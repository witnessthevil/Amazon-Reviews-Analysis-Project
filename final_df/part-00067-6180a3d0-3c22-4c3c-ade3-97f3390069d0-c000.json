This time, our Prince is hunted by Dahaka, an immortal incarnation of Fate. The spirit seeks retirbution against the Prince, but he is wiser and deadlier than he was. To avoid his preordained death, he'll travel to the infernal core of mankind's worst fears.","reviewerName":"OmnilimbO","summary":"A Twist of Fate","reviewText":"Warrior Within is the second game in the current generation series of three Prince of Persia games (to date) released by Ubi.The story resumes a few years after the conclusion of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.  The Prince is now war hardened from the past years in battle.  He now has a menacing style and persona when compared to his previously unthreatening appearance and innocent soul.  Returning to his home of Babylon, the prince finds that he is being hunted down by a supernatural beast that is intent on destroying him at all costs.  What it all really boils down to is that the prince created a rift in the space-time continuum as a result of his foolish actions in the previous game. Now Death is intent on hunting down the Prince. He must find a way to alter his fate before impending doom catches up to him.To get right to the point - the game is another stunner!  Every aspect of the game has been redesigned and tweaked to create an experience that rivals the previous title.  The game play mechanics are extremely fluid and intuitive and the fighting system is much more complex than that found in Sands of Time but just as easy to use.  The game is graphically gorgeous once again as it seems Ubi always pushes the visual envelope to the very edge.  Everything about the game is fantastic with the exception of one thing, the music.  In their efforts to make the Prince of Persia series more dark and burly, Ubi errantly opted to implement some not so fantastic heavy rock music into the game.  That is quite likely just my opinion and is really not a major issue, but one to be aware of if you are expecting more of the same from the last game.  All things considered, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within is another superb title that every action fan should own.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2006"}

From the first round all the way to the 4th or 5th we were having a blast competing over stars and trying to mess each other up.I haven't played a mario party game since the N64 games so you'll have to take that into account, but I know for a fact that this is a ton of fun with a group of 4 people.  The best part is is that the mini games are fun but easy to learn so anyone can play and have a blast.The only gripes I have are that without someone else to play with the game is a bit dull.  Don't buy this if you're just planning on playing alone.  Also, the game relies a bit too much on chance.  I don't mind it too much, but when you are tearing it up in the mini games and you still lose because of landing on random events that take away half of your stars you feel a bit cheated.  As long as you're not taking it too seriously you'll still have a blast playing with friends and family.The game looks great.  How a mario game should look.  You'll here a lot of the familiar tunes and character noises as well(for good and bad depending on who you are), and there's a lot of variety to the mini games.  Not all of them are great, but there's enough to enjoy.If you are looking for a game to play with others then definitely give Mario Party 9 a shot.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2012"}

Super Mario 64 DS just about took that same exact idea and just improve on it by making the amount of stars in this game from 120 to 150, including a splash of some fun minigames, pretty solid multiplayer, and the playable characters Yoshi, Luigi, and Wario. This version is better than the Nintendo 64 version in almost every way. Why? It improved on the already fantastic original game.Graphics: 5/5. The DS's graphical capabilities are nothing compared to the PSP as we all know, but this game delivers the whole Nintendo 64 version of the game on one cartridge, and more. The graphics are a bit sharper and less blocky, but you can see some graphical blurs here and there. Does it matter? No it doesn't, since this game features all levels imaginable from sandy deserts to a cave with a lake to platforms floating on lava. The graphics are extremely sharp and pretty to look at.Sound: 5/5. The sound in this game is the best I've heard from any handheld: period. It is okay when listening without headphones, but with headphones; the sound is awesome. It's surround sound right into your ears. From Mario's \"Woo-Hoos\" to the sound of collecting a coin, Bowser's laugh, the music... everything sounds spectacular with headphones on.Control: 4/5. The control is fine, but it definitely has some frustrating problems. Occasionaly when time counts to get a star, it can definitely be hard to get where you want to go. Since the camera angles are a little awkward, when in a strange position between 2 or 3 walls and you're trying to jump on a platform, you have to predict. Many times you can't see, but you can normally make it. All other controls in this game are great; it's just the camera angles that prevent this score from going any higher.Fun: 4.5/5. This game has everything Mario fans want in an on-the-go adventure game and more; great graphics, fantastic sound, over 20 great minigames,4 player multiplayer on one cartridge, 4 different playable characters with different abilities, and a not-too-easy-not-too-hard story. If you are craving some on-the-go Mario adventure, this is the only one out there. Why would you need any other adventure game anyways if you have a game like this? This is a must-buy for any DS owner.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2005"}
{"product_name":"B001IK1BJ0","reviewerName":"Mike","summary":"Awesome Game, graphics are just fine","reviewText":"I love this game. People have been talking about the graphics because they are not the graphics of the decade but the truth is there is absolutely nothing wrong with them. The game looks and plays great.There are plenty of quests, with enough combat to break things up so it doesn't seem like you're spending all your time in dialogue. The talking scenes and choices you make are witty, and effect the game play depending on what you say.I like the different professions and although there are only three classes, there are a lot of different spells so I don't feel like it's short on class play. Personally I enjoy playing a mage in the game because it feels like most of the characters you meet are capable of being tanks or doing melee damage, especially if your game comes with the code to download the golemn.I chose the 360 version because of the controller and achievement system, also I read that it runs a little smoother on the 360 which is more important to me, I can't stand low frame rates. However I haven't played the ps3 version so I can't say if you would even notice. I would have preferred the PC version but I'm long over due for an upgrade on hardware. My one complaint for the console version is that it is just a little inconvenient to access spells, though the bonus is I get to kick back on my couch in front of a 52\" plasma.Some people just aren't into RPGs so I wouldn't recommend this for everyone because it's something that you need to allow yourself to be pulled into, but I will say that there is plenty of replay value here and the combat does not get old.If you have any interest in this game I would definitely say go ahead and buy it, it is a keeper along side other RPGs like oblivion, fallout 3, mass effect, and the KOTOR series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2009"}

Ave Maria at the beginning and throughout makes a wonderful contrast to bloody evil deeds that Agent 47 carries out.  Jesper Kyd is an excellent composer and his music fits perfectly with the game.The controls are tight.  The camera system works very well.  Weapon upgrades are an excellent touch.  Hitman has a great linear story.  Since when did linear become such a bad thing?  My only complaint is the lack of variety in character models.  There's an athletic character and fat character for both male and female.  Between these 4 body types there seems to be only 1 face for each body type.

If they hadn't bundled the Kinnect, the Xbox One would have stood a better change competing with the PS4. In my opinion all human augmentation devices like Kinnect, Move etc are just gimmicks that work only 70% of the time but look great on paper and commercials.That's the reason I went straight for the PS4 and waited months later before taking the plunge on the Xbox One, because to me, the Kinnect was a useless unnecessary investment not worth the extra $100, privacy concerns set aside...Having waited this long I can say the console looks promising. First impression was better and won the Xbox One some points in contrast to my first PS4 unit which arrived with a blue light right out of the box. Feel free to look at my past reviews and my prior verified Amazon review to see that I'm not a fan boy like most of the trolls here who live with their mom and dads and can't afford the luxury of enjoying both consoles.Physically the console is gigantic when put side by side with the PS4 but unlike the PS4 it has more internal space to breathe and thus is less noisier (those who have played Killzone on the PS4 know what I'm talking about). If you're about aesthetics you may like the PS4 a lot better.The controller feels a bit better than the PS4's which is a drain on the battery due to the always on LED indicator. Additionally, the triggers have force feedback which makes the experience a lot more enjoyable when playing racing games such as Forza 5.In the visuals department I have to say both PS4 and Xbox One perform great. Forza 5 and Ryse look very good but nothing earth shattering.I have experienced some lag when playing Forza 5 which I found very disappointing for a next gen console, but the PS4 has had its hick-ups too like game crashes when playing Killzone (later fixed with a software update)IMO, Killzone is the crown jewel of the PS4 and shows how much more powerful the PS4 hardware is compared to Microsoft's. I have yet to see an Xbox One game that looks this good. I only care about exclusives here, since that's the sole reason I buy consoles, otherwise I stick to my GTX 780 gaming PC for playing games.Start-up times are also a lot longer on the Xbox One compared to the PS4 but Microsoft is being sneaky about it by never shutting the console down after the first boot. Instead, the console is put it into sleep mode. This is given away by the light on the power brick that never turns off. This behavior can be changed from the Settings menu though, and once changed, cold boots will increase ten-fold.In the gaming department I believe neither the PS4 or the Xbox offer a lot when it comes to exclusives, but I believe the PS4 has the upper hand with Killzone, Infamous, Infamous, Knack, Resogun. Sure, Forza 5 looks good, and so does Ryse but that's about it. Tinfall is not really an exclusive being available on the PC also, and the rest of the yet to be released exclusives are months away from being released.I'm not going to review all the media-hub capabilities because I have not used them nor I intend to. The main reason I buy consoles is strictly to play games the old fashioned way, with my two hands and ten fingers.Verdict is get both consoles, the power lies with both.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2014"}

It is way too much money for a game that gives you Halo 3's multiplayer on one disc (with three extra maps, nonetheless), and a short campaign that can be completed in 6-7 hours (on another disc). But for the price tag that it has right now (somewhere from 20-30 bucks), it really is a steal.

After playing through Halo Reach first, followed by Halo 3. I felt there was significant progress made between Halo 3 and Reach. Halo 3 took forever to load if the cache was cleared by playing another game in the Xbox prior to playing Halo 3 (for each session!). That meant waiting 3-5 minutes if I decided to play something before playing Halo 3.Halo 3 had quite a different feel from ODST and Reach, which is why it seemed odd to me why ODST was called Halo 3: ODST. In my opinion, ODST stands by itself with a different storyline and different characters that have somewhat of a tie in with Halo 3 and Halo Reach (Gunnery Sgt Buck for instance).I won't make it a surprise that I feel Halo Reach and Halo 3 ODST are the best Halo games in the entire franchise  - realizing that Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary Edition was just released, I have not played it and cannot comment on it. But Halo 1, Halo 2, and Halo 3 didn't feel as fun as ODST and Reach.ODST has some fun achievements similar to those in Reach, and the graphics are about on-par. I loved the VISR feature in ODST because it helps with dark areas, similar to the night vision option in Reach. The new suppressed submachine gun is kind of cool, but just like the other Halo games, I'd find myself constantly switching to enemy weapons because I'd run out of ammo and needed something in a pinch, or because I wanted to ditch that dinky sidearm for a fuel rod cannon or beam weapon.ODST has a very short campaign compared to Halo 3 and Halo Reach. Most of the rookie's missions through the streets of Mombasa are dark as in lack of light, but the VISR is a nice touch as it highlights important items. The available vehicles are the typical Halo fare, and you get to take down 1 Scarab in ODST towards the end.The voice acting is great. I immediately recognized the voice actors for Buck (Nathan Fillion) and Dutch (Adam Baldwin), but I had to look up the voices for Dare (Tricia Helfer) and Mickey (Alan Tudyk). Fans of Firefly/Serenity will be in for a treat for sure.I wouldn't recommend paying too much for ODST, as it is a very short campaign. But some of the achievements allow you to get neat Avatar awards via Halo Waypoint, and ODST can be purchased for peanuts (in terms of Xbox game prices) these days.Overall: 4/5 stars, very short campaign, should be inexpensive now, good voice acting, similar in feel to Reach which, IMHO, is better than Halo 1-3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2011"}

This game will have you looking around every corner and exploring every area carefully, witch in my opinion makes for a more realistic experience. This is basically your Call Of Duty Halo with a little more realism and defiantly a little more challenging then previous Halo titles. Well worth owning, exploring and enjoying for all true Halo fans, Bungie made this to be similar to other Halo titles while giving us a new game and new characters to enjoy, that is the best way to sum this game up.

Over the years, they've gotten progressively better, culminating in Double Agent, which I truly thought would be the absolute best entry in the series.  Then came Conviction.  Conviction is not necessarily better than Double Agent, rather it's different.  Double Agent gave you the feeling that you were, well, a secret double agent.  Conviction has more of a Bourne Identity feel to it.  It has more of an emphasis on hand to hand combat and rewards you with instant kills or \"executions\" when you take someone out at close range.  This also in emphasized while interrogating enemies.  Sam Fisher basically beats the crap out them until they talk...and it's very fun!  Stealth is still the name of the game and there are a couple of missions that are instantly lost if you are spotted.  So, this game doesn't completely veer from what Splinter Cell is about.  The bottom line is that it's a fun game to play.  Sam Fisher makes you feel like a bad ass and you'll have a great time showing your enemies that you are just that.  Oh, and did I mention that the story line is great?  The story line is great.PROS- Great graphics- Great voice acting- Great sound- Great controls- Balanced difficulty- Good replay value (just based on how much fun the game is!)CONS- Enemies - particularly those who are aware of your presence and are actively searching for you - tend to repeat themselves over and over again, which gets a little annoying.  \"I know you're here somewhere, Fisher!  Are you too scared to face me??\" gets old after the doucher asks it 10 times.I highly recommend this game to both Splinter Cell fans and to gamers that have never played a game in the series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2012"}

Well, six years later, my opinion has not changed. Final Fantasy VI has been re-released, keeping intact the entire game as it was back then, with Final Fantasy V as a special bonus.People introduced to the FF series at part VII might not be able to get past the graphics, which were fine for them time but lousy by today's standards. But for the less cynical player, this is the holy grail of RPGs. This is proof that less is more, and the music in these games rivals anything that came later in the series. Having said that, the later installments in the series are great, but it is important not to forget where it all started.Final Fantasy V is a great game, it's big disadvantage being that it is packaged alongside part VI, so gamers will inevitably compare it to FFVI. It is a typical FF game, meaning that you are assured a great game at the least. The &quot;job skills&quot; add a nice twist, and the story, albeit linear, can hold it's own with the best of the RPGs.Final Fantasy VI, as you have read in countless reviews, is probably the most engaging and emotionally involved game in the series. The characters all have likeable personalities, and their individual stories are very enrossing. As the game progresses, the player becomes more involved in their lives. The story is the game's strongest point, while the music is a milestone for any video game. Anybody who dismisses it as &quot;just a game&quot; should takea closer look. Completing this game will become your life.The really good Squaresoft games have an anoying habit of falling out of print quickly, making this game in particular hard to find, let alone at a reasonable price. Anyone who still shops around for SNES games knows this, as well do the people who have tried to find the FF Anthology at their game shop, only to be met with &quot;Sorry, it's no longer available&quot;. This is really sad because there are many people who will not get to experience these games, and will go on thinking that the FF series never got better than  part VII or IX.

However, there are still a good number of games or special releases that have never been available beyond the Saturn.Because of poor console sales outside of Japan, the Saturn library was scant for North American and European markets. With console sales more than four times that of America and Europe, the Japanese Saturn library is more than double. Using the Action Replay Plus version 2.02, the vast Japanese Saturn library is available to western gamers. If you are a fan of classic 2D fighting games and platformers, scrolling shooters, and RPGs, the Saturn is the way to go with these genres. I also love the Saturn controller (the North American model 2; same as Japanese model 1)- it's so much better for these types of games over the PS controller. It may seem like a lightweight on first impression, but it is very responsive, accurate and durable. It's my favorite all-time controller for 2D gaming.Some recommended games:*Dungeons and Dragons Collection- One of my all-time favorite side-scrolling brawlers.*X-Men vs Street Fighter & Marvel Super Heroes- Top notch tag team fighter with beautiful art and animation.*Fighters Megamix- This game is like a mash-up of Sega's different game franchises.

In addition to Virtua Fighter and Fighting Viper characters, you can also fight as a polar bear, Janet from Virtua Cop, little kids, a pinto bean with arms and legs, and a car.*Die Hard Arcade- your standard side-scrolling brawler. Decent fun.*Guardian Heroes- A very entertaining side-scrolling, hack n' slash brawler with RPG elements.*Bulk Slash- Despite the major pop-in and relatively slow flight speed, this is an awesome 3D, free-roaming shooter.*Akumajou Dracula X: Gekka no Yasoukyoku- This Saturn port of \"Symphony of the Night\" has Richter, Alucard, and Maria as playable characters from the beginning. Even if you've already played the PS1 version, the Saturn version is well worth your time with an addition 4 areas, 18 enemies (16 regular and 2 bosses), and several other weapons and bonus items.*Nights into Dreams/ Christmas Nights- A fun flying on-rails game. You'll need the 3D Saturn controller.*Panzer Dragoon Eins & Zwei- Simply a great on-rails shoot-em-up series.*Panzer Dragoon Saga (Azel)- PDS/ Azel is actually an RPG style entry with free-roam style gameplay.

Back when I first heard that I wasn't too happy since Kotor is one of my favorite games ever. However this game stands up right with that classic and is unique in its own way. Jade Empire dives into territory that is not often explored especially in western gaming. That being mythical China of course. The world is amazingly unique and immersive. The characters, the story, the side quests, all are very good. The combat, while repetitive is pretty fluid for its time. Seems like everyone forgets about this game but it's actually one of their best and it's a shame that Bioware isn't the kind of company they once were. A sequel almost seems pointless in this present time but at least we always have this gem to go back to.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00030GS80","description":"There's always been a certain magic to Zelda games. The classic formula should have gotten old by now, but it hasn't. Perhaps it's because we all identify on some level with this shy, unlikely hero. Maybe the games remind us of our own childhood. Or perhaps these titles are consistently of such high quality that we can't help but love them. Regardless, The Minish Cap succeeds in all these ways &#x96; simultaneously embracing its links to the past while offering numerous innovations that keep gameplay fresh, exciting, and a true joy to&#xA0;play.The greatest of these novel concepts is the ability to transform from normal size down to the diminutive form of the Minish, a race of tiny people living right under the noses of the humans. This opens up entirely new realms of gameplay, as puzzles and even combat must be accomplished in different ways. When miniaturized, the smallest puddle becomes a deep lake, and the most mundane creatures become monstrous foes.There's a new item called the Gust Jar that allows you to suck up obstacles and enemies before blowing them back out in a burst of air. It's one of the cooler new power-up items I've encountered in any of the Zelda games, and adds yet another level of complexity to how you play. Another new ability allows Link to double himself, creating a ghostly after-image that mirrors his moves for a brief time. As you might imagine, this results in some clever and unique brainteasers that are a nod to the recent Four Swords games. In all these ways, the game challenges you to think in multiple dimensions and carefully remember details on your journey. A large cast of characters fleshes out the land of Hyrule, and monsters both large and small await your blade. To further connect you to the world's people, you will now collect items called Kinstones &#x96; broken halves of coin-like objects that can be fused with the Kinstones that other characters in the world have collected. By doing so, you'll open up portals, treasure chests, and secret doors all over the map. It's an addictive side quest that serves as a worthy compliment to the main adventure.One of my few complaints is that while the puzzles in the game are uniformly challenging, some of the combat is easier than I might have liked, especially against the bosses, who were often one-trick ponies requiring minimal skill. Even so, the fights are satisfying in their simplicity, and you have access to all the familiar weapons and techniques, including the boomerang, spin attack, and bow. The old and new features combine to make a game that feels both true to the Zelda heritage while offering an entirely unique experience.But more than any of this, the game charms you with its stalwart hero. This silent little boy with ruffled, messy hair is faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. Through him, the game establishes a hero whose pure heart and will are carrying him forward. All the elements of The Minish Cap (even its presence on the GBA) contribute to the idea of a tiny force for good that strives to triumph against a huge evil. It's a classic adventure that more than lives up to the legacy of a classic series.Concept:The time-honored Zelda tale retold in yet another new formGraphics:Mixing the familiar images of previous Zelda games with humorous and detailed new character designs results in an impressive success for the GBASound:Some of the most memorable and recognizable tunes in gaming sound great even on those little GBA speakersPlayability:Responsive and flexible with a nearly perfect learning curve that moves from simple to challengingEntertainment:Like many of its predecessors &#x96; a true classicReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerIssue:February 20052nd Opinion:There's a bird sitting on my head, I'm no larger than a toenail clipping, and I've been stuck on the same puzzle for the last three hours. Long story short, I'm having the time of my life. For any of you who played the remarkable Super Nintendo title A Link to the Past, The Minish Cap will bring a tear to your eye. This is classic Zelda gameplay in all its glory. The journey is a tad easy for my liking (boss fights are a breeze), but I can't get enough of the creative puzzles and new gadgets. Shrinking in height to a two-pixel speck is not only hilarious, it's one of the most compelling concepts that the series has offered up in a long time. Minigames are also in great abundance, and you can collect over 130 different figurines that shed some light on the characters in the world (which also happens to be one of my favorite aspects of Wind Waker). From its stunning visuals to its gameplay finesse, The Minish Cap is another harrowing Hyrule adventure that you'll remember for a lifetime.Rated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer","reviewerName":"Madisen","summary":"One of the best games of the year","reviewText":"Heck, it might even be THE best game. Maybe all the people who say it's too hard should go back to pressing the A button (or the X button, or whatever) over and over in Halo and GTA and all those other stupid games. The graphics, puzzles, and the whole game \"world\" (which includes familiar areas like Hyrule Town and Lon Lon Ranch, plus plenty of new areas like the Castor Wilds) all simply rock. Plus, the introduction of shrinking as a new feature is awesome. Chalk up yet another point for Nintendo on the \"console-maker wars\" scorecard.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2005"}

As SD was one of the longest running Wrestling game series I kina had doublt on this.  This game is awesome.  It is not as good as Shut Your Mouth but still great.  The game is a bit lacking as the other reviewer said but still holds on it's own.  No voice overs sadly, This game still is good but nothing new except bra and panties which I could care less and the new Elimination Chamber match.  But nothing has really changed except new graphics engine but I acctually found Shut your Mouth to have a better graphics engine I donno why.  The game is slower then Shut your mouth I acctually found Shut your Mouth to be more fast pace.  The story mode in this one is so great it puts some other Wrestling games to shame but I found No mercy to have a better line of stories.  In this one they acctually added BLOOD! But that's pretty much it with some new wrestlers such as Bill Goldberg.  Nothing really new.The graphics in this game are good but not as good as Smackdown, I found Brock Lesnar to be more realistic in Shut your mouth then Here comes the pain but still this game succeds in alot of places.  I can't really talk about the graphics that much since it's pretty much just the characters but the Rock looks terrific in this game!  Goldberg was poorly made in this one.  But no worries this is still a great game.The gameplay is what really made me upset.  It go's a little slow if you ask me I thought Shut your Mouth was wayyy more fun and fast paste.  And The there wern't that many choices of moves And I tried many too.  The game could have bin better.THE SOUND!!!  WHAT HAPPEND TO THE RING ANNOUNCERS!!!!  Wait I haven't played this game in awhile But I am sure it was this SD game that didn't have the Ring announcers.  That really sucks though!  It taKEs away the fun and feel of this game.  I don't remember mainly cause I got this game when it first came out back in October of 2003..I think..  The sound was average I guess nothing new lIKe I said before.Over all it really is one of the best WWE games out but It was ruined by slower paced Gameplay.  They were soooo much better in Shut your Mouth.  But the story mode is the strong point of this game and it sticks to it's word I mainly liked this game for it's story mode.  It was waaay better then SYM's story mode which was taken off of acctual past WWE events.When it all comes down to this Graphics, gameplay, sound ect WWE contender I pretty much have to say it's worth the purchase..or rent and that is why I give it a4.4 out of 5 stars...Great game get itLates","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2004"}

For example, the fighter jets can only attack other air units, but they do so almost unconditionally effectively.  The player must worry about fuel consumption for each unit, many consume different amounts, like air units use 5 per day, terrain effects in addition to unit-attack compatability, CO powers, which can unfairly turn the battle in your opponents favor, and base capture, which is usually the main goal of campaigns.This only scratches the surface of this game's depth.  Included is a very lengthy campaign, numerous individual maps that begin you with no units and require speed, efficiency, and power to take the enemy's main base, and a 3-hour tutorial on the game's basics.Recommended to all who have a craving for intense, turn-based strategy on the almost-already-venerable Gameboy Advance.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2002"}

I grew up playing this franchise and really really love it.Lets talk about the characters. So far I have two builds a monk and a witch doctor. Completed the normal modes and have been dipping my toes into the online. The characters are all rather unique except for the barbarian which I find is just a typical murder tank not much excitement there. The witch doctor is cool summon some dudes than stand back and blow them apart with magic. The monk was harder for me didn't really like her until the end the second act then she really started to come into her own.The story line is kinda bonk. They totally scrap the first game and how that all went down. I didn't find myself caring about the main  characters I ended caring most about two of the warriors you recruit the scoundrel and the Templar and covetous Shen who really deserves his own DLC.The cut scenes are beautiful there is one where you see this detail of Leah's hand and I was really impressed by that. Diablo on the other hand looks wrong almost feminine I was hoping for an old school HD version but hey. The end seemed rushed the Belial boss battle was awful and its a tad on the easy side even with playing the second time through the hard style of normal mode.The cool thing is on the second play through the characters share that chest thing so you can leave your weaker player goodies. But you also get access to all your gold so you can really mod your new build out with the best which is nice.It wasn't bad it just didn't have the same wonder that 2 had.

What a fantastic product!  What an awesome idea.I have been a musician now for over 20 years.  I have played many instruments, as well as been a vocal performer.  I am a member of a National, Professional Music Fraternity.  I know music.Rock Band will NOT make you a musician.  Getting good scores in Rock Band does not mean that you can be the next one-hit wonder.  BUT, you'll sure have a lot of fun playing it anyways!!Gripes:  I'll hit these first and get it out of the way.  I made a helluva mess getting this game set up the first time...  Boxes everywhere, tape everywhere, bags and twist-ties and little instruction books as far as the eye could see.  However, once you get the hang of it and clean up, it's really not bad.  Yes the guitar and drums could be a little less flimsy, but it's plastic, and the whole thing is what, $160 or so?  So what do you expect?  Yes the pads on the drum set make some noise when striking them - I've already been shopping for sound-absorber pads.  But seeing how no other game has this option, can you really complain or compare it to anything?  Sure they could feel more like MIDI drum pads - if you want to pay $400 for the drum set alone...  Lastly, when I play the guitar (or bass) sections, I can really hear my instrument above \"the band,\" but not so when I play drums.  I've adjusted settings, but it seems like I can barely hear the drums from my TV over the actual drum set in front of me.  The game amplifies the guitars very well, but does not seem to amplify the drums.  No idea why.Praise:  This game is just FUN.  It's FUN!!  You load it up, create your character, and next thing you know, you're tapping your feet, banging your head, leaning into the instruments - you really get into it.  I have already severely beaten the tar out of the guitar and drum units - no malfunctions (yet) to speak of.  I've only used the mic once, but I got 97% accuracy on Boston's \"More Than A Feeling\" (Downloaded add-on,) so I have to presume that it works - and is quite generous too.  Did I mention this game is fun??  The range of difficulty options means that just about anybody can get through the songs and enjoy themselves.  My wife can barely play the radio, but we've already unlocked a number of the Xbox Achievements with her playing the drums - the Drums!!  I myself have used the drum kit and been challenging myself to play the harder difficulties because I have always wanted to learn how to play a trap set.  Within just a few days I realized that I had established an independence from my foot (bass pedal) and my arms.  I could never do that before.Rock Band gives us all an avenue to do something few of us can ever do but most of us have dreamed of.  The sheer concept of booting up your video console and rocking out in front of millions of \"fans\" is just awesome.  Yes I too agree that they shouldn't have placed so much emphasis on multiplayer modes - especially for those of us whose friends are doing things like buying houses or having children...  Still, it is called \"Rock Band\" and not \"One-Man Band.\"Rock Band is for all ages (thanks to some unfortunate but understandable lyric censoring,) and as I clearly stated, is a helluva lotta fun.  So power up, strap in, and ROCK ON!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2008"}

It feels like someone inherited the engine and title and said, \"Who wants all of this options and interactions!?\". BAH! Add a random variable to an equation, and it changes the entire formula.I spent a little more time on this title and felt compelled to improve my review...The graphics aren't very bad. Not incredible, but they work. The controls are watered down, the sound is OK. All in all, I did not need to play this game. The DLC didn't add much to content. I really believe the developer missed the ball on this one, and could have provided improvements without loosing the content the previous game provided to the player.Being able to purchase property is a good idea, but the management of it is INCREDIBLY tedious! Having to enter EVERY map, and manually repair EVERY house, EVERY four or so hours is EVERY - err, VERY annoying! Designers, where is that \"fix all for $$ button\"!? My god! It takes about an hour once you get all the properties to simply repair them! And it's necessary to getting the \"good\" ending.During combat, the context sensitive controls broke (well, I think I fat fingered the directional/digital pad by accident, I'm not sure! It's context sensitive! And \"kill everyone, regardless of good or bad\" is right next to the other buttons, but doesn't show up but a tenth of the time) - any how, what I am trying to say is that I am sorry to the family of military unit 107, 1oth brigade for murdering your husband in one swipe. It was an unavoidable mistake, due to the size of my thumbs, and I wish I could take it back. Mostly, as my people revel in the sight of me, cheer with adulation my name, my achievements, saving their world, and wining their hearts, of then randomly screaming \"MURDERER!\" You know it's bad when your wife greets you with \"Oh, your highness! MURDERER!\" All kidding a side, seriously? They make everyone including your wife randomly praise you, and condemn you for one murder? Just weird. Just, weird.The game feels like the developer thought the players were tired of playing the first game, so they removed control and game play, and left you with story; an OK story, but not compelling. Friends have been much more harsh about this game than I am, so I don't feel I am doing an injustice in conveying the quality of this game.I hope this review adds something to help the possible buyer make the right choice for them.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0001KUE7S","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. If your PC has the juice to set this game loose and you have a thirst for first-person shooter action, you're in for a treat. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have.Hell on MarsYour character is a low-ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the Mars Research Facility of the United Aerospace Corporation (UAC). That's pretty much all the backstory you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the storyline department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of the Doom franchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?), it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well-crafted sound effects succeeded at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth... ethereal Revenants fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy... a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll often find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might easily be solved by duct-taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.Looking GoodDoom 3looks incredible. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. The eye candy does come at a price, though, and we were forced to play at fairly low resolution even on a Pentium IV 2.8 GHz and an ATI Radeon 9500. Even so, gameplay was smooth as silk. For higher resolutions (1024 x 768 and above) the latest generation of ATI or Nvidia cards is suggested.--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessRich variety of enemiesPlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineStiff system requirementsNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multiplayer options","reviewerName":"Winston Fraser \"Arcade Bee\"","summary":"it's alittle spooky but somehow it's not what i expected.","reviewText":"First of all why is it so dark? i have to switch from flahlight to a weapon and then switch back whats up with that? i enjoy this game even if there was alot of draw back, but i must admitt that it's creepy at times, i expected more and i felt that the graphic was good the environment was realistic, the audio good, but the technology hmmmmmmm gun without light ect............i think that the shot gun was almost useless compared to the original doom, well lets not be too critical, all in all i wanted more and expected more,this definitely a good game it may not have much replay value but it's worth the ride well later folks","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2006"}

{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"aka TRAP","summary":"Please stop going backwards.......","reviewText":"Uncharted 2 proved to have the best single-player campaign I have ever enjoyed this generation.  It was an amazing change of pace from the constant flood of \"wannabe manly action movie\" campaigns we've seen over and over and over AND OVER again from the FPS genre.  It had an amazing cast of characters that actually felt like CHARACTERS and not just random AI saying words, it featured a story that has yet to be surpassed by any FPS or third-person shooter on the market today, and was an overall masterpiece............EXCEPT for the multiplayer.  Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the game.A year after I stopped playing Uncharted 2, I was fortunate enough to pick up a used copy of Uncharted 3 at a local store.  Knowing how much I enjoyed the story of the second one, I expected nothing but an experience that could only top its predecessor.I'm glad I didn't pay $60 for this title.To start, Uncharted 3's single-player campaign, while still better than a vast majority of what you'll find in your typical shooter (easily), was a huge disappointment compared to the predecessor.  The characters this time seem to lack the same emotion they did in the second game.  It's there, but this time I couldn't care less about how they feel with their current situations.  It's almost like the game is saying \"Yup....here they are.  He's the same...she's also the same....he's also the same....yup.  Same ol' same ol'\".  It's not necessarily a bad thing, but I feel like it could have been done better.  Another thing I didn't like was they changed the way Elena and Chloe look.  I still don't understand their logic behind changing the way they looked, but there's a lot of things Naughty Dog did that I don't understand.Despite the above, the campaign still had the potential to be as amazing as it was in the second one.  Only, it wasn't.  For one, the writing was not as good as the predecessor.  There were a lot of clever one-liners, but I don't feel they're as clever or as funny.  On top of that, the writing seems like it's \"just good enough\".  Only good enough to be considered very-well done compared to the competition.  Another thing I can't stand is that the game is overall easier than Uncharted 2.  Uncharted 2 took me 13 hours on Hard and 10 hours on Crushing.  Uncharted 3 took me roughly 6 to 7 hours on both Hard and Crushing, and that is only because the A.I. likes to spawn behind you when you least expect it, resulting in you dying and having to restart a checkpoint.  It would be different if the A.I. actually flanked you, but Naughty Dog doesn't exactly understand the difference between flanking and spawning behind someone.  It also features a few sections where you have to fight brutes, which are nothing but short sessions of mashing Square and occasionally pressing Triangle to avoid attacks.  Then there's a scene that lasts a good 20 minutes where Drake is walking aimlessly through the desert.  It was a good idea at the beginning, but it feels like they only used it as a place-holder because they ran out of ideas.  Holding Up on the analog stick for 20 minutes isn't exactly my idea of fun.  To make it even better, the final boss fight is the exact same thing you've seen in other parts of the game; a mash-fest against a \"brute\" and pressing Triangle to avoid attacks.  Naughty Dog appears to have run out of creative juice since a lot of the things you see in the campaign are either reused from the earlier parts, were done to be \"just good enough\", or were reused from the predecessor.  If you're expecting something 100% new and fresh, you may be disappointed.My dislike of Uncharted 3 wouldn't have been due to the campaign alone.  Again, I was disappointed, but it was still better than, say your typical CoD wannabe, or Battlefield 3 (then again that campaign's just training grounds), and even Gears of War.  But the multiplayer is something Naughty Dog hasn't been able to get right since the second game.For one, the recent patch included A LOT of DLC.  You would think that's a good thing because it would help extend the life of the game. Instead, the DLC is a bunch of character items and \"cheat codes\".  For example, to by elf ears for Drake is $.99, buying Elena's G-MAL, a gun that you can earn by collecting treasures in-game, costs the same amount.  You might say \"what's the big deal?  Don't buy them/get a job\".  That's not the point.  I don't like being nickel'd and dime'd by a company, nor do I like being charged for cheat codes.  Capcom attempted to do the same thing.  Look at their business rating now.  They've also implemented a Tournament mode.  You're given 10 tickets to gamble in Team Deathmatch, Three-Team Deathmatch, and Elimination.  The only way to receive any points is to win the game.  Once you're out of tickets, you're out......until you buy more tickets from the PSN store.  I don't know another tournament where you have to constantly pay money in order to participate.  That's like going to EVO and having to pay $5 every time you win a game to continue through your bracket.Another problem with Uncharted 3 is it appears they learned hardly anything from Uncharted 2's multiplayer.  Lag is even worse than before, ranging from certain game mechanics not working properly (I'm not supposed to suffer melee damage while rolling), to simply not being able to play the game at all.  Uncharted 3 features an \"anti-lag switch\".  If the game thinks you're lagging intentionally, a logo featuring an ethernet cable being unplugged will appear, and you won't be able to move for a certain time.  This is actually a wonderful feature...........on paper.  I can't count how many times I've played against foreigners, only to see that logo because the game thinks I'm lagging on purpose.  I don't understand why this game does not have dedicated servers, but it clearly needs them.  At the very least, I would like to play more Americans when I'm online.  To further explain, your connection partially depends on your ping.  Ping is how long - in milliseconds - it takes for you to send information to the server and to receive it.  The higher the ping, the more lag you will experience.  When you're playing against Americans, this usually isn't a problem so long as the other players have good connections.  But when you're playing against Brazilians, Egyptians, Spanish, and French people constantly, and are connecting to servers in their respective countries, your ping is going to be unbelievably high, resulting in a lot of lag whenever you play the game.  This was a problem in Uncharted 2, and it's only worse in Uncharted 3.  It's like they learned absolutely NOTHING from the two betas (yes, two) that they had before the game released.Uncharted 3's singleplayer is still better than what you'll find from the vast majority of other shooters.  But because it fails in regards to Uncharted 2, and the online that makes me think they learned nothing from the feedback, I can't give this game a good score.  I can't support a developer that not only learns nothing from their mistakes, but continues to make them, and has the nerve to try to nickel and dime me every chance they get.  I'm not going to pay for a silly little hat for a character, I'm not going to pay to unlock items I can barely earn in the game because of your broken treasure system, and I won't be picking up another Uncharted game.EDIT:  I'm completely disgusted with Naughty Dog's tactics of charging for cheat codes instead of fixing their broken multiplayer.  It's almost like they're becoming the American Capcom.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2012"}

Gann \"Video game junkie\"","summary":"Remember Noble. Remember Reach.","reviewText":"Halo Reach is the prequel to the entire series where you play as a Lieutenant code named 'Noble Six'. It is also the most recently released entry and it shows wonderfully. This, as of right NOW (see the date above; Halo 4 not out yet) is my absolute favorite Halo game. I'll try to explain my reasons in 4 parts: Graphics, Gameplay, Characters, and Story.Graphics: This is easily the best looking Halo in my small opinion. The environments just pop off the screen, as you go over hills in the beginning, bypass mountains in between missions, and jump from building to building in the New Alexandria mission. The one thing I especially love most of all is surprisingly, the weapons. The Assault Rilfe's HUD (and the HUD in general) and look are really polished, and each weapon has great detail to it. I personally love the Energy Sword, but I really dont see that much difference between Reach and Halo 3. Overall, the game is just stunning to look at. (5/5)Gameplay: OK, there is ZERO difference between how you can play the game and every other Halo. (Other than the fact that there is NO FLOOD which is my number one reason why I love this entry the most. I HATE the Flood and the fact that 4-player Co-op is here) This includes FireFight like Halo 3 and ODST so you Halo 3 buffs know that this is a major plus. I don't write about multiplayer because of two reasons; 1.) I'm awful at it, but it is the single greatest multiplayer out there. (Including Call of Duty and Battlefield) with the variety of modes and maps; and 2.) I consider myself a single campaign player so I like that type of game better but PLEASE DO NOT allow that to make you feel I'm being biased (reference reason 1.) The final thing that is left is Forge. Again, you Halo 3 buffs know what I'm talking about, a Halo 3 original, this mode is actually better here due to it having its own dedicated world cleverly titled (not) 'Forge World' and other maps and its easier building menu system. (5/5)Characters: Each character is well designed, voiced, and each personality is nicely made. The cutscenes show just how awesome the graphics are but I wanted to have this part under Characters because their armor, faces, and movements are very well programmed. (I love Carter's armor and Jorge's voice, however everyone else in Noble gets on my nerves) These characters provide great additions in the Halo universe and each one is relatable in some way. (5/5)Story: Without a doubt, this is the most compelling game in the Halo saga. I was moved after each mission starting about halfway through. If you haven't played this game, I will not provide spoilers but you have no heart if you don't feel. Every mission is filled with more and more importance to the entire Halo mantra as you go along. By the end of the very last mission, you know how Halo 1 starts, and it gave me a sense of wonder. Bungie bowed out of Halo with grace to 343 Industries and they left their last mark on the game that made them the powerhouse that they are and made me replay Halo. (5/5)Pros:+ Story is unmatched in all of the Halo games.+ (Personal) No Flood+ Visuals are nothing short of stunning.+ Best multiplayer a game could have.+ 4-player Co-op possibleCon:- Only one tiny thing that I guess only quirks me and me alone, is that Forge has a limited amount of money you can use. If you play with a lot of people in Forge, it will go quicklyIn summary, as I stated, this is my absolute favorite Halo with the best graphics, story, and environments (Not characters because if anyone values these characters over Master Chief, the Arbiter, Sgt. Johnson and Cortana, I apologize but you need a brain scan). If you consider yourself a gamer, you need to own this game. No arguments about it. (10/10)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2012"}

It really is nothing new, but something to really grasp on. That comes with the case of the original Nintendo games, and the original taste of the Mario Brothers. It has been a great feeling, time and time again. The duo of Mario &amp; Luigi, has been known as one of the most successful video games of all time. The original Super Mario Brothers made it into full stream 20 years ago in the arcades, and then it made it fully on the first supersystem, the Nintendo Entertainment System. Arguably, the games still ring out bells very well, as well as welcoming newcomers to the plumber light again, and again from the warp pipe.Super Mario Brothers, the 1985 video game returns to the Game Boy Advance. Only the second time this game returns to the system, the previous one was just for the earlier Game Boy Color system. The games graphics are really old school, and a little bland, compared to the later Mario Brothers games, but this cartridge was designed for it, as a way to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the NES.  The other downside is that many people may not want this one, because they might be hooked on the recent Super Mario 3. The game features the same 8 different worlds from the original Super Mario Brothers, without any hidden bonuses or surprises. As you play, you will encounter the same enemies, Bowser, goombas, and koopa troopas and a whole lot more than meets the eye. Still, I thought it would've been a better move to reissue it with the same graphics feel from the Super Mario All-Stars from 1993, but not what Nintendo created years earlier. All in all, the game still remains addictive as earlier eras in the video game world, and that is nothing to sneeze at.I honestly suggest this game, only if you haven't played the original one from the NES system, or the Super Mario Bros. Deluxe from the Game Boy Color. The game still proved that it launched a whole new way to play video games, and that so many games have been influenced on these plumbers' pipes, Mario and Luigi.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2004"}

Fear not however, because this game proves once and for all that it is very possible to beat a MGS game without the radar. The jungle setting is fantastic. I had my doubts at first (like you all probably did) but after waging jungle warfare, I don't want to return to the constricted metal corridors of the past. The camoflage and food system is great in conveying a \"survival\" theme, making you feel like you are really there, but is hardly ever overbearing, and it never takes away from the gameplay. The new cure system is used well also, making getting shot, cut or burnt a much larger deal than it was in past instalments. bullets now have to be removed and disinfected, and wounds wust be sewen up, meaning that you have to keep your medical supplies in check. The game offers a much more managable story this time round (nothing like MGS2), involvig a fair share of (genuinely suprising) twists and turns, but nothing to really push the game over the edge of being unbarable. The story is also much more emotionally envolved this time... for the first time in a metal gear game, I actually found myself caring about characters in the game. The game largely focuses on Snake (aka. Big Boss) coming to terms with himself, and understanding and all together choosing for him self what makes a good solider, and ultimatly a good man.  the only real complaint about this game that I have is that the camera can be slightly frustrating in some parts (you won't notice this too much once you become involved in the game) Like all Metal Gear games, this one feature production values that are over the top, with amazing graphics, and even better cut scenes, this is a MGS game for the record books. Overall, this game treads into new and dangerous territory, and develops a style that is very different from the past MG games. Simply put, if you are a fan, there is no way you could be dissapointed with this game. If you are a newbie, You won't be able to appreciate the game as much (even though it is a prequel, there are some parts you just won't understand without past knowledge), but will enjoy it all the same for a touching story, and fantastic gameplay. Don't take my word for it. go rent it and see for yourself.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2004"}

I won't say much more about that because I don't want to give anything away, and because there are already so many positive reviews of it out there, so I will focus on the negatives.First is the combat system. They abandoned the system used in the first Witcher and instead moved to a weak attack/strong attack type system, but the combat moves are not interruptable, there is no little white targeting dot so you only rely on health bars which pop up which often results in attacking or using the wrong thing. The difficulty of the start of the game is pretty high, not because the enemies are hard, it is because you will often engage multiple enemies at the same time which result in high damage taken, especially when attacked from behind. The story doesn't seem to grab me as much as the first Witcher game did.If they would have fixed the combat system then it would have easily have made the game twice as fun, but the well developed story keeps you moving along and makes it a pretty enjoyable game, though in my opinion not as fun and engrossing as its predecessor.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"Matthew Gardner \"monster_jester\"","summary":"PlayStation of the Future is a Beautiful, Sparse Place to Play","reviewText":"I basically got my PlayStation 4 out of brand loyalty. I love video games, and my 60 gig PS3 served me so well over the years, and PS2 before that, that I decided to for once be an early adopter. So far I love it. The design is sleek and compact, though I'm not sure if I love how camouflaged the power and eject buttons and disc slot are on the front--aesthetically nice, but not the most practical of choices. The power and eject buttons look like they should depress like regular buttons, but do not and are simply touch sensitive. The Dualshock 4 is comfortable and far superior to the previous model, with depressed joystick heads, improved trigger shapes, options and share buttons replacing start and select, and a clickable touchpad in the center as well as a speaker. The only odd choice for the controller is the light bar on the front which is meant to be read by the PS camera for some features, but which you cannot turn off, which undoubtedly drains the battery and can be distracting in a dark room if you're watching a movie. My favorite aspect so far is the speed; the system boots up, loads, and downloads lickety split, and you can start playing a game before it's even finished downloading. The system comes with a 30 day free trial of PlayStation Plus (50 bucks a year) which you need to play any games online; signing up gives you access to four free games to download, most of which are actually pretty great, a FPS, a TPS, an arcade style scrolling ship shooter, and a weird little girl's shadow pal game. Also included is a month free trial of their music streaming service (meh), and 10 free bucks for the PlayStation Store. My only physical game so far is Call of Duty: Ghosts, and while I know the critics are dissing it, I'm having a blast and find the speed and graphics phenomenal. Great speed, great controller, and a lot of potential lead me to give this latest iteration of the PlayStation a solid four-star recommendation... But here now are the things that almost make me wish I'd waited:1. PS4 does not play 3D blu rays. What?! The only reason I ever started buying 3D blu rays was because my old PS3 was able to play them. Not cool Sony, give us a software update for this please!2. Lack of titles. So the only other two titles that seem remotely interesting to me are Battlefield 4 and Killzone--two other first-person shooters. Back when I preordered the game I was really excited for was Watch Dogs, now pushed back til next year. The only other games I'm interested in playing, GTA5 and Batman Arkham Origins, are supposedly not going to be released for next generation. So I basically have a glorified four hundred dollar Call of Duty machine. I guess a lack of titles is common for any system on launch, and there's a good chance I'll get a version of those games eventually, at least as downloads, but geez.3. No component outputs. With my PS3 I could use HDMI for video out to the TV, and RCA component out to my analog stereo system and it sounded incredible. But PS4 outputs only in HDMI, so I'll need at least a new digital receiver, if not a whole new sound system, if I want better sound than just the TV speaker, which of course suck.Obviously none of these are deal breakers, but are enough to frustrate me to the point that I do kind of wish I'd waited. So if any of these issues is a red flag for you as well, it might be prudent to wait a while, for the bugs to get worked out and the game library to grow. But it really is a pretty great machine, and I look forward to the future of PlayStation gaming.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2013"}
{"product_name":"B002673XJA","reviewerName":"Paul Arellano \"Last Days on Earth\"","summary":"A new MMO that will only get better.","reviewText":"Before I write my review, let me interest you on my background with MMORPGs. I started with Ultima Online back in the late 90s, then Asherons Call in 1999 for about three years, moved to DAoC in 2000 for another three years, then City of Heroes for about a year, Warhammer for six months, and finally World of Warcraft for two years. I've seen the best and the worst of MMORPGs. Frankly, the best MMORPG I've ever played was Asherons Call because of it's difficulty level, uniqueness, and brutal and unforgiving death penalty (players can open your corpse and take stuff out, loss of exp, loss of stats, etc).STO (Star Trek Online) is a new MMORPG. Expect to see bugs at this early stage of it's growing process. There are lots of issues that need to be fixed but just like any MMORPG out there, there will be issues for the next six months until it gets stabilized. ANybody who cries foul that this game is a failure at this early stage probably only played World of Warcraft. Give this game a few years and it will only get better. Also as a tip...do NOT go for a lifetime subscription on this game or on any MMORPG. NEVER. You'll never know what will happen down the road.Let's begin with the review. This is based on two weeks of playing STO.OBJECTIVE- Live long and prosper and attain the rank of Admiral (level cap).GAMEPLAY- You start out as a Lieutenant with a light starship. It's agile its fast but not tough enough to withstand multiple Klingon Bird of Prey attacks. You are assigned three officers at the start. There are three classes in this game: ENGINEER, SCIENCE, and TACTICAL. Each class is subdivided into two general skills: SPACE combat and GROUND combat. ENGINEER is like your buffer. SCIENCE is like your healer. TACTICAL is like your tank. Your class and your bridge officers should be well rounded in both SPACE and Ground combat. As you kill stuff and complete quests, you earn skill points that you can use for your character and your bridge officers. You can distribute your points based on where you wish to focus your skills on. DO you want to build yours skills in Space combat and then leave out Ground combat? Or Ground and leave Space? Or create a balanced character? These development in skills will determine how well you perform in combat. There are TONS of races that you can choose as well. You will be asked to choose two main skills that you wish to place on your race. I chose Vulcan so I chose Accuracy and Mind Meld.As you complete missions, you will also earn merit points. The merit points are like experience points. The more exp you get, the faster you can attain the next rank. Each rank is subdivided into 10 levels. You start as a Lieutenant, then 10 levels later, you become a Lieutenant Commander, then 10 levels later, you become a Commander, etc. As you gain ranks, you are awarded a free ship based on that rank. So a Lieutenant that gets promoted to Lt. Commander, gets awarded with a Cruiser or any ship of your choice as long as you meet the requirements to pilot that ship, mainly the rank you have. As you gain rank, you will be awarded with additional bridge officers that you can level up. Bridge officers are like PETS.There are energy points also. This is the main currency. Basically you sell loot so you can buy ship, personal, and personnel upgrades. You also earn Badges of Explorations. These are badges awarded to you when you complete exploration missions. The badges have tiers as well, they run from 1st order badges to 4th order badges. You start with 1st order badges and then slowly as you complete exploration missions, you get the next tier of badges. Badges are used to purchase better equipment. Equipment purchased using badges are much better than items purchased using energy points.COMBAT- Space:  Space combat is a fire and forget type of combat. Just keep firing and you're bound to hit the enemy ship. If you want to do better damage, you can use skills you've developed with your own character and with your bridge officers. These skills are translated into how powerful your attacks and repairs are, this includes photon torpedo buffs, beam array and cannon buffs, and shield/protection buffs. If let's say you focused too much on Ship Repair for space combat, chances are you won't be able to bring down a tougher ship but at the same time you'll be unstoppable since your ship has a higher repair skill. On the other hand, if you concentrated your space combat skills on Photon Beam attacks and no Ship Repair, you'll be able to take down an enemy ship fast but you'll probably be taking TONS of damage during combat and probably blowing up into space dust when the dust clears. Space combat can be likened to Flight simulators...it's a dogfight out in space. SPace combat is done on a 3rd person view.COMBAT- Ground: Similar to space combat. Combat ground is a fire and forget type of combat. Keep firing your weapon, command your away team (your bridge officers) to attack/assist same target, and you'll probably win the gunbattle. You use the same logic in terms of skill use in ground combat. Should you have focused on more heals to outlast that Klingon warrior or maybe focused more on gun play. The choice is yours. Gunplay is done on a 3rd person view.MISSIONS- All missions are instanced based. Meaning, you don't ride your ship across space, enter the atmosphere, land your ship, and then jump out and run to your mission spot. In STO, there are space systems that you enter. If you have a mission in that space system, a loading screen appears and the mission begins. Once you complete the mission, you beam out and then request your ship to warp out. There are random encounters while you travel between space systems. Again, you don't see any mobs in this game until you enter an instance or you go into a Deep Space encounter. Have you ever played the old Final Fantasy games where you don't see the enemy until a loading screen suddenly appears and then all hell breaks lose? Yup those are Deep Space encounters in STO.INTERESTING TREKKIE MOMENTS- Audio and other stuff: Yes all the familiar sounds of STar Trek are here. From the phaser scan to the \"tweek tweek\" sound when you open your communication device, to the \"poowongwish\" sound when you beam up or beam down. You'll find those pesky tribbles, the arrogant Klingon, the sneaky business tactics of the Ferengis, the sinister Borgs, yes they are all here. Even the ship designs remain true to the Star Trek feel. The uniforms span from the original series (if you have the deluxe edition) to the newest Starfleet uniforms.  Voice narration was provided by the great Vulcan himself...Leonard Nimoy.GRAPHICS- You need a strong system to run this game to max quality. Graphics are quite good. They are clean and well-defined. The architecture stuck with the Star Trek feel and ambience. Cryptic managed to mix the original Star Trek design with the more modern Star Trek architecture. All in all the graphics are good.BUGS- Extremely long load times in high populated areas. Yes the long load times are a killer but they recently released a patch to fix this. If for some reason you are still experiencing long load times even after patching, you can workaround it by decreasing your graphics quality. Simply reducing the Viewing Distance will fix the long load times. Also there is only one server in this game. Everyone gets to login to the same server be it Europe, Asia, or North America. Downside is that during high population logins, you may have to wait for a 1 minute queue.Some functionality in the RENAME option is still not fixed. There is an option to RENAME your character but nobody has figured out how to RENAME it. It will tell you to go to the RENAME option before login. Guess what...the RENAME is still missing at the login page.A few mission objectives are missing. I did one mission where it asked me to investigate a damaged starship. I couldn't find it and decided to just quit the mission.You get stuck in some areas. I was on a  ground mission. I went down a steep hill. I couldn't find a way to get back up. Had to ask my ship to beam me up and abandon the mission.Repetitive mission encounters. Quite a few mission encounters are repetitive. They first ask you to access a computer. Then proceed to another computer. Then fight off a main squad of baddies. Then fight off a second squad of baddies. Then access final computer. THen beam up and end mission. For some reason, the pattern on a lot of the missions run in this logic.OVERALL: This game has a lot of potential. It's still a new game. It still has a lot of issues. But it shouldn't stop you fromn trying this game out. Judge this game six months down the road when everything is stable. And to those who say Cryptic should've caught the bugs before it was released, I'd say this is an MMORPG. It's bound to have bugs. It's a good thing for me because the game just keeps getting better as more bugs are fixed. Bugs lead to fixes which in turn leads to improvements and possibly better gameplay in the end. Try to avoid comparing it to say WOW. ALthough WOW was released in a stable format. It did undergo TONS upon TONS of patches during it's five year reign, that it made the entire game SO easy and forgiving. Give STO a chance but remember...don't do a lifetime subscription.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2010"}

A game and two expansions for this price is a good deal. I had a problem, though: I couldn't even install my expansions. I went to the site to get help but I still couldn't get it working. Too bad, I was really looking forward to trying the game as a werewolf. Anyway, onto the main game.Morrowind is known for being very non-linear. Some games are almost completely story-driven, where you have no other options than what they want you to do, but this is where they don't tell you to do anything and you only do what you feel like. You have a loose string of suggestions that you can follow, or you can wander to a random town and get a small quest. You don't get much as a reward, but there is a lot to try.The characters are just boring. There are only a few types in each town, and the rest are just repeats. They look pretty good, although they aren't really unique. Each one isn't very interesting, and you can't really have compassion for any of them like you can in other rpgs. So there isn't much motivation. I could just as easily kill them as I could help them, and I was bored out of my mind listening to them and reading the script.The graphics are pretty good. It looks clean, interesting, and there is some variety. There are items you can collect in the wild like plants and animal parts. Then you can sell them or use them as food or in alchemy. That's cool.There are various skills, such as lockpicking, alchemy, and nightvision. These help in professions like being an guard or a thief. You can choose a race that specifies in these skills and professions, and how you look. You can also choose a sign that affects your traits. Your character is very customizable.A lot of people seem to have problems getting this game to work. But, I think you should try this; it's a good deal to get the main game and two expansions.

Finally, the developers have listened to the fans, and it pays off big time!the game is  loosly based On the Arkham Asylum graphic novel from 1989..but tweaked here and there By batman writer Paul Dini (who also worked on the award winning batman the animated series )the plot..pretty simple...or is it?  After fighting and capturing the joker yet again..batman is en route back to Gotham city's infamous  Nuthouse to return the joker.

Basically it plays like a hybrid of Sleeper cell (for the silent takedowns)  god of war(for the non stop @SS kicking) and a great detective story.  all rolled up in a awesome action/adventure game...The controles  move fluidly, the gameplay is top notch..you can tell that the developers are big time batman fans..because this game is so richly detailed.  from the graphics  ...which are INCREDIBLE  and have to be seen to believe. to a engrosing storyline..arkham asylum has it all and much more for the batman fan.  its a creepy, journey into the world of madness ..and your right there  in the heart of it  be prepared for some long  gaming sessions with this one..(those scarcrow levels alone are chilling :) )if you get tired of going on the story mode..you can always wander around and explore the asylum and the island..there are lots of surprises to be found..one is having that batman set up a secret batcave up on the island years ago..and you need to go there to unravel some clues...  plus you can  match  with the various riddles from the riddler scattered all over the place...  or if You have Xbox live..you can get exclusive dlc to  add even more dimension to this blockbuster title...if you dont believe me...check out the other reviews here.back to the graphics for a second..The characters look amazing and well detailed..Batman looks like he could scare the you know what out of you..this is what the batman is!  No adam west stuff here!the sound effects and music are spot on..and  as a bonus if you are a fan of batman :the animated series..some of the cast came back to lend their voice..such as kevin conroy as batman..and mark hamil as the joker..he really hams it up in this game  but make no mistake  this is one seriously twisted joker..which to the fans is a real treat.im only  halfway through the game as i write this..but  i can say  that its worth it!  if you buy one game this year  make it this one..you wont be disapointed.I have the Xbox 360 version...and i have to say this game really shines on the system!  i almost got it for my ps3  im glad i didnt..the ps3 version looks a little unfinished in my opinion compared to the 360s's  thats the benefit of having more than one system...you can choose and check out for yourself.  Batman: Arkham asylum is a well made, solid game...ignore those people that  rip on this game..they dont know whats good.  this is a mature  batman game...its made for the fans and rightfully so.Bottom line...if your a batman fan, its a must own  not rent.  hmm i wonder if they will do a sequel to this..hope so.  or mabey a take on another batman story  one springs to mind  Batman: Knightfall...lots of possibilities here.also if you want more batman excitement..check out the graphic novel it was based on.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2009"}

It is a solid action/adventure title with a great interface and and ease of playability that this almost unmatched by other companies.  I like this game.  I just wasnt as enchanted with this outing as I was with The Sands of Time.This game seemed too much to be an attempt to catch a grittier, more intense feel than a true sequal.  Yes, the story is continued and some of the loose ends are tied up, but for the most part, the story seems fractured and hastily mapped out for my taste.The control scheme on this game is good, intuitive and easy to learn, once you forget all that you have learned from playing the 1st game.  See, the moves in The Sands of Time were easy to pull off as well, and they just \"felt right.\"  Putting in this disc, I was all ready to go about my business, only to have to stop every few seconds and remind myself that the layout had changed and that the moves were now different to pull off.  Once I had rewired my brain to the new control scheme, it was smooth sailing...minor annoyance at best.The thing that really soured me on this game was the inclusion of the darker and more \"souped up\" Prince.  Yeah, he has been through a tough ordeal and all, but why is it that all game companies think that in order to draw customers they need to make things more violent, more dark and more the clones of other games than true originals?The enemies are sand...why do they bleed?  The prince has such awesome moves, why are they limited to only a few areas of the island that need to be traversed over and over again?  I agree with the other reviewers that the game felt repetitive and dull in places, but at other times (being chased by the big baddie) it was tense and fast paced.  No happy median seemed to exist, and this makes for an unbalanced gameplay experience.Dont get me wrong, I applaud this game for it acheivements and its ability to improve upon a solid 1st outing, but for some reason, it felt as if this game was one that the developer thought we, the consumer, wanted them to make- and less like a game that they truly had envisioned.I would rent this game for a weekend at best, or wait till it comes out at a lower price for the \"Greatest Hits\" collection.

It's a really solid game that's cheap enough now that you should have no excuses not to get it.  The first X-men Legends game is better, in big part because you fight so many Sentinels, but that one's dirt cheap too now so just buy them both.  Also don't miss Marvel Ultimate Alliance, that one is even better than the Legends games.There are a few problems.  First you are stuck with their default button layout.  It's not overly annoying, but I'd have liked to rearrange things a bit to make it easier to control.  Managing 4 active characters and swapping out any other ones is a little onerous.  The auto-equipment option makes this much less of a chore, but it can be a little quirky how it assigns gear to your team.  I could say the same thing for both auto-skill distribution and auto-stat distribution.Whether a plus or a minus, you really should only deal with your four characters if you can help it.  The ones you aren't taking on missions level up much more slowly than your active characters, so if you swap guys a lot you can be in for a really hard game.  I found this a little disappointing.  There are some characters which really aren't all that good, but would have been fun to play for short spurts, however I ended up playing just the ones I had been so they didn't lose out on experience.In short, if you want the best team you have to pick 4 characters, stay with only those the entire game, and micromanage ever aspect.  I've also heard there are some glitches if you carry/store too much gear, so make sure you sell the stuff you aren't using.  The PC version of the game does have a couple of extra characters, Sabertooth and Pyro, but they're not all that good and you aren't missing much.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000034DCF","reviewerName":"GamerGirl","summary":"Best Cart Racer Ever","reviewText":"I know that Nintendo invented the cart racing genre with Mario Kart, and usually when Nintendo comes up with an idea they outdo everyone else. But here we have an exception. Crash Team Racing outdoes Mario Kart in so many ways that it puts Mario Kart to shame.CTR basically uses the same weapons as in Mario Kart. They may look different and be called different things, but they basically have the same effect. The two best weapons to have are the guided missile and the warp orb, which when juiced up, can cause all the racers ahead of you to crash and put you in first place. When you collect and hold ten pieces of fruit, you go faster and your weapons are &quot;juiced up.&quot;What really sets CTR apart from the other racers out there is its adventure mode, where you race through different circuits to unlock more racers and courses in arcade mode. The game is actually very similar to a Crash adventure game, in that each course has three objectives. First, you have to come in first place on the course. Then, you have two more things to earn on the course--a relic for beating a certain time and a gem that you earn when you collect the letters C, T and R from the course while also finishing in first place.There are also boss levels, where you have to race against a boss on their course, which can be very difficult. There are also a few gem collecting levels, where you are in an arena and have to collect all the gems in a give amount of time. These additions may not be incredibly fun, but they at least add a little variety.Finally, I enjoy the multiplayer mode in CTR much better than that in Mario Kart. You can play with up to four players split-screen, either racing or playing in a battle arena trying to take out the other players.Overall, CTR is a very solid game. For all I care, there could never be another cart racing game made again because this is the best one I have ever played, or probably ever will play, unless there is a sequel to CTR.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00003E4EB","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo-Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$110 recommended retail price for a console with two controllers, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"punkviper","summary":"What we have here is a failure to reach a proper price point","reviewText":"It is a known fact that the N64 got its barn doors blown off in the system wars.  Upstart Sony took the technology that was to be the foundation of the SNES CD-ROM add-on, and proceeded to give the world the Sony Playstation, and they've been on top of the biz ever since.  The N64 was crippled by Nintendo's stale conservative business attitudes, a lack of games aimed at anyone over the age of 10, and an expensive cartridge medium that required inflated prices to recoup any sort of profit from.And that is where we stand today: Nintendo's current contender, Gamecube, is being smacked around by both Sony (PS2) and Microsoft (XBox) and as if that isn't enough humiliation, Nintendo still wants consumers to shell out 100 bones for what amounts to a 1995 model automobile.Are there good games to be played on the N64?  Of course.  It's just ludicrous to expect the game-buying public to pay the equivalent of Gamecube prices for an outdated, dead, way-past-the-prime-it-never-had system.  It's a shame, because there are some fine titles to be had, but no one will buy them when they can simply sink those funds into a state-of-the-art machine.Dumb marketing, thy name is Nintendo.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2002"}

The game is a wild and wacky strategy racing game, as you try to beat the clock to try to drop your passengers off. The game does seem to hit it off, but the music does seem to drown out the fun a little bit, with a sagging dash of Hard Rock in the mix. The game does feature a down side, with only a couple of courses, but makes up for it in the fun. The game proved itself in the arcades, but there has to be a sequel in the works.

{"product_name":"B0050SWNZW","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Tyler","summary":"It's just not fun.","reviewText":"I am a real fan of Studio Japan's.  I consider them to be one of the most consistent studios when it comes to shunning the tried and true (and boring) formulas of game development in favor of true novelty.  A few examples of this are LocoRoco, Ico, and, of course, Shadow of the Colossus.  They also assisted in the development of the excellent and original Gravity Rush for Vita.Like so many of their other games, Puppeteer is based on a novel idea - playing through a puppet show.  The presentation really is flawless, from the soundtrack to the voice acting to the visuals.  The thing that sets this game apart from other Studio Japan games is that it just isn't any fun.  The gameplay really is lacking.  To be fair, it is novel, introducing the scissor mechanic and the secondary character controls; but it doesn't quite click.  As other have said, the cut scenes really are VERY long, too.  Fortunately, you can skip these.For me, the real test of enjoyment is how much I am drawn in.  If a game is good enough, I naturally make time because I WANT to play it.  In the case of Puppeteer, I had to MAKE myself play; and I only did this because of my fond disposition toward Studio Japan.  Ultimately, I couldn't finish the game.  It was just too boring to spend precious time on.Will this stop me from buying future Studio Japan games?  Not a chance.  They have earned the benefit of the doubt, as far as I'm concerned.

Although I come back to several games every now and then for nostalgia I am sure I will be playing this game regularly for as long as I play video games. Not only is the single player game great but the community makes this game infinitely playable with a constantly evolving catalog of levels.But the best thing about this game is that you don't have to love video games to love this game. I recently played it with my brother who just got back from Germany and he absolutely loved it. Keep in mind my brother declared all video games a \"massive waste of time\" and \"totally stupid\" somewhere during his sophomore year of college, right after he met his future wife...hmmm. Anyway, he couldn't help but have a blast playing this game! HE could barely contain his laughter and hes 27 and just got out of the Army.Meanwhile this game offers a lot of challenge for skilled players, especially veteran platformer-players who have been looking for a new style of play in an old genre. Some of the player-created levels are so hard they border on impossible, and that's the best part... you know it before you even play it, you can find the level that is perfect for you... easy and goofy or wicked hard but rewarding (getting the high score on one of those harder levels is very satisfying)When I am no playing harder levels or a fun easier level with my family and friends I entertain myself by simply looking up levels based on \"i like ghostbusters... lets see if there are any cool levels based on it\" and sure enough there are... lots of em!Despite a rather robust game collection I keep coming back to this one again and again! It's basically the perfect game for everyone thanks to the level creater. Did I mention how fun it is to make your own levels? When you get this great game try mine called Little Big Galaxy (my PSN is Sharpshell)although I warn you its on the harder side.The single player itself is an amazing game with or without the online community. The Developers chose to invent there own style for the game mechanics which work well in the game rather than simply make a Mario clone. It offers a lot of ability to master the game.

This mysterious power forms the beginning of all life, is the source of all magic and the origin of all thought. For eons the angelic Seraphim watched over the T-Energy and therefore over the fate of the entire world. But eventually tiring of their burden, they passed their knowledge on to the High Elves. T-Energy helped the realm of the High Elves to experience an unimaginable boost of prosperity, making it the reigning culture in Ancaria. But a force as powerful as T-Energy carries great dangers. Not taught how to deal with this, no sooner did the Elves take control, then a heated dispute erupted among them as to how and to what purpose the T-Energy was to be used. Dispute morphed into irresolvable conflict, then rift and eventually to a civil war among the High Elves, where all participants were losers. Their realm collapsed and with it the entire power structure of Anacaria. In the turmoil all the peoples of Anacaria coveted the right, either openly or in secret, to wield the power of T-Energy and in the end, unmanaged, the T-Energy raged out of control warping creature and lands alike. Can anyone regain control over the T-Energy. And if so, will he/she strive to prevent the world from lapsing into final chaos, or deepen it?GameplayGameplay inSacred 2: Fallen Angelin divided into two campaign paths: Light and Dark. As the game begins players choose and customize their character and choose the path they will follow. This choice determines the ultimate goal and intentions of their character, and as the game progresses through literally hundreds of quests and side quests, the paths of different characters intersect at different junctions. Choose one way and you may be tasked to defend a town and its people, while another path could result in you attacking the same town. The choice is yours and the fate of the world and your well-being are at stake.Key Game Features:A massive, seamless and dynamic world delivering hundreds of hours of freeform exploration.Two deep campaigns: play as the 'Light' or 'Shadow' side, complete with distinct skills, rewards and story-elements tailored to the chosen path.Six exceptional, playable characters, each with a distinct look, capabilities and in-game motivation.Modifiable combat arts: change, upgrade and link together your alter ego's combat skills to match your playing style.Fight effectively from the back of a number of mounts under your control; equip and upgrade your character's unlockable special mount.Deities offer unique combat disciplines and unlock additional quests.Seamless transition between single and multiplayer gaming modes via Xbox LIVE.Captivating online modes of play challenge gamers in cooperative, PvP and PvE play.Extraordinary, cutting-edge graphics and Dolby 5.1 channel surround sound utilize the latest technologies for a truly immersive experience.Character ClassesInSacred 2: Fallen Angelplayers assume the role of one of six characters -- five of which are new to the franchise -- and delve into a thrilling story full of side quests and secrets that you will have to unravel. Breathtaking combat arts and sophisticated spells are waiting to be learned. A multitude of weapons and items will be available, and you will choose which of your character's attributes you will enhance with these items in order to create a unique and distinct hero.SeraphimOften referred to as 'Fallen Angels,' these mystical and angelic creatures are the oldest inhabitants of Ancaria. Fast, elegant and acrobatic warriors from a technological future they fight with light to medium weapons and, if required, with massive technological support. Players can assume the role of a Seraphim and protect the world from chaos.Shadow WarriorShadow Warriors were originally humans trained as elite soldiers in service to the High Elves. Upon their death their souls were stolen by an Elven general, bound to lifeless bodies and imbued with T-Energy. Now free, they travel between this world and the next as undead beings with only the desire to return to the peace of the golden halls of Elysium.High ElfThe best student at the ancient academy of magic in Thylysium, the High Elf character lives and breathes magic. Her hunger for adventure and her insatiable desire to increase her personal knowledge and the influence of her once-powerful house are the driving forces as she sets off into an Ancaria boiling over with turmoil.DryadMasters of the hunt and akin to the Elves, The Dryad are in tune with nature and are equipped with the strength of the forests. The most powerful and the strongest among them are knowledgeable of the dark art of voodoo and were chosen in order to save their peoples from extinction. All are expert with the bow, traps, poisons and lore of the forest.InquisitorThe Inquisitors are the High Priests of the High Elves. Arrogant and deadly, they are only committed to themselves and their ultimate goal of assume control over the T-Energy. Proficient in close combat and able to gain increasing power as damage is taken, their manipulative spells make them powerful fighters from the shadows.Temple GuardianSince the beginning of time the purpose of Temple Guardians were to maintain and protect the Great Machine, so that it could keep the world in balance. Neither fully flesh or mechanical, they are half human and half machine. Propelled by T-Energy and devoted to protecting it, they are part of the Great Machine and so able to use the T-Energy for their purposes.A Wide Variety of MountsAcross Ancaria you will find many horse dealers. They offer all kinds of animals, from the simple nag up to a real war horse. You can equip a war horse with bridle, saddle and even special armor. These special items can be found in the game just like player items, ranging in quality from regular to rare and even unique items. In addition, every character also has a unique mount created specifically for their character class. This mount not only fits the personality of the character, but also complements the various aspects of the character's playing style perfectly. All character classes can fight from a mounted position using a variety of tactics that the player chooses depending on the terrain and battle conditions.","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"The Most Fun I've Had Playing a Terrible Game","reviewText":"Sacred 2 is loaded with flaws, glitches, and bad ideas.If you can get past the bad, there's some fun to be had.(Sorry, couldn't resist...)Concept: 9/10A Diablo Clone for the Xbox 360!  (Ported from the PC Version)  Hack N' Slash Fans Rejoice!!!Story:  0/10With text like, \"Kevin got GOOB'D for wearing Pink Spandex at the gym!\" or \"This grave is for concept art that didn't make it into the game.\"  I can honestly say that no attempt was made at even creating game fiction.  It's like the game was written Mad Libs style by angsty 12 year olds on forums.  The voice acting is horrible and full of unfunny jokes that you'll hear 100 times by level 15.  There is no excuse for this.  So, I guess the story is, \"You kill stuff to level up so you can kill more stuff.\"- Some Hack N' Slash Fans can overlook this.Graphics:  3/10This is a top down Hack N' Slash game which features 20 enemies on screen at a time, so the graphics are never really that good in these types of games.  However, the super-saturated backgrounds actually gave me a headache / eye strain.  (Out of 51 Xbox 360 games, this is the ONLY one to give me a headache.)  The backgrounds are so bright, it's very difficult to notice visual differences in the enemies.  The game also lacks style.  World of Warcraft is saturated but it has a stylized art direction.  Sacred 2 feels like the brightest generic world of all time.  When you really think about the graphics, it's almost impossible to believe that Mass Effect came out on the same system 2 years ago!!!  The graphics in this game are passable at best.- Some Hack N' Slash Fans can overlook this.Interface Screens:  5/10Navigating through the screens is really cumbersome and awkward at first, but if you really want to try, you'll eventually get the hang of it.  Too Human does a much better job with interface screens.  After you figure out where everything is, they're not that bad.-  Some Hack N' Slash Fans can overlook this.Bugs:  7/10There's some slowdown, poly tearing, crashes, dead enemies glitching, and interface bugs.  This game is really sloppy.-  A few Hack N' Slash Fans can overlook this.Bad Ideas: 8/10No Pause in 1 player!!!  No game fiction!  A laughably bad opening movie!  Worst Voice Acting for a 360 game!  Confusing Inventory System!  Once you assign your Stat Increases, you can never change them...-  It takes a very special breed of Hack N' Slash Fan to overlook this.Gameplay:  8/10If you didn't immediately take the game back to the store, and you actually tried playing it for about 2 hours, the game starts to get fun.  The Character Customization and Enemy Loot Drops are great!  You're constantly fighting hordes of bad guys and they're dropping things that you can actually use every 15 to 20 minutes.  There are also socketed weapons to further your customization.  You level up fairly quickly, so you're always looking forward to what's coming next.  Each time you level up, you get to increase 3 things:  Character Attributes (Strength, Dexterity...), Skills (Tactics, Swords, Speed), and Special Attacks (Hit Multiple guys, Hit one guy, Energy Leech...)  So, once you get hooked on the game, it really gets addicting.  The Loot in this game is on par with Diablo 2 and may have an edge over Titan Quest.-  This is a Hack N' Slash Fan's Dream!Combat:  7/10For this type of game, the combat is ok.  You map weapons to the face buttons on the 360 and press them to attack enemies.  You can also hold them to repeatedly attack.  It's pretty simple.  Potions are mapped to the D-Pad, which feels awkward, but you can get used to it.  There is no cool down period after taking a health potion and you can carry a ton of them.  With 99 Health Potions, you're pretty close to invincible.-  Hack N' Slash Fans hungry for some console action can appreciate this.Level and World Design:  6/10The dungeons are the smallest dungeons of any RPG that I've ever seen.  Some are the size of an apartment and hold 3 enemies.  Other dungeons are a series of linked rooms connected by a very short load time.  The World is also a bit strange.  You could be in a very easy area, then walk through a field and suddenly get ambushed by some very powerful enemies.  There really isn't a clear distinction of when you're entering into a tougher area.  On the positive side, the world is HUGE!!!!!-  Hack N' Slash Fans don't care about worlds, they care about enemies, powers, and loot!Good Ideas:  7/10At any time, if you are encumbered, you can \"Scrap\" your excess loot and instantly turn it into gold.  It's a nice feature that prevents you from having to drop a ton of items.  Mapping Combo attacks to the Face Buttons is also a good feature.  You can change difficulty levels as you're playing!  The Character Classes all have a unique feel to them.-  Hack N' Slash Fans can appreciate this.Overall:  4/10This game has a ton of problems and you really have to overlook quite a bit in order to have fun.  As a result, I really can't recommend this game to the majority of gamers out there.  However, if you are dying to play a Hack N' Slash on the 360 and you just want to level up and customize a character, then you can have a lot of fun with this game.EDIT:1 Star overall because of all of the problems, poor graphics, glitches, and an epic fail regarding game fiction.3 Stars for fun, simply because getting loot is addicting after a few hours of play.The game is Rated M for... no apparent reason.  It should be T for Teen.Buy this game if you can overlook a ton of faults and you really want to hack and slash your way through a massive world full of enemies for hours and hours.There's no reason to rent this game unless you can keep the game for as long as you want.  This is a really long game and you won't be able to finish it in a week.Avoid this game if any of the faults that I listed above were 'deal breakers.'  If you can't get over these things, then you'll be taking the game right back to the store.If you like Sacred 2, you'll probably like Castle Crashers on Xbox Live.  It's a hack and slash side scroller, and it's fun!  You'll also like the Marvel Ultimate Alliance games from Activision.If Sacred 2 isn't your thing, but you want a great RPG, then Fallout 3, Oblivion, and Mass Effect are some of the best ever!Dragon Age Origins and Mass Effect 2 are on their way, too!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2009"}

Instead of getting a new remote for Samsung, I decided to give this PS3 remote a try. It worked out perfectly.Programming is a standard fare for a universal remote in this price range -- you find your TV's model from the manual, and enter the corresponding code into the remote. There were 4 different codes for Samsung TV, and I had to try them one by one, and as my luck would have it, it was the last one I tried that worked for my TV. But once the correct code was entered, it worked beautifully. Not only did it handle the basic functions like volume, channel, and input selection, the remote could even navigate the TV's setting menu, which I found to be a very pleasant surprise. Pressing the Subtitle button (the one you would normally press while watching DVD/Bluray) while the remote is in TV mode let me turn on/off the Closed Caption function of my Samsung television too. I have absolutely zero need for a Samsung remote now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2013"}

As far as the game play is concerned it is really impressive.  The action is nonstop and very fluid.  This game is akin Burnout Paradise mixed with Need for Speed Hot Pursuit.  They have really removed the complexity of some of the simulation racing games and kept this truly as an arcade style game.I know how limited the game selection is for fellow PS4 gamers.

Single player campaign is very enjoyable and probably as good if not better than the Halo 3 single player experience. Horde mode is usually lag-free and really is a lot of fun - when players don't drop out. Multiplayer PvP is a travesty and unplayable due to the worst lag I have ever experienced in a console game. Forget the complaints you hear about unfair weapons, shield glitches, and matchmaking wait times. These issues are moot when the lag is literally multiple seconds, not fractions of a second.Since you only get 2/3 of the game that is enjoyable and workable, Epic and Micblosoft should refund everyone $20 for this game and only charge new customers $40 since the PvP is completely broken.This is all really a shame since the graphics, production values, sound, and gameplay/controls are top notch.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J4NE","description":"","reviewerName":"Nutwiisystem.Com","summary":"An excellent Move by Sony","reviewText":"I ordered my Playstation Move Starter Kit using Amazon's \"Day of Release\" option. And true to their word, the kit was in my hands on September 17.I normally review Wii fitness games, but I've actually owned the PS3 a lot longer than I've owned my Wii. I originally chose the PS3 because of innovations such as BluRay and HD graphics. I only got the Wii after seeing how much fun my nieces were having with the one I bought them. But I always hoped that the PS3 would some day support motion control.As much as I was thrilled with both systems in the beginning, both have disappointed me lately. Sony has actually gone backwards in innovation, taking away features such as OtherOS and PS2 compatibility. As for the Wii, the amount of shovelware has gotten unbearable. Wii game publishers just seem unable or unwilling to push that system further as far as innovative gameplay, more accurate motion controls, or better graphics. So I welcome the Playstation Move as a way to shake up the industry. But that'd only happen if it actually works. So does it?I'm happy to say it does.The starter kit was perfectly packaged in the box at my door. In it was the Playstation Eye camera, the Sports Champions disc, the Move Controller, and a Game Demo disc, all wrapped in plastic and in a box which was surprisingly compact.The Move Controller basically looks like a microphone with a plastic ball on top. I've seen pictures and always assumed the ball was blue and made of rigid plastic, but it's white (it'll glow different colors) and the plastic was soft. Unlike the Wii remote, the battery is built-in and charged using a USB cable.The Playstation Eye is basically a high-end webcam. It's been around for a while, but never quite caught on (there were a handful of PSN games that used it, but nothing too exciting). I already had an Eye, but given the bundled pricing of the kit it made sense for me to just get another one.The demo disc contains an \"introductory video\" (basically a long commercial with bunch of game scenes set to \"I Live to Move It\"), a Setup Guide, and demos for Sports Champions, Start the Party, EyePet, Kung Fu Rider, TV Superstars, The Shoot, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11, Time Crisis, Echochrome II, Beat Sketcher, and Tumble. If you're showing the technology off to friends, Beat Sketcher (where you use the Move controller as a paintbrush to paint on-screen over your own image) and Tumble (where you use the Move controller to move and stack blocks) both make excellent demonstrations of the Move's capabilities and accuracy.The Setup Guide shows you a little introduction to the Move. Then it takes you through setting up the Motion Controller and the Playstation Eye. Setup was a snap. To set up the Motion Controller, you connect a USB cable to it to charge up its battery (a red LED will blink while it's charging). Press the PS button to pair the controller to your system. While you can use it with the USB cable plugged it, I'd recommend not doing that unless you have a very, very long USB cable, or you'll end up yanking the whole unit off the shelf.To connect the Eye, you have to set the camera to \"wide angle mode\" by turning the lens so the right so the white dot points to the blue dot. You can place it above or below the middle of your TV screen (closest to your shoulder is best). Then, plug it into a free USB port on the PS3. There are conflicting instuctions on how far the Eye must be from the player. Some say 5 to 6.5 feet, some say 8 feet. I've found that around 5-6 feet works fine for me and my tiny apartment.The Setup Guide continues with tips, all of which should be familiar to anyone who's played a Wii, complete with pictures of silhouettes of people knocking lamps over. It does add tips about room lighting, which of course wasn't an issue with the Wii.When you start up Sports Champions, your Controller will start to blink. Point the blinking controller to the Eye and hit the \"Move\" (squggly) button in front + the trigger (T) button on the back. The controller will glow a bright purple when it's connected.Before playing a game, you need to calibrate the system. You'll see an actual video image of yourself. The system will tell you to stand within a certain area and move your controller to your shoulder, side, and belt buckle. You'll need to adjust the camera to make sure that your whole torso and hips are on the screen. (This is one tiny area where the Wii may have an advantage over the Move--the Wii will be a bit more liberal as far as picking up moves in a large space, standing or sitting, but with the Move you need to stay within the camera image, which may make multi-player games a little challenging)I've written a more detailed review ofSports Champions on its own product page. But I'll say here that it is the perfect game to showcase the capabilities of Move. The actions of the screen are truly one-to-one with the actions on your hand. Ping pong on the PS3 really feels like the real thing, where you can move and twist your paddle in real-time and you have a full range of motion (when you turn your body, your on-screen view even moves too). It's definitely a superior experience to Wii Sports Resort, where movement is hurky-jerky and you can beat the system by twisting your wrists in an unnatural way. And as much as I love my little Mii, there was something nice about controlling photo-realistic looking characters on the screen (the upcoming Kinect Sports uses cartoony characters, so Sony's alone right now as far as realism in sports games). The graphics of the locations, from the sunny beaches of volleyball to the city skyline overlooking the bocce courts, are stunningly beautiful, as is the surround-sound audio.As far as figuring out the controls, it was pretty easy, as the Move Controller pretty much mimics the Wii remote. I was a little disappointed that the controllers don't have speakers in them, but the flashing colors and the excellent rumble feedback more than made up for it.The Move Navigation Controller (not included in the Starter Kit, unfortunately) is really just a version of the DualShock that's shaped to fit in your other hand more easily (It doesn't have motion controls like a Wii nunchuk). For games that require motion control using both hands, you'll generally need two Move controllers (Sports Champions Gladiator Duel and Archery are good examples of games that gives you the option of using either one or two controllers--with the experience clearly being better with two).Overall, I'd say that the Playstation Move feels and looks like a \"next generation\" Wii. Having said that, there is a price to pay. To purchase a Playstation console, a Move Starter Kit, three more Move Controllers, and a few games will run many hundreds of dollars. In this economy, that's not easy. So I'm going to guess that the Wii will still do just fine as a casual gaming platform for families and friends to play together. On the other hand it's hard not to feel excited about the potential of the Move (relative weakness of Sony's other launch titles notwithstanding), especially with technologies like 3D coming down the road very soon. I'm looking forward to more \"virtual reality\" type games in the not-too-distant future.And so, I'll give this five out of five stars. Sony has made the right move (no pun intended :)), and we'll see how Microsoft and Nintendo counter. Hopefully the competition will wake up an industry that's clearly been in need of it, and we'll all be better for it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2010"}

It's a pretty hefty 2.6G machine with the best nVidia from 2 years ago.  To celebrate, I decided to pickup a cope of Masquerade: Bloodlines.  I was a fan of Masquerade: Redemption so it was time to 'catch up.'Installation was simple, but be warned that there have been updates to correct some bugs to download the latest and apply that as well.  For all the power I think my machine has, Bloodlines really pushes its capabilities at the highest resolution, so turn it down a bit.  To be honest I couldn't really see a detailing difference, and the number of frame 'jerks' dropped in half.  Even so, this game is hard on processors and graphics cards.  In highly populated fight sequences it pays to be patient.Those issues aside, you will find yourself playing as a fledgling vampire, created in defiance of Camarilla law.  Your sire has been executed, but the Prince of Los Angeles decides to spare you in a whimsical moment and sets you up as an errand boy in Santa Monica.  And for the first part of the game you tend to business, running errands that gradually get you the experience, and the information, you need to define your strengths and learn to negotiate the game.But a strange sarcophagus arrives in a ship and gradually the story changed to a series of efforts to help Prince Le Croix lay his hands on the sarcophagus and its contents.  The errands will lead you from Camarilla to Sabbat, put you at odds with the mysterious Kuei-Jin vampires.  You will even meet a few surprise monsters just to keep you jumping.  And a whole lot of vampire politics - everyone wants LA, even the Anarchs.This is a classical, mission-based RPG with a strong first person shooter component built in.  You get to worry about puzzles, money, character development, and dying the final death, not necessarily in that order.  The setting is pure Hollywood noir, with a action that is sexy and violent.  It is a bit more fragmented than Redemption, but it offers a more finely grained playing environment.Depending on your choice of clan to be a member of different option will open of close.  Although the most radical difference is with clan Nosferatu, who aren't very well suited for the seductive approach.Personally, I liked Redemption a bit better for it's story line and the likableness of its hero.  But Bloodlines is very much in tune with the current state of White Wolf's long time money-maker.  It it weren't for the graphic overload that plagues the fight scenes and a few glaring bugs this would have been one the best of its genre.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2005"}

Just in case you didn't know, I'm from Singapore, and Sony only officially launched the\"ultimate portable gaming console\" at this part of the world yesterday. I walked past the shop, took a look at the demo, and took out my credit card.Going home together with me is the inaugural title for the PSP, the racing classic Ridge Racer. I've played the game on my wife's colleague's parallel-imported PSP some months ago, and was pretty impressed by the look of things. But it was only when I had the time to finally take on the game on a more prolonged duration, that I fully appreciate the beauty of it. And it is, as I mentioned, just beautiful.The thing that immediately captures your attention is obviously the graphics. Fantastic is an understatement when it comes to how good Ridge Racer looks. Even when you're primarily focused on the road while racing, you can't help but notice the amazingly detailed background. For one, your races will take you thought different hours of the day, which means you'll come across the brightness of the day, as well as the cosiness of sunset. During different courses, you may also notice an airplane flying above you; or see yourself driving past an awe-inspiring lake; or a crowd of spectators cheering you on... you get the idea.The graphics also put a lot of emphasis on speed. So when you're bursting down the road at 240km/h in a tunnel, you'll find the background fading away in a blur to create a sense of speed. The best part, however, is that the frame rate never seems to skip a beat despite the extensive graphics. Having the screen freezing for moments while I go side-by-side with a rival car in other racing games (such as Burnout) on the PS2 is definitely not a problem for the PSP and Ridge Racer.You've a few options to approach the game, while single events like Single Race and Time Attack may be a good training ground for newbies, you'd expect to spend most of your time unlocking new tracks and cars in the World Tour mode. The earlier tours are relatively easy to pass, but from what I heard, it just get tougher as it goes, so expect to redo races a lot of times as you progress. Oh, and did I mention you can have a wireless racing session with your friends if they also own the PSP?The controls are relatively standard. You've the X button for acceleration, and Square Button for brakes. If you're using the manual gear, the Triangle button shifts a gear up, and the Circle Button shifts a gear down. The \"L\" button switches between first and third person view, and the \"R\" button activates the nitro you earn while doing power drifts during corners. Oh, and you also control the direction using the D-Pad, but I'm sure you already know that. The controls make reduce the need for any tedious learning curve, and make sure that you can start right away to do the thing that you bought the game. That is, to play!Now, the next big thing for this game. The audios. If you're played earlier renditions of Ridge Racer, you should have knowledge of how cool the soundtrack, er, sounds. You get some rehashed tracks, as well as new tracks that really make it a joy to listen while you take on the competition. You'll also get to select from different playlists, so you're by no means stuck with what you don't like. An archive is also available for you to listen to remixes of old Ridge Racer tracks. Now, for the nostalgic fan, this is really a cool idea.On the whole, Ridge Racer is a testament to how good a game can be on the PSP. If you're not a Ridge Racer fan, you may not enjoy it as much as those who're. Still, you can't deny that the graphics and audios in this game are worth another look. It's a pity that the sound couldn't do better, due to the limitations of the console itself. Listening to music on the PSP without earphones is like listening to a badly tuned FM receiver in my opinion, but then again, earphones are provided! Anyhow, I'd highly recommend Ridge Racer for fans of the racing genre, if only just to enjoy the beauty of the game's aesthetics.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2005"}

There are some kinda-unique elements to the game; there's stealth abilities, the graphics are very good, the story is passable, the intro and cut scenes are awesome.  The problem is that it's... muddled.  In most instances, stealth is an option, but more often than not, someone or something notices you, and completely kills that option.  The game then becomes; run into an area, have the bad guys notice you and shoot at you, you hide and pop out from time to time to take them out / let your sheilds recharge.  Rinse and Repeat.  The bad guys get boring real quick.  Couple different soliders, couple different aliens.  Yay.  The weapons are nicely done, and the sound effects are good.  Control is solid.

{"product_name":"B001CMIUYS","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"A Total Disconnect Between You and the World","reviewText":"Square tried to make FFXIII more accessible to players, but ended up alienating them.Here's what went wrong:When you make a video game franchise, you want to be sure that people can finish your game.The logic behind this states that there are a lot of people who say, \"Well, I didn't finish Dragon Squadron 1, so why should I buy Dragon Squadron 2?\"The three main reasons people quit playing games are:1)  I got lost and couldn't find out where to go.2)  The gameplay is too complicated.3)  I couldn't get past one particular area.Final Fantasy XIII addressed these concerns the wrong way.In FFXIII, you cannot get lost.  The levels are basically glass tubes where you can see a beautifully rendered, fantastic, and creative world.  But you can't interact with it.  You just feel like you are being escorted down a hallway or you're on a ride like the Jungle Cruise at Disneyland.  You can look around, but you can't touch anything.  The illusion that you are controlling characters in a fantasy world becomes diminished here.Allowing the characters to run around and affect objects in the environment would have gone a long way.In FFXIII, the game makes all of the meaningful choices for you (for the first 30 hours).  This game has a menagerie of enemies and creatures and there are a ton of different attacks and damage types.  It would be almost impossible to memorize which enemies are resistant or vulnerable to which attacks.  By using the Libra Spell, the game gives you all of these statistics.  When you are in battle, the characters' best attacks are Auto-Selected for you in the Auto-Battle feature.  All you need to do is press the A Button when the gauge fills up.  For the first 30 hours, you don't need to think about strategy and the game picks the best attacks for your characters.  Again, the illusion that you are controlling characters becomes diminished here because the game makes the meaningful decisions for you.Simplifying the damage types and resistances, and giving the player more control over the battles would have helped.In FFXIII, the only trouble you might have is during the boss fights.  If you die, you can restart right before the fight and you can always fight the same groups of enemies over and over again to grind up your levels to make the boss fight easier.  But the rules of combat actually increase the player's chance of dying during the 20 minute boss battles.  In combat, you only control the party leader, and the AI controls the other two characters.  If the party leader dies, the game is over.  They cannot be resurrected.  This rule is completely artificial and breaks the game fiction.  Any character that you are not controlling can easily be resurrected with the push of a button.  To make matters worse, the Party Leader Changes throughout the game.  So, if you are controlling Lightning, and she dies, you lose.  If the AI is controlling Lightning, and she dies, it's no problem.  This also diminishes the illusion that you are in a fantasy world because the rules don't make sense and you have little control over your own fate.To make matters worse, during a 20 minute battle, if the AI makes one simple mistake, like healing an AI character instead of you, you die and the game is over.  Now, you get to restart and fight the 20 minute battle over again, hoping the AI gets it right next time.  So winning a battle feels like it is almost out of your control.Speaking of controls, here's another issue.  You just select spells from a menu.  If you cast CURE, a list of characters appears like this:LightningVanilleSahzIf you are in a hurry, it is very easy to double tap or triple tap when you didn't mean to and cure the wrong character.  This is a very easy mistake to make and it often results in your death.  The game would have been much better if you pushed, left, right, and up to select the characters.  Down, cancels the spell.During the battles, you have to focus 100% on the HUD.  As a result, you don't even pay attention to the character animations and effects happening in the battle.  The timing is all based on artificial gauges.  And when an enemy takes damage, a bunch of numbers appear quickly and overlap each other, so you really can't read them.  If you try one particular attack you might see:  38,45,27,44, all at once, and partially obstructing each other.  2 seconds later, another attack hits and you see, 49,52,61, which quickly fades.  So, it becomes too difficult to do the math to see which attacks are doing the most damage.  So, you are forced to ignore the monsters and your characters and just watch the gauges.  To make things worse, when you select an attack, then the monster (OGRE B), the Ogre's health bar is not in the HUD.  It is over the actual monster which is jumping around and hard to see.  So, in an effort to make the game look more exciting, it actually hides the information that you need to make educated decisions.  Sure, party members and monsters are jumping around and performing attack animations, but none of it matters.  Again, this disconnects the player from the actual world.Now, here are some more issues:The Characters vs. The Story:The game begins with a peaceful utopian city getting destroyed by an evil military organization.  It's kind of like the holocaust + 9/11.  Thousands die and a peaceful nation gets destroyed.  This is a very dramatic opening.However, the characters don't really seem to be affected by this as much as you would think.  They seem wound up in their own personal issues.  This breaks the illusion of the story.  If the player watches something dramatic and feels emotion, you would think the characters in the world would share the same emotion to a higher degree.  The biggest culprit is Vanille.  She belongs in a Mario Cart Game because her dialogue consists of \"Yaaay, Wheeeeee, Fuuuun!\"  Lightning is a stoic hero, but she is so closed off emotionally, you cannot relate to her.  Snow's fiancee got turned into crystal, so he's got his own problems, but they don't relate much to environment around him.  Hope is the young adventurer who lacks confidence.  The best character is a black dude with a Chocobo Chick in is fro!  Sahz is the only character that seems to have emotions that resemble that of a human being.  But when your best character is a guy with a chocobo chick in his fro, you've got issues.The story is told through cutscenes that are full of convoluted dialogue that deal with misplaced character drama, and not the events unfolding in the world.  To make matters worse, the story skips around from past to present and changes the character point of view so you really don't feel a sense of attachment to any of them.  You control Lightning for a while, then Snow in the past, then Sahz in the future, then Vanille...  The game would have been better if you just played as Lightning and she was on a mission.  Because the characters don't react to the world, and you can't interact with the world, and the meaningful decisions are made by the AI, you really don't feel like you are playing through an adventure.  You just feel like you're along for a 60-100 hour ride.If you make it past the 30 hour mark, you actually get to play.The strategy involves leveling up your characters and assigning three of them roles in a Group or Paradigm.Some examples would be:Commando, Commando, ReaverHealer, Saboteur, ReaverSo, you set up your character's functions in a group.  (Max attack, debuff, buff, heal, magic...)Then you swap groups in realtime.  This is another disconnect because you feel more like a coach shouting \"Formation 1!\" OK \"Now, Formation 2!!!\"  Instead of taking control of the characters and hurling fireballs at the enemies.One final point... the music also doesn't match the events in the story.  It's either too quiet or jazzy, which doesn't really match \"holocaust.\"  It's like watching \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\" or \"Schindler's List\" while listening to \"She's a Brick... House... do-do-do-do.\"So, the art is fantastic, the world is fantastic, the art direction is fantastic... but with the gameplay, characters, dialogue, levels, and music preventing you from enjoying or experiencing the world, you're gonna have some serious issues.If you're the type of player that needs to feel immersed in your RPG's, you won't enjoy this game at all.If you love the art of Final Fantasy, and want to tough it out through the first 30 hours, and forgive some AI bugs, then you have a shot at liking this game.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2011"}

It's very difficult to not compare it to its heir apparent Dishonored as that game was everything Thief should have been. Dishonored is a classic in not only gameplay but storytelling as well.This Thief game has its moments and it never gets old creeping around and stealing stuff and collecting artifacts which is the primary reason I have scrored it a seven. The flaws that keep it from getting an 8, 9 or 10 rating are the following:- Very hallow generic game, not much life in it and the storyline doesn't help either. Not that great.- Loot is everywhere which can be a bad thing since your constantly hitting square collecting things. Not sure why we need to see an animation of him swiping stuff.- Garrett talks too much. Seriously though the acting could be a bit better and the animations sometimes come off as cheezy or last generation quality. Overall I'm not sure I like the Joaquin Phoenix look of Garrett or his sidekicks.Overall the game is fun but not worth the money. It definitely has value in the $20-$30 range but I can't recommend this especially for die hard Thief fans because it's pretty different from the older games.Nice try but hopefully Square Enix and Eidos Montreal have better luck on a sequel or better yet let someone else do it.--------------Edit - I had to edit the review to point out two more things I did not mention, one a positive and one a negative.Good:The game is completely adjustable, almost every setting in the game can be changed such as difficulty levels, turning off or on your focus, the enemy AI, turning off knock outs so you can't knock guards out etc. This makes the game highly replayable as missions can be replayed after finishing the game but there's a caveat to this, see below.Bad:Wandering the city is horrible which may make you not want to replay the game. The map is terrible. The mini map is atrocious. There are no waypoints, markers you can set and no fast travel. The entire city is a twisted maze of passages and without a jump button (the game focus on auto navigation) it becomes a frustrating mess of a time waster just getting from one mission to the next. Hiding from guards in the city serves no purpose. Killing them also serves no purpose as they respawn when you re-enter the map and it has no bearing on the story-line at all. Trying to find your bearing at times can test your nerves to the extreme. This part of the game has seriously not been thought through and it is one of things that can break the game for most people rendering it nearly unplayable at times.My review still stands as a somewhat above average game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2014"}

{"product_name":"B0050SX0UY","description":"","reviewerName":"dookerJ","summary":"A Beautiful and Ageless Game","reviewText":"I picked up a Vita bundled with my Playstation 4.  I had heard great things about this game, and it was among the first I purchased right off the bat.  People talk about the Vita having a lack of games, but I'm not finding that to be the case; there are enough AAA+ titles to keep me occupied for a year, and the Vita only seems to be picking up steam now that the PS4 has become so embedded as the lead console for multiplats and Sony's great exclusives.This, is another great, great Sony exclusive.  I played Little Big Planet before, and while I appreciated the creativity and innovation, the gameplay was not really enough to hold my attention.  When I learned that the same developers made this title, I was afraid I might have the same reaction.  I definitely did not, though.  This is not a game purely about collecting and exploring; you can do plenty of that, but it's an adventure game, with surprise, after surprise, after surprise.Tearaway uses every sensor on the Vita, features fun and compelling (and often challenging) gameplay (you will die a lot!), but the key is that they used the *perfect* balance of all of these elements.  The rear touch is used just enough (and in a very cool way); the camera is used just enough, so on and so forth.And most importantly, the real innovation here, is that as the game tells you a story, you are also creating your own story.  There's something very special and sentimental about this game.  Every person's experience of it is like a snowflake; no two are alike.  You decorate and define the entire universe in-between immersive gameplay.  Probably the most perfect use of any handheld's hardware to date, and definitely one of the best games available on any handheld.  If you have a Vita, this is a must-buy!  You'll never experience another game like this (unless, of course, there's a sequel; but that could be a while!).Overall, great, great game. I found myself playing this game every morning on the way to work.  My only wish is that it could have been just a little bit longer.  But, to those who criticize it for being \"too short\", I can say this: it took me at least twice as long to finish this than it did to finish the latest Call of Duty (Ghosts) campaign; and that was a $60+ game (clocking in at around 4-5 hours)!  And I didn't even find all the secrets and collectables; there is definitely replay value...  Some of those treasure boxes are extremely tricky to find!  It's a pretty long campaign, all things considered, especially for the price.  Great value great game.  I know I've said it already, but pick this one up!  Support great, fun, innovative games, and maybe we'll get more.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2014"}

Now.","reviewText":"If you're the type of RPG gamer who grew up playing the original dragon warrior and final fantasy NES games, and who still thinks of them fondly, then this is the RPG for you. I mean it. If you're that guy who wets his pants with uncontrollable ecstasy when, and only when, a Final Fantasy game with a roman numeral greater than VII\" appended lands in his hands, then you should probably stop reading now, as I might not be able to convince you of this DQ8's pure brilliance.Designed to be more of a \"traditional RPG\" and less like the japanese \"customiz-o-fest\" clones that modern RPGs have become, DQ8 does just about everything right. From the gorgeous andand vivid handdrawn graphics and detailed animations to the beautiful soundtrack and enjoyable sound effects and on to the stunning overworld and dungeon design, DQ8 is an absolute masterpiece. Let's break this behemoth down:-Story. Recall that this is a traditional RPG, and what tends to go along with that classification is a traditional storyline. There's some great evil brewing somewhere evil and evil people are doing evil things because of it. Not necessarily earth-shattering, but not boring either. In fact, it's pretty enjoyable if you just lay back and become a part of it, and the plot will take you all over the land through a large variety of interesting locations, which is always nice. In my opinion, so many RPGs have been made up to this point in history that it's almost impossible to come up with an original storyline. Think about it. RPG plots aren't really all that different. So, what makes a game's tired/cliched storyline worth playing? Ah, the characters.-Characters. One of the many great things this game has going for it. Characters (both playable and nonplayable) are interesting and unique in personality, and are fun to interact with. You start out with only two playable characters, but that increases to a max of four as the story progresses. WHAT?!? WHERE ARE MY 5,000 PLAYABLE CHARACTERS?!?! Sorry bubba, remember this is a traditional rpg. You control only a small number of characters so that you'll get to know them better and become more attached as a result. So again, what makes a cliched story worth playing through is the engaging characters that live it. And these characters are full of personality as well as different enough from one another to not seem like clones.-Voice Acting. Top-notch. Some have complained that most of the voices are British, which is definitely true, but is that really a bad thing? Personally I'd rather hear some British guy grunt half-syllables all day long than have to listen to another high-pitch Japanese pre-teen squeak for even a few seconds. Yeah, that was a shot at quite a few voice actors who lend their \"talents\" to modern RPGs. Go back to anime porn.-Graphics. Absolutely gorgeous. If every game from here on out had graphics of this caliber, I'd quit my job, sell my couch, affix wheels to my toilet, roll it out in front of the tv, and spend the rest of my life there playing games. Why should I sit here and describe the visuals in words? Go on grandpa, get on the internet and see for yourself!-Music and sound. Beautiful and appropriate. From the opening title theme that most old-school RPGers will recognize to the ending track, all music is fully orchestrated and a delight to hear. Granted, there aren't many tracks overall, and many of them (like the overworld and battle tunes) will be played over and over and over and over again, but don't be too disappointed. Remember, even the common tracks are pleasant to the ears.-Battles. Just like the old days. Battles involve the good guys lined up on one side and the bad guys lined up on the other side, facing each other. Action is turn-based, with the player inputting commands for all the characters (fight, magic, skill, run, defend, etc) and each character's and monster's reaction statistic generally determines the order they take their turn. Battles are fast and fluid. Animations don't involve unnecessary crap like the player licking his fingers, massaging his scabbard, slowing pulling out his sword, taking a few test swings, zigzag running toward the target, screaming \"OOGA BOOGA\", hitting the target, zigzag running back to the party, then saying something stupid like \"Feel the ultimate power!\". Characters jump toward the enemy, blast them, and hop back in line. Again, lightning fast. And this is a good thing. Animations are appropriate and fun to watch, and the business gets done.-Magic and skills. As you level up, you'll get skill points that you can assign to various types of skill categories such as sword, spell, sex appeal, etc. Which categories you see depend on which one of the four characters you're dealing with. Depending on where you allocate these points, the characters will learn particular skills when they level up. Some are useful, some are not, some are really friggin' useful, and some are good to get your rocks off, at least partially (take my word for it). In short, the system works well, with the magic casting characters getting the good spells and the offensive-minded characters getting the good attach stuff. It flows nicely too. Rarely (if ever) will you have to sit there and level up just to get some skill that will allow you beat a boss. In fact, I don't think this ever happened, even once.-Overworld and dungeons. One word: expansive. The world is designed to mimic a real, living place. When you travel from Town A, through the forest, across a rope bridge, through the valley, and up the hill to Town B, you actually get to do all that. It's not simply a case of pointing your character to the east, and holding down the \"run\" button until you bump into the next town. This was probably the most amazing part of the game for me. The lands you visit are enormous, and once you get other forms of transportation (three more in addition to running around), you'll really get a feel for the size of the DQ8 world. And boy, have I mentioned the graphics are colorful, vivid, and downright beautiful? I have? Well it probably won't be the last time.-Load times. If there absolutely, positively MUST be a negative in this jewel of a game, it's the loading time that springs up and shows its ugly \"thank you, CD/DVD medium) face everytime you enter or leave a battle, town, or form of transportation. Now, be careful. The load time is not horrendous by any means, but it is certainly noticeable. I'd say the battle loads are around a few seconds going into the battle and a few seconds leaving. Of course, this all depends on where the battle takes place. Out-of-battle loads take up to 5 seconds or so in the overworld, but are almost negligible in dungeons (due to the fact that dungeons all much smaller than an entire continent). So, bottom line, the load times are noticeable, but they really shouldn't detract from the enjoyment of the game. If they do, you should really consider taking a big sip of \"lighten up\".-Random encounters. Ah, what can often make or break an RPG. I've read reviews that have said that the encounter rate is too high. I think those people are on crack. That, or they need to consider trying the above-mentioned soft drink. The encounter rate is totally appropriate for this game. I'd say you'll get a fight about every 10 secs or so, which is actually a long time if you think about it. Don't worry, you won't get attacked once every 3 steps like some other games. And, if the encounters do get to you for some reason, or if you're backtracking and don't want to waste time, there are items and spells to use that \"turn off\" encounters temporarily. How's that? Or, if you're a masochist, there's a skill that allows you to be attacked as soon as you use it on the overworld. This is great for raising levels. So whatever your flavor, the combat shouldn't disappoint on any level.-Extras and side quests. There's a reasonable amount of stuff to do once you finish the main game, including a cool battle arena where you pit monsters you've \"collected\" or tamed against ranks of computer controlled monster teams to win prizes and other cool things. Other things include hidden treasure chests, dungeons and bosses. There's plenty to do here, I promise.-Game length. Man, this is another thing about the game that shocked me. It's reaallllllllllllllllllllly LONG. My final game time clocked in around 90 hours, and I hadn't really completed all the extra stuff there is to do. If you take your time and enjoy the game, the average gamer will probably put in about 60+ hours before they beat the game, not including the extra side quests and stuff.Really, this game is long and fulfilling. And well worth even twice its retail price. Don't be one of those fools who misses out on the experience because they say the \"battles aren't 3D\" or the \"game's too cartoony\" or \"British dialects make my ears bleed\". This game is pure gold (or better, platinum?) and is an absolute masterpiece in the realm of video game design.Buy a copy for yourself, buy a copy for your friend, and buy one for your dog too.

You need to gain &#34;Chaos&#34; points by completing side missions and destroying enemy bases.  When you have gained enough Chaos points, you can do a story related mission (which progresses the story, gains safe bases, and has boss fights).  The fun part about this game is that you can do whatever you want!  The entire map is yours to explore! and all vehicles are unlocked, it is simply a matter of finding them.  So you can just walk up to a car or a helicopter and take it!The main game itself is pretty cool and should take about 15-20 hours to complete...

Wario, Mario's jealous rival, plays the hero--well, kind of--in his first console adventure.Money TroubleIn the depths of Wario's castle lies the plunder of his many adventures on the Game Boy, Game Boy Advance and elsewhere.While Wario kicks back in his crib, enjoying the videogame equivalent of bling-bling, a mysterious black jewel in his trove transforms gems into monsters. His wealth, which was once a source of pride, becomes his greatest foe. Now, Wario must scramble to recover his riches.Cranky CapitalistStep into an alternate world filled with quirky puzzles, swarming enemies and lots and lots of loot. You'll learn a multitude of cool moves as Wario progresses in the game. You can punch, kick, jump, grab monsters and objects and inhale surrounding coins like a two-legged vacuum cleaner. The game even has a wrestling game-ish feel, as you can string together combo attacks that The Rock would give his eyebrow for.Early on, you will learn the significance of special sticky balls that dot the landscape. Wario can cling to these balls to navigate tough spots, reach new areas, and even fight bosses.You can freely bash and manipulate your surroundings to discover secrets. For instance, you can pick up a stone pillar and swing it at your foes or spin a fallen monster to activate a switch that raises a gate.Perplexing PuzzlesThe side-scrolling action remains true to the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games that made Wario famous, but Wario's incredible range of motion gives him newfound freedom.Finding treasure often calls for flipping a colored switch, then searching high and low for the activated chest. Considering the size of the worlds and the plethora of hiding places, this can be quite a feat. When it comes to moolah, though, no task is too tough for Wario.Trap doors transport you to hidden worlds that offer mind-bending puzzles. Using your noggin' will yield some important items. A colorful band of fairies offers game info and advice throughout your adventure.GraphicsThe development team at Treasure have stamped Wario's Nintendo GameCube debut with colorful and vibrant graphics. Wario's signature look comes to life like never before. From his arrogant waddle to his purple trousers, Wario is immediately recognizable. Charles Martinet, the actor famous as the voice of Mario, brings a special zest to Wario's growls, chortles and guffaws.From gleaming castle walls to gloomy gravestones,Wario Worldis crammed with beautifully realized details. The action is relentless but the frame rate never falters, even when the screen is packed with dozens of enemies that explode into showers of coins when defeated.Wario Worldwill test both your brains and your button-mashing skills.","reviewerName":"Marshall David WahlstromHelgren","summary":"Wario World","reviewText":"I love this game its awesome and I found it for $7.00 at a used store.

{"product_name":"B000I10PY2","description":"","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"For the best in portable gaming, go lite!","reviewText":"You have to hand it to Nintendo; they have successfully cornered the video game market, both with the mammoth-selling Wii console and the DS, their newest portable system. I held off on buying the DS when it first came out because I disliked the bulky design, but the DS Lite totally caught my attention. Having gotten one for Christmas and playing it frequently, I can easily say that this is one of the best systems on the market, and easily the best portable system you can buy. Below is my review, done in the usual \"pro and con\" style.Pros:1. Excellent selection of games. Games like \"New Super Mario Brothers\", \"Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass\", \"Metriod Prime Hunters\" and \"Mario Kart Wii\" are the reason that many people bought a DS. Nintendo really delivers with their franchises, but the DS has a better selection of quality third-party titles than the Wii. I am a big RPG fan and there are several great ones available for this system, but there are also plenty of great shooters, strategy and platformer games available as well. I am not a fan of the \"lifestyle\" games like \"Brain Age\" that they are pushing, but more on that later.2. Solid design. The DS Lite has a much more intuitive design that is comfortable to hold and play on for a few hours. The build of the system also feels solid, and believe me, it can withstand being dropped quite a few times. I can admit that I am clumsy and prone to dropping things.3. The touch screen adds more depth and a new element of playability to the games. Surprisingly, games that require the stylus to move the character on screen play extremely well, and multi-tasking with two screens is not nearly as cumbersome as some would expect. I personally like having the two screens and I have no problem following both.4. Great battery life. I am usually able to get 10 hours (or more) of gameplay on a single charge, which is substantially more than the PSP and even the Gameboy Advance.5. Backwards compatibility with the Gameboy Advance. I own a lot of GBA games and it's nice to be able to play them on a new system, although you do not benefit from any of the features of the DS.Cons:1. Abundance of \"Lifestyle\" games. I have to give Nintendo props for pitching their products to a wider demographic, but I feel that the game market is crowded with brain and coaching games, so much that it makes finding some of the games I like harder. Why is it that the Castlevania games on the DS go out of print so quickly while games like \"My Cooking Coach\" and \"Big Brain Academy\" are in plentiful supply? It seems that Nintendo puts more money into maketing it's shovelware titles than it does others, and it's a pet peeve for a lot of DS owners.2. The cartridge based games are unable to have the same quality of graphics and sound as the PSP. But hey, I would rather have a great game with mediocre graphics rather than vice versa.3. Lack of quality internet browser. Online play on the DS is a pain at the best of times, but don't even think of using the web browser that the DS offers. It's crippled and totally archaic by even the most basic standards.4. The touch screen is easily damaged, especially if you own a lot of games that use the touch screen and stylus pen as the main method of control. The key to avoiding this is to use the stylus in light and sweeping strokes as opposed to banging the tip on the screen. Buying a good quality screen protector, available anywhere from a variety of third party companies, is also recommended.I also own a PSP, which is better for racing and 3D platforming games, but I play my DS a lot more often. There are so many great games and more on the way, so I love the system despite the reputation it has for being a \"kiddy console\" or (similar to the Wii) not a proper gaming console. As far as systems go, this one is going cheap, so there is no reason to not buy one if you have been considering it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2009"}

Lambert \"DS Player, PC gamer\"","summary":"Another great handheld from Nintendo!","reviewText":"Although the DS Lite has been out awhile now, this is my first review of the product. I just recently acquired an Onyx DS Lite and find it a wonderful gaming machine. I owned the original DS before this, so here's my ups and downs listed below:Portability: Lighter than the DS original, easily playable for hours at a stretch (RPG fans will love this..not much wrist fatigue)Color: The Onyx version REALLY smudges, so be prepared to wipe down the outside casing frequently. A minor point, really, more cosmetic than anything else.Screen: Exceptionally bright (on the highest setting). A joy versus the original DS to view. Backlighting provides crisp, clear viewing of all your games (GBA games included)Price: Used DS Lites are now around $100.00. Games are between $20.00 and $35.00. A vast library awaits you for the DS and for GBA games. Brand new these systems cost $130.00, and you can buy bundles (like the Zelda: Phantom Hourglass bundle) for $150.00Durability: Most durable system. This will take reasonable amounts of punishment and keep on working. Occassional drops should not cause this unit to shatter into a million pieces.Redesign from the original DS: Everything about this unit is better. From the positioning of the switches (the on switch now slides, preventing accidental game shutoff's) to the mic being centered, it all works more fluently togetherOverall: Highly recommended to all gamers (and even those non-gamers out there) to buy. Buy a bundles system so you at least get one game. You'll only be spending an additional $20.00 to get it. The Zelda bundle is top-notch, but the Onyx color is still downright sexy with it's glossy finish. Be prepared to wipe, wipe, wipe...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2007"}
{"product_name":"B001FPBZBC","reviewerName":"Evan Eberhardt","summary":"Pretty good system","reviewText":"I found a Jasper unit.  I bought it at Wal-mart.  It runs cool and it is fairly quiet, excluding the disc drive which is insanely loud (think tower PC rom-drive spinning at 48x).  I have already ordered the starter kit with a 60gb hdd so I can load the games I am playing currently.  The performance has been flawless so far.  No lag.  I actually liked the old xbox live layout better I think (it seemed easier to navigate), but the newer features are a must.My only real complaint right now is that the bottom-right corner of the faceplate doesn't snap down all the way.  It is no biggie, but it just makes the console seem cheap, although I know the cpu and gpu are nothing to laugh at (even at 3 years old, although the nm have shrunk).  Speaking of hardware, I actually think MS went the better way with their machine than Sony.  At $200-300 for a console, I will be happy if it lasts 5 years (I spent a grand on my tower PC a year and a half ago and already it seems out of date with the i7 intels making the core 2 duo's look like a joke).  At the rate computers are advancing, it doesn't make sense to design a 10-year machine like the PS3 is suppossed to be.  MS will gain further market share if it brings out a new system by 2011 that will of course be superior to anything now, and blu-ray will be much cheaper then also.  I also hope they end the hard disk drive system for a bigger solid state internal memory (maybe 8 or 16 gigs), and they can sell an external 3.5\" HDD with a terabyte for the downloading types.  Oh, and it better have wi-fi built in, especially since they are pushing on-line play so hard.  That is a shameless ploy to sell those outrageously priced adapters.  The wi-fi adapter at retail costs HALF what the base console does?  Absolutely ridiculous.  In fact, MS would be wise to stop or at least lessen the 'nickel-and-dime' trend they have been on.  It generates cash revenue, but at a cost to consumer satisfaction.  The DVD adapter on the first Xbox was the worst of all time.  Sell the remote to people who want one, but do not block DVD playback to force buying the adapter.  I could not believe that one.  Sony would never stoop so low.  Show some class please, at least a little.  I know people love to rag on MS, and I too have issues, but sometimes it is just unwarranted.  If Apple had the courage to lower their computer costs (perhaps allow other vendors to build machines?), we might have some real competition.  But, as is, how can the world hate MS when they have encouraged competition in the pc sector and we now have laptops under $500 and towers for even less?  Anyway, got off track there.  Enough talky, time to play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2009"}

I would have paid $600 for this system easy.","reviewText":"After owning the Xbox 360 premium, Playstation 3 (for 2 weeks), and now the Xbox 360 Elite, I am completely convinced that the Elite is the ultimate gaming HD machine.  Concerning the premium 360 1080i was nice but in order to get the desired 1080p which my t.v. is capable of displaying, I had to have the VGA cable.  I got the resolution but the colors were somewhat washed out, and the sound wasn't as bold as it had been with component.The Playstation 3 for me felt like a disaster.  I honestly tried to give it a chance but with the terrible internet interface, flimsy/cheap controller, below average game choice, and TERRIBLE online service (was the deal breaker for me), I just couldn't justify $853 I paid for the system, extra controller, PS3 HDMI cable, 1 game).  The real downer is no TrueHD sound.  Pathetic!Now, I got the Elite the day it came out and was so excited and was hoping that it wouldn't let me down.  I can assure you that it hasn't!  The fact that the HDMI cable was included was really nice.  I like the cream better than the black but its nice.  I love having the larger harddrive and I've downloaded tons of stuff and love the fact I don't have to erase it all.Where it matters?  Yes, the picture is phenominal!  I can honestly say that with the HDMI 1080p has never looked better!  Bright, vibrant, sharp, and crip colors that I never saw with the premium and never saw with the PS3.  The sound is fantastic!  Actually incredible even compared to the premium 360.  No more upscaling the 1080p like the premium was doing.  My HD-DVD movies sound and look better than ever before.I have to recommend the 360 Elite to anyone wanting HD entertainment and amazing video games.BEST PART!!!

{"product_name":"B00113T0VA","reviewerName":"Simon","summary":"Now you can feel the Force!","reviewText":"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is the new multimedia project that chronicles the journey of Vader's secret apprentice during the years between Episodes III and IV. Kill Stormtroopers, battle the last Jedi, and change the fate of the galaxy.Right away, lower your expectations, because this is the Wii and it obviously won't have the same graphics and physics engines of the PS3/360 versions. Now lower your expectations some more, because the graphics are pretty average by Wii standards. That out of the way, the Wii version features great implementation of Force powers through gesture-based controls, and you'll have a blast shoving enemies aside, blasting them with Force lightning, or holding them in the air and throwing a lightsaber through their chest. Lightsaber controls are also motion-based, and while it's more waggle than 1:1 precision, it works well with your Force powers and allow you to mow through the multiple enemies with ease. There is also a duel mode for the Wii version that lets you pick from classics characters, and it's amusing in short bursts.What really hurts the game though are the same problems that plague most action games: The levels are linear, leading to some repetitive environments. The camera can also get seriously spastic at times, especially during boss segments where AT-STs and Rancors are bombarding you with hits. And for some strange reason you can't die, either - the game merely kicks you back to a previous checkpoint. This kills some of the difficulty, and with the game being relatively short, you'll be done in no time.Even with all the issues, I had great fun with The Force Unleashed. If you ultimately choose to go with the 360/PS3 version, which presents the cinematic story with better flair, I'd still recommend trying the Wii version once for the well-done controls. This is a 3.5 star game that deserves to be rounded up rather than down, but unless you're a hardcore Star Wars fan, wait for the first price drop before committing to this  fun but short adventure.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00005YTYJ","description":"WithGrand Theft Auto III, Rockstar proves that not all  developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games.  This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular  predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any  criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the  local population for their money (or weapons), make time with  prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking  more structure can embark on dozens of plot-driven missions or steal  cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and go on vigilante  missions. Grab a cab and play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi.  Take a fire truck and earn money putting out fires. The game just never  gets boring.As in real life, there are consequences for your criminality. As your  random acts of mayhem mount up, the police start hounding you,  eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you  continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily  the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are  packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every  category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump  trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically  when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific  detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic,  pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing.  Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine  different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a  monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages  to get everything right.--T.

Mok","summary":"Vast improvement over the first two GTA games.","reviewText":"Having played GTA and GTA2 for PlayStation, I was pretty skeptical about the whole Grand Theft Auto series.  The first two games had attitude to spare and nice details, but the gameplay was sloppy thanks to an ill-conceived control scheme, slowdown was constant (the result of trying to do too many things onscreen), the savegame system was abysmal, and the missions were often too hard (not helped by the controls).GTA3, happy to say, improves on many crucial points.  First of all, the versatility of a keyboard (on the PC version I bought, at least) means that there is now much more control over the camera angles.  The overhead angle of GTA and GTA2 is now only one of many available options, and the availability of this option makes gameplay a whole lot easier.  I still don't totally dig the way the camera would sometimes end up in awkward positions for controlling your car, but the camera problems of GTA3 are minor compared to, say, Tomb Raider.  Unfortunately, either because of too much design detail or the capacity of my computer, slowdown on my copy of the game is really prominent.  My computer was able to play Medal of Honor:  Allied Assault without any problems, and that game had atmosphere and details enough, so I can't help thinking perhaps GTA3 put in a little too much candy for the ears and eyes at the expense of control and smoothness.  I wish they could have built in some more display and audio options to help smooth out game operation; I personally wouldn't have minded not having so much weather and lighting detail, or being able to turn off the car radio, so I can play the game more smoothly.  If the slowdowns could have been alleviated, the control scheme and response of GTA3 positively demolishes that of GTA and GTA2.One big plus is that the story elements have been greatly improved.  You now have a much more comprehensible storyline to flesh out your adventures (though you can still play the game non-linearly if you want to); the character design and voice work now have oodles more personality, making it much easier to recognize one character from another.  The missions have been improved as well; though the technical problems above prevented me from playing some of the missions (El Burro's city race, for example), the learning curve and difficulty are now much more reasonable, making for a more enjoyable gaming experience.I have one major complaint:  The save-game system.  Why make it such a hassle to save your progress?  I don't mind replaying missions, but to have to return to your safehouse, go visit the boss again, get the same mission, then attempt to finish the mission time after time is a major drag.  I don't understand why the designers are so jittery about letting players save within the game.  At the very least, how about a checkpoint system so long missions don't have to be played all the way through over and over?I like this game, but I have enough gripes to make my experience a mixed one.  I can only hope GTA4, whenever it may arrive, would make as many improvements on GTA3 as GTA3 did on its predecessors, especially in the crucial gameplay and control fronts.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2002"}

After several patches; it's pretty good.","reviewText":"It took several expansion packs to make Civilization 5 great. While the launch of SimCity was horrible, the servers have been better since. When I read about the issues in March, I waited about a week or two to go on. It was spotty at best but, after about a month, there were no issues connecting for me at all. Do I think the launch sucked? Yes. If anyone remembers way back when Ultima Online was available there were a million problems. It happens. Yes, at times I might get kicked off while playing but it usually happens once a month. Never in the afternoon but usually late at night.Concerning the DRM: It's a matter of opinion. I personally don't care that I have to be online to play SimCity. Many years ago, this would be a travesty but most people have connections that are on 24/7. I can sympathize though with people who either don't have a constant internet connection or live in a area with a slow connection. Not everyone has a Fiber Optic connection. My sympathy stops when you know full well that this game requires a internet connection to play, yet you still buy the game.The graphics are pretty good.

The streets look nice as well however, sometimes there is a glitch when you place roads, it will sometimes place a intersection that doesn't belong or show a pathway right into a home. I wish that the traffic lights could of been more realistic but I really like how in this SimCity, the driving Sims really pay attention to the traffic lights although pedestrians don't which looks unrealistic. Also, the city looks alive with your citizens going about there business. For example, a homeowner within your city drives to the Garbage Dump, reports to work and is driving a garbage truck to pick up the days garbage. I love how the trucks go to each and every zone to pick up the trash. The simulation does a fine job letting you know whether you need to plop more buildings to add more garbage trucks. The idea of ploppables is fantastic!In all honesty, I don't miss the terraforming and region creation tools from SimCity 4. Yes, I believe in this SimCity that there should be more of a variety of regions. Right now there are only a handful that allows you to have up to 16 cities and several \"Great Works.\" Great Works act as huge bonuses to your region. For example, if your region cooperates and builds a International Airport, citizens from your whole region, even if they aren't connected to all 16 cities, can visit any city within the region. You also can get a huge influx of tourists. If you built a city catering to tourists, then this means more money in your coffers. Some cities have rivers running through it, some cities have a ocean bordering it. While this does help your sims in the way of commuting to other cites, tourists visiting, and relieve traffic, this does take away valuable real estate to build on a already midsized map. Still, some variety on the actual plot of land you chose to build your city is needed.Concerning city size maps, yes, I do believe they are not large. Gone are they days where in SimCity 4 you can create a city with millions. While it's possible to create a city with 1 million people, all cities will look the same cramming people within city block after city block. In my honest opinion, if I created a city with millions in SimCity 4, the city seemed to have no heart and no specialization. Yes, I could add a mall, prison, missile silo, and a toxic waste dump but the simulation was not realistic. While at times I will think, \"hey, a bigger map would be nice,\" but thinking about it, Id rather be able to specialize my city than them all looking the same. Playing SC4; the cities and region looked the same. You could put everything down and not have to worry about the budget. The one thing I do miss from SC4 was creating a giant region. It would of been nice if the regions in SimCity allowed for more cities. The cap is 16 so far.Concerning multiplayer, Cities XL failed but with SimCity, it's pretty nice. If someone needed money or municipal help, help was on the way. In Cities XL, you had to pay $9.99 for the multiplayer aspect, but on SimCity, it's free. Communicating and trading is much easier on SimCity than CXL. Just remember that the multiplayer aspect on CXL was shutdown years ago. Focus Home Entertaining who bought CXL from Monte Cristo hasn't done much with the several additions to CXL. The most was the ability to mod. Those that want to complain about Maxis/EA should look at Focus Home Entertainment. They re-released CXL as CXL '11 with adding a good amount from CXL '09 (Monte Cristo) but the same old bugs that plagued CXL '09 were carried over. The game once again became unplayable if you had several hundred thousand citizens. Subsequent releases of CXL just added some buildings but again, the same bugs carried over. How can you justify a $29-39 game adding maybe 100 buildings each year but the same old bugs infest it. FHE takes forever to answer you if you have a problem and yet again, CXL Platinum is pretty much the same as the other CXL iterations.Going back to SimCity, now you can specialize your city. You can craft a mining town, a resort catering to tourists, a technological center that creates flat panel TV's and CPUs, and a cultural mecca that includes stadiums, arenas, and a amusement park (DLC). Your decisions affect who comes to your city whether it's tourists or other workers from other cities within your region. This can also create traffic nightmares. You have several traffic solutions to work with although I was slightly upset that if I create a huge city, I couldn't create a subway. With the city land size not great, at least give me the option of creating subway lines. The one thing that CXL excelled at, the ability to create \"lines.\" For example, bus lines and subway lines. You can't create bus lines in SimCity but you have the option to place Bus Terminals, a shuttle depot and/or a bus depot. If your Bus Terminal has a long wait time, you can add more buses to your terminal in the form of ploppables which is a great idea. The idea of Ploppables allows you to add to a building instead of building more and more of the same type. For example, if you build a Coal Power Station and you find that you need more power, instead of building another Coal Power Plant, you have several options to add to your power plant. In SimCity 4, it wasn't uncommon to have a dozen coal power plants in your city which was a pollution nightmare. In this SimCity, besides pollution, you have to take into account which way the wind is blowing plus you can add clean burning coal furnace ploppable if you have the necessary \"research,\" from a university within your region.The simulation is very nice. When your garbage trucks drive around in SimCity 4, all they do is drive around. In SimCity,they will drive around to all zones, stop, pick up the trash, and move to the next zone. The simulator does a really good job showing you different charts/graphs from garbage, coal deposits, happy Sims, crime, pollution etc. How the zones \"communicate\" with each other is great. Your sims will look for work. They will mostly look for work within your industrial zones as well as commercial. The amount of workers varies for each zone type (C/I). Even your trade depot which sends out trucks to your industrial zones and mining complexes to bring back to the trade depot to ship out your freight from your industry and sell or buy your ore, coal, and/or oil. Within your industrial complex at your trade depot, you can buy/sell alloy to create TVs and CPUs to sell for a lot of dough!Many have opinions but personally I don't mind about the always on component of the game. My internet is on 24/7 and rarely does Verizon cause a hiccup. If the server is down or if my internet is down, then I'll just simply play another game. Will I get annoyed? Of course but hey, I got other games. Origin which is where this game is located (like Steam) I find is not as good as Steam but I've never had any hiccups with Origin.  I've never had that issue and I will go on SimCity any time during the day and/or night. I usually encounter the \"server not responding\" when I'm playing at night but it has been a very long time since I got that error message. The last 2 times I was thrown out of my city was because Verizon was shooting updates. It happened late last night; I called Verizon and they said that there was a update that was sent. When my internet was back, I found that my city was still there, saved, and had everything I did that day for the few hours I was on. While I didn't exit SimCity and see it sync and save, it still showed everything was there.Yes, it seems that SimCity is adding DLC to pay for but who hasn't been doing this. Tropico 4 just added more content that you need to pay for. Look at Train Simulator 2013, it has over $1000 worth of DLC. I hope SimCity does get expansion packs. SimCity 4 was great with the addition of the Rush Hour expansion pack. Yes,  Do I hope SimCity's maps get bigger? Yes. I do find SimCity enjoyable. Not quite up there with SC4 but I would rate it higher than CXL at this point. For those that will bug out with my 4 star rating, get over it. I happen to enjoy SimCity. Feel free to argue your points in the comments but at least keep it civil. My opinion,  I don't need comments telling me to go f- myself just because it's my opinion. Show some class.Concerning the DLC (downloaded content) of European City packs; what's the big deal? Personally, Im glad it wasn't included within the limited version since I wouldn't even use it. This was why I changed my order to the Limited version. For those that wanted it, they had the other edition that was $70. Those that complained about paying $70, then you should of gotten the Limited Edition. Having available as DLC just means that if you change your mind, buy what you want. Same thing with the new Amusement Park DLC. If you don't like it or question EA concerning it; again, don't buy it, it's your choice.People really need to stop whining about \"bigger maps, it's SimTown, the server issues, why did I buy this, I wasted $70.\" I know growing up is hard to do as accepting the fact that there are people that actually enjoy the game. While the game is not perfect, it's much better than what it was at release time.+ FREE multiplayer+ Nice fresh graphics that really update the SimCity series+ The simulation is very nice (If you build a hotel and gambling casino for tourists, by placing commercial zones nearby, you'll see motels/hotels and shopping pop up and tourists will go there+ Glassbox Engine looks good+ Specialized cities+ The bus stops plop ON the road like it should unlike SC4 that took valuable real estate (2 tiles)+ You have to plan ahead and put into thought what you want since the saving option was taken away- Maps aren't very big- Highway placing (parkways) taken away...in other words, we have no control and/or placement of limited access highways. Which is a bummer, I miss toll plazas :)- Wish we had more hotels and casinos or resorts to place in our tourist specialized city- The road placement tool is a little awkward- Server illness sometimes happens (it throws you off) but honestly, since I've had SimCity (since day 1) I've only been thrown off 4 times and that's mostly since June.- Origin (I find Steam slightly more reliable BUT when Steam has those 75% sales, you will be happy that SimCity is on Origin.- Not enough region variety- The city sites in the region look the same for each \"resource type\"- The pathfinding for the firetrucks/police vehicles/ ambulance is baffling which was fixed in a patch***By the way, the Prima Guide is very informative. You can also get it online and it will update according to the game******* The embellishment of constant server bugs is more from people who jump on the anti-EA/Maxis train and follow others.***-I haven't been thrown off SImCity or find a city I was working on empty in quite a long time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2013"}

Romano \"Avid Gamer\"","summary":"This Is One Of The Funnest Games I Have Ever Played!","reviewText":"I started playing Hellgate: London and I couldn't stop.  This game is very addictive.  The replay value of this game is just amazing.  Everytime you play the game, the game will play out differently.The game takes place in London, England in the year 2038.  Demons from Hell have taken over London and they live above ground.  The last remmants of humanity live underground in subway stations.  The levels you go through are always different and the monsters and creatures you fight against are always different.Right now, I'm playing a character called Blademaster and I'm having so much fun playing that character.  You can play six different characters in the game.  You actually give your character a name and you make your character look the way you want it to look before you start playing the game.  Blademaster is an expert using different swords and shields.  You can also use one sword in each hand or a pistol in one hand and a sword in the other hand.  You can also use a grappling hook to bring a demon next to you with one hand and kill the creature with a sword with the other hand.  You make the choice of how to fight the demons throughout the game.It was so cool to fight against demons called Blood Zombies and I actually used my sword to cut one Blood Zombie right in half.  Well the bottom half of the Blood Zombie's body kept coming at me.  It was just the hips and the legs coming after me.  I couldn't believe it.  Another time I chopped off the head to a Blood Zombie and the body kept coming after me with no head attached.  There are these jumping demons that look like mean looking dogs and they will try to land on top of you.  Well I actually use my sword to kill them while they are up in the air above me.  It so cool to see them fall down dead around you.The graphics in this game are really good.  I don't why people are saying the graphics aren't very good in other reviews because I think they're great.  Also the demo to the game is only 5% of the full game.  The different levels and demons in the demo are nothing compared to what is in the full version game. The full version game is huge.  The game reminds me a lot of Diablo and Diablo II.  I loved those games and I love this game.  This game is definitely a five star game.  I highly recommend getting this game.  Hellgate: London is so much fun to play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2007"}

The graphics are excellent, and the character modeling is spectacular, even the bird Kuzo.  This game is very much melee-oriented; however, stealth is involved somewhat.  Unlike other games, such as Metal Gear Solid 2, there are limited save points; however, you can choose when to save once you collect these save points (\"save\" scrolls).  The controls admittedly are not the best, but you can adjust after an hour or so.  Unlike Tenchu, however, you have a bird Kuzo to scout out the situation before you choose to attack.  For example, you can choose to stealthily attack some and blatantly attack others.  The focusing feature of Rau when he attacks is very innovative, and you can adjust to fight different characters simultaneously.  The environments in this game resemble Metal Gear Solid, in that you do have limited space to move, but you can move freely.  My favorite things about the game are several.  First, the use of Kuzo as your eyes in the sky is cool.  You can examine enemy movements from a distance.  Next, the stealth animations are absolutely brutal.  They make Tenchu look like child's play.  For example, in a double stealth skill, he breaks the neck of one enemy and beheads the other LITERALLY.  Even worse, in a single enemy stealth kill, Rau picks up the enemy and swings the enemy's head into the wall 3 times (!), smashing his head and neck with blood spewing everywhere.  Tenchu never got this brutal; and Metal Gear Solid 2 never saw blood spatter like this.  Lastly, the plotline via Disney characters and sketches makes this game incredible, and at this price of [$$], it is definitely worth it.Sony made a valuable and unforgettable game.  This game surpasses Tenchu (presently), Spiderman: The Movie and Batman: Vengeance in its gameplay, concept and stealth and the respective stealth animations.One note: When you buy this game, this game has a Mature rating for a reason.  Rau is absolutely and assuredly brutal and unforgiving, and blood will spill -- everywhere.  Although the characters are very cartoonish, resembling Disney characters, the incredible brutality of Rau ups the rating into Mature.This game for all action/adventure fans, especially Metal Gear Solid or Tenchu fans.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-02-2002"}

Zombies may seem very difficult at first, since two zombie slapstakes you down, and they can occur in quick succession.  There is alot of difference between the campaign, multiplayerand zombies in terms of gameplay.  The campaign rehashes air strikes, cover techniques, quick-reflex running and gunning,and stealth attacks (which are much more prevalent).  Trearch improved graphics from World at War to be on par with MW2.There's great variety in environments, ranging from indoor, outdoor, under water, under gound and up in the air.The cut scenes are visually apealling, but you can't skip them.  The animators did an amazing job on the Russian, Nicoli,as you can see every wrinkle on his face as he's expressing his war sentiment.  The earlier parts of the story really grabyou, especially while escaping prison.  As the campaign goes on, you may tire of the story, just wanting to get onwith shooting the enemy.  There is an entirely fresh mission.  It involves controlling a stealth bomber for ground support,guiding troops, then zooming down into the troop's shoes, getting the drop on Russians, then killing, killing, killing.There is vehicular combat in the form of pontoon boats and helicopters.  The campaign is playable, and very difficulton hard difficulty.  There is a good variety of new guns, and they have different functions for campaign, multiplayer andzombies.  As always, there are pistols, sub-machine guns, assault rifles, light machine guns, sniper rifles, shotguns andexplosives.  A new addition is the explosive crossbow.  There is plenty of ammunition during the campaign, so that's notan issue.  You have alot less ammo to start with in multiplayer.  I found assault rifles with high fire rate and low recoilto be the best weapons to weild.  The multiplayer maps are pretty good.  I lost alot of stats due to the host quiting.Like any other COD, people hack it like crazy.  The bulk of my knowledge about Blk Ops concerns zombies; it's addictive, fun,frustrating, non-sensical, brutal, time-consuming and repetetive.  The waves of zombies get larger and tougher, unlessyou know a couple secrets about MOON.  You have guns available for purchase, can gamble on the ? box, and can buy perks to aidyour efforts.  The perks include speed reloading, extra health, stamina, explosive immunity, increased fire rate,quick reviving, carry extra weapon, and narrow cross hair/auto aim for heads.  You get points for every time you hit a zombie,and a whopping 130 for a stab kill.  Learning how to play zombies is like learning what not to do in order to stay alive.The game can get pretty nuts while playing online with three others.  When people run all over the place, or mess with yourstuff, it's maddening.  There's alot of etiquite involved while playing zombies.  You should give other players room,because every player needs space to work with.  After learning how the zombies chase after you, they can be predictable,and you can use it to your advantage.  Sometimes, you just have to run around, leading the zombies after you, so youcan do a 180 and polish them off.  Bullets pass through them, and rack up points.  This is important for conserving ammoin later rounds.  Playing zombies makes you paranoid, because you never know when more are going to pop out.  Alwayswatch your back.  Players without spines get in glitches, immune to attack.  People don't hack the game, though.If the host quits, the game's over.  If people quit, the connection usually gets worse.  You can press select to see receptionbars.  Sub-machine guns have a good fire rate and make you quick, but have low ammo.  Light machine guns have more ammo,but slow you down.  Don't bother with shotguns and sniper rifles in zombies.  The ray gun's powerful, but is bad for points,and can hurt you with blowback.  The reason Blk Ops is still popular is zombies.  The multiplayer community was strong untilMW3 came out.  The campaign is worth playing, but not the main ticket.  Thanks for reading.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2012"}

You get awsome graphics, deatailed and unique chracters as well as an endless replay value. Alot of gamers were shocked when Soul Caliber was realeased for the Dreamcast.

Now all of our hopes and prayers have been answered and the product is Soul Caliber II.Soul Caliber II is packed with plenty of modes of gameplay. First off there is the Weapon Masters Mode which will keep anyone busy for awhile and added to that are over 250 unlockable items such as characters, costumes, and weapons. Yes I did say weapons and that is perhaps what makes this game so sweet. By having each character have over a dozen weapons the game will take some time to master. Unlike other fighting game this one includes weapons such as an axe and a plentidue of swords. The graphics are truley eye poping. If you hapeen to own an HDTV, then you will be amazed. Another plus is that the game is being released for all three main consoles: Playstation 2, X-box, and Gamecube. Each game has its own special character,and I must say the version to get would be Gamecube with Link (Zelda guy)as the playable character.

{"product_name":"B00000PLUW","description":"With a sub-$100 price tag and a massive software library, the Sony PlayStation is the undisputed king of home video game consoles. Although the PlayStation is no longer the fastest machine on the market, it does boast the broadest selection of software. Some of the hottest console games available today are created exclusively for the PlayStation, including several modern-day video gaming classics (Metal Gear SolidandCrash Bandicootto name a few).The Sony PlayStation truly shines with 3D-rendered action games, such asTomb RaiderandSyphon Filter. These and other 3D-based titles place players in the middle of elaborate gaming environments that take full advantage of the system's ability to render up to 360,000 polygons per second. The PlayStation also has the capability to display 16.8 million colors simultaneously and can support full-frame video playback at 30 frames per second. In addition to impressive graphics, the PlayStation also offers CD-quality sound. Each PlayStation disc has the capacity to store up to 650 MB of data--significantly more information than can be stored on cartridge-based games. As an added bonus, the PlayStation will even play your favorite music CDs (accompanied by a selection of cool graphics).Additionally, the PlayStation now comes packed with Sony's impressive dual shock controller, which allows players to feel every punch, kick, and rumble during gameplay. The controller features dual-analog thumb joysticks and round rubber grips for improved game control and comfort. Separate accessories that could enhance the PlayStation experience include an additional controller--allowing two-player action--and a memory card so players can save their progress in a game.--Brett Atwood","reviewerName":"EMAN NEP","summary":"GREAT SYSTEM, GREAT GAMES","reviewText":"Before I bought a Playstation I had the following impressions of it: long load times (five minutes or so)and major overheating problems. But now that I own a PSX, I know better. Load times are only a couple of seconds or at the most under a minute. As for the overheating, I guess it depends where you place your playstation. Mine's atop a cardboard box away from the satellite receiver and VCR. On the game Metal Gear Solid a CD icon is supposed to appear if the system is overheating or something, but that has never happened to me once. I normally play a game for 1 to 3 hours. One thing that I did notice, though, is that if you play a game for several hours, then take the game out and put another one in, you have to let the system cool down for an hour or two, otherwise you'll just get the main menu. The Playstation has a great library of games. For RPG gamers there's the Final Fantasy series with its GREAT graphics. The FMV sequences look like they came out of a big-budget special-effects-laden movie. N64 doesn't have such graphics, not that I've seen. For action gamers there's Metal Gear Solid, Vagrant Story, etc. TONS of great games. Remember, its not the graphics that make a system worth having, it's the games. I don't have the analog controller, but I love the regular controllers. They fit nice in your hand and ALL buttons are easily accessible, unlike N64. There are only two controller ports, but I seldomly play two player games and never play four player games. The system itself is very durable--I've taken it to college several times and hooked it up to the TV during my three-hour lunch. Overall a great system, but if mine broke sometime soon I'd probably save my money and wait for a PS2, although I would test the system first--see how it runs your old games--before making the big buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2001"}

{"product_name":"B001ASJISG","reviewerName":"Corey Turner \"The Musician\"","summary":"4 1/2 Stars, A great Experience","reviewText":"Prince of Persia is an action/adventure game, where you'll be assuming the role of `the prince' assisting the competent A.I. partner Elika, against some very unlikely odds through an archaic mystically tuned Persia. In terms of a quality adventure game, the 360 doesn't have all too many, nor much better then this to speak of. Ubisoft Montreal, masterminds of Assassins Creed, artist of the Anvil/Scimitar (gaming) engine, are the ones behind this fantastic adventure.  Having a historically high key track record, Ubisoft Montreal avoids dipping into previous Prince of Persia story arks, making an entirely new adventure that will hopefully seed a new series.If you didn't read that right, this Prince of Persia has nothing to do story wise with the popular and well recieved \"sands of Time\" trilogy. No worries, developers solidified core elements and capabilities from the acrobatics to much of the adventurous 'wowing' feats. Referencing former Prince of Persia titles through cleverly placed methods are always a nice reward for long time fans. Canon or not developers listening to players hypes and gripes of the past games certainly help it that much more. Now with entirely new whereabouts and plot a lot can happen...That means freedom for this title to go and touch base with nearly anything the developer pleases, which in this case is good. The last trilogy wallowed into the dark, going grim and gothic. Steering many fans and players alike away, the series went on to still be heavily appraised by critics, others felt betrayed (now we have resolution without middle ground).In Prince of Persia you'll be using a special gauntlet capable of searing through to terrain to grace your fall. It is useful for both combat and scaling walls. Your inventory may do fine with just the gauntlet, but just doesn't feel complete without a defining sword and infinite quip reserve. Add with a partner willing to do just about anything to put closure on disaster, and you have an army of two. Magical pads offer twists on locations, from gliding to sprints that defy gravity, the prince can make use of them once Elika establishes there power. They are the kind of inovation capable of turning a dungeon into a youthful playground.Vibrant cell shading is the force to the above statement, and with cell shading rarily done 'right' if you will this makes it so much more pleasureful. Games of the yesteryears were jagged and childish (or I should say amateurish) looking, ecspecially when tying to convey a more moody atmosphere they'd tend to rub off as a bad joke. This game sets the tones right, characters interactions and intentions are near perfectly reflected upon in nature by there region. Colors pop, but not always will your eyes be treated with such picturesque landscapes, `infected' areas darken the peripherals of the screen. Plants and objects are gloomily faded, but all can be restored.Crossing through a dead and drought desert (as the prince), depicts what could have been a very bland game. Within a few moments the stories main premise booms, scenery changes, and cinematic qualities of the game become more apparent. Story wise it has its cut and paste moments, and that's okay. Good versus evil, like we haven't seen that enough times to know who traughts about victorious? Hmmmm...guess whose caught in the middle of it? Pretty obvious stuff so far, the variable being the 'how'. The duo must cleanse the land of evil. To do this you must scale structure after structure to find a spot capable of cleansing the land in the order you choose with limitations of course. Freedom to purify sanctems comes with the price of collecting enough of a certain item to unlock those pads I was mentioning earlier, privlegding the player to further lands.Characters development doesn't seem to be a fitting word on what happens between the two main characters, they unfold themselves making their mental strengths and weaknesses believable, which is really interesting. Unfortunately conversation is optional and many will miss this strong feat. Without conversing, travels snaking around an entire kingdom, feel lonely and more so then not...boring.If I don't begin filling you, the reader, in on the game I could go on about the nuances for ages. Combat is scarce, you take on one enemy at a time in a very cinematic nature, and action sequences (button at correct time in movie like timing and nature) spice battles always keeping you on your feet. Like I said earlier the gauntlet proudly displays its colors as most useful item. Main antagonist have special techniques, taking them down will require more then what your theatrical combo attacks have to offer. You and your partner can conjoin attacks for cataclysmic strikes. Aside from Elika lending her hand out in battle, she can literally lend her hand out and save you from an untimely end. No game overs may make the game sound easy and you're right, difficulty is never emphasized.To further your cleansing strike on the lands you need to collect trivial amounts of light seeds, something Elika claims will help. To do this you need to find a already healed land and begin the gathering. This is the only real gripe in the game, progression is diminutive if you can't obtain enough. Light seeds become a nuisance long after you have collected enough, as some will lay hidden in a position just taunting you, knowing your are going to go so far out of your way to collect just one. I just thought I'd repeat the item collecting and expand upon it from earlier on as it is one of the few downers depending on the player, and I wished not to spoil all the positives with such.No multiplayer to be spoken of what so ever because there is none, instead upon completion of the game go check out some of the extra content available for download. Bonus material will hopefully have been unlocked by some point during your travels in the campaign. Bonus material includes colorful imaginative artwork, and different `skins' (different looks) for the two main characters.Prince of Persia was a game I lacked interest in never willing to buy it, I borrowed it, oh how wrong I was. Characters believable, interesting, and genuine in what they feel and display. Enemies whom speak with such corrosive tongues making it hard to separate there venomous speech from there similarly corrupt exterior. Landscapes influenced little by history and massively by imaginative minds.When released in 2008 we had a handful of titles, triple-A sequels flooded the market. A comfort zone was already established by the second time around; fans of those games already knew what they wanted. To take a gamble on a completely redefined game on a past series featured on a now dated last generation console didn't seem like a profitable or likely purchase. Now that Prince of Persia has hit an all time low price, a purchase seems more then reasonable. -4  stars-","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2010"}

Prior to the game's release, first-person shooters were mindless  action games.Half-Life, while containing its fair share of action, also  contained plenty of exploration, puzzle, and story elements. Now released as a  PlayStation2 game,Half-Lifehas never looked or played better. This  version contains the outstanding single-player story mode, as well as a few new  ones. While the new additions aren't so great, the story mode is one of the best  escapades available on the PS2.The game follows the adventures of Gordon Freeman, a young research associate at  the Black Mesa Federal Research Facility. A typical day at the office goes  completely awry as numerous alien life forms invade the facility. The fate of  the facility, and quite possibly the world, is in the hands of an unlikely hero.The graphics here trump the original's (understandable, as more than three years  have passed). The character models have four times as many polygons, as well as  smoother textures and animations. The sound is also very good, with some of the  funniest voice acting yet heard in a game. Of course, the single-player gameplay  is excellent, thanks to some very well-developed enemy artificial intelligence.Unfortunately, the new modes aren't nearly as brilliant. Decay, the new  cooperative mode, seems like an afterthought and pales in comparison to the  cooperative modes inPerfect DarkandHalo. Deathmatches only  support two players, which is incredibly lame considering many PS2 first-person  shooters support four.

The game play is good although i give it a 4 stars because after you play for a while a lot of times the game play can feel repetitive even though you use new weapons. Story wise its decent but actually these days unless your half life or halo, does anyone really care about the plot? Anyhow on to the DRM, what the crap is all the fuss, this game installed in minutes was up and ready to play, all i did was fill out the online product key BOOM that was it. No interference, no slow downs, no bugs, no nothing. Its seems to me the DRM is nothing but a mothman type myth that no one really even knows exists. If it does i have never seen it, and this is the second game i've own claiming to have it. Well guess what, you have anti virus software, turn it off, have firewall, it turns off to, if protection is the problem dont use any when you play the game. Also who in the world wants to install this on more than one computer at a time, why? Its the same no matter what system you play it on. Heres an idea, install it, play it, leave it if you feel you'll play it again, if not delete it, throw it out and move on to another game. People over analyze things WAY to much. Anyways have fun.

It's basically a corridor game with martial arts instead of gun play.  Basically you run, jump, and climb for most of the game, then run into some random bad guys and fight, then rinse and repeat.Fighting: I feel this is one of the areas the game really fell apart for me.  The game has 4 preset combos that fallow the same timing pattern.  but then you can add your own pressens into the slots to customize them.  this is really cool idea, but the problem is after only a hour or so into the game i had my combo memorized and i was simple doing the same thing over and over again and i got bored, and yearning for a better more complex combo lab.  I just finished sleeping dogs, and DMC and the complexity of their fighting systems made this just bland in comparison.And biggest gripe about the fighting system, there is no counter move, and when the system is all about doing huge combos but when interrupted in anyways the combo bonus is lost, and counter move could have made this more fluid and damaging the the enemy, instead it has a jump over the enemy button that most likely had me fighting the wrong guy which ends the combo.Another problem with the Combat is the special moves have a three minute cool down unless you do some special pressens again a cool idea, but when your fighting a character that i cant use those pressens again like some of the bosses, i found myself running in circles for 3 minutes waiting till they recharged.  these movements in the game were painfully annoying.Enemy types:  Limited, theres about 8 different kinds of enemies, most are identical besides for a few robot types, and one annoying enemy that hurts you when you hit it.  This enemy again great on paper, but when all you have are special attacks that don't kill it fully, i was left with running around in circles until i fully recharged or basically killing myself in hopes that he'd die first.  I can dream can't I? wrong this will cause death.  So run, run in circles!Bosses: This has to do more with the writing, When you encounter a boss battle, they will talk as if they are old chums, but the main character has no memory, so how does she even know who they are, and because the gamer is like the main character just learning the world, i had no idea who any of the bosses were, besides that i needed to fight them.  basically most of the boss battles seemed random to me.Story: It's ok, your basic neuromancer or blade runner style story with a weird family twist, that really falls apart if you think about it more and more.  I'd write more on that but its major spoiler central, so i'll leave it at that.Graphics or environment: Pretty, its one of the strongest parts of the game.  My only complaint is in the game you go through shopping mall after shopping mall you you cant even enter stores to just look around.  the game environment is meant for looking not touching.Memory Remixing:  Really cool idea, and for most of them, it is a trial and error process but an interesting one.  &#34;The Crash&#34; one of the the last remixes on the other hand made no sense, and i had to look up the solution, only to find out i had it multiple times but just didn't have it finish completely.  and the last one is the Crash all over but simplified to amazingness and almost as easy as the first one.  kind of disappointing really.  But one of the reasons this game should be looked at for new ideas in an industry that is often just making different variations of shooters these days.Overall:  I paid $12 for the game when it was on discount on the PSN store and it was worth it.  If i paid a full $60 id been happy for the first half of the game and hating the game even more by the end half.  It is an interesting idea on paper, and if there is a sequel, it has potential of being a really good game.  but as it is right now... it's a 3.5 star game.PS the french dubbing is much better than the English Dub, but the subtitles are really small and trying to read them and watch the video was way harder then any foreign film. So if the game had bigger subs i'd stuck to the french but i found tracking the story to be too difficult when running around trying to kick some arse.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2013"}

{"product_name":"B004QEWVTO","description":"","reviewerName":"Veil_Lord","summary":"Way Better Than I Expected","reviewText":"I purchased this game in the pack of multiple THQ games. I only wanted to get Darksiders, which is a really good game by the way, but I had absolutely no clue what this game was about. I have to say that I ended up liking this game nearly as much is that one. If you never played red faction guerrilla, this game is basically like that one only significantly improved city, non-destructible buildings.I saw someone else's comments on a message board about how this is basically grand theft auto that took the turn towards fun versus the turn towards gritty. That sums it up pretty well. One of my major complaints about red faction guerrilla was that you had very little ammo carried with you so you had to keep going to refill it. In this game you can basically carry around an entire arsenal with you. You do periodically have to go to one of the ammo stores to restock in the game had some weird glitches were would change my weapons on me, but overall the system worked pretty well. Driving around in the game is awesome and the music is songs that you may actually recognize. The fake radio stories and commercials were amusing as well. I really enjoyed the karaoke moment early on in the game which was just plain charming.You can take a lot of time customizing your character. As I recall there are three male voices, three female voices, and a zombie voice. A friend of mine once laughed at me for choosing the female character in a game, until I pointed out that I'd rather look at a female digital rear end for the entire game a male. The customization isn't quite as detailed as mass effect, but you can do a pretty good job creating your ideal character. There is a wide variety of clothing you can put them in. I was slightly disappointed that most of the clothing was pants, with very limited skirts and a few shorts. The only real skirt but worked very well realistically was the go-go outfit which appeared to be something someone might wear. There were also a couple of cleavage and deep cleavage shirts, but for the most part versus apprising lack of skin showing. That being said, if you really want to you can have the character runaround in their underwear or even naked, though it's filtered out, while playing; there is sort of a bonus activity that you can play only when naked where you have to streak. You can also do tattoos to various body parts and at earrings or other jewelry. There are very limited sets of glasses, with probably 9/10 of the being sunglasses.The world is large, but my major complaint is that the game is extremely short. I played over 20 hours, but a lot of the time was spent figuring the character and driving around doing the little side missions. If you just tried to blast your way through all the story missions, you'd be done pretty quickly. Most of the are fairly short and a large portion of them is just driving over to the point to start them. I get the feeling that they left out more content so they could sell it as DLC later. Not exactly cool.Overall, this was an incredibly happy surprise that the game was as good as it was. It's very possible come back and play this game sometime in the future, but the rate of been picking up games I haven't had a chance to replay much of my old stuff even if I like it a lot.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2013"}

Some have even called it the new king of kart racers. I am hesitant to give the game such lofty praise...perhaps ModNation Racers is the prince to King Mario Kart. For me, nothing will ever quite beat Super Mario Kart or Mario Kart 64.But ModNation Racers does breathe some life into a genre that had been becoming stale. With even the mighty Mario Kart series stalling out in with same tired old formula and precious few innovative features, ModNation Racers comes to the rescue.The game borrows from the LittleBigPlanet idea of \"create and share\". In the game, you can build and share tracks, karts, and characters (called \"mods\") online. The community is very creative, and you could spend hours sifting through cool character and kart creations, and racing on community-built tracks.The single-player is fun, but brutally difficult if you plan on unlocking everything. Some of the challenges feel nearly impossible given the challenging A.I. This is a great racer for all levels of gamer, for hardcore gamers and kart-racers will love the challenge of trying to complete every challenge. The campaign story doesn't really amount to much, but you're probably not playing a kart racer for story, anyway.The multiplayer is a blast. There is a lot to do, from sharing creations to racing in a variety of modes. This is where, I think, the game really shines, since the multiplayer community is what the whole idea of the game is centered around.Overall, this is a solid kart racer with a lot of innovations that should be welcomed in a stagnating genre. The biggest flaw, really, is the obscenely long loading screens. Once you get past that, however, you're in for some fun kart-racing action.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2010"}

Abraham \"Abe\"","summary":"A Game That Can Be Played For Over 100 Hours.","reviewText":"Opening Statement...War......War Never Changes....... This is a statement that I will neevr forget. You see it is a statment made in the Game Fallout 3 which to many including myself is one of the best RPG games that you can buy. It really does push the system to the max with a lot of diffrent items. It also take a good amount of time to beat so therefore it keeps you hooked until you beat it. This is a game that I can safley say has it all.Gameplay...This game at first takes a little time to get used to. But after that you get used to the controls very quickly. The specail V.A.T.S. System that is used throughout the game is awesome. It adds a whole new theme to the gameplay and I personally love it. It acts as a special homing device on enemies and works very well. There is an option to switch between 1st and 3rd person which I found to like becuase I am partail to 3rd person so when I want to use it I can with the click of a button. Now there are only a few things that I dislike. One is for the fact that walking around the wasteland while trying to get to one certain point you will encounter a pile of rubble. Now someone might think they can just jump over it but sometimes you get stuck trying to which means you have to get down and try another route. That is frustrating to anyone. Being able to use the Pip-Boy which is a small menu makes everything easy and orginized to find whatever you need in the blink of an eye. Being able to use your weapons switch between them moving and everything along this catagory are all easily picked up. I give this catagory a 4.3/5Graphics...Now there are a lot of people out there that can argue saying that this game has so-so or okay graphics. See I disagree with them for the main fact that this RPG is a huge one meaning that there is a lot of ground to cover. When you look at the graphics on that range I say that they are pretty darn good with the occasinal things looking funny. Like some of the enemy but not enought to make it hard to look at. Or for you to say the graphics such or anything along the lines of that. I give this catagory a 4.6/5Storyline...This game is imfamous in my opinion as having a outstanding long storyline. Obviously there is one main story that you foloow throughout the whole game in which you are trying to finish one main objective. But as you come to the end of that objective that you were trying to do throughout the game you are opened up with several more side quests you can do which makes this game something you can play for hours becuase there are many diffrent things you can do wheather you are finished with the game or not. I have played this game for about 62 hours and I'm not done exploring yet. So I have to say the many storylines or quests of this game is something to keep you occupied for a long time. I give this catagory a 5/5Sound/Audio....This game is freaky when it comes to the sound and audio of the game. Number one when you are playing through the wasteland you encounter diffrent types of enemies. Some of the noises you here can freak you out if you are playing at night. I'm man enough to say I jumped a few times haha. Now ontop of all of the noises you here they have this one radio channel you can listen to called Galaxey News Radio. All they play is music from the 40's and 50's now if that isn't enough to freak you out I don't know what will. Along with all of that the gunshots all sound clear and accurate and the sounds of killing enemies sounds cool. Along with the character dialoge. I give this catagory a 5/5..Final Thought...Now if you are one of many people who enjoy playing new games I would have to higly recommend this game. This is the first game I have played in the Fallout series and I really do enjoy playing it. It is a fun game to get a hold of and just play. ALso if you are someone like me who from time to time get in the slump of being board with what you have this is a good game to pop in. It appeals to a lot of gamers and what they want out of a game. This is a game that packs a full punch of awesomeness around every corner. It has a lot of what people want in every catagory. I suggest this game to anyone that wants a new fun and addicting game this one is all yours. With the exception of some of the minor things this game is a good one to play. I would have to overall rate this game a 4.4/5. ANd remember ...War.....War Never Changes.......","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2009"}

However - not unlike the original - the game is not always fair, and it is not well balanced. It seems that some of the earlier missions are relatively tough compared to some of the missions middle.What bugs me about this game is that you can not win it by skill. The game allows you to save anywhere (which is good) and you will have to, because too often it depends on luck whether you will survive the next 10 seconds, or not.While playing this expansion, I have died 25 times or more at the same spot without having the faintest clue why (while other levels I played through without getting killed even once). I have died because I could not get the elevator controls to work. I have died because a fallen comrad's rifle fell on top of the \"Panzerfaust\" I needed, so I could not pick it up anymore. I have died because I wasn't able to interrupt the \"putting down the MG\" animation that takes 10 seconds. I have died because my comrads blocked the way. I have died because my character insisted on reloading all 5 bullets while the enemy solder held his gun 3 inches from my head. I have died being bombed by aircraft while hiding under a train. I have been sniped with a single bullet while running from cover to cover with almost no exposure to the enemy far to often for it to be realistic. I have also died for a lot of reasons real solders die, but that just aren't fun in a game.I like that I can save anywhere, but I do not like that I never know whether it is safe to save. Will I get killed in the next fraction of a second? Often there is no way to tell. I more than once saved myself into a position that made me die as soon as I reloaded. Does it have to be that way? Of course not! It would be easy to implement a rotating quick-save system. Create 2 or 3 quick save files and always only overwrite the oldest one. This way, if I save myself into a pickle, I can go to the slightly older save game. Or perhaps the developers could have given me half a second of inmortality right after re-load, so I could at least manage to hit the \"prone\" key before the bullet hits my head.Overall, this is not a bad game. There are lots of memorable moments and the game has high production values. If it was a bit fairer and really rewarded skill and not luck, this could have been a 5-star game easily. But as it stands, this is an impressive game that just is not a lot of fun. Looking back, finishing the game seems to be more like a dreaded task then entertainment. I guess that means it re-creates war better than most first person shooters...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2005"}

The complaints I hear all seem to revolve around reading and waiting. Dear god say it aint so. I thought they made games for people who liked leveling up but hate reading and have no patience. Aren't they called God of War? Readers do not be put off by the negative things you have heard about this game but rather judge its merits on your own. Or better yet, my standards!  Wink!The storyline in this game runs deeper than almost any other I have ever seen in a game. At worst this game should warrant no less than a three, and this I say despite any personal taste, because you are expected to enjoy the genre you are reviewing otherwise you provide nothing useful, just as I would provide nothing useful if I reviewed a sports title. Some things are just good. Empire Strikes Back is just good. However, there is always someone who wants to be a contrarian, and then there are those with just plain awful taste. To those who can't handle this game's long build up, or as I like to call it \"Pacing\" (A concept few seem able to understand in our flash bang world today.)Perhaps you should master your adult onset ADD and give it another shot. Normally I would never criticize someone for their taste, but in this case it had to be said.This game is one that comes across every few years when the stars align (The real stars not the stars of destiny). It's not just a good RPG, it's not just a good game, it is just good! A quality piece of interactive media that creates an impression on those who can appreciate it! The tragedy of this game, and really the series in general is its puzzling lack of support and popularity despite its hardcore but small fan base. These games are very well made and fun to play, and yet they seem to be somewhat obscure in spite of this. If you are looking for a story that will give you that \"Oh my god Aeris noooooooo!\" feeling all over again, then this is the one.Plot and CharactersThe plot of this game is truly epic; so epic in fact, that there is nearly two hours of exposition involved before you begin to control your character, and can freely roam about. Is this a bit much? Yes, perhaps to some but I would argue that this set up is completely necessary. Suikoden games have always taken their time to get under way, but the pay off is a lushly fleshed out title, which makes you care about the characters, and what they are doing. The game sets its plot up not in a long winded way, but in a methodical careful way so that when the proverbial finally hits the fan, you are left drooling for more. You can expect all the same themes of intrigue, honor, betrayal, sacrifice, duty, and friendship that were present in the other games. I personally say this game is superior to the second title which is still considered the golden child of the series to many. I suspect a combination of nostalgia and rarity are all that places II above V, but that is not at all to say it is a bad game. They are both utterly fantastic in my eyes.You take on the role of a young prince in this game, who is caught up in the court intrigue and political maneuvering of his once prosperous kingdom. The game goes through great pains to introduce you to all the key players, rather than have them materialize in a big cape and say \"Ha ha ha I'm going to blow up the world!\" The characters, even the villains are complex, and you will really feel immersed in the court drama, and plotting that takes place in the game. I don't wish to give any more specifics for fear of spoiling the story, but after about 4 hours of ticking, this bomb explodes, and when it does you will not want to stop playing until you beat it.As for characters you are certain to find a few you like out of the 108 possible to recruit. This game has a long standing tradition of having the largest party both in battle and out of, for any RPG, and the large number is based around the story line itself. The 108 characters, including the main one correspond to the mystical 108 stars of destiny. Each person you bring on board has a special role to play, and recruiting them all makes up not only much of the content of the game but much of the fun as well. As in other games most characters won't throw their lot in with you until you perform a certain task. This aspect of the game requires much searching and backtracking to previously visited towns. You never know when a new face might show up. There are even a few reoccurring characters from other Suikoden games. If you have played through the others, and you should, you will be delighted to see these characters become playable once again.The main characters themselves are well designed, interesting and interact well with each other. So much of the story is conveyed through conversations between the main characters, and they are truly well crafted. This game is more reminiscent of a novel that was converted into a game in some ways. The characters personalities are replete with flaws, strengths and everything in between and even the \"bad guys\" of the game are extremely relatable.Game-play:Suikoden V does exactly what I want with a sequel to a beloved series of games. It preserves all the major elements of play, and adds in or combines a few extra bits as well. Unlike some series which feel the need to reinvent the wheel with each new title, (recent Final Fantasy offerings spring to mind) Suikoden has done a relatively good job of keeping its game mechanics integral. This game combines elements from previous games in a very effective way.There are three elements to the combat of the game. There is your basic 6 person party which constitutes most battles in the game. This is a fairly traditional turn based style of combat, but obviously having six characters instead of the typical three or four adds a new element to the flow. Then there is a one on one duel type battle, wherein you must preempt the actions of your opponent based on his or her words in order to effectively fight. Finally there are all out war segments, where members of your party lead units of soldiers, and act as generals. Each one requires a different type of strategy, and all are fun.Apart from this there are tons of mini games, and a nice customization element taken from Suikoden 3 and refined. The rune magic system offers a refreshing change from typical MP based magic in other games. The result is that you are able to cast magic less often, but it is far more powerful. I like this concept much more than the magic in other games which seems to have bright flashy graphics, but does barely more (or even less) damage than a melee attack from some spiky haired hotshot with a sword larger than his body.The game play overall is nice and solid. Nothing too difficult or too easy, and most of it revolves around strategy rather than button mashing or reflex. Moreover it is good because it offers that nostalgic experience to fans of the original two games. I am from the more traditional camp of RPG players, and it should be noted that I enjoy turn based strategy driven role playing games, much more than the more active type seen increasingly today. So if you started playing Role playing games recently you may find the slowness of this game off putting. I think it's minor and if you are invested for the right reasons you will hardly care about the combat system anyway. It may sound uppity but if you pass right over the wealth of great story and character interaction in this game and complain about the turn based battles, then you aren't a real RPG fan anyway in my book.Sound and GraphicsThe music in the Suikoden series is great! There is a very distinctly Asian sound to it but also a noticeable European influence. In fact the setting and graphics of the game are much the same. It's like a fusion of Japanese and European cultures, and it creates a subtle yet highly imaginative effect that is equal parts strange and appealing. The game is colorful, but not garish. Each character is rendered in a distinct fashion, and they have character portraits to show more detail. The cut scenes in the game are enjoyable, but perhaps a little awkward. There seems to be a lot of strange idiomatic hand waving that goes on for too long and other similar things. They aren't the best but they move the game along, and they aren't an unwelcome addition in any case.Graphically the game is not spectacular, but because of this more time could be spent making the game in depth in terms of plot, and it certainly has kept the game from being linear. Some titles have suffered for their primary emphasis on graphics, particularly in the PS2 area. This game looks good. It's not trying to be eyeball exploding. It doesn't want to be, or need to be. It's a classic styled game made specifically and unapologetically for fans of the series, and shows that this team of developers really understands what their fans want. Integrity!I'll wrap this up as it's already run a bit long. I can't say enough good things about this game. If you have played and enjoyed Suikoden I and or II then you must try this game. At the risk of sound sycophantic, it has it all. I am typically very harsh with games, as I have exacting standards for what I will call a good RPG, but I can scarcely think of a single negative comment about this game. I played once all the way through, and then literally restarted it and played through again before touching a single other game. I don't think there are any other games I can say that about.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2010"}

{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"David G. Harpstrite","summary":"Mass Effect 3 is amazing (minor spoilers)","reviewText":"So, after completing Mass Effect 3 last night, I have only really have one thing to say. This game, this series, has moved me more than anything I've ever experience. Not just in books or film or anything like that. I mean media period. The characters are believable, loveable or even hateable. No matter what every single character makes you feel something. Every single plot point makes you feel something even. Anger, sadness, joy, you name it. I truly fell on love with this universe over the past four years. I have become so emotionally invested that on numerous occasions I shed tears, leaped in joy and shouted \"YES\". Needless to say Mass Effect as a whole has had a profound effect on me. Every plotline resolved itself in a very satisfying way that exceeded my expectations. Best part is that they can resolve in a different way depending on your choices. It's one of the best Scifi epics I've ever seen period. Unfortunately there is something that does bog this game down. The ending. It is perhaps the most disappointing thing about the game. That's not to say it's the worst ending ever. It's bitter sweet, tragic and there are some good ideas burred there, unfortunately a rushed and sloppy execution ruin it. It's not what I wanted, and it almost felt like everything I'd invested in the series didn't really amount to anything. It did, but that feeling wasn't there. Take Mass Effect 2's ending, perhaps one of the best finales in the history of gaming, it made me feel triumphant, great, like I had really accomplished something. Mass Effect 3's has no such effect. I guess from an emotional standpoint it fails where it should have succeeded. It was too complex when it needed to be simple. It was bold, but the payoff was not worth the Buildup. But, what I've spent the past day trying thinking about, and the conclusion I've come to is that it's not about the ending. The ending doesn't really matter to me. The Journey I took with these characters in this universe is what I am going to remember fondly. Mass Effect is perhaps my favorite series of games ever, and I'm glad I experienced it. If the ending falters so be it, at least I still have everything else to love.With that out of the way, I feel I have to talk about something besides the story. The import system returns and works brilliantly to connect the three games together. You run into people you've previously met and just casual mentions remind you of what you'd done. You really should play the first two by the way. Starting at the second or third game would be a mistake despite what the marketing says. This series works so well because it's all connected, and missing out on any of it would cheapen the experience. The gameplay is vastly improved from Mass Effect 2. The combat is intense, Guns handle amazingly and none of them feel useless. You can mod them all as well. This means that chances are your weapons will be tailored to your liking no matter what. The new weight system, which determines how fast your powers cool down depending on how many guns you carry, coupled with the ability to carry any number/kind of guns you want helps make you feel even more in control. The powers are all improved as well. They can be upgraded in several different ways thanks to improved skill trees. This helps for strategizing and customizing your character completely. It takes the best aspects of both Mass Effect 1 and 2 and combines them. The AI is considerably more intelligent. They are clever, resourceful and it makes for a great challenge. There are a wide variety of them as well. Mainly it's the Reaper ground forces, Cerberus and the Geth. All of them require a different tactic and each of them are distinct. The sound is brilliant as well, the guns sound realistic, the music is powerful and it really sets the tone from the story. The Voice acting is top notch, with every returning actor delivering their best performances. The Cut scenes are very well directed as well, though some occasional bugs can disrupt the immersion, but it's so minor that I don't even care. The Graphics are good, while not the best and starting to kind of show their age, Mass Effect is still a beautiful game. Textures could be better and some pop in rears its ugly head every here and there, but again, it's forgivable. This is especially made apparent by the massive scale of the set pieces. When you see Reapers descending towards Vancouver at the beginning of the game, you really see how big they are, nay, you feel how big they are. The newest and probably most innovative thing about the game is the war room galaxy readiness system. You have to search the galaxy for resources, war assets and support in order to have a chance of taking Earth back from the Reapers. There are so many ways to do this it felt a little overwhelming. I spent hours on the Citadel just doing side quests to gain support. Every little bit counts in this game and it really feels that way. With that I shall segue into what is perhaps the most controversial aspect of this game, the Multiplayer. I am happy to report that this component is both totally optional and a lot of fun. It's a 4 player class based co-op mode that requires you to survive wave after wave of Geth, Reapers or Cerberus. After a few rounds you have an objective that gets you money that you can use to buy more weapons, classes and equipment. You fight them as several classes from Vanguards to infiltrators. The characters you create are your own, you can customize them similar to Shepard, but to a smaller degree. This multiplayer helps you in the overall progress of the game but like I said, it's totally optional and I didn't need to play much to be completely ready to fight the Reapers.So, Mass Effect 3 is, in a word, amazing. It has affected me in a more profound way than anything else due to Bioware's uncanny ability to get me so emotionally invested. The ending falters, but you should not let it ruin the series for you. This series is perhaps the best trilogy of this gaming generation. It improves on ME2 in every way and is a strong contender for Game of the Year. But above all that, it moved me emotionally in a way that I didn't think was possible.10 out of 10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2012"}

The colors, the fights, the story, all will be imprinted on your brain for some time to come.  But if you are a person of little patience and less tolerance, maybe you should consider a raincheck because this game may drive you to the BRINK!Allow me to explain if you will.  Skies of Arcadia follows loosely the guidelines set by the Final Fantasy series.  You will have a group of three to four warriors and you will find and defeat a series of enemies.  Weapons and combat skills will abound while magic will grow and engulf the world around you.  To this tried and true style, several major and important advancements were made.1) Ship battles.  You will love this the first second you play it.  Not unlike some of the monster battle games of the world, you will order your ship to make 4 \"moves\" for a given turn.  This can be magic, repair, attack, or defend.  Then you will okay it and sit back.  the four turns will be played out in front of you not unlike a movie, with your ship and your enemy swirling about and attacking.  Then the 4 turns will end and you will be given a chance to make 4 move moves.  Battle goes on until either you or your enemy plunges from the skies in flames.  However this sounds to you, I promise this will be one of the better aspects of the game to you.2)Move to move combat.  Not unlike the ship battles above, personal combat follows a turn basis.  Instead of having time bars that fill until it is your turn, each side will decide what their warriors will do, and then they will do it.  When a person goes in determined by what their speed is.  Strategy evolves around your ability to guess what you enemy will do and counter it.  Boss battles are some of the most inspiring and fun things you will partake in.But not all is flowers in the Skies of Arcadia.  Much like FF, you will often be ambushed by random enemies.  The difference here is how often it happens.  Throughout the game you are expected to find or discover your next area of importance.  Well this is rather hard when ever fifth step of tenth seconds you have to fend off hordes of enemies.  I personally tired every way possible to avoid those all-to-common attacks but to no avail.  There is a actual dis-insentive to explore because you don't want to spend hours fighting your way in, possibly finding some weapon or goody, and then spending more time getting back out so you can continue on your way.  And there is no relief from this tedium. Only towns are safe for you to explore freely.  Now I understand why this is in the game but COME ON!  I don't want to have to fight an army everytime I go into some cave.  This feature needed to be spread out a little.Also of annoyance is the lack of dialouge.  Everything is writte with the exception of a few simple and comically dsiplaced sound-bytes.  In the end, I think I should have been happy for just those but a bit more actual taliking and a bit less eye-wearying reading would have been nice.So in conclusion, this is a must have for your average DC owner (although we are a dying breed).  But if you have a short fuse, might want to look elsewhere because I am a patient and mellow tempered person and I nearly gouged my eyes out from the almost constant combat.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2002"}

There's something about the genre that mixes good old-style arcady action and platforming into highly addictive gameplay rolled with brain-teasing puzzles.There are some great games in the genre like 'Jak and Daxter', 'Sly Cooper' and 'Ratchet and Clank' series that focus on cartoonish world of our childhood memories.  There's 'Survival Horror' a sub-genre of action adventure like 'Alone in the Dark', 'Resident Evil' and 'Silent Hill' series that focus more on psychological tension and brain-twisting puzzles.  New comer like 'Uncharted' and 'Uncharted 2' infused jolt of nonstop excitement into the genre with unbelievable technical prowess, break-neck pacing and cinematic story-telling.Then there are likes of 'Devil May Cry', 'Prince of Persia' and 'Ninja Gaiden' series that focus heavily on complex combat mechanics.  Playing action adventure is so much more gratifying and immensely entertaining to than playing plain action game.  When it comes to this last group I mentioned, most games are starting to lose their charms and ugly over-rated pretenders like 'Bayonetta' and 'Darksider' that muddied the genre early this year are not really helping the matter.  But no worry, because the prodigal son has returned to wreak havok and send them into oblivion and his name is Kratos, the ghost of Sparta.If you've never played the previous GoW, the game is a tale of remorse, fury, vengence and redemption, a superb revisionistic retelling of grand Greek Mythology with a lot of twists and jolts in baroque craziness.  Everything about the game is packed with grandeur only seen in very few games.While the first two GoW throw handful of memorable boss fights combined, GoW 3 throws one epic boss fight after another in a scale that dwarfs the first two in comparison.  And even the regular fights in God Mode (normal difficulty) is harder than the first two and the game is also bit longer at 12 hours in my first run.  But with subtly refined combat mechanics that lets you use different weapons on the fly or even in combination at the same time, magics that are bound to each weapon, new moves like picking up enemy and using it as battering ram, and items you can directly use during combat without consuming magic really make this game the finest of all three.  Enough platforming and puzzles thrown together to give you variety further enhance the experience.The scale of all the set-pieces in the game is wow-inducing, jaw-dropping and gargantuan.  As much as the first two ooze the epicness, GoW 3 really outperforms in every aspect.The multi-staged epic final battle between Kratos and Zeus (not so much spoiler as you would already know if you ever played the first two) and the long interactive cutscene that ensued is the culmination of this magnificient epic trilogy that wraps up everything nicely in epic proportion.  All of Kratos' past demons are exorcised.  Some expresse the dissatisfaction about the seemingly ambiguous and abrupt ending, but if you ever read the Greek mythology about 'Pandora's Box' and pay attention to all the cutscenes in GoW 3 (the game recaptures the most important clues again in the ending cutscene), what Kratos does is not only fitting and sensible but very heroic and the only logical thing he should have done in the context of the story.Production values are out of this world from graphics, art works, design, music, voice works, animation to technical prowess that really flex the muscle of PS3 Cell Processor, everything about GoW 3 put vast majority of the current Hollywood to serious shame.  Once you complete your first run, watch all the various documentaries about the production and you will see the talents behind such a phenomenal developing team 'Santa Monica'.  Another noteworthy is the mo-cap tech that is now frequently used in games like 'Uncharted' series and 'Heavy Rain' really brings the performance (?) of the in-game characters to life.As with the first two games in the series, the game comes with loads of unlockable extra contents nicely on single Bluray disc.  Extensive and detailed 17 segments 'Making of Documentaries', extra skins, challenge modes and all the in-game cutscenes are better than many of special edition DVD / Bluray movies.Having paid for 'Ultimate Edition', I feel stupid that I actually paid $120 (the bundle that contains God of War Bluray Collection compared to $100 regular 'Ultimate Edition' ) for the not so 'Ultimate' edition, especially in light of these excellent already-included contents and I already have PS2 version of GoW 1 and 2.  The problem is that feature length documentary on 'History of God of War', GoW Trilogy Soundtrack, GoW Heavy metal EP, and GoW Challenge Arena all comes on a single voucher for DLC as GoW Premium Kratos Skin.  I was expecting nice extra case of Bluray and DVD in the fashion of MGS4 Limited Collector's Edition.  The actual digital contents are excellent.  But it's one thing to put skin on a voucher, but it's totally unacceptable to put the rest of contents as intangible DLCs.  Furthermore, the DLCs expire on March 2011, even if you don't download them.  So if you don't download and save them on your HDD or burn them on optical disc, they are permanently lost.  Art Book is nothing but a nicely made and ultimately forgettable coffee table book.  Pandora's Box is, while nicely engraved with fine details, made in cheap plastic that Pandora would break with her fragile fingers.  Not that I expected it to be made of gold-tinted steel or metal, but the plastic could have been much sturdier.  So be warned.  I honestly think the package is a criminal rip-off.  The regular edition is a complete package as it is.  If you don't own the previous two iteration on PS2, get excellent 'God of War Collection' on single Bluray disc with all the previous extra contents intact to complete the ultimate GoW collection, but avoid 'GoW 3 Ultimate Edition'.God of War is the undisputed king of the genre and that's exactly why EA carbon-copied 'God of War' with 'Dante's Inferno' out of all other similar games.  By the way, I loved 'Dante's Inferno' for what it is.  Unadulterated and unashamed blood-soaking violent revenge saga full of gushing blood, severed limbs and nudity with handful of platforming and puzzles.  Sounds familiar?'GoW' series rank with the very best of the video game industry alongside handful of the most notable classics such as 'MGS', 'Uncharted', 'Final Fantasy',  'Metroid', 'Zelda', 'The Elder Scrolls', and 'Fallout' series.Hail, Kratos.  There's only one GoW and that title belongs to Kratos.  If you only buy one series on your PS3, God of War Trilogy is the definitive PS3 collection every PS3 owner should purchase.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2010"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed.

The story moved with narration from another character and talked about you and your deeds.  That narration helped moved the story along.  The action was also a big plus so it was a fun game to like.So I didn't hesitate to buy Resistance 2 and I've got to say I'm disappointed.  I'm not disappointed by the multi-player aspects but that wasn't why I bought the game.  It was story and level design that is off.  Without getting into the story, it's that there isn't much of one. The character is simply thrown in the middle of battle after battle.  There are no major cut-scenes with story telling in the middle.  It's just a jump from A to B with a little bit of splash narration.  Then there are the levels which aren't that exciting.  And it's not that that this isn't a pretty game.  Because it's very pretty.  But that it's very linear.  You get to explore a town that has  been overrun by the Chimera.  But you can't open houses.  Only certain ones.  So you never feel like you're exploring to find the enemy.  You're just funnelled into a series of encounters again and again and again.  So you'll find yourself watching for a new gun and then have to duke it out with some enemies that just pop up again and again.More story, bigger levels that weren't so linear and this would be awesome.  As it stands, it's just too shallow as a single player game.  Other than multiplayer, this is a somewhat disappointing second outing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2008"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs.

Garrelts","summary":"Inferior to the Original, But Still Good","reviewText":"Resistance 2 comes as somewhat of a disappointment to me. I absolutely loved the first Resistance game for the PS3 and it was truly the first \"must have\" title for the system.Unfortunately many of the things that endeared me to the first game have been modified or dropped completely in R2. The excellent narration between levels featured in the first game is now completely gone and sorely missed.  The story suffers because of it. Now instead of getting a quick update of the fight against the Chimera the game relies on in-game voice acting to move the story. It simply doesn't work for me. The objectives are never quite clear enough, the motivation isn't quite there. I felt like every level was simplified to \"kill the guys who don't look like us\". Very disappointing considering the first game had such an excellent story.Another disappointment to me is the graphics. While R2 does add more colors to the originals palette the game is by no means stunning. Graphical glitches are prevalent in everything from evident polygon seams to areas completely missing textures. The environment textures themselves vary from pixilated to blurry. This all stands in stark contrast to in-game bosses which are stunning. The graphical detail from level to level is also uneven. The very first level looks terrible while the next level, situated in a redwood forest, looks great. I can't help but feel that the game could've used another 6 months in development to improve the graphics.Also cut are the fun vehicle sequences from R1. That's right you won't get a crack to pilot any vehicle of any type at any point in the game. Co-operative offline campaign has also been cut and replaced with random levels that feature no story to speak of. Very disappointing.Another change to R2 is the weapons themselves. The first game featured a large variety of weapons that were added to the player's inventory permanently. Now, not only has the amount of weapons offered dwindled; but you can only carry 2 weapons at one time. I can understand certain players citing more realism as the reason for the change but it simply doesn't make sense - Resistance isn't about realism.Changes too have been made to the health system. In the first game the player had a traditional health bar that provided the pertinent information. That has now been removed in favor of a damage system represented by a red screen. The more damage your character takes the more red the outer ring of your screen will become. I don't have a problem with the new system as much as I have a problem with the one-hit instant kills that have been added to the game. Certain enemies retain the capability of stopping you dead in your tracks. Unfortunately this is abused by the developer and you'll find yourself randomly dying at the hands of enemies in what can only be described as trial and error. It's very frustrating to be killed unexpectedly because you're unclear where to go or what to do or by invisible enemies.One change to the game that I liked is the inclusion of a cast of characters that Nathan actually fights alongside. The first Resistance game was essentially a one man show. While in R2 you have no direct control of your squad-mates they are there and fight along with you. The AI for these characters is moderately capable.The online portion of the game has clearly received more attention in R2. You now have a slew of options including cooperative and competitive online modes. A big selling point touted by the developer is the ability to fight in 60-player online battles. My experience thus far has been mixed. The massive battles I've played in are unorganized and chaotic. I confess that thus far I'm not a fan. The game attempts to encourage small squad based objectives but it hasn't had the desired effect. In online games I've started it seems that my squad immediately fragments into individuals.Ultimately, Resistance 2 will probably be liked more by newcomers to the series. Fans of the original game will likely notice the shortcomings and changes all to well. Still, R2 is a proficient enough of an effort and here's hoping the next game realigns with the efforts of the first.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2008"}

Sme\"","summary":"Something doesn't jibe right","reviewText":"\"Return to Castle Wolfenstein\" (RTCW) was one of my favorite games from a few years ago, and I was a little surprised to see a new version of the game in the store, which should have been my first clue---if it was a major release I should have heard about it.  It's not a bad game, and it's been so long since I played RTCW the story feels new, but it just didn't connect with me.RTCW started out as a World War Two shooter, and then gradually progressed into the Sci-Fi and supernatural elements.  The story was long and challenging, and being a traditional episodic game you felt like you were on a journey to the end.Wolfenstein plunges right into the supernatural and is one of those games which centers around a town, with optional missions you travel to.  You always have to pass back through town to be assigned missions and for supplies, and the result is finding your way back to the same place over and over for ammo, and having to kill the same guards and monsters.  The town is also much smaller than normal and so it gets old quick.I've never cared for these \"pick your missions\" games as they always break down into things that are basically filler and episodes you have to complete to advance.  In other words you can't really do what you want, instead you're a step further removed from the plot and now have to do the right things in the right order to open the next usable mission.  It never fails something gets out of sequence and you're trying to figure out what you missed, whether it's a minor part or a big chunk of the plot.  (Stalker was by far the worst on that).The game play could be challenging, but too many elements seemed derived from other famous shooters.  The energy shields looked like they came out of Half Life 2, the defend your position episode was too much like a Call of Duty game, the shield/walking through walls reminded me of Prey, the customize your weapons reminded me of.....well, you get the idea.Put your brain in park and crank the difficulty up and it'll be several hours of action with a few fun parts, but that's about it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2009"}

That would explain the fact that there are several hours of cutscenes, and they sometimes seem to drag on endlessly. You can skip them, though, so if you aren't very patient, you don't have to sit through them. There is humor, tragedy, romance, and action all rolled into one little package. Plus many twists in the plot. It seems like almost every cutscene, there's someone dying or betraying someone else or revealing a secret about him/herself. I was pulled into the story soon after I started playing. I felt bad for almost all of the bosses I killed, because they told their stories before they died and it turned out that they've had pretty tragic lives. At times, the characters repeat themselves too much or they monologue for too long, but mostly, its a well-written story with good voice-acting. The voice-acting went very smoothly, with few lines or voices that are completely idiotic. Which is an accomplishment, since most other games have major problems with that. Sometimes, though, the action in the cutscenes seems quite unrealistic. For example, when Solid Snake, the main character, sees a metal bar flying at him from an explosion, he doesn't just dodge it like a normal person. He leaps five feet into the air and throws a grenade at the pesky hunk of steel. There are a lot of crazy stunts like that in the game, but whether that's a good thing or a bad thing is a matter of opinion. Its not nearly as well done as the Matrix, but if you like over-the-top action, this might be for you.Something that impressed me was the uniqueness and variety of some of the boss battles. *Spoiler ahead* One boss has psychic powers, and he demonstrates them by reading some of the games on your memory card and making your controller move. During the fight, he could read your every move through your controller, so you have to put the controller into another port to block his telepathy. I've never seen that one before. *Spoiler ended* The other battles make you use strategy, too, which keeps it interesting.Movement isn't quite as smooth as I would have liked. You might run into things or turn in the wrong direction. Another problem I had was that when you walk towards a wall, you automatically put your back to it. This could be a problem when you need to face something on the wall, like a switch, and you keep turning around. But mostly, the gameplay is alright, even fun at times. You can collect a variety of weapons, from a stun grenade to a missile launcher. You can even pick up adult magazines and place them on the ground to distract enemies. And the controls are fairly easy to figure out. The gameplay is pretty good, with just the few flaws.For the remake of the original Metal Gear Solid, the graphics would obviously be improved. It looks good, with nice weather effects and facial expressions. It's not the best looking GameCube game out now, but it beats the old graphics. And as I stated before, the voice-acting is quite good. The music matches the situation well and the sounds match what they represent.I really liked this game and I plan to try Metal Gear Solid 2 next. There isn't much replay value, so maybe you should rent the game, then see if you want to buy. But, since it's under twenty dollars, it would be worth it to just buy it. I finished the game in nine hours, so its on the short side, but I enjoyed almost every minute of it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2005"}

White \"Dragnilar\"","summary":"Dante is ba- I mean.. is born","reviewText":"DMC3 improves upon just about everything it's two predecessors laid out, including it's legendary original. The crazy thing though about DMC3 is that it is a prequil, which may baffle some of those expecting it to be just as good as it's original.The variety of things that Dante can do should be the first selling point of this game. With easily at least 50+ moves at his disposal, many gamers will just be awestruck by the variety of things Dante can do in this run of DMC. The slight downside though is that you cannot perform them all at once, as Dante has to chose from 1 of 6 different styles that change the layout of his controls. This creates an interesting strategy for each player though as the game progresses, so it guarantees much replay value for those who want to try the game out in different ways each time.Another selling point for DMC3 is the increased arsenal at Dante's disposal. Dante has now more weapons than ever to play with, and all of them are much different from the traditional 'sword and guns' approach in DMC2. While I will not divuldge into details, these weapons heavily add onto the amount of variety and content in the game, and give the gamer a sheer feel of 'coolness' eminating from the arrogant red coated devil hunter.The music in DMC3 is stellar as usual. It is more heavy metal than the last two DMC's, but that is alright. The added in 'evil voice' that sings on all of the songs gives the game an added macho feel that is a definente need since DMC2 was rather quiet and generic despite it being a DMC game.Graphics are stellar as well, although there probably could have been some pre-rendered cut scenes.Overall DMC3 improves upon just about everything the first game had. It brings the strength back to the series that it lost with DMC2, and definently leaves the gamer wanting another DMC very soon.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2005"}

Martin","summary":"Not as much fun as AC 4","reviewText":"I eagerly awaited the release of this game and overall, I'm dissapointed.This game just isn't as much fun as the last version. In the previous version most of the missions had specific goals you and your wingmen had to accomplish. This game has several, not just 1-2, missions where not only do you have to accomplish certain goals but do it in a specific time limit. Even on the easiest setting, this time limit I've found is almost never enough. There's also one mission where you're given a specific time limit to simply destroy as much as you can. The game will decide after the mission's over if you've destroyed enough to pass the mission!The biggest problem with almost every mission is that your wingmen are nearly useless except for extremely annoying chatter, which you can luckily turn off in the game options. Even if you've given your wingmen commands to attack, they'll rarely destroy very much or they'll go after useless targets instead of attacking something important. Also if you ask them for help in a dogfight, you'll rarely get it if it's the last plane in the sky you're fighting. It's like the game is programmed to make you and the lead enemy AI pilot always have to fight it out alone, which is just stupid.I also thought the anti-war theme was a bit overdone. I got extremely tired of the one pilot that constantly had lines about how this was such a shame, etc. I also thought the developers used a stupid plot twist to run the game about 5 missions too long.Like a previous reviewer said, I really didn't like the fact that I could only pick the planes for my fighter group instead of being able to pick the planes and arm them as in AC 4. It seemed that while I had a lot of missiles (which was a big plus in most missions) I would have preferred to be able to choose between missiles designed for air to air or air to ground battles depending upon my mission objectives. The way this game is set up, all you can do is choose a plane that's more designed for ground attack if your main objectives are ground targets. But that will leave you vulnerable to losing dogfights.Overall, I just think this game isn't as well done as AC 4 and definitely not as much fun given the incessant anti-war plot and rather stupid plot twist.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2005"}

What's more, dragons have returned to Skyrim and they aren't anywhere near the realm of kindness for mankind.  Only one person can heal the rift that the world has wrought: the mythical Dragonborn.  Great, I thought, it sounds like the blurb on the back of a crappy fantasy novel.Although there was no original intention of buying this game, after seeing the world gush about it on Facebook and other social networking sites, I decided to give it a go.  It helped that the game was bought as a gift by a friend of mine, the ultimate kind of peer pressure, and so I sat down one night deciding that I'd play for an hour or so just to see what all the hype was about.  My intentions, you should know, was to play for a bit and then return to some other game waiting in a pile, gathering dust, that had been in my possession for much longer than this cryptic game with a dragon emblem standing out in stark contrast to its black background.  You should also know that my intentions meant absolutely nothing after hour one.Over 500 saves and 50 levels later, I've finally completed the game to where I deemed a satisfactory place to end my questing.  The game is, in a word, addicting.  But it's much more than that.  It's fun!  At first I didn't think repeating what would eventually boil down to the same damn quest over and over again would be anywhere near fun, but it is!  Bethesda's brilliance in developing this game was to make most of the quests similar, but many of them just different enough that you get a good laugh, a scare, or an intriguing plot twist that makes you want to continue on.Skyrim, as a place, is believable, vast, and has a wide variety of different locales that make it interesting just to wander around to see what one might find.  The best part about the game is about fifteen minutes in you can leave the main quest storyline and go do whatever the hell you want in this vast land for as long as you want.  The game does not have a shortage of quests and the more you explore the more you will undoubtedly find. You only need to return to the storyline if and when you want to.What's more, is that some of the \"bad\" aspects of the game are actually rather enjoyable.  One of which is the well worn out subject of Skyrim's infamous glitches.  My favorite, personally, was when I was a measly little runt of only a few levels, finding myself in need of some mammoth tusks for a quest.  I, at the time, didn't realize that they could be found elsewhere other than on mammoths.  So, what do I do?  Go and kill mammoths.  Or at least try to.  I failed miserably for a few hours.  I needed only one more!  I happened upon some mammoths with their giant companions and watched as one mammoth shot straight into the air.  Ten seconds later it came back down to earth and although there isn't much in the game that would prompt a mammoth to go sailing through the air in ANY direction, Bethesda apparently decided that if something went sailing through the air long enough, it, no matter what it was, would die.  Or perhaps the one where a horse and rider go flying through the sky ever Westward until my eyes could no longer see them.  The glitches could sometimes get annoying, but general bug fixes have the game working fine now.  Most of the time the glitches had to do with minor happenstance anyway.The only Achilles heel that I see for Skyrim is that yes, a lot of the quests are far too similar.  Plus, after a certain level, the game gets extraordinarily easy.  Although the game does try to keep up with your level by providing harder enemies as you, yourself, become harder to kill, it stops at a certain point.  What with the addictive nature of the quests, most players I've spoken to (including myself) reached a high enough level to surpass even the hardest of targets.However, despite this, the game can only be described as a pure tour de force for Bethesda and the Elder Scrolls series.  It is engaging, a great time killer, and beyond any shadow of a doubt, fun! Something to note, like the Final Fantasy series, the games can be played individually, so no need to get worried about that little \"V\" after \"Elder Scrolls\".Enjoy playing, and don't forget to consume food every so often.  Perhaps a sweet roll.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2012"}

Another glitch I encountered, was It would freeze a lot. The only way I could fix this was to turn off the internet connection for the PS3. Making sure it read \"Internet Disabled\". Another glitch, or I wasn't doing it right (which I doubt), was that when I hit the triumvirates I had to go over them again and again, just to get it to work.Glitches aside, this is one of the best games I've played on the PS3.If your PS3 has an internet connection you can download a demo of Conan for free and try it out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2008"}

Skylanders Spyro&#x2019;s adventure involves real life toys, which players will have to place on the Portal of Power to bring them into the game. The three toy characters that come in the starter pack are: Spyro, Gill Grunt and Trigger Happy. We have some information and some short clips where players can see all three characters in action.","reviewerName":"Noname","summary":"Fun, but the kids will want more characters","reviewText":"My kids have been all over Skylander's since the day we got it.  My son says it's a combination ofLego Star Wars: The Complete SagaandSuper Mario Galaxy Wii.  The starter pack comes with three figures that the players place on a wireless platform to activate in their Wii game.  While playing, the players can switch them out and the Wii just knows who just took their piece off and what that player's new character is.  Each one has different powers.Two players can play at a time.  When playing the mini-games, there has to be two players playing against each other.  I played against my son and though I'm not a huge video game addict like he is, I already feel a desire to have more characters than the three that the starter pack came with.  It just feels too limited that way.  There are 30+ figures available.  Be prepared to spend more money, and don't buy this if your kids are prone to losing their toys.  You can't play without the figures.Overall, a great game.  It's the only Wii game my son will play right now._________________________________________________________________________________________UPDATE (6/4/12): My son has collected nearly every character.  Every time he beats the game, he buys new characters and then goes back and plays it again with the new characters.  In the long run, he's spent a few hundred dollars, but maybe it's cheaper than beating the game and going out to buy a new game.  At any rate, it's a resounding thumbs up from him and his friends.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXX88","description":"","reviewerName":"Genryu","summary":"A great open world with a so-so campaign","reviewText":"I spent quite a number of hours in this game finishing up every mission, every optional mission, and getting most of the collectibles spread out across the island. My overall impression of this game is that it's a fun open-world game to go messing around in, but the campaign itself isn't where the fun is. Frankly I found the campaign to be pretty boring with uninspired missions compared to other games out today and previously in the last few years. It just wasn't the highlight of the game, but that's okay because wandering around on your own and doing your own thing is the best part.Finding different ways to take down the various outposts, many with secret entrances to sneak in or perches to attack from, is plenty of fun. Not to mention just driving around and getting randomly attacked by various wild-life is terrifying but incredibly fun. It's the dynamic nature of the game that keeps it interesting and from getting dull and routine. I remember going on a mission to stalk and hunt down a wild boar, and as I'm getting closer with my bow and arrow a jeep full of pirates came out of nowhere and scare it off. They get down and 1 of the guys spots me so I take him out with an arrow and run into the jungle for cover. I hear screams so I look back to see one of them being attacked by a komodo dragon that was upset by the jeep. The last pirate is trying to shoot it down, so I start pulling back on my bow to get him while he's distracted and then I get jumped from behind by a leopard. As I'm struggling to throw it off, I end up rolling down over by the waterbank and just as the leopard is about to go in for the kill a crocodile comes out of river and pulls the leopard in roaring. This is just one of the crazy encounters I've had, and there are plenty of others I can recount that probably top it too.It's for moments like this where you're just going around doing random side missions or running across pirates/wildlife/strangers that keep the game interesting. The collectibles are also quite fun to go hunting down, since they often require you to go somewhere dangerous, hidden, and genuinely different and unique. The bonus perks you get like special weapons for getting them is also nice too. The crafting system is simple but effective, and there are a decent variety of weapons and modifications for them to use. The island is quite large and filled with content, so you won't gun through it in a few hours by any means. But that's also where the downside comes in. The jeeps in my opinion don't handle all that well, and there are plenty of stretches of area or when you're in the jungle where you pretty much have to run to where you're going. This can definitely take some time in some stretches and is the only way to travel when it comes to going up some mountain sides where vehicles can't take you. They do offer hang-gliders to help get you around, but they still require you to go up top somewhere which takes time. Travelling can definitely be a pain sometimes, but then again all of the fun crazy encounters I've had all happened because I was on the ground on foot. So I can't be too upset about it.All in all, if you want a game that you can just mess around in and have fun, this is your kind of game. Don't take the campaign too seriously, because it's just not that great. But for everything else you're getting, I'd still say it's a solid purchase - especially at the prices that it's being sold for now.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2013"}
{"product_name":"B001D7T2VM","reviewerName":"Corey Turner \"The Musician\"","summary":"Darksiders Has Nostalgia Waiting to be Uncovered","reviewText":"I'll keep this short (no, no I can't). Darksiders is a multiplatform hack and slash title where you'll be taking on the role of War, one of the four horsemen.  Darksiders was released on the same day as a very different hack and slash game Bayonetta, though different much competition has ensued.Choosing the right title out of the two should be very easy, Darksiders reminisces on elements from many other games, from God of War to the Legend of Zelda series. Bayonetta is similar to a Devil May Cry game without the serious nature, and possibly better gameplay then the most recent Devil May Cry Title. I don't mean to dip between two games on this review, but again much debate is at foot here. So if you're purchasing this for a friend it's best to know what they lean toward more.Darksiders displays a colorful open ended world, even in post-apocalyptic times objects have some graphical glow. An issue with the games display, only on the Xbox 360 version, known as screen tearing has surfaced. Currently word of a patch/update is in the makes.As War you'll be seeking vengeance for being called to unleash damage early. The story picks up early on and drops off fast, trailing around the earth's wreckage doing deeds for demons doesn't add to the nature of the game, but it is none the less still enjoyable. War is a lucky guy; he can go on massacres with a large array of gear.Weapons obtained can be modified to make them even more deadly, techniques can be learned, and artifacts are only there to sweeten the death dealing even more. Hate to say it but many of these features are available in the beginning only to be ripped away and collected again later on. Locational objects from cars to tombstones should hold you over in destruction until then. No worries you get some cool new gear along the way, though it does become a bit tedious juggling through inventory, so stick with what you like and use the leftovers for puzzles.Yes puzzles, this is a hack and slash with progressively more intricate puzzles, no puzzle gets all too hard though. The puzzles and travel remind me a lot of Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (and does so to many other players apparently). Enemies are interesting, unique special elimination sequences insure the players interest remains focused on combat and enjoying new targets.The game isn't perfect, screen tearing isn't that troublesome, the game just can feel so drawn out at times. Never worry though; rewarding new gear and locations should hopefully pull players out of the rut. To speak truthfully here, I was expecting a much darker, more gothic game, but this will make do even with cheesy dialogue. Secondly, when starting up a game the first time, within five minutes I was thinking this was going to be a very bland and generic game. So thankfully this turned out to be decent, not a bore fest, just not as over the top as sale pitching critics make it seem.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2010"}

Posey","summary":"Deus Ex: HR - First Impressions","reviewText":"Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a game that I have been looking forward to for quite some time.  I was a fairly big fan of the original, and even though the second was hated by most PC gamers, I actually quite liked it.  Prior to it's release, you heard nothing but good things about the newest Deus Ex and one such story told that the PC version wasn't just a direct port.  With that in mind, I pre-ordered the game on Steam and began playing two nights ago.  After putting over 10 hours or so into the game, I feel that I can give an honest impression on how it's gone so far.  So, without further adieu, my thoughts on Deus Ex: Human Revolution.If you have played any of the previous Deus Ex games, you know what to expect.  There's a lot of heavily modified humans which gives them an almost superhero like powers along with big corporations and shadowy corporate agendas.  The game actually takes place about 25 years prior to the first Deus Ex, so the world is a little more chaotic.  Human modification with bionic arms and other such devices is a bit of a hot button issue.  On one side, you have scientists and corporations citing the life saving ability while on the other side you have purists who claim it's against human nature.  Throw in some socio-economic issues and the world is rife for chaos.You play as Adam Jensen, head of security for a company call Sarif Infustries.  This company is one of the forerunners in human mechanical augmentation and as a result suffers an attack on the eve of a big announcement the company was going to make.  In the scuffle, you are nearly killed only to be brought back with an insane amount of modifications.  From here on out, you are equipped to find out who called the hit in on your company (and as a result caused some personal strife for Adam) and bring those people to justice.As in other Deus Ex games, you are given a lot of choice in how you want to complete a mission.  Do you run through the front door guns blazing or do you sneak in through the back?  You can also play the social game and try to talk your way into places.  All are an option thanks to the mechanical augmentations you have built into your body.  Every level you will gain a point to put into these augmentations improving some and opening up others for the first time.  The way that the developers built this system is seamless.  You acquire the points at specific XP intervals as well as through buying them (although in limited supply) from stores.  Early in the game you may feel a little under powered, but thankfully you get points to place soon enough and the badassery begins.  Hacking was something I found I needed early on to complete some of the early side quests, so a little protip is to invest in 2 or 3 of hacking as soon as you can.  From there the choices are yours and they really are plentiful.  I always find myself anxiously looking forward to the next point I'm going to receive to try out a new power or improve upon one.  It's very addictive and you can see your character becoming better and better as time goes on.In Deus Ex, you can focus on Stealth or Gunplay or also a mixture of the two.  I'm going for the mixture.  I'm finding that stealth is amazing and really fun.  On the PC, holding the right mouse button sticks you to a wall in third person perspective giving you a wide view of the area.  I'll take people out in the shadows as much as I can, but I also carry some weapons for when things inevitably go hairy.  Stealth is so fun because of the tools that are given to you.  You can approach someone from behind and perfom a quick stun or kill move to silently remove the enemy from combat.  Be careful though, because if you only stun his buddies can wake him up and they will be alerted to your presence.  Pull the body aside to avoid this and hide it well, just like you would in a Metal Gear Solid game.Gunplay in DE:HR is nothing to scoff at either.  It can be just as fun running from cover to cover mowing down enemies with your weapons.  Weapon mods and augs that improve gunplay are a plenty so you can always tweak what you want to do or become.  The mix of stealth and gunplay has been a blast so far and I'm really enjoying it.The graphics in Deus Ex: HR are fantastic.  The world has a very golden glow to it which sort of reminds me of a Blade Runner type world.  There are some long load times between areas but they don't happen that often and I did find myself forgetting about the issue as time went on.  I played this game on the PC with max settings and it was amazing.  I haven't seen the console versions so I can't really speak to them.One thing I typically don't touch on in first impressions is music but in this case, I think I have to.  The music is hauntingly wonderful with a touch of despair.  When the action gets heavy, the music reacts and really blends into the background while at the same time being ever present in your mind.  The music reflects the mood and at times even caused some anxiety about what's around the corner.  They did a great job with the music and a soundtrack wouldn't be a bore to listen to.One final note about the game that really impressed me - the level of detail with the story.  Everywhere I go there are emails, PDAs, eBooks, etc. waiting to be picking up/hacked and read.  If you are a story nut like I am, you are going to have a field day.  The story is very throught out and doesn't treat you like a dumb consumer.  You will have no idea what some of the story items being referred to are at first, but remember them and it will pay out.Deus Ex: Human Revolution can easily be categorized as a candidate for Game of the Year.  Not many games pay so much attention to detail, show so much polish, and keep you as invested in the story as Deus Ex: Human Revolution has.  I'm looking forward to completing the game to find out exactly what's going on in this world and give the game another playthrough with a different loadout of augmentations.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2011"}

It rekindled my interest and I popped RCT2 in my cd-rom, installed it, and I was on my way.Once again, I couldn't help myself! I can't believe I almost forgot how unbelievably addicting this game is! It's basically like RCT1 expanded, but, if it ain't broke, why fix it? Designing coasters, rides, customizing paths, stalls, bathrooms, et cetera, are still the standard, of course. Of course, if that gets boring, you can drown guests, crash coasters, stick a little piece of pathway way off in the distance (not connecting to anything) and leave a poor, hapless guest to wander there forever and watch them grow madder and madder... it never gets old.One gripe, however: building coasters is not as easy as you might have guessed. There's a couple of things that could happen: the train might not make it up a hill (but if there's two trains going, at least you can watch 'em crash and explode), or it might get an intensity rating of \"Extreme\" or \"Ultra-Extreme\", which is basically a \"TO BE DEMOLISHED\" stamp on your coaster (no guest gets on coasters with those ratings).

As one of five distinct character types, players explore the world ofDiablo II, journey across distant lands, fight new villains, discover new treasures, and uncover ancient mysteries. Since the beginning of time, the forces of order and chaos have been engaged in an eternal struggle to decide the fate of all creation. That struggle has now come to the mortal realm, and neither man, demon, nor angel will be left unscathed. Diablo, lord of terror and youngest of the three prime evils, awakes from his long sleep beneath the dark earth. Setting in motion a grand scheme to free his exiled brothers, Mephisto and Baal, Diablo takes control of the small western kingdom of Khanduras. Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo grips the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia. Ultimately, as even Khanduras's good King Leoric falls under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arises to challenge the darkness that engulfs the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronts the lord of terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit can never be truly destroyed, the hero makes the noblest sacrifice of all--casting his soul and his very sanity aside, he takes the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will can contain the demon within. The hero doesn't realize that his selfless act will not only ensure Diablo's victory, but will also irrevocably damn his soul for all time.","reviewerName":"Jeffrey R. Tilley Jr. \"goatman_1\"","summary":"Fun at first, but fails to captivate.","reviewText":"First of all let me say that there is a large audience who loved the first Diablo and will undoubtedly love the sequal.  This review is targeted for the rest of you who may not have caught on to the craze or the hype.Like many long awaited sequals, Diablo 2 was destined to receive as much anti-hype as hype.  One of the biggest challenges Diablo 2 had to overcome was the treemendous anticipation and expectations that revolved around it.  I wasn't one of the fan's who were waiting with baited breath for the release, so I'll try to remain objective.One of the nicest things about Diablo was the cool CG scenes between chapters and at the beginning of the game.  The story was well thought out and after watching the first movie I was really hyped to play.  While not a facet of the overall game, they were impressive and worth mentioning.Another cool aspect of the game were the tons of weapons to choose from, especially with the barbarian who can use two weapons simultaneoulsy.  Unfortunately you can't leave things sitting on the ground like you could in the first Diablo.  gold and weapons go into your stash.  Once it's full anything you leave on the ground will disappear when you quit the game.Diablo 2 is entertaining, but failed to really captivate my attention to the very end.  I found the game to be unstable on my system which meets the minimum requirements, which was a constant annoyance.  It may not happen to you, but it was a contributing factor to my level of satisfaction with the game.One of my biggest complaints with the game is that it seems repetitious.  The hack and slash elements are fun, but RPG's have come a long way since the first Diablo was a hit several years ago.  There is little in the way of variety.  The same monsters are colored differently, given new names, made a little tougher and we're supposed to believe it's a new monster.  Eventually even the combat, the saving grace of the game, gets old after you wade through wave after wave of monsters that are far more irritating than threatening.The other big letdown is that they really haven't evolved the RPG aspect of the game since the first one.  Unlike other RPG's (which I'll get to in a moment) the hirelings and NPC's are static and almost worthless.  You can't interact with them, you can't change their weapons and all their really good for is taking some of the heat off your back until they are inevitably slaughtered.The game is far more interesting in multiplayer as long as your not trying to connect to battle.net.  If you're like me, however and are barely able to meet the game's minimum requirements and aren't priveleged enough to have a cable-modem, you might as well give it up.  The lag will drive you insane.All in all, Diablo 2 is a nice little distraction for a couple of days, but it is no t the best RPG or dungeon crawler on the market.  If you want a REAL RPG and not just a dungeon crawler, get one of the many fine Interplay games on the market.  Baldur's Gate 2 may be available by the time you're reading this, but you can already get Icewind Dale, Torment (which is fantastic), Baldur's Gate 1 and the expansion pack, and even the Fallout games, which may be dated but are far more entertaining than Diablo 2.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2000"}

Wario Land Advance) is an excellent example of innovative gameplay in a genre that has pretty much been left in the dust by current next generation consoles.  I love the 3D graphics and gameplay that the GameCube, PC, PS2, and XBox offer, but playing a 2D platformer brings me back to the days of frustratingly good fun that the original Super Mario games of the NES and Super NES era.  Sonic was great on Genesis too.  While these characters have made superb trasitions to the 3D realm in most cases, there is great gameplay still to be had in the 2D world of Wario Land 4.  The level design is truely creative and involves thinking to get through.  There were several instances where I was reminded of how I felt the first time I played through the 2D Mario games.  Specifically when I discovered a hidden room.  The game is very addictive. It can be beaten in a couple of days, but the time you will spend with it will be very good.  Wario is a great anti-mario.  He is not totally evil, just morally corrupt, and for this reason he is a great addition to Nintendo's unchallenged character library...  If you own a Game Boy Advance, don't pass this one up.  By the way. If you are thinking about buying a GBA, and are still deciding, get the SP.  I have owned both, and the GBA SP is well worth the additional money.

If you have little kids (or hamsters, etc.) around, you want to make sure they are away from this wheel when you boot things up - the motor is pretty powerful.The only \"tricky\" part to setting up the wheel is finding the right surface to mount it to, and yes, you really have to mount it to a solid surface (can't be used on your lap). There are 2 adjustable C clamps that have a maximum throat of about 1.25\", so I'm using a fairly sturdy wood coffee table, but it could be sturdier. If you use something that doesn't have a flat edge lip or is too flimsy, the wheel will work loose pretty quickly on you...You also need to consider the gas/brake peddle board - you have to find a table that doesn't have a cross-leg brace that's too close to the floor, or it will interfere with the peddle board operation.If you are handy at constructing things, you could make the ideal stand for this.

Dark Arisen offers a new island to explore that is difficult for those who haven't already delved into the game prior.Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen is an open world, 3rd person, action/rpg where players are given a variety of vocations, or classes, that offer different methods of fighting.-The three basic classes are Fighter, Strider (archer), and Mage.  The rest of the classes are either an expansion of the base class or a hybrid of the other classes; Warrior for Fighter, Ranger for Strider, and Sorcerer for Mage.  The hybrids are Assassin (Fighter/Strider), Mystic Knight (Fighter/Mage), and Magick Archer (Strider/Mage).  Each vocation is fun and offers varied play styles.- The player is always accompanied by a \"Pawn\", a side-kick NPC that can be given instructions and can change vocations as well, though they do not receive access to the hybrid classes.-The character creation is quite in depth with many, many options.  The pawns have the same amount of depth so you can craft your perfect pair.  The only thing I found annoying is the different voices are not really different.  It's the one actor/actress and the original recording is simply modified to be higher or lower and then called another \"voice\" option.  I consider this a big deal since the pawns talk... often.-The party can consist of up to 4, the player, their main pawn, and two additional pawns from other players.  Their pawn can also be enlisted by other players and will bring home items occasionally when they are utilized.-The story is very shallow and often quite obvious.  There are a few interesting twists, but overall someone looking for an in-depth, intelligent storyline should look elsewhere.  The writing is terrible and the main character is devoid of any life.-The actual game play is quite fun.  The action combat is what really makes this game shine.  Controls are responsive and using abilities is satisfying.-There are not \"invisible walls\" in the game; you can go anywhere you want from the onset.  However, if you're not high enough level, death will come often.-Because of the open world nature of the game, auto saves are few and far between.  Often mainly coming when the player enters/exits a building or city that requires a loading screen.  Also when sleeping.  Remember to save often as you can potentially lose hours of gameplay!-The visuals are nice, but certainly not top of the line.  They get the job done and I felt like the overall look fit with the theme and story well.-There are a lot of weapon and armor options that allow a unique look for each character as well as allowing for focusing on different abilities and resistances (such as higher poison resistance).Differences between original and the expansion:-Quicker load times - much quicker.-Easier \"fast travel\" via Ferrystones - it is much easier and cheaper to acquire Ferrystones now-New items, weapons, armor, skills, and monsters-Pawns, however, as are annoying as always!  (\"There may be treasure hidden about.\")Gameplay is 4/5 and the story is a 2/5.  If you want a great action game that you can get lost in for many hours, this is worth the purchase.  There is a new game plus that offers a degree of replayability, but with all vocations being available to the player, it's still limited as the story is not worth a second play through.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2013"}
{"product_name":"B002I0K3CK","description":"","reviewerName":"ChrisInCali","summary":"NEW? Super Mario Bros","reviewText":"New Super Mario Bros. U (NSMBU) is the fourteenth installment into the Super Mario series. Let that sink in for a moment. Fourteenth. There are eight other Mario Bros. games and three other \"New\" Super Mario Bros. games. With that many Mario games floating around on the market, one question begs to be asked: What hasn't been done? Is there anything \"New\" about New Super Mario Bros. U? What Nintendo has proven time and time again--with New Super Mario Bros., New Super Mario Bros. 2, New Super Mario Bros. Wii, and now NSMBU--is that they're not changing anything. The series stopped being \"New\" a long time ago.NSMBU sticks to the same exact gameplay as its predecessors. There is absolutely nothing different, barring little twists and themes thrown into each of the levels. You play as Mario, defeat enemies as you make your way towards the end of the level, and topple the Bowser flag to end the level. Rinse and repeat. And repeat. And repeat. However, this repetition is warranted and justified through the fresh level designs and polished nature of each of the stages. While some of them are utterly forgettable, others are engaging, fun, adrenaline-pumping, heart-pounding, blood-coursing stages of sheer, uh adrenaline!While that's wonderful and all, there is one serious error with that sort of setup: Nintendo has already done that before. For those of you who have played New Super Mario Bros. Wii, remember World 8-3? It did the exact same thing. Lava waves and all. What's the point of buying NSMBU if I can just go back to its predecessor on the Wii and play the same level? Granted, there are plenty of levels that are different and unique; nevertheless, the same concerns remain. With each level, there's always the feeling that I've done this before. No, not because I just died on that level. Rather, because I played Soda Jungle's Castle in its Wii incarnation. Rather, because I played 5-4 in New Super Mario Bros. Wii, I'm prepared for Peach's Castle's rising elevator. It's nothing new. There's absolutely nothing new about it. I've played it. You've likely played it. We've all seen it before. It's not new.Even the smaller parts of each level are similar. The little tricks and techniques are practically guessable by now. I've only discovered one truly new trick throughout my entire time playing NSMBU, and that was in Rock-Candy Mines first level: to get one of the star coins, I needed to have Yoshi eat an ice-ball, and spit it at some Piranha Plants that would then freeze and fall on the Piranha Plants below, allowing me to reach the star coin. Of course, this may just be new to me; I'm not an avid Mario Bros. player, so these stages may be even staler to more experienced gamers. Anyways, many of the intricacies in each of the stages are far too familiar for their own good. If I know what to expect, what to do when playing a level for the first time, I can't imagine how more experienced gamers feel.Knowing what to do usually wouldn't bother me, but, for NSMBU, it's worrisome. This is a game that prides itself on making you problem-solve, on making you think, on making you figure conundrums out. It's not supposed to be taking you to the intellectual doldrums. Ninety-five percent of star coins--basically larger coins that unlock extra levels post-game--can be easily obtained with some basic searching. Furthermore, a good fifty percent of all star coins can be found with a basic, non-comprehensive playthrough. What's the fun in that? I don't want to play NSMBU and breeze through each level. I want to die. I want to scratch my head. I want to have to pull off near-impossible feats. Because then I can feel as if I accomplished something--NSMBU feels like a warm-up before the actual challenge.Some ChangesYes, note the some. I didn't just leave it as just \"Changes,\" or put some stronger word like \"Revolutions\" or \"Overhauls.\" NSMBU offers one never-before-seen-power-up: the Super Acorn. The Super Acorn allows you to become Squirrel Mario/Luigi/Toad; while you're in squirrel form, you can basically glide around and shake to get a short vertical boost that mitigates your mobility. The Super Acorn is wonderfully implemented and all, but it's the only new power-up this time around. Sure, there are Glowing Baby Yoshis, Bubble Baby Yoshis, and Balloon Baby Yoshis, but they're very peripheral in their inclusion. Maybe one or two levels per world will actually include one variety of Yoshi. There are no multiplayer-centric worlds that require skillful use of each of the Yoshis, and there are no multiplayer-centric worlds that require skillful use of each of the power-ups. Moreover, many of the other changes are simply new level elements that are actually spins on older elements. The only truly impressive inclusion is the intricate World Map, though this does nothing but put fresh icing on an otherwise stale cake.Multiplayer WoesSingle-player gameplay is solid; it adds a few degrees of difficulty and forces you to work hard for your star coins and level clears. On top of that, using the GamePad gives you a nice, closer view of the stage. However, the aforementioned increased difficulty for a single-player is offset by a common multiplayer Mario Bros. problem--the stages are not meant for multiplayer. One part of a stage may require all four players to sit on a block one square wide for a short period of time; how can you do that with four players? You would need to have two players on the bottom and two players bouncing on top of them. That's frankly and utterly stupid. Whereas a single player would simply breeze right past that part, multiple players are going to have to finagle their way through there. The alternative is to simply \"bubble\" multiple players as a one or two of the players works their way through that particular precarious part. But, again I ask, what's the fun in that? Forcing other players to sit out while one player does the \"hard work\"--preposterous!The stages were not designed for multiple players. They were not designed for one player either. The developers of NSMBU try so hard to strike a delicate balance between being multiplayer-friendly and single-player possible. For the most part, they manage to do this well. But there are also many parts like the scenario I mentioned above: the multiple player setup simply does not work. Furthermore, if any one player is far less skilled than the others, he or she can end up dragging the whole group behind or end up getting left behind. On the opposite extreme, if one player is far more skilled than the others, he or she can end up leaving the rest of the group in the dust in their attempt to proceed. While this is mostly a group dynamic that should not detract from the game for most people, it's a consideration you have to make before you sit down and play with multiple people.Boost ModeWhen you play with multiple players, Boost Mode becomes available. Basically, you can--you can always switch this off--opt to have one player use the GamePad to \"assist\" the other players who are actually moving through the level. The player with the Gamepad gets an overall view of the stage, and can \"assist\" the other players by placing temporary blocks to help them reach other areas, by stunning or immobilizing enemies, by revealing hidden areas and power-ups, and by saving players when in peril. However, you may notice how I've been putting \"assist\" in quotation marks. Well, that's because Boost Mode isn't always giving a boost; even with the most experienced \"boosters,\" one can hurt more than they help. The blocks they place are like regular blocks in most cases: they can block pitfalls, help you reach new areas, but they can also obstruct your path. They can place blocks where you least need or want them. Sure, they can help you reach places you want to go, but they can also help you reach places you don't want to go--e.g., the lava below. An inexperienced player on Boost Mode can basically cripple the game. Boost Mode has its uses, but it also has some serious flaws.The Bright SpotsThe Glowing Baby Yoshis aren't the only bright aspects of NSMBU. Firstly, I do need to address the graphics and sounds of NSMBU; they are as crisp as ever. While the graphics certainly are not as impressive as they could've been, they work. They follow the game to a \"T.\" There are no problems; rather, there is just a bit of disappointment the game didn't try to do something more. Regardless, the graphics are as clear and fresh as ever, especially on the World Map. The music is also top-notch in most aspects; however, it's nothing you'd want to go out there and buy/download for your future listening pleasure.The graphics and sound are reflective of the overall game itself. NSMBU is Polished with a capital \"P.\" There are no glitches, no problems, no bugs, no coding errors, no \"bad\" levels, and no specks of dirt to be found everywhere. It's spotless. Speckless. Splochless. After releasing the same game over and over again, Nintendo has finally made an utterly punctual game with no major mistakes whatsoever. I cannot speak ill of the quality of this game; while it may have its core problems, the presentation is perfect.A Respectable PlatformerObviously Nintendo has done something right. Hell, there are fourteen games in this series. You don't become prolific like that overnight. However, with eight nearly identical platformers, there's little innovation to be attained. That needs to change. While there is nothing wrong with NSMBU on the surface, it has major problems with its staleness. It is far too similar to its predecessors. No, I'm not asking for New Super Mario Bros. to redefine itself. Is NSMBU a bad game? Certainly not. But is it a game that needs to get a freaking grip and realize that there are three games before it that do the exact same thing? Yes! The Mario Bros. series needs to realize that either (a) it needs to wow us consumers with some truly considerable expansion and level innovation, or (b) it needs to overhaul its multiplayer system and basic platforming premise. To be brutally honest, nothing sets NSMBU apart from its predecessors, so, if you have those predecessors, you need to think long and hard before you get this game. If you haven't picked up a Mario Bros. game for ten years, this is a great game to start with. Regardless, the game is still hindered by its super-polished status--no innovation whatsoever. If only New Super Mario Bros. U were as \"new\" as it touts itself to be.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2013"}

I've played through the first 8 chapters and I just really feel like it's an impostor. It's like Bend took the Uncharted formula and removed all the really, really cool stuff from it. The visuals are nice but definitely way less polished than certain other Vita games. When the developers say that they were improving the game's visuals until the final day of development, you know they could've done much more with the hardware if given time. None of the set pieces so far have been much more than bland and jungle-themed(no cool stuff like that abandoned sub in Uncharted 1 or the crashed plane in Uncharted 2). The gunplay is solid, it's just not all that fun. Easily the worst feature of the game is the fact that Bend for some reason seems to think that swiping and tapping on the screen is totally not out of place or frustrating and that it can replace good gameplay. Every few minutes you have to swipe three times just right on the screen to use your machete to cut through cloth, to melee fight, to help lift series newcomer Marisa Chase to higher ground or, worst of all, to try to save yourself from dying in quick-time events. Maybe if they were implemented better the awkward swiping and tapping would've totally fit, but it was NOT implemented well and it feels completely out of place.Also worth note: you can pay money for a launch date \"DLC pack\" that tells you where all the hidden treasure in the game is. This is the kind of stuff you can expect from the game experience, just a ton of bad decisions.I honestly don't see how the developers/publisher felt they could get away with charging $50 for this game. Apparently they wanted to see how much money they could get away with charging for a true triple-A experience on a handheld, but I have news for Sony: this is not triple-A quality. This is clearly an incomplete game with swiping used to replace actual innovation and polish and to pad out the experience. It's the only Vita game I have that I'll stop playing right after my first playthrough. I'm a Vita nut and I absolutely love the launch lineup, but this is easily the weakest link outside of the shovelware. I regret choosing this over Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom, and I HATE fighting games.Update: Completed the game a week or two ago, since I clearly haven't updated the review since it should be clear my opinion hasn't changed. It's much longer than I had expected and it definitely gets better... howwweverrrr in a few ways it also gets worse. There are two sequences in the game that require that you swipe the screen over and over and over again, it isn't fun at all and completely ruins what little flow hadn't already been destroyed by forcing swipes, balancing your Vita and tapping the screen previously. Uncharted: Golden Abyss is and always will be a flawed little monster, unless the swiping is patched out. I don't see that happening and if it did it'd be even more apparent that the game just didn't add anything to the Uncharted formula. Sure, tilting the system to line up headshots is the most accurate way to get headshots from my experience, even compared to mouse or Wii Remote aiming(I'm normally a PC gamer, I get headshots in Uncharted: GA way more often than in any Steam game I own) but the combat can get really frustrating for other reasons, like having to defend an AI partner who doesn't realize that if she just jumped off the freaking pipe she's on she'd be out of a sniper's sights and getting a few game overs because you didn't expect such stupidity out of Uncharted AI. Grr.Overall the production values are high and I love the new tilt-aim mechanics, but Uncharted: Golden Abyss has little to no immersion because of the gimmicky controls thrown into the mix. Uncharted: GA is not worth $50, I don't even think it's worth $30. Get it when it's $20 or less, it's just barely worth your time.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2012"}

Reduced my review from 3 to 2 stars.  I wanted to go through the game again to try to find more of the collectibles, but because I've already finished the plot collectibles the game wont have me pick them up again, which mean I simply get stuck where I'm standing unable to progress any further.  I then have to kill myself, reload, and it will sometimes, let me progress to the next collecable i can't pick up.  This happened in the first Chapter!Original review Below:The games not bad, and if i hadn't played the PS3 versions I would probably be nicer. That said, the game feels like a very expensive vita advertisement.  The story is OK, nothing special, but does the trick and keeps the game going forward.  The problem is all the writing and game play stuff feels like its simply implemented to make sure the Vita new Tech is being used.  The end result is a ton of mini games that make what I consider on the PS3 to be a nice mature game, to be dumbed down to quicktime events and little kid puzzles.The Good:*Graphics look really nice.*Voice acting is as good as always*The jumping/climbing fun that is expected is there.Bad:*Vita specific mini games that take you out of the game all the time.*Difficulty Spikes that feel like sloppy planning rather then a challenge.*No real boss fights, and the only two fights that exist are Quicktime events!!!*Rope climbing is designed to use the vita touch back screen but it's wonky, so they also put in normal button as well.  end result you just go up and down on the rope for a while.The Blah:*Puzzles: which are more like rub this or line this picture up so it looks nice. Not horrible for a few of them, but you do it for the whole game.  it gets a bit repetitive.* The story, if drake and Sulli weren't in the game, I wouldn't have cared for any of them.*The Camera during the climbing parts is stiff, where's the \"Oh S***\" parts that the PS3 counter parts have.Conclusion:because the Vita is currently lacking in games its worth it for about 20 or so.  I do want to conclude that it's fun to see what the Vita can physically do, i just wish it wasn't forced upon you, but rather the natural choice.  Heavy Rain a quicktime only game feels right because each action that you do seems like a form of what the characters are actual doing on screen, but these quicktime events feel more like 'look what the vita can do,' rather then having any real purpose.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2013"}

Does it measure up?The story begins in ancient times - a peaceful civilization is wracked by a disaster (a giant eruption of volcanoes). The survivors split into two groups: the peaceful and knowledgable Asylians in the bountiful mountains, and the technological Mokai on the desolate plains. The Mokai attack the Asylians, hoping to take some of their food so their people don't starve to death. After a few battles, it is the hope of both sides that they can come to an agreement, but the Diviner, the spiritual leader of the Asylians, wishes to continue the conflict. Almost from the get-go, Lair has a hamhanded approach to the story - even before the religious leader is shown to be aggressive and bloodthirsty (which occurs pretty early on) the characters make blatant, out-of-character anti-religious statements. The story has some convoluted twists - the assassination of the peace-wanting leaders of each nation in the same meeting by an open agent of the zealotous religious leader leads each side to believe that the other was responsible, despite the fact that a member of each side witnessed the meeting and survived (but, for whatever reason, didn't tell anyone). The story is basically there to justify \"red army fights blue army\".The gameplay is probably the worst part of the game. The dragon you ride can breathe fire (either as a stream or as individual blasts) and is \"steered\" using the motion sensor. However, the controls do not handle particularly well and tend to be overly sensitive - or not enough. The flight is awkward, and the lock-on system only works if the enemy is a short distance directly in front of you (thus making it annoying and useless in a dogfight). Specialized combat sequences include mid-air melees (involving proper button input at close range and a side-swipe subgame when you get close to enemy dragons) and ground attacks (either strafing from the air or landing on the ground and wading into the battle). The controls on almost all of these are clunky and ineffectual, making combat and flight frustrating beyond the limits of fun.The graphics are a mixed bag: on the one hand, the designs and style are fantastic (viewable through unlockable concept art, most of which is only barely noticaeble in the game such as soldiers' armor), but on the other hand the overuse of lighting and bloom makes the backgrounds almost impossible to see most of the time. Sure, it's great when you have fantastic vistas, architecture, and costumes (all with a vague hint of a \"Shadow of the Colossus\" style), but the combination of the over-exposure to light and the awkward, jerky controls means that nobody will be able to enjoy them. As mentioned, there is a concept art gallery, and the game might be worth playing through just to unlock all of it. In-game, however, it doesn't really seem to matter.The sound is good, but has such a feeling of being overdone in almost every single way;  the music and voice acting both seem so awkwardly familiar, with the same tones and the same musical style as seen in so many other games. It's not bad, but it's just incredibly familiar sounding - in a bad way.As a whole, this game has one thing going for it: the art. That might be enough in some areas, but since this is supposed to be a game, not a gallery, it doesn't seem particularly forgivable.This game gets a 4/10.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2008"}

Mullins","summary":"A mash up between Modern Warfare and Halo.","reviewText":"I have never played the first Crysis, though I'd read wonderful things about it. I had played Far Cry and I had heard the open gameplay compared to Crysis. So I was excited to see that Crysis 2 was going to be released on consoles and I'd get a chance to play it. When I finally did I can't say I was thrilled. The game is a very solid FPS and the graphics are fantastic. The level design is also good and the weapon selection is great. They managed to give all the weapons a distinct feel. But all of that just makes a good solid shooter, not a fantastic one.Crysis 2 feels to me as a mash between Modern Warfare and Halo. It has the large set piece moments and very linear path to follow like Modern Warfare. And you spend time as a super soldier killing aliens like Halo. What is lacks is the good story elements of either of those games. Since this was the first Crysis released on consoles they should have expected plenty of first time players. The game assumes the player must have played the first game because the story starts in the middle and makes no sense. I spent the game shooting bad guys and had no idea what was going on. Nor did I even care. The time when a shooter could just be about shooting has passed. In this day of blockbuster video games with massive budgets story, plot and game flow can't be neglected anymore. No matter how solid the game play or how beautiful the graphics the game is no fun if you have no connection with the story or character. The whole game left me bored and I had no interest in playing through it again, nor really finishing it the first time.If you do want to play through it, and again it is a solid shooter, I recommend you spend some time on Wikipedia catching up on the story at least. For such an acclaimed game franchise and studio I expected more from Crysis 2.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2011"}

If you're comnig from RE5 first thing you'll say is WTH is this crap. Yeah, RE5 was the last RE game I played. The character models of the bosses just don't match up. The few cutscenes are nice to look at but then switches back to gameplay it looks like a PS2 game. Good thing it doesn't last no more than 4 hours. It plays like a Socom game/look (slant six) Story? it's nothing hard to understand, basically you are hired men that has to do what the guy on the radio tells you and destroy all the Umbrella evidence before Clair/leon comes rolling in town(resident evil 2 remember) and that's pretty much all you're doing the whole game. Gameplay? after the first mission or 2 you finally get a wave of zombies to shoot in which that's why everyone pretty much got this game to go zombie killing but sadly they aren't a challenge that much, they also have a force team that jumps in and out of the game that shoots at you to try make the game challenging because the zombies are just easy kills but it slows the game down when you have to stop take cover and waste 200 bullets on a wave of bad guys, borrrring. This game is missing all the main RE stars, like wesker, jill,chris,cheesy lines. This should of been a 39.99 download game only but they knew everyone thought this was going to be the zombie game everyone's been waiting on so they went with a 59.99 pricetag. I'm sure within a year you could get this game for 29.99.

Dead Space fans should be thrilled. I thought I'd be used to some of the scares and Dead Space 2 wouldn't initially be as effective as the first time I played the original. But I was already crying for my mommy even in Chapter 1.It looks like now you only know that the chapters are changing when you see it in your game save. You'll recall in the first game that each chapter ended with a tram ride, so there was never any question as to when a chapter ended and a new one began. In Dead Space 2 there's clearly been a change to that system. Maybe it spells out chapter changes on the screen or something, and I'm just too busy looking over my back for necromorphs to notice. But as of the first few chapters it looks like the chapters just change without any blatant notice.Everything in Dead Space 2 screams terror, and everything is presented (once again) terrifically! You're Isaac Clark and you've woken up on some space station or something and you have no idea how you got there. There's good news and bad news. The bad is that this space station or whatever it is seems to have been made home to a breed of creature that Isaac had recently been made familiar with in the last Dead Space; the good news is that at least you're somewhat familiar about how to deal with this issue...and in the first few moments of the game you are rudely reintroduced to some old friends.The creatures in Dead Space 2 are familiar and scary. When they're not scary they're disturbing. When they're not disturbing they're viciously ruthless, and there are some new ones to look out for. The background sounds are again creepy and send chills down your spine. The background music is orchestrated precisely, and it builds you right up to a heart attack when the action starts. The graphics are great and the environmental layout and surroundings  are super realistic.Your initial protection as third person Isaac Clark is lame, so you need to find a suit, weapons and ammo fast. But the melee controls are a lot better than the first game. I've already noticed a huge improvement on the dynamic of using Kinesis as a way to pick things up and launch them at attackers. The game is clearly leaving more items laying around for you do exactly that. Just like in the first game you upgrade your weapons as you progress through the game and you wear an upgradeable suit that shows your health via illuminated LED lights on the spine of the suit. (The Zealot Suit that came with the Collector's Edition is very cool.) You again have a holographic HUD that you can bring up at any time to show your inventory & objectives. And there again are save stations throughout the game positioned almost everywhere you start hoping for one.Dead Space 2 is just awesome! And to top it off if you're new to the franchise, you can pick up Dead Spacereally cheap at Amazonand play that first which I'd highly recommend, but it's certainly not necessary.Just a few quick words about the Collector's Edition. Here's what was in the box: Game w/Extraction included, Online Pass code for \"Online Features and Zealot Suit\" (haven't tried online yet and might not even bother), Plasma Gun Replica, soundtrack CD and a Necromorph postcard.Sick. Game. Again! Did you like the movieAliens? Do you like to be scared? Add this to your cart, but prepared for an adventure that's perhaps more intense than any movie you've ever watched or any game that you've ever played...except for maybe Dead Space 1.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2011"}

In 1990 this was THE game to get! It had the biggest selling release of all time until 1999 when the more than disappointing FFVIII came around.I'm not reviewing the NES one but rather the SNES one since that's the one we're going to get obviously! This is the best Mario game ever made! The only one that could possibly be better than this is probably Super Mario RPG on the SNES.I'll admit I was disappointed when Nintendo re-released Super Mario Brothers 2 and then they SKIPPED THE BEST MARIO GAME and came out with a re-release of Super Mario World and then Super Mario World 2.  I couldn't believe my eyes when I heard thatt they skipped this one!The reason why this is the greatest Mario game is because this focuses on EXACTLY what a game should focus on (Back 13 years ago especially) and that is gameplay! These days gameplay is what games tend to lack. They get tediously long (making you never want to go through it all again) and are much too focused on storyline that they forget what keeps people coming back to the game and that's gameplay.Graphically this was by far the best looking NES game in those days and on the SNES it was just so much better looking.  However, I can't say the same for the music. I LOVED the music on the NES version but in the SNES version the music got worse. Sadly because of the GBA it WILL be worse on the GBA (Super Mario Brothers 2 had worse music as well in it's re-releases).The controls scheme of course is top notch and easy to do as it is in most Mario games. If you're like me you were without a doubt a little displeased with Super Mario Sunshine.  But this game will make up for that.However, I still don't like that once again we're getting a RE-release of a classic game for the GBA. When are we going to get a NEW Mario game on the gameboy advance? We've been waiting FOREVER!Still, when this game is released remember the old NES days and the SNES days and you'll KNOW why this is the best Mario game of all time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00007JZB3","description":"TRON 2.0is an action-packed story-driven title inspired byTRON, the groundbreaking science-fiction motion picture. The game takes place in present day, approximately 20 years after the events of the film. Playing as Jet Bradley, son of ENCOM programmer Alan Bradley from the movie, gamers are digitized into cyberspace and will race on light cycles, battle corruption both inside and outside of the computer world, and explore locations including the Internet Hub, Firewall, Corrupted Server and Light Cycle Game Grid.","reviewerName":"Rich Stoehr \"Idle Rich\"","summary":"Thoroughly Modern Retro","reviewText":"\"Greetings, Program.\"Remember those days, when the original movie \"Tron\" came out? It was like seeing your fantasy there on the screen, a computer user transported into the world of the computer, seeing what it's like to play games from the inside. Back then, it was a distant futuristic vision to think along these lines. These days, as games have become more and more realistic, that faraway vision has gotten ever closer. \"Tron 2.0\" is, in some ways, the realization of it: a video game in which you play someone (once again) trapped in the digital world, playing games.In this sense, \"Tron 2.0\" completes the circle begun by the movie over 20 years ago.  It also takes the concept of \"Tron\" and brings it into the modern world, incorporating technology and terminology we use today into the overall idea. The metaphor continues to work very well for the game, as your character's advancement is gained through build points and version upgrades, special abilities can be attained in the form of subroutines, which can be installed or disabled from your program memory, and healing is gained from patch routines. At some points in the game, you may have to defragment, disinfect, or port some of your subroutines using procedurals within your program. Some of the environments you'll be travelling through include a PDA, a laptop, the Net, a router, and of course the Game Grids.Despite the updated framework, the original \"Tron\" is still clearly here. Your characters staple weapon is the Identity Disc, which can be upgraded and will be the weapon you have with you throughout the game. The look and feel of the game just screams \"Tron\" like nothing else, with the same clean lines and glowing environments that characterized the original film so perfectly. Recognizers, tanks, and Bits all make their appearances through the game. There are many references back to \"Tron,\" both direct and indirect, as the story progresses. And we mustn't forget the lightcycles, which are incorporated into the single-player story, as well as being playable in standalone form both on- and off-line. Frankly, the lightcycles alone are worth the cost of the game...more on that shortly.In terms of the technical stuff, \"Tron 2.0\" holds up quite well. The graphics are gorgeous. They meet and occasionally exceed the standard set by the film, and really allow the user to involve themselves in the story without interference. In one memorable level, one of the most vertiginous moments I've ever had in a game, the graphics go a long way to conveying the impression of height and distance and speed. The sound is excellent, particularly the effects and music, both of which work well throughout the game. The voice acting is excellent as well. The stability of the game is fairly good.  I experienced a few sudden crashes in key moments on my Windows 2000 machine, but for the most part I didn't have problems.The single-player story should sound fairly familiar. Jet Bradley, son of Alan Bradley from the original \"Tron,\" is brought into the digital world and must find his way out. In doing so he discovers a conspiracy to not only take over his father's company and their sought-after digitizing software, but taking over computer networks all over the world. As you play through you'll learn more about Jet and what's happened to Alan since the events of the film, as well as uncovering more and more of the plans of your enemies. It leads up to an ending which was a bit unsatisfying to me. In this game, getting there is definitely most of the fun.The multiplayer levels offer some good variety. You can participate in Disc Arena and Tournament play, which allows you to compete on some updated game grids using only your disc and your agility to defeat your opponents. There is also a Derez match, often called \"deathmatch\" levels for other games, in which you have a fuller arsenal to choose from and more room to fight in. And, of course, there's the lightcycle levels, which allow you to pit your skills on the lightcycle grids against other riders around the world. Now that I've finished the single-player game, I find myself spending a great deal of time racing other riders in my super ligthcycle, seeing who can run rings around who. It's completely addictive and I love it.\"Tron 2.0\" is great fun. Perfect for those who saw the film in the eighties and have always wanted to re-live it from within, but also just a good game for any gamer.  Fairly light, not easy but not too difficult, and playable by just about anyone. It has lots of replay value and should be enjoyed by kids of all ages. Drop yourself into the digital world for a while and give it shot.\"End of line.\"","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2005"}

Plus the movies and music via the Playstation Store, Netflix, etc. Other reviewers already talked about how great the Vita is, let me point out other aspects of the Vita.-Memory : People complain that the memory cards are expense. Yes it is. But Apple charges $100 more if want to step up from 16GB to 32GB iPad. Besides, Vita bundles include 8GB memory cards(which is what most people need anyway), also the price of 32GB Vita memory card is coming down.-Price : Some people say the Vita is a bit expensive. But think about all the cutting edge technology in the Vita with OLED screen and Quad Core processor just to mention a few. A similar smart phone or iPhone would be $500 to $700 if you got it without a contract from major wireless carriers. If you get a smartphone with service contract, you spend hundreds of dollars over a year.-Real games : People say portable gaming consoles are dying because of smart phones and tablets. You can't really play games on these devices with touch screens and gyro sensors, you need controllers like the Vita to really play the games unless you want to play only Angry Birds.-Fast web browser : By the way, did you know the Vita has a web browser? It is much better than the PSP's broswer which used to be slow and ran out of memory. The Vita's browser is faster(thanks to fast processor) and plenty of memory, it really is a usable web browser.-Great selection of movies, music, content : Besides gaming, the Vita has old and latest movies and TV shows (to buy and rent) and any music you want to listen. Music Unlimited is surprising good, you can listen to any music, old and new, for $10 a month.I really enjoy using the Vita, I highly recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2012"}
{"product_name":"B001UWGBC8","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Good times with quite a few major flaws","reviewText":"Ultimate Alliance 2 is almost exactly what its expected to be. A 3D brawler featuring a panoply of Marvel heroes from all stripes, playing through the major plot arc of the decade, that being the development of the Superhuman Registration Laws. Your characters level through a combination of fights and locating boxes containing the mystical XP orbs. Surprisingly, also included is a variety of dialogue options that would've been reminiscent of Mass Effect for their variety if not for the fact that you have maybe two dialogue choices per stage.Graphics are surprisingly bad. While a majority of the problem can be corrected by ramping up the gamma, a large part of the difficulty of play is due to some of the enemies looking like some of your players, making it easy to lose track of your characters in the swirling melee. Aside from, its the usual adulation of crisp, beautiful backgrounds and convincing explosion and fire effects. The only real sad point is the fact that they couldn't come up with effective walls, meaning that you'll try flying over a open canal to look for goodies only to run smack into the wall of we were too lazy to add this part of the stage.Audio also is surprisingly bad. While the character voices are really very good, and most of the dialogue is above average, you can only tell this when you can actually hear what the characters are saying. Muffled voices and overlapping background and music makes it difficult to hear half of whats being said without ramping the volume up high enough to make geysers of blood fountain from your head, and subtitles are only for crucial cutscene speeches, and aren't present in the pickup audio files, which are more entertaining.Gameplay is rather hit and miss. While the brawler mantra is followed well, and you wade through enemies like a farmer scything through wheat, some of the cooler effects, namely the fusion attacks, can be awful, as the tutorial to help massage through the various abilities glosses over this section, and trial and error makes you feel like an idiot.Despite butchering some of the core fundamentals, this game is fun. Dialogue entertaining, storyline solid, characters endearing, side quests and finding missions challenging without being annoying. Better camera controls, maybe a reduction in scope so you didn't feel like you were watching ants, and some better delivery of dialogue, and this would've been four stars going on 5. And they can't easily use the excuse that its too hard, as Batman managed it with style to spare.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2009"}

It isn't great, but it isn't bad either.In the game you play as Adam Jensen, a security guard for a biotech firm who's body is augmented after a devestating attack on the company he works for.  With the new augs Adam is super human and launches an investigation into the whereabouts of the attackers.  The story is interesting, if not a little bloated and confusing.  It isn't as strong as the story in some RPGs, but it does a decent job of driving the game forward.  There are a lot of characters you will meet and sometimes it can be hard to keep tabs on all the names of everyone involved.  A lot of important events are described in ambigous terms leaving out the nitty gritty details.  The motivations of central characters aren't clear and when you try to dig deeper characters will reply with, \"Isn't it obvious?\" which isn't an answer.  If you're playing this for the story, you may be let down.The gameplay is like Rainbow Six Vegas meets Metal Gear Solid with some Mass Effect on the side.  Like R6 Vegas, you play from a first person perspective, although when you take cover using the LT, you'll see yourself in third person.  Like MGS, stealth is strongly encouraged, as 90% of the time you're out manned and out gunned.  Like ME, you earn experience and can upgrade your character and weapons in various ways, and you can choose your dialogue in a similar fashion as well.  As RPGs go, it's about as deep as Mass Effect 2.  Since most of the time you'll be playing from a first person view, this will largely feel like a First Person Shooter, but you'll soon realize that it is not.  The controls are sluggish compaired to other FPS games, and you'll want to turn up the sensitivity in the options menu just to be competent.  Aiming can be difficult compaired to most FPS games, and you'll want to choose your shots wisely as ammo is scarce.  Since the direct approach is usually suicide, you'll spend most of your time looking for air duct vents and ladders and passcodes and computers to hack.  This is a slow paced game, and trying to play it like Call of Duty will result in death.  The game is not an open world like Fallout 3, but rather the cities you visit act as a hub for the levels you must complete.  The city is not too big, you can walk end to end in less than 2 minutes, but it's just big enough to feel like a city.  The levels are pretty linar and your objectives are mostly reaching the next checkpoint in the stage.  Each stage can take between 10 minutes to an hour or more depending on your approach.  During a stage where I infiltrated a police station, it took nearly 3 hours to complete as I tried to sneak around and avoid firefights because I didn't feel right killing cops.  In the end, discounting my many, many deaths and subsequent reloads, the game took about 9 hours to complete.  In fairness to the game, I didn't really tackle any side quests, so completionists will get more out of this than I did.The graphics are mostly good.  The art direction is fantastic, and the artists created a compelling and beautiful futuristic world.  The style and setting are actually what drew me to this game and they don't dissapoint.  The graphics engine this game is running on is another story.  Some of the character's faces look odd and animations can look weird, especially during conversation.  The textures are sharp and lighting effects are good, and most outdoor areas are eyecatching.  Interiors, however, can get bland quickly.  Also, FMV is used between stages (I assume to hide loading screens), but the FMV uses in game assets and is too dark and looks to be low rez.  The in game graphics look better than the FMV, and I just don't understand why they didn't just use the in game graphics for cut scenes instead.  On a positive note, the game runs smoothly at 30 frames per second with out any screen tearing or hiccups.  On a side note, this game is very dark and I recommend turning up the Luminosity a few notches in the options menu.The sound is another mixed bad.  The voice acting is okay, none of it sounds corny or over the top.  The music is great.  Much like the art direction, the music sets the mood and atmosphere for this game and is easily one of it's strongest assets.  The sound effects are good, although gunshots are about 100X louder than everything else in the game.  The voicework does suffer from compression issues, however.  All of the dialogue sounds like it is in some low bit audio format compressed to hell.  I only noticed it because audio in games today is so good that when I heard the voice audio in this game it reminded me of the PlayStation one.  Music and sound effects do not suffer the same problem.Deus Ex isn't a bad game.  There was a lot I liked about it.  The characters are interesting, especially the protagonist, the setting is really cool, the music is fantastic, and the blending of generes was bold.  Deus Ex isn't a great game, either.  There was a lot that frustrated me.  I died frequently.  The loading screens are painfully long (30 seconds or more), and you have to suffer through them every time you die.  Even on the easiest setting this game is brutally hard.  I'm no stranger to difficult games, I've completed most of the games I own on the hardest setting, yet still I found Deus Ex to be extremely challenging even on easy.  The game tells you there are multiple paths, but the truth is there are two paths: 1. Go into every room guns blazing and hope for the best (suicide), and 2. search high and low in every room for hours until you find that one crate that's been blocking that hidden vent you're suppsed to use to sneak around the enemies.  Speaking of sneaking, when there aren't vents (or you can't find them), you can try studying the patrol patterns of enemies and sneaking around them.  The problem is that most rooms have 6 to 10 enemies all patrolling around eachother, meaning that even if you wait and watch for when 8 of them turn their backs for that split second, 2 of them are still watching you.  In addition, enemies have super senses, and can see and hear you from a mile away, even if they just catch a glimpse of your hair.  I have mastered sneaking in other stealth games like Splinter Cell and Metal Gear, but I found successfully sneaking in Deus Ex to be nearly impossible.  In later levels you'll have to disable tanks to procede, and without EMP grenades you're pretty much screwed.  Lastly, although it is extremely difficult, you can avoid combat altogether throughout the entire game, EXCEPT for boss fights.  You MUST confront and defeat all bosses in combat.  If you don't level your character up for combat scenarios, you may find yourself critically out matched.Leading up to the release of this game, I had a lot of high hopes, perhaps too high.  Unfortunately Deus Ex doesn't live up to most of them.  The frustrations of combat and level navigation marred the features I did like, like the music, art direction, setting, and characters.  Deus Ex is supposed to be a Stealth Action RPG, but at it's heart it felt like an FPS that's not as fun as other FPS games, and a Stealth game that's not as good as other Stealth games, and an RPG that's not as deep as other RPG games.  I would recommend this as a weekend rental.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2011"}

The first sequel to the original Deus Ex, Deus Ex: Invisible War, wasn't the sequel most fans had hoped for. When it launched at the end of 2003, it was rated highly by reviewers, however it wasn't by fans of the franchise, and mostly for good reason. Granted, Deus Ex: Invisible War wasn't a poor game, as it was completely competent and solid, but it just wasn't a good sequel to one of the best games ever made. Like the innovative and incredible Deus Ex, Deus Ex: Human Revolution isn't without its flaws, but it's a sequel that not only lives up to the Deus Ex name, it even surpasses it in some areas. This is the true sequel (or prequel, I guess) to Deus Ex that you've been waiting for. Don't even bother reading the rest of this review, pick your platform of choice and click \"Add to Cart\" ASAP.Pros:- Deus Ex Done Right - Unlike the previous sequel, Deus Ex: Human Revolution doesn't \"consolize\" the Deus Ex formula; this, my friends, is a true sequel that's packed with challenging gameplay, a great inventory system, unlocks/augments, side missions, etc. This is the role-playing masterpiece that you've been craving.- Beautifully Detailed Hub Worlds - There are 2 hub worlds in total in this game, both offering their own unique atmosphere. These hubs are huge and offer a lot to see and do. Not only can you push through the main story missions, you have tons of things to hack into, side missions to take on, civilians to talk to, and so much more.- Atmospheric Masterpiece - Thanks to wonderful game design, incredibly detailed visuals, and amazing sound design, Deus Ex: Human Revolution's atmosphere is nothing short of breathtaking.- Role-Playing Delight - Deep systems, which keep track of your choices, can have an overall impact on the immediate and long-term narrative. Every choice you make matters. If you mess up during a conversation, you may either fail to complete a side mission or have to try to achieve it another way. Along with these components, you have an inventory system and weapon augments, the latter of which serves as your upgrades throughout the course of the game.- Tons of Replay Value - You won't see and do everything the first time through. This is a game packed with choices, both in terms of how you tackle a mission and how you react in conversations, which makes things much different depending on how you play. You could play this through differently a good many times before you see everything it has to offer.- Polished Gameplay - While Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a first-person game, it also switches to third-person when you take cover, and it features a system that allows you to easily traverse around environments when in cover. To move around a corner, you just hold in A, and to transfer from one piece of cover to another, you just tap A. It all works well and it's satisfying.- Cinematic Bliss - Deus Ex: Human Revolution has the cutscenes, in-game graphical effects, stellar sound design and more, to make this an unforgettable experience.Cons:- Dated Animations - As wonderful as the graphics are overall, the animations certainly aren't cutting edge; however, they do get the job done.- Slight Frame-rate Dips - During larger encounters and in big hub worlds, you may encounter a very minor dip in performance here and there.Deus Ex: Human Revolution had some very big shoes to fill. Not only did it have the pressure of hype because of the amazing trailers Square Enix and Eidos put out, but they had to live up to one of the most beloved games ever. After being disappointed already, I don't think Deus Ex fans would've been so kind if another sequel failed to meet their expectations. Luckily, I'm here to report that this game will go down in history as one of the absolute finest out there. If you want a meaty single player experience that offers something truly unforgettable, you better get yourself a copy right now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2011"}

The 3DS seems like a perfect home for the sequel so Nintendo went for it. You play as Luigi who is tasked with dispersing a small town of ghosts with the help of Professor E. Gadd. You take your Poltergust 5000 and suck and blow anything in your path. Be it cloth on walls, rugs, pulleys, or using your other powers to reveal hidden objects or even your flashlight to help battle ghosts. There&#8217;s quite a few elements in play here and they are done fairly well. Ghosts don&#8217;t just stand around and let you suck them up. Some are protected by objects or are inside other objects and require coaxing out in various ways. This with the inclusion of puzzles makes Luigi&#8217;s Mansion a fun trip.It isn&#8217;t without its problems and there are more than meets the eye like most recent Nintendo games. Sure the game looks great and plays well but it gets repetitive half-way through and gets frustrating. You&#8217;d expect tougher ghosts to come into play at some point, but instead you get the same ghosts with bigger life bars and more thrown at you. As you progress you find cash throughout the game to upgrade your equipment so this isn&#8217;t a problem. I was nearly maxed out towards the end of the game. The issue is redundancy and constantly revisiting the same areas just to fight different ghosts. Some puzzles are hard to figure out and some require insistent backtracking that gets very dull. The game had the Mario charm thrown in, but I expected more variety. After the third area you really start getting tired of the game, but that doesn&#8217;t mean its terrible.There are some hidden items in each area and they aren&#8217;t too hard to find if you explore every little area. These range from gems to cash to a hidden Boo in each level. It feels less like a collectathon and more like exploring an area. The objectives are clear and your map is useful. With that said, many objectives are also repeated throughout like chasing down a ghost dog to find a key and getting back parts from various ghosts. It just got old and I just kept telling myself, &#8220;Not this again!&#8221;Dark Moon is one of the best looking 3DS games out there. The game has high-resolution textures, great looking models, and some impressive lighting effects and physics. I almost felt like I was playing the Wii U. The 3D effects are nice, but don&#8217;t add anything to the gameplay. I loved the attention to detail from Luigi&#8217;s voice to his animations. The game has great production values but could have used a better variety of gameplay elements.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2014"}

You pick up power-ups that can be shot at your opponents as you lap 6 different courses, trying to hit the finish line first while not falling off the sides.  Fighting has you &amp; your opponents perched on a platform, trying to push each other off with the aid of power-ups.

Daneker","summary":"Part 1 is classic, Part 2 is clunky.","reviewText":"Update: I would like to thank the fanboys who say my review is not helpful simply because I said something negative about the game, even though I said it honestly and constructively. Of course reviews are only written to express love for something.I know a lot of people just swoon over GOW I & II like girls over boy-bands, but let me tell you it's not that amazing. I picked this up first for the PS2, both games, used for under $20 and played about half of the first game, but even in wide-screen mode it was hard to play the blurry 480p graphics on my 42\" screen. When this update was announced and IGN praised the graphics (especially GOWII as the first one has horrible cut-scenes that look far inferior to the actual game)I decided the price was too good and with three coming out it seemed like the perfect time to put these two games to rest.Part one goes by fairly painlessly. The main issue I had where the clunky swimming controls. However, overall it's a fun game, lots of puzzles, exploration and excellent battles to be won. The game does deteriorate slightly near the end as the constant need to press the right button at the right moment as they flash on the screen becomes the most important thing in the game -- this substituting for the brilliantly complex way say Link or Samus would have to kill a boss, is a cop-out in design and damned pointless.The second game get's hairy. This time around fighting is an afterthought, the God of War is of course dragged down and turned mortal again (so we can have a sequel)immediately making the game feel unworthy and more like a cheap attempt to capitalize on the first. But he doesn't really have to fight, most of the game is spent doing the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and ... until you GET IT RIGHT. At the moment of writing this review I am facing down an impossible task, pull a lever, lower a door, run to a vent, double jump, fly to roof and coast over door before it slams shut ... yeah, right. You have to literally be running back to that vent before the game camera pans away from that door.(the real flaw here is logic, this guy breaks down huge stone walls, he can't chip a piece off, jam the lever open and just casually climb over???) There is NOT ONE SECOND of room for error and that defines this game, do it, do it again, keep doing it until it's perfect. Most of the hard puzzles could be solved by jamming a stone in a lever or tying something off with a bit of rope -- the logic here defies reason, why on earth do all these complex tasks when simple solutions are present but the game-makers render unavailable, before asking the player to do something really annoying you have to kill off all other logical options. If this was the first game, I'd never finish it, never play a sequel, I'm learning to hate it. There's not a few areas in this game like this, IT'S THE ENTIRE GAME. Every time I turn it on it's \"how many hours of the same screen/task today? This entire game is designed around how fast and perfect you can press buttons. It gets very frustrating as you double jump from swinging grapple to grapple and as you pound the R1 button to grab the next grapple he grabs the last one again instead, when double jump doesn't register and you fall like a stone and have to start an area over. It's not the challenge, it's the fact that the game relies on both controller and player to be PERFECT task after task there's no room and that brings the game down.I hope GOWIII is more like one and not at all like two.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2010"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E3C8","description":"","reviewerName":"Paul Mosier","summary":"Valve Does It Again","reviewText":"After the overwhelmingly positive reviews from the mini game within the Orange Box, Valve decided to revisit the world of Aperture Industries. It has all the old things that were great about the first game and quite a few new inventions which allow for some pretty creative gaming. Valve essentially created a new genre - what I'd consider a first person puzzle game. For those unfamiliar with Portal, you carry around this gun that makes holes in walls (two at a time - max) and you can walk through instantly ending up at the opposite portal.Pros-Full length single player game lasting 10-12 hours (longer depending on level of experience)-Co-op play adds even more gameplay and a totally different set of puzzles-Story has considerably more depth and plenty of humor-Large deviation from the common game type-Plenty of new inventions give constant gameplay varianceCons-After beating single player and co-op, replay is kind of pointless-Graphics engine looks basically the same-Only a few really hard puzzles-Needs tips or a tutorial mode for beginnersGameplay 9 of 10Portal 2 is similar to Portal in that you carry around the Portal gun and solve puzzles. But that's where the similarity ends. I'd say there are somewhere around 40-50 total testing rooms / \"obstacle areas.\" Not all are legitimate testing rooms. The old things like the boxes are back, but as opposed to the balls of light that would bounce everywhere and potentially kill you; they've replaced those with laser beams. Along with the lasers are reflective boxes which can be used to redirect the beams. And there are hard light bridges which can be walked on and sent through portals to move about a room. These add-ons occur in the earlier parts of the game.Later on you'll find yourself in the bowels of Aperture's testing facility attempting to return to the surface. I won't give too much away here, but some of the new elements are the repulsion gel, speed gel (don't know the actual name) and the conversion gel. The repulsion gel acts like Flubber. It makes you bounce and you can imagine the uses for this. Speed gel basically makes you move about 3-5 times as fast when you walk over it. This has a multiplicative effect meaning the longer you run on it, the faster you'll move. Conversion gel is the weird one, which allows you to turn any flat surface into a portal. The final addition is a beam which holds you in mid-air but only allows movement one direction and can be sent through portals.The puzzles are in general far larger and in later cases far more elaborate. Some of them are difficult at first, but once you've understood the principles everything is easier. And that's the only thing in the gameplay that I was peeved with. I only really struggled with two or three of the all the puzzles. I would have liked a replay where the puzzles added another degree of difficulty or like a timer maybe. On the other hand, I think a person who'd never touched Portal would have a really hard time understanding what to do. There should be tips given as a toggle option.Co-op 8 of 10I couldn't believe it, but the co-op game is an entirely different set of puzzles and is of course more difficult as many times you have to use all four portals. You're given control of a robot, blue or orange and you have the ability to tell your partner a location to go to or give a countdown. You can also dance, play: rock, paper, scissors, high five and wave all while interacting with your partner. What's nice is you can play co-op online with friends or even another random Portal 2 player. I'm not sure how long the co-op game length is, but would probably be similar to the single player campaign.Story 8 of 10You're awoken some years(?) later after you've defeated the AI running the place who's named GlaDOS. If you don't get the pun, it's ok. It's an `80s thing. Anyways, you're essentially trying to escape with Wheatley who is another AI. He's not exactly an AI, more like an artificial personality. And by the way, he provides almost all the humor in the game. He was voiced by Stephen Merchant who did a wonderful job and gave a very human quality to the game. If you don't want spoilers I wouldn't read any more of the story section.While trying to get out of this facility Wheatley accidentally turns GlaDOS back on. Some rather ridiculous events ensue and you end up at the bottom of the salt mine in which Aperture started. I really enjoyed this part of the game, getting to see the progression of the story and gradually make my way back to the surface. It turns out that a man named Cave Johnson started Aperture in 1952. As you navigate the puzzles you'll also notice how things changed at Aperture as the decades passed. It's a solid storyline for a game and a really impressive one for a puzzle game.Graphics 7 of 10Visuals in Portal 2 are really solid, but don't take a big leap from Portal and that was four years ago. The rooms are expansive and visual impressive, but the details are not unbelievable. Though in a game like this, you're not going to sit there and stare at the metal structure to see the grain in the rivets. None of this takes anything away from the game however and the graphics are easily contemporary to most current games.Replay Value 5 of 10It's unfortunate there are no other ways to play the puzzles, because if there were I would have given this game five stars. But once you played through the single player and co-op - that's it. You could play again, but you know all the tricks and remember how to solve most of the puzzles already. It is still a very good game that I'd recommend to just about anyone. But I'd say this is a must rent at least for someone new to the franchise and a must buy for Portal gamers. It's an easy 8 out of 10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2011"}

Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"An old school rpg with enough \"new\" in it to make it worthwhile!","reviewText":"In an era where big dawg developer companies give us shorter games, limited offer dlc, and 2 page black and white instruction manuals Divinity 2 DKS comes along on a silver chariot pulled by the two mighty steeds Larian and Atlus to prove \"chivalry\" is not dead in the industry. Even before you get into the game itself you're treated to a soundtrack cd and a fully colored bi-lingual instruction manual. Indeed after head honcho  Swen Vincke sincerely thanks you for your purchase and showers praise upon  his team in a heart felt introduction letter you may feel as if you are having a delirious hallucination. Then when you are promised 100 hours of rpg goodness for 39.99 your head will reel with the possibility that you have fallen into an alternate dimension through a worm hole. Well, rest assured Divinity 2 Dragon Knight Saga is as \"real\" as it gets!I've heard some gamers describe this as being \"good filler\" to occupy time until Skyrim releases but to me that seems to discredit just how worthy Divinity 2 DKS truly is. While it is true some things in DKS remind me of Oblivion, Fable, and Dragon age it's chalked full of many nuances that make it completely unique as well. Sure, you can kick chickens, learn to mix herbs, roam around in an open world, and enchant your gear with special charms but these familiar things are a very miniscule portion of the greater experience.The first aspect that surprised me in a positive way was how streamline the controls were. Spells, items, and attacks can be assigned to the Y, X, A, and B in any combination you want. You can also allocate additional things to your directional pad. Pressing LB will allow you to open doors, snag goodies, climb ladders, and talk to npcs whereas the RT makes you jump and can also set up a graceful dodge roll if you press a direction on the right analogue stick at the same time. In addition you can go into an inventory screen where everything is easy to find. If you get lost it's easy to mark something on your map which gives you a blue arrow to follow while indicating your own location with a red arrow.Unlike other rpgs which restrict your hero Divinity 2 is very liberal. Though you may choose your gender and class from the beginning nothing actually bars you from the ranger, slayer, wizard, warrior, and priest skill trees. You can mix and match to your heart's content!Yet Divinity 2 is no cakewalk. You have no magic sparkling pixie trails or brightly glowing items to tip you off. The game will be cruel if you do not take the time to look around. Likewise if you fail to save often enemies will kill you once they get into better organized bands with \"healers\" and \"shamans\" to buff their archers and fighters.  Losing 3 hours of progress due to careless negligence can be a cumbersome drag!At first Divinity 2 may come off as a bland action rpg . Yes, you can eventually turn into a dragon to partake in epic aerial dog fights with floating sky citadels. Yes, you do get an awesome \"battle tower\" that makes Bruce Wayne's \"Bat cave\" seem as if it is a dingy cheap hotel room by comparison. Yes, later on you can collect body parts from your enemies to make a patchwork monstrosity which will fight loyally by your side.  Problem is this isn't until about 15 or so hours into the game.Yet the exploration between the points of being a nave adventurer and becoming an epic protagonist are so well crafted with so many diverse side quests and lively encounters you are not going to care if certain things about DKS smack as being \"rudimentary\".  This is \"good fantasy\" at its' finest. The loot hunting,  absurd or foreboding conversations, and visceral combat act as a euphoric drug that incites that \"Just one more hour!\" response.Perhaps the most interesting mechanic towards the beginning of the game is the ability to \"mind read\". By spending a small boon of experience points you can decipher people's thoughts during chat sessions. This can range from  being mildly amusing to very helpful. Certain whispery contemplations will reveal the locations of important items, teach you a new alphabet, boost certain attributes, or even cue you in on secret pass words that are essential to your quest.When you finally \"do\" take to the skies being a dragon will be awkward initially. Each battle citadel has towers that either fire out powerful blasts or spawn more flying enemies. Strategically it helped me to take out the ballista towers first before going after the nesting towers. Also be sure to keep on the move. Staying idle in one place too long will spell out your doom! Luckily a dragon's \"fire balls\" are somewhat akin to homing missiles so taking down the winged abominations that come after you is not a chore in tedium. As the difficulty of these battles scale up you'll also be able to upgrade your dragon form's inherent supernatural abilities.Wrapped around all this is an intriguing story. As a dragon slayer recruit you are tasked with hunting down the last of the dragons. It is known far and wide that a corrupt dragon knight struck down the divine champion of the realm thus his kindred have become scapegoats to blame for everything that is evil, wicked, and wrong. Yet in an ironic twist of fate a dying female dragon knight gives you her powers and reveals to you an even greater threat in the land. The events that follow sort of mess up your life. In one instance you have to cut down your old friends that are trying to kill you. In addition the villain Damian is not rampaging without having a valid reason. Though certain characters may seem like ridiculous clich&eacute;s at first they eventually prove to have a lot of emotional and historical depth to them. There are moments you may feel sorry for the bad guys and equally loathe the good guys. DKS insists you \"think\". It's not going to make things easy by setting up a bunch of cookie cutter archetypes meant to incite total fondness or total avarice. Many big movers and shakers in Rivellion have done both virtuous and atrocious deeds in equal measure. Take that as you will.Before I close up shop I should state that DKS may lack a few things you expect from the genre. Though you have free reign with your multiple responses there is no morality meter. In addition though the game has \"romantic themes\" your main hero cannot develop and enrich a relationship with a special partner. Frankly I did not mind this nor did I perceive it as a qualm but for those who prefer the \"Bio-ware\" or \"Witcher\" approach to socializing DKS may leave them wanting.For me Divinity 2 DKS has been a delightful escape. It's obvious a lot of love and hard work went into this \"special edition\"  and the bugs I've encountered have been few and far between. If you enjoy Western rpgs but are looking for something that's delightfully different you should totally pick up this unappreciated master piece!Pros+Easy to learn controls+ fluid combat+ Freedom to develop your character anyway you want to+Deep multi layered story+ A sweeping and breathtaking sound track+Unique aesthetic design applied to enemies & armor.+ Side quest are actually \"fun\".+ Turning into a dragon, mind reading, and creating your own patchwork minion separates this game from the pack while establishing it as a special experience you shouldn`t pass up!+Very massive and interesting world.+Magic teleport way points make travel easy once you find them all.+Free soundtrack and bi-lingual full color instruction manual. (The other featured language is French)Cons-Little to offer those who prefer morality meters and relationship development-Game can be unapologetically vague and very difficult-Aerial fights in dragon form maybe frustrating until gamers grasp the basics for successful strategy.-Fans that supported Larian by getting the original \"Ego Draconis\" will feel a tad cheated.  All I can say in DKS's defense is that it comes with a 30 hour expansion AND many steps were taken to improve the core game. (Aka better engine and nicer visuals)For you ifDo you feel as if the journey matters more than the destination? Do you like seeing your armor and weapons visually change as you equip new gear? Love dragons and wizards? Do you applaud open worlds that offer up humor, tragedy, and a rich history in equal dosages? Do you prefer to be in the thick of the action instead of issuing commands via turn based monotony?  If so Divinity 2 DKS was lovingly smelted and re-forged just for you!Not for you ifDivinity 2 sits on the uncomfortable ant hill of being more stream lined than Oblivion yet is not quite as straight forward and user friendly as Fable. If you prefer an rpg that is one of those two extremes DKS could rain on your parade with its` \"middle of the road\" approach. In addition there are no \"deep relationships\" for the hero or heroine to pursue so if you are aching for a dime novel fantasy romance this is not the place to find it.Personal Bias OpinionI haven't played a Western rpg that has hooked me this much since Dragon age. DKS has fun game play, many expansive locales, and a really good story line. It's also not afraid to do its' own thing which is admirable. For these reasons I give it 5 out of 5!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2011"}

S.","summary":"Annoying.  Period.","reviewText":"Summary:This game is horribly unbalanced against the player.  And this makes playing it absolutely frustrating.  With poor story progression, there isn't much to make one want to put oneself through such a horrible experience.  BUT, it just might be worth your while if you like the visuals and gameplay style.  I'll admit I really enjoyed these aspects.  If only they were accented by the rest of the game...Reasons I like this game:1. Good graphics.2. Enjoyed the Resident Evil meets Shinobi style.Reasons I hate this game:1. Camera:  Generally fixed camera.  Always centered on player.  This is great.... except when you're in a corner, which you usually are.  Then the camera is facing the corner and not outwards, where you'll obviously be facing to attack oncoming enemies.  This camera may work for games like Resident Evil where you have plentiful healing items and where the enemies don't move freakishly fast, but both of these are major issues in this game.  I'll elaborate in reason 3.2. Difficulty:  I'm not your average gamer - I'm always adept at any game I play.  And I've spent probably as much time I've been progressing in this game retrying levels (7 hours-ish).  This is due in part because of the horrible retry system, which takes you all the way back to the beginning of the stage if you lose.  If you have a yellow orb, you can retry from the last door, BUT you lose all your equipment you used on your last try... why even call it a \"retry\" then?  If you failed with the equipment, you'll fail without it.  Other than this, the enemies movements are just too erratic and fast.  No matter how much I get these enemies' strategies down, their attacks are still insanely difficult to dodge.  And the enemy strength doesn't help - a regular enemy can take off half of your health bar with a single attack.  Major problems for this: you are only allowed ONE potion item.  And health drops are VERY sparse and VERY weak.  This makes bosses particularly difficult.3. Upgrades:  This game has a very nice upgrading system that allows the player to pick and choose what is desired.  The problem is that most of the upgrades to weapons aren't very useful, yet they're outrageously costly.  It will take you days if you want to grind the cost to gain all of the upgrades/items you want.  And enemies are sparse for grinding.4. Controls:  There is a button to switch melee weapons, but no button to switch guns.  Even worse, when you do switch melee weapons, an animation will be performed making you vulnerable to attacks.  So you're forced to do it the old-fashioned way by opening the start menu and taking half a minute re-equipping your desired gear.  This makes battles very slow where you need to switch weapons because of enemy elemental properties.  Not to mention it just becomes tiresome after the 30th time.5. Story:  Started strong, ended horrible.  It's like the whole Inuyasha series smashed into 7 hours.  Imagine all the filler...  Well, the story is interesting at the beginning, though not much is explained.  But after that, it seems like they just pieced together backstories to all the stages.  Example, there's a tiny story (of about 3 lines of text long) about some item you need to get.  Game done.  But seriously... these kind of stories are what you're treated to most in this game.  Very sparsely is the gameplay ever tied to the main character's story.6. Music:  Repetative and generic.  Same battle music is repeated over and over throughout the entire game.  This music is VERY basic and VERY stereotypical action rock music.7. Platforming:  This game is by far the worst platformer I've ever played.  Half of the time you can't see where you're jumping because of the camera as stated before.  The other half when you can see is still riddled with problems.  You can't always grip onto platforms or the character just fails to, which is immediately annoying.  But even worse it is so difficult to land exactly on top of some platforms.  Platforming is not intuitive in this game AT ALL.  Some jumps are performed automatically when you jump from certain ledges that require a longer jump, and some jumps you have complete control over.  Which jump is the one you'll be doing?  Who knows!!  There is no way of telling.  Most jumps have some sort of automatic contol, where you are in partial control and are partly guided.  This is so necessary, because of the lame platforming in this game, BUT this is also very problematic.  Since you are only in partial control, your character makes unordinary jumps.  This is very tricky for two reasons: (1) the partial automatic control sucks, you will miss your jump often, and (2) its hard to determine which jumps you can make because you don't know exactly how the jump will react.8. Fanbase:  I bought this game because of the heavy embrace by a very large audience.  This leaves one to wonder.... why?  It leaves me to worry about my human kin, and their interest in this outright annoying game.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2008"}

While I was entertained, I'm not going to pretend this game is for everyone.  It is incredibly violent, possibly one of the most graphically violent games I've ever played.  Oddly, the choice to make the game in black in white only heightens the blood as you kill, and the game rewards you by making more gruesome kills. So, if you're not someone whose into violence and carnage, this game is not for you at all.If you are someone who likes violent and gory games, this is one of the better ones.  The game play is a bit old school.  Rather than a linear progression through a level, the game works a little differently.  Most levels involve you being placed in some large area, a train station or street.  Then a bunch of guys show up, and you kill them.  This goes on until you get to a certain amount of points, which results in a reward, new weapons, challenges, and the eventual boss fight.This pretty fun, though a very arcade style of play.  However, given the level of violence and gore, it is definitely not something that everyone will love.

I have played this game through several times now, like Half Life games, I never get bored with it. Movie stars galore are in this too. Not huge ones, but I think I just heard Arnold do a cameo.Like Half Lives, Riddick gives you a little bit of a break now and then. I really like to take my time and take it all in. Take a few screenshots of the environs. I'm not the run from one room to the next, or one trail to the next shooting and dodging 'til the game is over. Riddick gives you plenty of chances to stop and surf around. Has a little bit of everything here, some shooting(some lethal, some with a tranq gun), some stealth, some blow it all up, some run and grab goodies, some run away to survive, strategy, collecting needed items, and much more.This game has been out quite a few years now and graphically holds up today. It is a very good looking game. This game was jaw-dropping when it came out. People today may be too jaded. Even the semi-rusty walls still shine when light is placed on them. All the lighted surfaces and objects are dead on right. The people that designed the lighting for this game were very smart.Riddick even sports the best in-game menu ever, with a spinning cube that has pieces of the cube being flying out of it as you spin it. The sound of the spinning metallic cube-of-cubes is also adding to its charm.I played this game for several years on my Windows XP machine, good for its day. I ran an ATI x1950pro video card. This game had a few sections that made the system work overtime. If I ran the the full 1920x1200 even the spinning cube menu, which is graphically intense, slowed down at times. I have now switched it over to a new win7x64 computer with an i7-860 and an ATI-HD5750 and all the slowing of any kind came to a halt. Wow, that spinning cube menu really flies around now. The only scenes that were tough for the XP machine were the catacombs, and few of the action packed shooting episodes towards the end.Not until I loaded a game called STALKER on my XP computer did I really realize that its days were numbered for playing newer games. If you don't have a decent video card on your XP computer, get one. OR get a Win7 and start flying.Riddick also has some fun hand fighting, neck popping, body dragging, body tossing, gun stealing, stolen gun flipping backwards to shoot assailants head, and more stuff that you don't see elsewhere.AND for all the people that think video games of movies usually suck, this IS actually way better than the movies, yes plural.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2012"}

InHeavy Raineach player discovers their own answer to this question as they experience a gripping psychological thriller filled with innumerable twists and turns, where choices and actions can and do result in dramatic consequences. Spanning four days of mystery and suspense, the hunt is on for a murderer known only as the Origami Killer - named after his macabre calling card of leaving behind folded paper shapes at crime scenes. Even more chilling is the fiend's well established pattern of killing his victims four days after abducting them. The public is gripped with fear as the police seem powerless to stop the carnage, and another potential victim &#151; Shaun Mars &#151; has gone missing. Now four characters, each following their own leads and with their own motives, must take part in a desperate attempt to prevent the killer from taking yet another life.","reviewerName":"Jeremy R. Gleason","summary":"Great game, but lacks replay potential for me! Spoilerish","reviewText":"I LOVED this game, it was so fresh and new style to get rid of the typical FPS or RPG style game. I will definitely be buying into the type of game play again. However, once you find out who the killer is, and that doesn't change regardless your choices, I kind of said \"meh\"...I don't want to invest my time again, changing choices etc... if it will not ultimately effect the entire end game. Now it would be really cool if your choices changed who the actual killer is and who lives/dies, etc... but that would have to be one beefed up game to include all those scenarios. Regardless, it's totally worth a play or even two (or 20 if you like it that much)!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2012"}

What I will say is that this game is by far one of the funnest games you'll play on the N64. Even those who despise wrestling will find themselves having fun with this game, as it is amazingly easy to pick up and play. There is some considerable slow down, but that can be dealt with by turning off background music during gameplay - a small sacrifice to make. The Create a Wrestler function adds a great amount of time to it's replayability, as you can make dozens of new wrestlers to play with.As was stated in an earlier review, there is a bug that causes info to be lost. Buyers might want to be cautious about buying this game, and its because of this frustrating bug that I give this game a 4 and not 5 stars. Otherwise, the game itself is a blast.

Miles \"dkmiles1\"","summary":"Good effects, very challenging, could be longer","reviewText":"After playing a game like San Andreas, everything else seems short by comparison.  Call of Duty feels really short.  Which lessens the value of an otherwise solid game.The special effects in Call of Duty are simply outstanding, you literally feel like you're in the middle of the battle.  The opening scene in particular feels much like the opening scene from \"Saving Private Ryan\", bullets flying everywhere, people dying all around, total chaos.  You don't know whether you're coming or going, to make matters worse, you're unarmed.In Call of Duty you play a series of missions as various characters from the allies side of WW 2.  You start with Russian missions, then move on to British mission, and finally American missions.  Each with their own nuances and varying levels of difficulty.  The American missions are the most difficult.  I found that it was necessary to replay the American missions constantly before they could finally be beaten.As great as the graphics and gameplay are, the individual missions are linear and somewhat short, though challenging just the same.  It is however the relative 'shortness' of Call of Duty that is its downfall.  If there were say, 5 - 10 more missions the game would be more worthwhile.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000QY9C90","reviewerName":"Corey Turner \"The Musician\"","summary":"It's The End of the World, as We Know It","reviewText":"Many of you have probably known or familiarized yourselves with Valve's new first person shooter (FPS), \"Left 4 Dead\". For those who don't know of it, lived under a rock, or maybe even just set foot into the next generation of gaming, no worries I'm here to help. To begin this is a game based on cooperation, even in single player campaign modes you'll want a fearsome four. Not a feeble loner, or you'll be turning the game into \"Left 2 Die\", with a middle finger on the cover and to your teammates.Left 4 Dead begins in the middle of what appears to be a zombie apocalypse, with no real back-story. Aiming for an easy hop in and play title, rather then having to make a proper story and avoid a clich&eacute; way of infestation. The game features four prime cuts of zombie terrain goodness, broken into chapters. Each scenario holds no story to the other, so any beginner can play any section without missing much. Some chapters though are quite tough, but difficulty settings aside beginners wont be turned away even joining up with a group nearing the end of the game.Streets painted in blood, urban sprawl, and sewers are just some of the areas you'll venture to. Airports even fields (as we all know are terrifying in real life in the dark) are available. Progression is logged by making way to a safe room. These rooms serve as a quick breather in a rather hellish atmosphere, and offer goods from ammo to health packs. Players on higher difficulties will see these rooms as a sign of salvation. So next time you make a bold attempt to dart to one of these safe rooms, look both ways.Zombies pose little threat at first, much like the \"28 Days Later\" rage infected people, they are fast but nothing a bullet can't handle. Special infected are what to look out for. Special musical cues alert players of what to expect. Special infected range in size and abilities. The most deadly being the Tank, a destructive `tank' like foe, which specialty is to bludgeon or toss survivors. Next in our Frankenstein like conveyor belt is the `smoker'. You can hear this fella cackling away from either emphysema or laughter as he's about to lash out his tongue and victimize you. Along the way you'll probably see the hunter, chances are he'll see you first though. He likes to tackle and maul you! He's pleasant in comparison to the boomer. The boomer likes to cover you in gooey bile of some sort that attracts a horde of zombies. Now those weak pestering waste of shot zombies are an army of the dead, and you're their primary target (lovely). Before I finish this segment, it wouldn't be complete with out mentioning the witch. I wont mention much about her, leave her be and maybe you wont know a thing of her either.Weapons are a constant in survival, and teams must choose accordingly to their premises to survive. Entry grade weapons include a sub machine gun, and a shotgun, as pistols are equipped as a back up or last resort. Down the road you'll run into the upgraded versions (automatic shotgun, assault rifle, dual pistol), and a hunting rifle. What you used before may not be suitable at this point. Consider speaking and clarifying your specialty with others, if everyone only has a shotgun, say good-bye to the straggler.Items are just as important if not more important to survival here. Medical items anyways. Pills, and `med packs' are your health boosters. Pills increase your health but slowly ware off and bring you back to bare bones. Med packs can be given out to other players, or used upon you; it goes for pills too (can be handed out). (Lower your health the slower you run).  They can also save you when your screen becomes grayed (ill explain more upon this grayness later). Other items can be improvised such as a Molotov cocktail, and a pipe bomb. Players must choose one or the other, in a perfect world we should be able to carry both, but this isn't a perfect world, in fact it feels like the end. Gasoline cans and propane tanks can be shot or thrown into a spot for some tactical explosive goodness.Players can become incapacitated by what they are facing and have in need of some assistance. As their health bar dwindles, players can pick them up. After enough knockdowns though, their screen will appear faded and gray. After one more accident, they will die! Luckily your friend is much like a zombie and will respawn in a closet at a later time. Versus mode offers players to be special infected or survivors, and incapacitation is the biggest objective to avoid or initiate. Versus mode is a rehash of the games campaign, with only two of the trials offered. Teams switch off each round (to zombie or survivor). This works rather smoothly, but the spawning is a bit confusing at first, and isn't all that interesting.Visuals- 4/5: Cinematic flares added here and there make the gore even more horrific.Sound-5/5: Not much music, but the bits are crucial to survival. They also heighten the freight to another level.Frame rate and performance-4/5: The E3 demos gave me this conception of a Half-Life 2 mod with a clunky frame rate, oh how I was wrong. It runs smooth, not too many clunks, and the A.I. is great. Check out the A.I, director to learn more.Gameplay-4/5: Fun,fun,fun! Repetitiveness done right, you don't even want to call it that. New feeling each play through, just with a stronger sense of familiarity.Left 4 Dead summed up is a game that will have you completing the same objectives every time, fairly linear but different combinations of weapons and people and even difficulty changes make for a great intense game. Slight changes of item locations and witches will have you peering around every tree and or wall. This is a game worth buying if you have a devoted group of friends or clan to play with, but as for now a rental if available and while the online community lingers with the dead. For I fear that lack of downloadable content (DLC) could hinder this games online player base, so lets hope for a few new locations.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2009"}

I wanted a high quality screen protector that i could count on and what other better option is there other than the official screen protector from Sony itself. As you already probably know anything with the word \"official\" and \"Sony\" right after each other usually entails an overpriced accessory that has a cheaper 3rd party equivalent alternative. This is definitely an exception to that rule.For whatever reason Amazon discounts this item (2 screen protectors) down to $1.98 every other week or so, so if I were you I would put this on my Amazon Watch list to see when the price goes down. 2 official screen protectors for $2 basically is an amazing deal especially when 3rd party screen protectors cost about the same or a little more, except this is the official version for those of you who actually care.As for the quality of the screen protector, its not too bad easy to apply and its great that it comes with 2 of them so in case you mess up you still have the other one. I would definitely recommend this to all PS Vita owners, especially if you can get it at $2. If not $5 for a 2 pack isnt that bad either","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired.

{"product_name":"B00BGHUS58","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Paslay","summary":"Assassin's Creed + GTA + 1984 = Watch Dogs","reviewText":"Watch Dogs is an interesting experience. It's one part Assassin's Creed, one part Grand Theft Auto and a dash of Orwell's 1984.The premise is that it's Chicago in the very near future (like 5 years) and you are a hacker. Smart phone technology has allowed the devices to become the hacker's tool of the trade. You're part of a two man team that goes into crowded upper class areas (Hotels, Restaurants, etc) and hack people's phones and drain their bank account into your own. One of your jobs goes awry and an unknown malcontent decides to teach you a lesson resulting in your niece being killed. You could grieve and give up your life of crime, but that's not your style. Revenge is on the menu and you're serving it cold.Aesthetically and mechanically Watch Dogs is primarily GTA. The whole of Chicago is your playground. You can steal cars and drive them, missions frequently involve evading police. Based on your crimes the police up their force to pursue you. You can kill anyone, etc. There are no prostitutes, at least none that I have found. I always thought that was stupid and gimmicky anyway, so no love lost there.Several things have been taken from Assassin's Creed as well. Free run and climbing is here. Although you can't climb everything like you can in AC, which makes sense, you're a hacker not an assassin. Walking around you are able to listen in on people's conversations (which often lead to side missions) and drain their bank accounts, very similar to some of the open world mechanics in AC. You can buy better equipment and use it via the weapon wheel like in AC. Even crafting grenades and other tactical devices. You have to hack these communications towers and that's what shows you where all the side quests and missions are, much like climbing the towers in AC.Side missions include VR mini games, running down gangs that are on their way to kill someone and stopping them before they do so, tailing criminals and stopping their crimes before they hurt anyone etc. They're fun albeit a little repetitive. You're generally well rewarded with positive reputation, money and exp. If nothing else they break up the gameplay.Watch Dogs includes several RPG elements. Most things grant you experience points. If you evade the police, you get experience. If you successfully hack something you get experience. Thwart a crime, experience. Kill a gang member with a well-placed headshot, experience. When your experience bar is full you are awarded a single skill point. You don't gain levels and I believe that the experience bar always takes the same amount to fill. Skill points are used to buy, you guessed it, skills. You have several skill trees; hacking, driving, combat, etc. Like a standard RPG you buy skills with skill points and certain skills have various requirements to unlock (your game progression, previous skills, etc). There are a lot of skills that are very useful and I'm pretty sure if you put in the time, you can unlock every single skill.You collect money from quest/mission rewards and from draining bank accounts. Money buys better weapons, ammo, new outfits, new cars (cars can be summoned virtually anywhere as long as you own them), etc. The outfits are kinda cool and allow you to give your character a look that you prefer. Most are essentially what he's wearing on the cover in different colors and patterns.The vehicle system is very helpful because Chicago is BIG. You can steal a car, but the alarm may go off, or someone may call 911 earning you unwanted attention. You also have a phone app that allows you to order one of the cars in your inventory from a friend who knows a guy who will park your vehicle of choice a block away from you. Every time you steal a different kind of car it will show up in this inventory. The standard low-end cars are free from the get go, the better cars cost an initial fee to fully unlock. There are A LOT of cars. Armored cars, semis, sport bikes, Ferrari's, Volkswagen, Lancers, station wagons and the list goes on. PLENTY to work with. Each handle differently and have different durability. Obviously a fiberglass sports car is going to explode faster than an armored truck.Let's discuss combat. As I stated you have an array of weapons. Hand guns, shotguns, sniper rifle, frag grenades, signal jammers, assault rifles. You can buy them or pick them up off dead bodies. Obviously some are better than others. This works well as you can approach each situation differently. So many things can be hacked. You can daisy chain hack cameras, quickly identifying where all the enemies in the area are. Scanning them will tell you things like whether or not they'll call for backup, if they have any explosives on them, etc. You can overload circuits causing things to explode, usually killing those nearby or at least getting their attention. You can burn them by releasing steam valves. If they have grenades you can remotely detonate them. I like hanging out outside a compound and using the above mentioned tactics to kill off most of the enemies and then sneak in using the silenced pistol and sniper rifle to clean up the rest. BUT you could use a semi or armored car to blow through the front gates and hop out with your shotgun and grenade launcher an turn the place into an inferno. The choice is yours! Combat works very well as a third person shooter, I have absolutely no complaints.Missions are put in categories by type and you have a progress wheel, much like the memory sync strands in AC that let you know how many of a specific mission you have done and how many you have left. It's a great system for the completionist.Graphics are fantastic. They really pushed it with this one. Sound is well done, but Ubisoft has always done well with sound. The soundtrack is phenomenal, a lot of Chicago bands. Ubisoft did such an amazing job recreating Chicago. I can't stress this enough. I live in Chicago and it's a very strange experience driving on streets in the game that I do in real life.My ONLY complaint is the same as I have with GTA. This is really just a matter of opinion and preference. I feel like the sandbox world is stronger than the overall story. I find myself frequently putting off the story so I can try different things in the open world environment. This may change as I get further into the story AND, from what I've played of the story missions, they're much stronger than anything Rockstar has every put out. Yes, I know Rockstar doesn't try to focus on the story, it wasn't a dig at them. You do feel for the protagonist and the situation he's in. I just feel that the story doesn't pull you in from the get go as much as it should. Overall though, it's a phenomenal title and Ubisoft has done an amazing job at combing elements from several successful genres into a single, solid title. If you're on the fence about this one, don't be, it's definitely worth your time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-28-2014"}

{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"blackaciddevil","summary":"Uncharted 2: Among Thieves......","reviewText":"Uncharted 2: Among Thieves' plot revolves around the doomed voyage home of Marco Polo from China in 1292. After spending almost 20 years in the court of the Mongol Emperor Kublai Khan, Marco Polo departed with fourteen ships and over six hundred passengers - but when he arrived in Persia a year and a half later, only one ship and eighteen passengers remained. Polo never revealed what had happened to the lost ships. Embarking on a quest to find the lost fleet, Nathan Drake soon realizes that Marco Polo was hiding a much bigger secret. That he had gone on a secret expedition to find the mythical kingdom of Shambhala and to recover the legendary Cintamani Stone, or the \"Wish-fulfilling jewel\" of Buddhist mythology as its' called. With this information, Nathan decides on a new course by following Marco Polo's trail. This quest pits him against a more formidable adversary than he is used to - a ruthless, rogue paramilitary leader with a private army and an ambition to recover the stone from Nathan for himself.Even though I played the first game and liked it, I never loved it. It seemed way too  much like Tomb Raider to me. I know I'll probably take some flack for saying that but it did to me. However, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves changed all that. This time around, I was more engrossed in the story and felt like I had accomplished something when I finished the game. The story came to a satisfying conclusion and, literally, made me start on the third game almost immediately. It truly is an amazing game that deserves all the awards and praise that it gets. Not only does it push the envelope graphically but in all other aspects as well. I'll go so far as to agree with other reviewers here that you will NOT regret purchasing this game. Playing this game made me a fan of the franchise.On a footnote, I think I might go back and play the first game again and see if my view on that game will change. I'm pretty sure it will. Give it a look, gamers...Uncharted 2: Among Thieves by Naughty Dog is one of the Best games of this generation of games on PS3. Buy It!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2012"}

As a male with family of two kids, overall the PS3 was the best value for the money. Since PS3 and Xbox 360 are aiming for the same market, I was comparing the PS3 more to the 360:Pros:-Most powerful system among 3 consoles.-Blu Ray player included, also it can be upgraded via the internet. It is full functioning Blu Ray player, not watered down, the picture quality if awesome.-Solid hardware, Xbox 360 hardware has many problems.-Includes wireless Wi-Fi, but with Xbox 360 you have to buy it separately.-Free online gaming, unlike Xbox's which you have to pay each month.-Internet web browser, which Xbox doesn't have.-Better menus for navigation than 360.-Controllers have not only rumble, but also motion sensor like Wii.-Hard drive is easily upgradable and inexpensive, unlike 360 which is expensive and very hard to upgrade if you want to put your own hard drive.-Latest movies and TV shows can purchased online, 360's Netflix has more titles but are old titles.-Playstation Eye(motion sensing camera) accessory allows for motion games like Wii.Cons:-Need more latest titles of movies(but same or better than 360 or Apple TV)-Not all movies can be rented in the first few weeks of release, but have to be purchased.-Need more variety of games, actually true for all 3 systems.Overall compared to Wii: Kids will want the Wii no matter what anyone says as long as their friends have it. The quality of Wii games are decreasing, game developers are not integrating the motion functionality well with the games. It feels like developers made the games and then added the motion feature as an afterthought. PS3's included controller has motion sensors like the Wii, also Playstation Eye camera has motion sensoring also. There are PS3 accessories for Guitar Hero and Rock Band which allows physical games on the PS3 like the Wii. So you can do play physical games like the Wii on the PS3.Overall compared to Xbox 360: Even though Xbox 360 is less expensive initially, if you add everything that PS3 has, the Xbox 360 is much more expensive. People forgot this. 360 has more games than PS3 because it was introduced a year earlier, but starting in 2008 PS3 is coming out with many high quality exclusive games now that introduction period is over(PS3 has Metal Gear Solid 4, Little Big Planet, Socom Confrontation, Resistance 2, Gran Turismo 4, etc). Unless you will play Halo or Gears of War, get the PS3, it is a much better value.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2008"}

You also have the added advantage of all of the software updates that make the game run smoother and more stable.  I did have an issue starting up the game due to my firewall/Comodo \"defense plus\" interfering with startup on my Windows 7 64bit OS, but after I disabled the offending software the game boots up smoothly.  Gameplay is solid and the bonus of a decent computer is that the game looks way better than when I played it the first time around my Xbox 360- and I'm only running on high detail, not ultra high.The heart of the game is still the same, and if you haven't played Fallout yet, you may as well do it now, because you're missing out on one of the best game worlds I've ever encountered on any console/platform.  This is one of the best games of the decade (or previous decade, however you count your decades).

It's satisfying to bash zombies over the head with machetes, sickles, pans, really anything you can find or if you are more technical there are shotguns, grenades, rifles, etc. Not to mention that you can customize these weapons to add some shock, poison, nails, et al.The Good:The game is plenty long with enough to do to last awhile. The world itself is pretty neat. It is somewhat intricate, so looking at every nook and cranny can really make it last. There are many different locales to keep the scenery fresh. A few stick out in my mind as exceedingly well made creating a chilling atmosphere. Killing zombies really never gets boring. The game almost feels like a Borderlands. In fact, the core formula is reminiscent to Borderlands. The combat is pretty fun. There are many great ideas in the game.The Bad:The story is mediocre at best. The quests are mostly dull fetch quests. The guns aren't as effective or useful as they should be. The characters are very stereotypical almost to a cringing state.The Ugly:PS3 Version: The graphics and texture popping is very bad. The framerate issues took awhile to get used to. There are many graphical issues that are this game's biggest downfalls. There are plenty of bugs as well when it comes to performing the quests. The worst game I've played to date with such technical issues.The game has some fantastic ideas even if it wasn't executed to its remarkable potential.

{"product_name":"B007SRM5U6","reviewerName":"brainiac723","summary":"Fantastic Game","reviewText":"Arkham City is a DEFINITE MUST PLAY experience. If you have never picked up the original then this is DEFINITELY the version to get. As legendary as Arkham City was, there were definitely problems with disc reading and data corruption that will all be likely fixed in the Game of the Year Edition. It is an amazing game and has so much to do and so much more depth than it seems at first glance. The Game of the Year edition is a must buy if you skipped out on the original version because buying the Nightwing, Robin, Catwoman, Skins, Batcave and Harley's Revenge packs can be slightly expensive. As great as the game is, the riddler's revenge campaigns and predator missions can be a little tricky. Getting the missions requires pretty specific routes that are hard to figure out on your own, but if you check out some YouTube videos it'll give you a good foundation in defeating these stages. Regardless, the Riddlers Revenge challenge maps are still fantastic. They also could have also taken some bigger risks with the side mission villains. With some of the side missions they could have had some intense boss battles but instead they have it end with a push of a button. Regardless the side missions are still pretty cool.Once again, if you have never played this game then definitely pick this edition up. It's by far one of the GREATEST games ever made. Can't wait for the third one.P.S. Harleys Revenge is a perfect ending to the Arkham City storyline which even more makes the Game of the Year edition a better purchase than the original one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2012"}

These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"Sylph StarWind \"sylphstarwind35\"","summary":"Worth trying","reviewText":"This game is alright. It looks beautiful in cutscenes, but not as good the rest of the time. The story is interesting and characters are fine, but I didn't really care much about any of them except maybe Auron. I wanted more to see the plot unfold. The battles are so-so, because summoning can be fun, but the fighting is not very entertaining otherwise and it is just turn-based. The music is nice; I enjoyed listening to some of the songs but there aren't really any cutscenes with songs with lyrics like in Kingdom Hearts or FFX-2. It's more background music. It's too bad you can't choose difficulty in most rpgs, because I am stuck on Yunalesca and I've tried over and over to beat her and can't. So I may never see the ending. But most people can probably beat the game, I just get stuck a lot. Anyway, this game is worth renting and if you like it you should buy it. This isn't really a memorable game overall, more for the graphics (but there are other games with equal graphics). I've never been a big fan of Final Fantasy, because I never seem to be able to finish them, and the battles are so boring. I think Zelda or Kingdom Hearts is better.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000R39GPA","reviewerName":"T. Frye","summary":"Are you a Star Wars fan? Head to the store right now. I mean it. Right now.","reviewText":"Wow, Just, wow. This... this is how the force should feel. This is the force from the previous games on steroids. This is a MUST buy for any Star Wars fan. Want to know why? Read on.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Story: The story starts off with Darth Vader getting off his private vessel on Kashyyk. The planet is in a war-zone, and Lord Vader is there to find a jedi in hiding. As soon as Vader hunts down and kills the jedi, he finds the jedi's son. Vader decides to take the child as his secret apprentice. The story then unfolds from there, and any other details would ruin the story for you.The story is, simply put, the best story ever in the history of Star Wars. The story branches the plot-line from the third and fourth movie. And it does a great job doing it. I'd go as far to say the story is better than some of the films. Now that's saying something.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Graphics: Another great part of the game is the graphics. This game is a joy to look at. The character models in cutscenes are astounding. The environments are amazing. Gameplay runs smoothly with little to no framerate problems or glitches. These graphics are some of the best graphics this gen has too offer.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Audio: As other Star Wars games have proven, it's hard to make a Star Wars game sound bad. And this game is no different. The dialogue is realistic and amazing. It's very well done.The soundtrack is BRILLIANT. I've never heard a more beautiful score. It borrows pieces straight from the movies (which was awesome), and plays them at just the right moments. At one scene, the music playing in the background combined with what was going on in the cutscene just about made me cry. Lucasarts even went to the trouble to create an all-new piece exclusively for the game. This piece is no different from the music in the films - epic and dramatic. The fact that Lucasarts created an all-new piece for the game shows that Lucasarts actually cares about this product. The games audio is easily ther best I've ever heard in a Star Wars game.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gameplay: Now, on to the gameplay. The gameplay is very intuitive, and a total blast. First of all, let's talk about your force powers. As the title implies, this game is all about unleashing the force. And unleash it you do. You can blow down bridges, blow storm-troopers 5,000 feet away, and knock down entire buildings. This is the big new thing in The Force Unleashed, and it's brilliant. In previous Star Wars games, you feel like the force is a cheap magnetic kids toy from Walmart that pushes your enemies up to two feet (*gasp*). That's why this game is so amazing. Sometimes (especially on the Felucia level), you feel slightly less powerful than your foes, but this is NOT a game-breaking issue.But what about light-saber combat? The game succeeds in this section, too. There are plenty of combos to buy using your force points, and most of them are really cool. Whether you choose to blow everyone away with force powers, or focus on lightsaber combat, you'll be thoroughly entertained.However, some of the platforming elements can be too unforgiving. There is a part in the Felucia level where you must go across bridges inside a cave, and you must go higher and higher to get to the surface. I have had several times where I fell off the bridge I was on, and fell to the bottom of the cave. This means I had to go through that entire segment again and again and again. This is nothing game-breaking, but it is noticeable.Overall, the game is really addictive, and will leave you begging for more.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lasting Appeal: Overall, you're getting a not-too-short, not-too-long 8 through 12 hour experience. That may seem short to some, but you'll be hooked so much that a second playthough is absolutely needed. There are also two endings to the game depending on what you do at the end. There is no multiplayer to be found, but there is some DLC to buy in the Playstation Store to further your quest for vengeance. So, all in all, you'll get a lot of time out of this game.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall: This is the best Star Wars game I have ever played. The story and graphics are amazing, the audio is brilliant, and the gameplay is simply joyous. This game is a must buy for any fan. If you're not a Star Wars fan, become one so you can get this game. Get this game. Right now.The following is a ranking system.
