If they'd delivered on them, this would have been a super game.  They didn't.  Allow me to explain.  Red Faction's big pillar has been that you get to vanquish enemies by destroying buildings and the environment.  After playing GUERILLA, I figured the next game would simply have larger environments and taller buildings  to destroy.  Where there's the promise of doing just that in this game, -- you even get a cool \"magnet gun\" that's really fun -- the gameplay gets derailed by the fact that you spend most of the game underground in caves with a bunch of alien bug monsters.  So all of a sudden the game feels like a poor man's Dead Space.  Argh.  At first I figured the bugs would only be a quick chapter.  But no.  It goes on and on.  It was actually quite baffling.  And the story is utterly forgettable.  Since our heroes are now the ones in control of Mars, there's not as much excitement or suspense quelling the terrorists (who've unleashed the bug scourge) as there was being part of a resistance trying to overthrow a tyrannical regime.  That being said, the game isn't horrible.  There's definitely some fun to be had playing with the magnet gun.  If you get it for $15 like I did, you ought to be pleasantly surprised.  Especially if you haven't played Red Faction Guerilla, I would imagine.  Just be ready to kill a LOT of bug creatures.  I hope a sequel comes out where you can destroy massive skyscrapers.  That would be unbelievably cool.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2012"}

The things I refer to are things like hidden bombs that are hard to find that you NEED to move on, rarely guards will spot you at an IMPOSSIBLE distance. But other than those small problems this game is REALLY fun. If you like Metal Gear Solid on the PS1 you should love this. Its just like one excepts with new characters, different story line, and some bonuses that the first one did not have.

The air chatter is nice, but it does get annoying after the repetitive \"cheerleader\" comments (like \"Nice shot\" or something like that). Although overall is fairly excellent, there has to be a comment made about the last mission -- Megalith.  If you liked Star Wars, the last mission is definitely reminiscent of the attack on the Death Star.  The storyline is a bit weird and a wee bit cheesy, but overall, this game is definitely worth the money, new or used.

For whatever reason I never released this on the main Amazon site.Morrowind, one of the largest RPGs (role playing games) I've seen, stands in line to revolutionize console gaming.  Although Morrowind has been released on the PC, I think it is a much more important game in regards to console gaming.RPG games have had a distinct and varied history.  Ranging from the Ultima series of the 1980s to the Zelda franchise to the PC games such as Everquest and Diablo, RPGs have proven very popular.  There are two main types of RPGs.The first one, which has found a very long life in consoles, is the closed-ended RPGs where you have a very clear plot to follow and there's not much getting away from that plot.  The immensely popular Final Fantasy games are excellent examples of this, as well as the Zelda games.The second type, which Morrowind falls under, is a very open-ended game, where the game focuses more on giving you the freedom to play whatever character you would like.  Everquest and Baldur's Gate are good examples of these.  These games focus much more on the `role playing' element instead of a fantasy plot that the game moves you through.  These games are mostly found on the computer.Morrowind is a mixture of both types.  It does have a main plot to attend too; however, Morrowind sets you in such an expansive environment with such a wide variety of things to do that you can play for a very long time without ever touching the main plot.  Morrowind takes the best of both RPG genres (the ability to do whatever you want; having a very good plot) and succeeds wonderfully at doing so.What makes Morrowind such a revolutionary game is actually just the format it is released in.  Console gaming does not have to many of the open-ended RPGs that the computer has.  Console RPGs focus much more on the plot-oriented games instead of giving you freedom to play how you wish.  With Morrowind released on the X-Box, console gamers get a taste of what PC gamers have been experiencing for years.  Hopefully, this trend will continue and console gaming will start getting their share of the open-end games, which (to me and many others) brings much more depth to RPGs tha closed ended games can offer.The best feature Morrowind has to offer is the sheer freedom to do whatever you want.  Like the RPGs you play with dice and a gaming master, Morrowind has you decide what kind of character you want to play based off skills and strong suites.There are ten races to choose from, ranging from Orcs to three different races of Elves to three human species and then to the Argonians (a lizard type species) and Khajiits (a cat race).  Do you want to be a mage or a thief?  Or an assasain?  Do you want to play a moral character such as a knight or a monk?  Do you want to play the part of a barbarian or an elegant businessman?  Or do you want to be a religious pilgrim?The sheer diversity and replayability of Morrowind is astounding because of how many different type characters you can play.  Bethseda (Morrowind's studio) was creative enough in this game to make it possible where you can spend more time on all the other missions to do than on the main plot itself.  How you play is up to you.  My character?  He's an assassin.  A person you watch out for because he is both very stealthy and, if he were ever caught, have a very long criminal record.  But he'll never be caught.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2011"}

This one is unlike any MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game, for those who don't know) that has come before.  Most other MMORPGs are of two varieties - Sci/Fi and Sword/Sorcery.  This one is all about becoming a superhero, straight out of the comics.  It is set within Paragon City, a huge unrban area with stunning architecture, ranging from the ultra-modern and clean areas to gritty industrial zones, with everything in between.After installing the game and starting it up, your first job is to create your character.  First, you must choose an Archetype, which basically is similar to choosing a Class in other games.  The basic archetypes range from the Blasters, who are all about dealing massive amounts of damage from long range, to the Tankers and Scrappers, who like to show they can deal out damage up close while taking the best shots from the bad guys, to the Controllers, who, instead of directly damaging enemies, instead perform crowd control functions and charm enemies and make them turn against their friends.Next, one must choose the types and sorts of powers they will use through the game, with choices ranging from fire balls to ice blasts to martial-arts moves, and many more.  Of course, some Archetypes are best suited for certain powers more than others, but the in-game help screens provide nice explanation of what types of powers are best.After that, the fun really begins as you get to choose your character's appearance.  Customization choices are incredibly massive, dwarfing any other game's.  Skin color, costume color, accents, utility belts, big swords, armor, robot arms, ammunition belts, you name it, and it's probably there (except for capes, but I hear they come later).  Once a character levels up, they will even be able to have more than one costume to choose from!  Those who really go for role-playing will also have the option to write a short origin for their hero, and create a battle cry for themselves, should they be so inclined.After doing all this, it is time to choose a server (they are all the same) and get busy!  First, you are put through a tutorial level that allows you to learn how the game works with minimal risk to your character.  You will gain enough experience in this to get your first level-up and see how your characters powers and abilities grow as your levels increase.Finally, it is time to get into the main city and get to work!  It is pretty easy to solo in this game, especially at the low levels.  You can either roam randomly around looking for thugs to kill (they aren't hard to find), or else seek out contacts and obtain missions.  Missions are basically tasks involving clearing out buildings of bad guys, looking for a particular enemy to kill, recovering vital information from an enemy-infested computer lab, etc.  They are nice and straightforward.  A nice feature of the game is that it makes use of \"instanced\" buildings for indoor missions, which basically means that you don't have to worry about sharing your mission environment with any competitors trying to kill your enemy and accomplish your goals before you do.  Definitely an improvement to those who are familiar with \"camp-stealing\" which is so prevalent in some other MMORPGs.Another nice change in this game is the fact that hunting for armor and other items to increase your strength is gone.  Instead, you can either find or purchase a variety of \"enhancements\", allowing you to buff up your powers for a few levels.  Enhancements are readily available for purchase, plus they drop off enemies all the time, so getting them isn't hard at all.  Also, you can get ahold of \"Inspirations\", which also drop from enemies or can be bought.  Inspirations can be saved and used as needed, and they range from self-healing, to temporary damage-increasing buffs, to accuracy increases, etc.  Some Inspirations even allow you to bring yourself back to life if you should be killed in action, though you need to use caution when doing this so you don't get killed again immediately by a nearby enemy.Death penalties in this game are not too harsh at all.  You lose a little bit of experience, and that is it.  If you don't have the proper Inspiration, or else no one is around to help you, you can choose to be taken to a hospital, where you can recuperate in safetly and go out to the mean streets again.Getting around Paragon City is a breeze.  The city is divided into a number of different zones of varying levels of difficulty.  You can choose to travel between the different zones on foot if you want, but there is a cool system of Trams with a stop in each zone which allows for instantaneous travel from one end of town to the other.  So, the days of long travel times to get where you want to go are over with.There's a lot more to the game than what I have put here.  There are in-game help screens and a pretty good manual that helps you figure things out.  Of course, there are also all kinds of web sites out there where you can get questions answered as well.Overall, this game is a great way to get on the Internet and have fun with friends, or make new friends, as you don your costume and protect Paragon City from the forces of evil.  The first few months of this game have been smooth sailing, and if things keep on like they are, the future of City of Heroes is bright indeed.  It is missing the Player-vs-Player element that some gamers really enjoy, but that will change once City of Villians is released in 2005.  Enjoy!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2004"}

The downfall is that it's very very short. So let me start by saying that if you're not set up to, or you just don't intend to, play the online co-op or multiplayer modes, you really want to think twice before paying full price for this game. Single players either need to rent this or wait for an inexpensive used copy to go on sale.So you get three game options: Special Ops (online isn't necessary, but at least two players are required for some of the missions), Multiplayer (designed to be played online; this is no fun split-screen with a max of 4 players), and the single player Campaign that took me less than 6 hours to finish.In single player Campaign mode, you're a first person shooter (soldier) on the frontlines, and this time the frontlines aren't limited to overseas territories. Primarily you're playing separate, interlacing missions all over the world as two different characters. The story takes place several years after CoD 4 ended. And just as in CoD 4 you're with a team of characters that are truly your band of Artificial Intelligence brothers. On easier settings the AI soldiers can do practically all of the work for you on some missions; the help you might get from your team is based on the difficulty setting you've chosen. So unless you want to just glide through the game, definitely don't pick the Recruit difficulty (the other difficulty options are Regular, Hardened and Vet).I could take away a star from the overall score of this game for how short the single player mode is, but I won't....All of a sudden it's not so short when you go back and try to play on the Vet setting and spend the time looking for all of the Intel items.You arrive in single player boot camp just like in all of the previous CoDs, and you get a brief tutorial on how to maneuver around, shoot your weapons & throw grenades. After boot camp you get to choose the difficulty setting, then you're immediately strewn into various battles. (Once you've completed the game on any setting you can go back to various chapters to clean up any items or trophies missed, and at the start of each chapter you can choose to attempt on the higher difficulties.)You fight your way through some intense chapters....really intense. In fact, when you first start off, there's even a warning that you'll be in for some VERY disturbing sequences, and you have the option to tell the game to skip \"offensive material\". Ummm...no thanks. I think that this is the first game that I've played that offers the option to censor itself if you choose the option. The story is a bit choppy at times, but the battles are wild. The graphics are out of this world, and some of the \"familiar territory\" scenes will just blow you away with how much it really looks like your own back yard.The weapons are plentiful and sophisticated. You're shooting whichever modern-day weapon you happen to have picked up along your objective route. Objectives that guide you along are updated regularly as you complete each task throughout each chapter. And some of those tasks are brutal. There are frequent checkpoints (I think I remember even reaching new checkpoints without firing a single shot) in the campaign, so no need to worry about respawning back before what seemed to take an eternity to complete. On the other hand........There is the Special Ops portion of the game. I think that there are 23 different missions for you here, and you can play each one by trying to earn 1, 2 or 3 stars in each mission. Some of these are darn hard, especially the final 3-star unlocks. You will be frustrated by playing some of these a few times before you beat the levels to earn your stars. And there are no checkpoints in these missions, so if you fail in the final moments of a mission, you start over from the beginning of that mission.Special Ops is most fun with a partner. It's best online so that you get to play full screen, but if you have a guest over you can play split screen offline. For all you World at War players looking for Zombies, you're out of luck here. You get Special Ops instead. There was a silly rumor that MW2 would have an \"Alien Invaders\" mode that would rival the Zombie mode of WaW, but that indeed was just a silly rumor.Online Multiplayer is where you'll get addicted. No AI brothers here...just your fellow gamers. You'd better have your FPS skills honed if you think that you'll score better than some of the MW2 online players. A very high percentage of the online players have been honing their skills online for years now with CoD4 and World at War.The concept with Multiplayer is certainly not new. The more you play, the higher you rank allowing you to unlock more (fine tuned) weapons. The game sets you up in matches with people at your level and rank, but that ain't gonna help you if you're new (you will be fondly referred to as a noob by your swell fellow online players) and you're up against the CoD4 or WaW vets.What makes MW2 Multiplayer more than just a new map pack for CoD4 is that the Multiplayer weapons and perk system are vastly improved. And so is connectivity (so it seems in the initial week of play after a few day one and two glitches). You get 10 times the amount of points for the kills and captures that you're used to getting only 5 or 10 points for in CoD4 and WaW. You also now get points for not just killing and capturing, but for taking out enemy air support, coming back from deathstreaks, killing your nemesis, breaking an enemy's streak and other stuff.  Yeah, Multiplayer is good fun, habitual and bad for a marriage.So all in all Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is major fun. The only drawbacks to this awesome game are that the campaign is really short and the multiplayer action is a bit familiar. But the MW2 Multiplayer improvements over its predecessors far out weigh the familiarity.Modern Warfare 2 is a must for FPS fans. Add it to your cart, soldier!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2009"}

{"product_name":"B001AWIP68","reviewerName":"JD","summary":"Just not quite there...","reviewText":"I really, really wanted to give this game 5 stars.  I absolutely loved Call of Duty 4.  The single player and multiplayer just blew me away.  I was hoping that I would have the same experience with this game - only this time in the WW2 setting.So why did it fall short.  It is hard to point to any one thing that they did wrong.  On its own this game merits decent praise.  It just isn't quite as good as CoD4.For one, I miss the precise graphic qualities of CoD4.  I'm tired of playing a WW2 game where the view is artificially grittier than it needs to be.  On my hi-def TV CoD4 was amazing in its clarity. With CoD5 it appears grainy.  Enemies are harder to spot, terrain is easier to run into, sights are harder to aim, etc.  This is something I feel has hampered many WW2 shooters.Secondly, the game is uglier than I felt it needed to be.  The opening scene of the first mission was OK on me as an adult, but knowing how many 12 year olds are going to play this game, it bothered me that they felt it necessary to push to that level.  Maybe I'm getting sensitive in my older years.Another draw back was the shortness of the campaign.  You can crank the difficulty up and that will slow you down some though.The standard multiplayer is still fun.  I don't like the vehicles - to me they felt too forced in and unrefined.  In a game focused on infantry fighting infantry the vehicles don't seem to fit into the rules well.  This appears to be a common complaint and I've played with groups who simply avoid the vehicles altogether because it is just funner without them.The game is still a great game and the above is mostly nit-picking.  I'm still having a blast playing it.  Last night a friend introduced me to the 4-player co-operative campaign and that is so fun I can't believe not every game has such a feature.  It makes me wish the enemy AI was smart enough to use suppression fire, flanking, etc. so your team could focus on being more tactical but I guess that multiplayer already gives you that.In the end, this game is highly recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2008"}

The story is very well written and the voice work is great! This game had the best hand to hand combat of a sandbox game I've ever played and the gunplay is seemless and powerfull.  I got this for PC and have a system that allows me to boost settings all the way up and lemme tell ya, it's beautiful!! Especially with the PhysX turned on high.  The clothes sway and move the way they would in real life and stuff like explosions and weather effect how it reacts as well. Even without the PhysX the game looks spectacular. But graphics aside, like I said, this game was fun. I beat the story in about 11 hours of game play with little to no straying from the story so if you choose to look for Playboys and Wanted posters there's plenty hours of enjoyment. There are 2 reasons I gave this a 4 instead of 5 stars though.  First, no multiplayer. This would've been a great game to run around in with your friends either co-op or at least versus. And with so many games including sandbox types having some form of multiplayer these days, it seems it should be standard.  The other reason 4 instead of 5 is lack of any side missions.  The only real thing to do besides work your way through the story is rob shops which you have to do later in the game anyway. Yeah there's a guy who has you steal cars but after the first one he keeps telling me to come back another time.  And there's very little customization as far as clothing however there's more than you'd expect for car customization so there's a plus. Fun game, buy if you like gangster movies and sandbox games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2010"}

Taking advantage of the power of the PS3.  But, the voice acting, not so good.  The plot, not really original.  What annoyed me more was when you are forced to hear the dialogue even when you ignore the little Elika icon.  This game puts you in a great world of ruins, and when you heal the lands, everything turns from dark, gray, barren to green lush and full of life.  Really cool.  The animation is excellent.  I just wish the game play itself wasn't so repetitive.  The music was very well performed.  My son actually liked some of the songs themselves.The Prince looked kind of odd.  His body proportions were unnatural and looked kinda funny.  Elika on the other was done very well.  So, they kind of mismatched on that part.  The combat play wasn't all that great.  After a while it became boring.  I really wanted to like this game.  I got it from a rental, so I'm glad I didn't buy it.I'm going to try Prince of Persia The Forgotten Sands, and if that doesn't deliver, well, the Prince will be no more....at least on my PS3.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2010"}

Already a huge hit in Japan, the game ramps you up and then wages an all-out war.

The multiplayer mode links up to four players in a variety of riveting scenarios designed to stretch your strategy skills.","reviewerName":"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","summary":"Really addictive!","reviewText":"When I first heard of this game, I was a bit skeptical. Although a big fan of real-time strategy, I never much liked turn-based strategy games. Such PC titles as Civilization, Alpha Centauri, and Imperialism just didn't spark my interest when I tried them, and so I didn't think Advance Wars would. Whether it was the eye candy or the higher emphasis on combat over resources, this game has succeeded in completely arresting my attention.Admittedly, there aren't very many turn based strategy games for any portable console, and few enough strategy titles in general. However, it will be a very long time before anything comes out that's better than this, and I'm sure many will try after the success of this game. It's incredibly addictive, and with the map creator has superior replayability. What's more, the multiplayer mode is actually worth using, unlike with most other GBA games!The game's mechanics are pretty straightforward- you have to either destroy all the enemy's units or capture their command center. Usually you'll have to at least threaten to do one or the other to accomplish either objective. There are a lot of different units, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. You can repair and resupply units at bases, or ferrying supplies by transport. Advance Wars benefits from an excellent, in-depth tutorial that covers everything you have to know to play, including basic strategy. Once you have learned how to control your army, you can start the extensive single play campaign or go head to head with friends. Due to its turn-based nature, you can even play with friends using a single GBA unit, switching off at each person's turn. Up to four people can play in this manner, on premade or up to three user-generated maps.If you're into strategy, this is the best mobile strategy game out there so far. Advance Wars is sure to awaken the genre, and  is already a classic.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2002"}

Contoured perfectly to fit a player's hand,The Wii Nunchuk (left) connects directly to the Wii remote.View larger.the Nunchuk controller builds on the simplicity of the Wii Remote controller. The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance. Just be careful not to knock out your significant other, or bruise the dog, severely, while using one, or two Nunchuk controllers.","reviewerName":"Enjolras","summary":"Fun, but not used much","reviewText":"The nunchuk is light and easy to use, but unfortunately isn't used in many games.

No matter how much time you put into levelling up your party members, their skill sets will never get better.  You aren't allowed to upgrade your party members' equipment.

I had never played Bookwork before playing it on the DS, and can't figure out how I missed this game until now.  You are given a board with letter tiles on it, and have to connect adjacent letters to form words.  The best part about Bookworm is that the learning curve is very easy.  It takes about 10 minutes of playing to fully understand the rules. The second best thing is the playability of it.  Unlike DS games that are done after 20-30 hours of play, Bookworm is randomized, so this is a game you could feasibly play for hundreds of hours and still enjoy.  Lastly, it's the type of game that you can pick up and play for 10-15 minutes and be done. You don't have to invest hours at a time.  Not only are you having fun, but you're increasing your vocabulary and brain power at the same time, since you are actively engaging your mind instead of hitting buttons over and over.As to the DS version, it is easily the best out there right now. The stylus is perfect for Bookworm DS, and this version contains added game play that I didn't see on the online Bookworm site.  My only complaint with it is that it appears to be designed for a right-handed person (all the tiles are on the right screen and the bookworm is on the left), and I am left-handed, which made it a bit awkward. I could figure out no way to change this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2010"}

{"product_name":"B004NRN5DU","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"Julia","summary":"So difficult, it's mesmerizing","reviewText":"I read a million reviews for this game before purchasing it. I have so many games I need to finish, that I just needed this one to be amazing to get it.And it is.This game is fantastic.This review is long, so I will section it out.**Appearance: The graphics aren't perfect, I will admit, but they're definitely not a problem (like, not bad enough to be distracting, just decent). However, I can entirely understand why this is true--the game is HUGE. And I don't just mean huge like there are a lot of doors to go through, I mean that it basically loads the entire game when you enter the main map. It's an understatement to say that the game is extremely interconnected. Once you get to the main map, you will find out exactly how far you can go without hitting a door, or anywhere where the map transitions. There are about 6 or 7 (I have yet to complete the map, so that number can be higher) different cities in the main map, and you don't ever hit a loading screen to transition to any of them. It is insane, and remarkable. It baffled me when I discovered all of these cities because I had never seen a game (I don't recall) this intricate before. If you don't believe me, you can always look up videos of this game. Basically, for being as huge as this map is, the graphics are stunning. But in general, they're decent.**Battles: The battles are actually very nice. I have never had a glitch of any sort (like if I attack and it was supposed to hit the enemy but it didn't), but they are pretty average as far as these types of games go. As for the items, weapons, and magic that can be used, it is quite unique (black firebombs, for example, are intriguing and awesome). I should warn that the enemies are capable of having the exact same items / weapons / magic that you can have, so you'll need to get used to having a lot of versatility in your enemies' fighting repertoire.**Enemies: I was going to mush this into the battles section, however I feel it needs its own review. The enemies are staggeringly difficult. They range from intermediate / hard to virtually impossible. I can promise you, if you get this game, you will battle in the same area hundreds of times just to level up for the bosses to become mildly tolerable. To many people, I can see this as being a huge turn off. My friend played an area twice, died both times, exclaimed how ridiculous the game was, then proceeded to throw the controller across the room. He obviously has no patience. I would normally feel this way--but from reading the reviews (and being prepared on the difficulty of the game), I became humble. I knew I would have to work hard to succeed at all at this game, and thus I was not surprised in the slightest. These enemies, and bosses, especially, are exactly everything that people say they are. This game has a crazy learning curve, and yet to me, that's why I love it so much. I have never been so challenged by a game, and it truly tests my abilities (and patience). Be warned--if you can't accept defeat in games (well, if you can't, then you should be advised against playing games in general), then you really should not get this game.**Plot: eh...there really isn't a plot in this game. At least, not quite. It exists as a subtle background, and they give you enough of a plot to keep you informed as to why you are killing the enemies and doing what you should be doing, but that's basically it. There is only one real cut scene I have encountered so far, and it was only being carried from the introduction map to the main map. The people you can converse with are few and far between. Other than the merchants, about half of those people speak in complete gibberish, and the remainder speak in riddles. At this point, if I see someone, I don't even talk to them until my curiosity overwhelms me, because I know in my gut they have absolutely nothing to say. If you need a plot, then this isn't the game for you. Although, I personally love plot, and strongly prefer this game without it. I believe that plot in addition to the rough enemies would make this game too hectic and possibly even uncomfortably manic.**Online play: I am not a fan of the online aspect of this game. The reasons for this are 1. Because on frequent occasion, when you are already trying desperately to level up, a contemptibly high leveled player will invade your territory and kill you mercilessly. Then, well, all of your souls are gone and you need to battle the same enemies you just battled (without dying again!!) to get back to your bloodstain to collect those precious souls. And 2. People can freely write tips and hints on the ground. They can say anything. And so the ground is scattered with these messages that are, much more often than not, useless.

I would play this game offline, until you are at a high enough level to immediately incinerate everything that crosses your path.

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"Midnight Distortions \"Cloud\"","summary":"4 months & still #58 in sales","reviewText":"I laugh at those who thought this was the worst FF ever, because even after 4 months it's still in the amazon top 100 in videogames. So think what you want this game has done what Square wanted it to do, despite the carelessness for their fans it sets the bar for Versus. I still am impressed by this game.Ok, before i begin this is probably the first Final Fantasy that i have come across that has 2-3 hours of cutscenes after cutscenes (in the first 2-3 chapters) Chapter 4 opens up (about 5-7hrs). It doesnt' take 30 hours for the game to open up either like 'other reviers' have said. It might however take about 30 hours to get to the sidequests & for the game to be more non-linear.And first off Square's decision to go linear started with FFX. Even some of the previous games like FFVI took about 5 hours to let you explore on your own. But... thats not the point. Square's vision of Final Fantasy has always been about storytelling & people knock it down like its 'cheap' & has lack of substance. If people stopped to think, hey well maybe theres a reason why Final Fantasy creates these stories. And infact the story tells it all, and even should hint to some the reason why some people fear others. And i have always known Square to write epic stories & the reasoning behind them. I even see some reviews that are like 'this is more of a movie then a game'. Well i guess you havent played the others. Including the first full epic storyline FF game (for the USA) FFIV. They coudln't do the voice-overs, epic cutscenes & amazing graphics like they could now. Many people don't know this but Square takes pride in the games they make. They work really hard to make it look good & most people won't even glance at it without saying, wow that game looks.. horrible. I however have been excited about seeing this game since '05 the first visuals i have seen for it. And yes this is the best FF game i have played in a long time.  They either must have done the storyline back when FFIV or VI existed or they decided to write something similar to the games of the old (except for maybe the addition of technology)I feel flashbacks of nostolgia when i play this game. And not that the other FF games were bad they just seemed to either become monotoneous or they just didn't have a way to re-spark or reboot the series. The day before the release i saw an online ad about this game that said something like this \"Would you want to save a world that doesn't want you\". That's basically the entire theme for the story. People like the main character, Lightning is exiled to 'Pulse' because the people of 'Cocoon' fear I'Cie people. And they wish any who become I'Cie to be exterminated. I won't get too far into detail for fear of spoilers.Now, again Final Fantasy is not about having the 'coolest storylines' in the world & therefore you will most ilkely find characters like 'Snow' for an example who players already may hate him, maybe hate him even more once you play the first couple of hours but again, there's a whole point to that. Square is telling it how it is. Storylines & the main characters in it are not supposed to be all heroes or all perfect & such. The crazy thing is someone said 'im not playing this game cuz i hate one of the characters in it'. Yeah, is that really going to deter you from playing it in the first place!? Or is it all talk.Anyways i hope i addressed that part fairly clearly. If your still unsure how you feel about this game, RENT IT! You really shouldn't miss out on this game just because of 'bad reviews' or as i like to call it 'bad reviewers'. Many of the reviews i have seen for this game, condridacts themeselves too much, which leads to wonder are they just trying to act cool like this is a good game but yet it has many flaws they cant stand? And it might have been done unintentially & i have been guilty of that too. But, my point is, don't listen to reviews.. use it as a baseline & to see whether or not this game is worth the time for you. And even if not, try a couple of hours renting the game & finding out if the story appeals to you after awhile. It does take up to 10 hours for a decent understanding of the story & you may or may not be hooked on it by that time.Story: 10 (this gets a perfect 10 but i think its mostly because i understand what Square is trying to 'say', its a work of art!)-Now the graphics are the best i have seen in 'any' game period. Maybe other then crysis but this game takes the cake in resolution. Im not a huge gamer as i do prefer to stick to several series mostly cuz i don't have the time for gaming as much anymore but as always Square manages to pull of great graphics. You can even see their (eye) 'pupils' move & thats 'in game graphics'. Not CG. Well im sure the CG has it too & the nice thing about this game is there is hardly any difference between the real game & the CG animation. There is a difference if you look close enough but Square manages to try to keep it unnoticeable even to the trained eye. I have noticed there are some frame rate glitches where it looks as if someone reduced the speed of a cutscene (not CG) & its annoying as ever. At least i am annoyed by it but i think its mostly cuz now i think there's something wrong with my ps3.Graphics: 9.2/10 (I'd give it a perfect 10 if i didn't get the frame rate glitch)-The battle game mechanics have been well done & however i am a bit dissapointed you can only control one character at a time at least Square did an amazing job with the autofunction for the other characters. Sometimes though i feel like its not up to par at times mostly bc for an example you have 2 characters that are getting low on health.. usually you would heal the person with the least amount of HP.. well i noticed that sometimes thats not always the case, sometimes they'll do it randomly. Its very minimal & i almost wouldn't worry too much. The nice thing is you can use a potion & it'll heal every1 so if you are low on health use a potion. In previous Final Fantasies i usually didn't bother with them after you obtain cure. And potions are pretty common so its fitting to use them. I like how Square did away with the MP & just have magic as an ability, so you don't have to worry about running out of juice. Another glitch i think i found or maybe something didn't go right but sometimes certain Paradigm selections don't work correctly or the caster in your party doesn't cast the right spell to effectively chain attack an enemy. But, i found to change Paradigms to another then back usually corrects that. Cuz otherwise you'd be spending a good 6 minutes trying to kill a foe that only is weak against one thing. The strategy guide book doesn't really clarify what weakness a certain enemy has, only to use a certain Paradigm. All the more reason to figure it out by trial & error. And controlling your character around the world is simple & easy.Gameplay: 9/10 (again either glitches or im doing something wrong that just makes it a bit harder to win battles effectively).Music: 9.4/10 - Music is amazing in this game its not making my ears bleed & yes Square does do thier music well.Overall i think this is a great game & even though it does have a linear path & i think people just have a hard time adjusting to it to where you can go to certain areas & explore a massive world, going to towns & talking to people. This game doesn't have it. You could even talk to people in FFX most of the time. But to me this is a real adventure just being in the middle of nowhere & where the characters are not compeletely sure where they are going either. Again if your not sure just rent the game & see for yourself on whether or not you'll like it. Even for those who don't even find interest in this game after all the bad reviews, i highly suggest renting this game, unless your completely against linear gameplay which i think is a minor setback.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"Nader","summary":"Fantastic console! But buyer beware","reviewText":"First of all, I'd like to state that you should take all these reviews on this product with a grain of salt. Although the PS4 is indeed experiencing some hardware diffuculty, vis-a-vis bricked consoles, faulty hardware, a lot of reviews on here are just clear trolling from the \"rival\" console fans, or Xbox One supporters. It seems rather juvenile so many people would resort to these antics on a consumer forum like Amazon, but it is what it is.That being said, I received my console from Amazon on Friday morning, and it's been truly fantastic. Fortunately, mine has had absolutely no issue. It's been a delight. However, keep in mind, like with every piece of new technology released, there are risks associated with early purchase. The average faulty hardware rate of modern electronics is around 3-5% (Sony has claimed that the percentage of faulty PS4s at this stage is around 0.4%, but take that with a grain of salt).Thing is, you might get a bricked console, or you might get a perfect one. The question is whether or not you want to put yourself through that stress and situation. It's up to you. I did, and it worked out great for me!P.S: Amazon packaging is HORRENDOUS for this item. It's shipped in a large cardboard box, with the only transit protection being minimal large bubble wrap (maybe that's contributing to the high broken console rate seen in Amazon shipments?).

If you didn't already know, while Mario and Luigi are immensely popular even till this day, it has been almost 15 years since they last appeared in a side-scrolling adventure. The brothers have ventured into racing, golf, tennis, soccer, and what have you. They've taken on aliens and travelled through time in other outings. They've even suffered the fate of being captured by their nemesis, only to be rescued by Princess Peach. All these are notable expansions of the brothers' career, but what many fans really wanted was to simply play through a brand new side-scrolling Mario game, updated with current technologies. And Nintendo have responded. New Super Mario Bros. for the DS is the game that brings the brothers back to where they began, and boy, what a ride it is!All the ingredients that made the early Super Mario Bros. games great are found in New Super Mario Bros. The storyline, the gameplay and the level designs are all reminiscent of the classic titles. The plot goes that Princess Peach is (once again) captured, and Mario is (once again) on his way to save her. Zero marks for creativity here, but that's beside the point. The franchise is never well known for groundbreaking story-telling, and for a game returning to its roots, it's only right that Nintendo are sticking to a tested-and-trusted formula. What really stands out in this game is that, apart from the expected involvement of simpler features from the originals, it also includes a large amount of advancements. Now, the DS may not be a PSP, but it's still strong enough to carry out the ideas that Nintendo wanted. The result is an instant hit featuring great gameplay, killer presentations, and a whole lot of fun.Mario's quest is broken up into eight worlds, and as usual, these worlds are in turn broken up into various levels. You'll approach these levels in a linear fashion via a world map, much like how you used to (and I hope you've!) approach Super Mario Bros. III. Within these levels, you'll then have to do the mandatory running, jumping and bouncing to reach the end of the level within a time limit. Along the way, Mario will encounter familiar enemies, bricks that contain power-ups and coins, as well as the secret areas and shortcuts. Of course, the path to the end of each level isn't a bed of roses, and the game does throw in some difficult challenges as you progress further into it. As such, despite the game's simplicity, you may find yourself running out of time as you attempt to navigate environmental puzzles, explore secrets in each level, collect rewards and beat enemies, while trying to reach the flag pole in time. All in a day's work for Mario, I guess. And, if you're wondering whether you've read correctly, yes, I mentioned the term \"flag pole\". This end-of-the-level checkpoint is, of course, homage to the original Super Mario Bros. game. And, if you happen to do something right during the level, you'll also trigger the end-of-level fireworks, which is yet another tribute to its origins.Within a level itself, you'll come across some sort of a \"midway point\". Not all levels have midway points, but once you reach one, the game will inform you by showing off a flag icon. The beauty of this feature is that, if you fail to get to the flag pole successfully thereafter, you can restart the level from this point, instead of having to engage the level right from the start. A similar feature appears on the world map, in the form of a tower. This tower is primarily the midway point of a world, and it's mostly (if not all) guarded by Baby Bowser. Defeating him will lead to an opportunity for you to save your game. At the end of a world, a castle beckons, and, as you may've expected, they're are guarded by a host of bosses. The surprise here is that these end-of-level boss fights do not consist solely of battles against Bowser Sr., which would be too cheap a trick to borrow from the past. Defeating a boss will bring you to the next world, as well as provide you with another opportunity to save your game. The distance between the save points, at times, may appear too far away. This is especially evident when you're playing on the run, and may not have the luxury to beat a few levels at one go. Considering that the DS is a handheld, Nintendo would do well to provide more save points along the way to cater for players who prefer to play the levels on short bursts.To make it easier for you to reach these save points, Mario is given an array of skills and items. He has his usual dashing, jumping and bouncing abilities. On top of that, he has some new skills that are mostly lifted from his later adventures. These include a wall-jump move, which allows him to bounce from wall-to-wall to reach higher grounds, as well as a downward pounce that he can use to do a (literally) ground-breaking action if the ground texture is made of bricks. The environments also provide many opportunities for Mario. Some pipes, like previous games, lead Mario into secret areas and shortcuts, while others simply toss him up into the air (a new feature). It's usually not a bad thing when that happens, because some obstacles can't be crossed without having Mario going air-borne,Talking about obstacles, New Super Mario Bros. also throws in some new traps that are previously unseen. One of these is a rocking mushroom that doubles up as a platform for Mario to manoeuvre. This sways from side-to-side, which essentially means that on each platform itself, Mario will have to experience an upward and downward slope in quick succession. Failing to jump to the next platform will simply result in a fall to death, so sharp reflexes are definitely a must if you want to end the level unscathed.Thankfully, the game does supply a fair amount of 1-Up mushrooms for you. Amassing 100 coins will net Mario another life. Unlocking a Toad House may net you a chance for many, many 1-Up mushrooms. Bearing in mind that an additional 1-Up mushroom equates to an additional chance for you to make it to the next save point alive, you'll just have to hope that you can figure out how to unlock a green Toad House regularly!On the subject of mushrooms, Mario is also given some news power-ups. The usual Power-up Mushrooms and Fire Flowers are still around, but Mario can now use a Mega Mushroom to transform himself into a supersized menace. In this size, Mario can bulldoze through a level without having to avoid any enemies, since they'll bounce off him and meet their maker when they're in his way. When Mario goes on a run in this size, blocks and pipes get destroyed along the way. A five-notched meter also grows at the top of the screen as he goes on the rampage. Each notch on this meter will drop 1-Up Mushroom when the giant-sized effect is up, giving you yet more chances of staying alive.Apart from the Mega Mushroom, Mario can pick up a Koopa Shell, and turn himself into... a Koopa! The selling point of this power-up is that Mario can hide within the shell and do a quick dash, sweeping any enemies along the way like what a Koopa Shell usually does. The shrinking concept in Zelda: The Minish Cap also finds a way into New Super Mario Bros. as another form of power-up. A Mini Mushroom will shrink Mario down to ant-sized, and in this form, he can go past small gaps, and enter small pipes. Because he's so light in this size, he can walk on water, and also jump higher than before. All these power-ups are scattered around each level, so, depending on the need, you'll find Mario changing into many forms even within a level. The only pity is that the Racoon Suit power-up, so useful in Super Mario Bros. III, is not in the game. Nevertheless, the innovative use of power-ups makes the game a more than lively experience.Games incorporating a multi-player mode are common nowadays. New Super Mario Bros. has one as well, and it's called the Mario vs. Luigi mode. No prize for guessing what that means! This mode allows two players to face off wirelessly in customized levels. In these games, both players must fight against each other in the quest to amass Big Stars. You can set the number of wins required to win a Mario vs. Luigi game; the numbers of Big Stars required for victory; as well as the number of lives each brother will have. You can also select from a few designated levels to do the battles in, so the choice is entirely up to you. The good thing is, a Mario vs. Luigi game can be played on a single card via download play, so all you need is a friend with a DS, and a New Super Mario Bros. cartridge to begin your quest for boasting rights.New Super Mario Bros. also has a 4-player Minigames mode. As with the Mario vs. Luigi mode, this also allows for a single cartridge to host 4 players simultaneously. These games are mostly recycled from Super Mario 64 DS, but they're equally fun when you're engaging them with friends. Unfortunately, the game doesn't support online play like Mario Kart DS. It's not exactly a big loss, but not everyone has the time to meet up for a wireless multi-playing session.While the game is billed as a \"2D side-scrolling adventure\", its graphics are actually made up of a mixture of 2D and 3D images. Mario himself, for example, is a fully 3D model. The backgrounds are mostly 2D, but some side effects are 3D as well. I mean, since the DS does have the engine to run 3D graphics, why lay it to waste? This combination works wonder in providing more depth to the otherwise bland 2D nature of the earlier Mario games. Yet, the 3D features are not too overwhelming to an extent that the look and feel of these games are lost. The audios in New Super Mario Bros. are also gloriously composed, providing a fair amount of old and new music and effects to complement the various levels nicely. Some of the boss fights even include Zelda-styled boss themes, which add tremendous appeal to the game.For all its goodness, New Super Mario Bros. falls short in the length department. Even with eight worlds to engage, some clever use of blast cannons, warp zones and short-cuts will cut your play time even shorter. The game can probably be completed in a day, so gamers who prefer a long and epic adventure may be critical of its overly short game time. Nevertheless, Nintendo has gone on record saying that they'd like to make shorter, simpler games, so it's not exactly a surprise when this game actually backs the company's vision up.I must admit that \"New Super Mario Bros.\" is not a very appealing title. The game, however, turns out to be an awesome adventure that not only plays well, but also pays great tribute to the series' origins without making you feel that it's overdoing it. The game is a testament of how a 2D side-scroller should be; and, regardless of how you feel about its short lifespan, seeing Mario back in a side-scrolling platformer should be incentive enough for you to pick this one up.Sidetrack: The design of first level of New Super Mario Bros. is loosely based on the first level of the original Super Mario Bros., albeit enhanced with modern touches. Breezing through it brings back the memory of me trying to \"hit a brick for coins\" after playing the game. Ouch.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2006"}

This is something of a hybrid FPS/Strategy game with plenty of action and periods of \"down\" time where you figure out your next move/mission. I like that. Most shooters have you blasting away continuously so this shooter is different in that respect. But I think it is great game. Graphics and sound are extraordinary and there is plenty of action. There are many missions so far and I have barely touched the surface of the game. There isn't a huge variety of weapons but there are lots of ammo upgrades that increase the power and lethality of the available weapons. The monsters are really creepy and the game can be a bit scary at times when something pops out of nowhere and attacks.

I played on the lowest settings, and I recommend Alienware, something with really powerful processing power and cooling abilities. I own a laptop HP pavillion G series that is for college, not gaming. Well Starcraft II still looks like a highend Xbox game!I dived right into the campaign, and was absorbed into the game. It feels like Star Wars, with tough good guys, and a wild west in outerspace setting. The developers have tapped into the galaxy of Starcraft, and dug in deeper into a story that is mysterious, and fascinating. It is like a well made science fiction movie.The soundtrack is the next thing that really impressed me. Although my Pavilion had some sound problems in the menu's, like the sound being inconsistent, there is so much to appreciate in the full orchestra that fills your ears and adds beauty to what you see by creating an epic climate that the high quality story deserves. In certain moments they take a different music style, and play neo-western songs that remind you of the gunslinger universe of Starcraft.The gameplay is about what I expected. It plays smooth, and there aren't major changes here, nor is there a dramatic change stylistically. There are new units to learn, and possibly new techniques to consider for online gaming, but I am not the best reviewer to go over the finer details of starcraft strategy. It is intimidating to work my way into the online community, even with the new system of classifying your level and placing you in the appropriate one. It takes guts, smarts, time, and humility to become serious with Starcraft online. It is one of the most competitive games ever online.I am already finding awesome replays on Youtube, which says to me that it is finding the pro-gamers who are out there. It may one day be represented at the WCG, but I hardly doubt that it will replace the original Starcraft as it is mastered, and will always be the most awesome challenge between hardcore gamers across the globe.The online features are incomplete and fans have many complaints, such as there being no chatroom. I log onto Battlenet about once every three days and there is an update needed. Starcraft II is going through many required changes at the moment, and it is something you must anticipate if you are going to buy this. It will take some time to work out all the bugs, but there is alot to offer by way of campaign.Starcraft II is a gorgeous game with presentations so far above my salary level, that I can only dream how good it is possible of being. But for all of you out there with average, school computers, you can play this game. I really recommend that you take it easy and limit yourself to only a few games at a time. My laptop is very hot after playing even one mission. It works my computer harder than any game or program ever has. This game is highly enjoyable, and because of the legendary status of this franchise, its fans expect only the best. I recommend this game as it has a very enjoyable story, and many things to appreciate.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8LR","description":"WhenLuigi's Mansionwas first announced, many assumed it would  follow in the legendary footsteps ofSuper Mario WorldandSuper Mario  64. The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy. If  only it were a bit longer.--David Jenkins. --Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Inspector Gadget \"Go Go Gadget Reviews\"","summary":"Very fun, very cute little game","reviewText":"While Mario gets zillions of games to himself every year, it's not often that Luigi gets his own lead, unless you countMario is Missing!.In this lovely little game Luigi goes Ghostbusting in a haunted mansion (one of those Scooby-Doo types) that he has mysteriously won in a competition he didn't even enter. The mansion is crawling with spooks of all kinds but Luigi gets help from a crackpot inventor living nearby. Now armed with a special vacuum cleaner, Luigi must clear every room in the mansion by hoovering-up spooks, and find his missing brother, who has apparently vanished inside.The gameplay is simple and very easy to get the hang of. Some of the rooms you clean up require some extra investigation and puzzle solving so be sure to check everything (I thought the piano room was a cool puzzle to solve) and use your Gameboy Horror to have a good look round.The graphics in Luigi's Mansion may not be up to the standard ofSuper Mario Galaxy 2but they're still very, very smooth and look amazing. Some of the SFX look highly realistic and there's no loading times at all between scenes. The music sounds like it's been done on a Commodore 64 and doesn't sound all that great but it's a cute little theme and I thought it was very funny when Luigi would whistle it whenever it wasn't playing.The mansion itself isn't that big and you'll finish the game in about a week, but when you have this much fun playing it is still worthwhile.Graphic B+Sound BGameplay B+Lasting Appeal B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2005"}
{"product_name":"B001D7T2XK","reviewerName":"A. A. BADER \"Q8  AL BADER\"","summary":"Dont buy it.....Very, very disappointing!!","reviewText":"When I first heard about this game I had mixed expectations. I once bought a WWE Legends game for the PS2 and was bitterly disappointed by the lack of moves and the clumsy controls. I was hoping that this latest Legends game would stick more closely to the Smackdown vs Raw control system which allows a much greater variation of moves.I played the demo for WWE Legends of Wrestlemania from the PS network last night and sadly, the game fails to deliver.As far as I could figure out, you only have the option of 4 basic moves excluding irish whips, off the ropes etc: 2 quick grapples and 2 strong grapples. This is absolutely pathetic for a next generation wrestling game! The Smackdown vs Raw system offers at least 12 basic grapples with 3/4 more offerings from the turnbuckle, 3 more from the top rope as well as environment-specific attacks.This is not the only problem I found: the graphics, although good when performing moves etc, are jittery in other situations and makes the characters feel very wooden. Also, the chain grapple sequences where you need to press the correct button in order to beat your opponent to the punch are insanely unforgiving. For example, you need lightning quick reflexes in order to actually hit your opponent when you attempt to irish whip them. I have quite quick reflexes and I was only just managing to make the press in time.Lastly, I don't know what the other characters' finishers are like as I could only play as Hulk Hogan but his finisher was very uninspiring.Overall, unless the full game has made huge leaps forward from the demo version, this will be a really disappointing game and I most certainly will not be buying it. Hopefully at somepoint a decent legends game will be made which allows you to perform a good number of varied moves but this game is not it.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2009"}

Plus the Spin Dash is back.","reviewerName":"StevyJ","summary":"Quick Comparision, Wii U Vs. 3DS","reviewText":"I thought it was going to be a great game when I saw the previews for it and then it got a lot of bad reviews.  So I just decided to wait on the wii u version and get the 3ds one.  The movements on the 3ds version were a lot smoother than previous sonic games which were often very stiff IMO.  That along with his new moves, running up walls and the return of the spin dash made the gameplay seamless and complete.  Many of the levels on the 3ds were like mazes giving you a lot of options for exploration which was great unless your searching for red star rings.  The 3D levels were the best I've played on a sonic game ever something you just have to experience yourself.  The 2D levels were good with sonic but seemed to be designed for super sonic.  It has an online multiplayer race which can be very competitive and fun.  Every level in multiplayer can be mastered making the levels fast paced and fluid.  The overall game was actually very fast paced at times not much slower than previous sonic games IMO.So some people suggest that the 3ds version is the better version.  I found them both to be unique.  The wii u version was definitely slower paced and more deliberate overall but just as rewarding.  The wii u version seems more like a game you would play after a long day at school or work just to relax.  Although there were several paths you can take for each stage like in previous games they were not mazes like on the 3ds.  I often used the spin dash on the 3ds where as on the wii u it's something that was more optional or for intermediate players.  The graphics were good and often had me going &#34;Ooooh shiny&#34;.  I found the cutscenes to be boring on the wii u than on the 3ds, often just skipped.Overall I'm very satisfied with both versions and would say that this is the best sonic game since the genesis era.  They finally got it right.  One thing I can say is if you don't care for the wii u version don't count out the 3ds one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"Robb Boutros","summary":"Lock n' Load!! This one is wall to wall FUN!!","reviewText":"Take one little straight laced robot, team him up with one cool cat (an alien cat maybe?), send them on a quest to find a legendary hero, throw in some of the craziest weapons you've ever seen and what do you get? You get Ratchet and Clank for the PS2.At a time when games and gamers are taking themselves WAY too seriously, Ratchet and Clank is a breath of fresh air from Sony and Insomniac Studios. You are Ratchet. A humble cat (well he looks like a cat at least) living on a backwater planet scrounging for parts for your space ship. Suddenly a little robot falls from the sky. And before you can say another word the two of you are paired up on an adventure to find Captain Quark in order to save countless planets from the evil Chairman Drek. Sounds Silly? Well, it is! But that's why Ratchet and Clank is so much fun. It never takes itself too seriously. It really does poke alot of good natured fun at alot of the classic video game cliche's. The weapons have great names (the Pyracitor, Glove of Doom for instance) and are equally fun to use!The graphics on this game give you the feeling that it's something out of a Saturday morning cartoon. And believe me that's not a &quot;bad thing&quot;. The worlds are incredibley well rendered and detailed. Large city scapes, buzzing traffic, huge buildings. There's alot of detail here and the backgrounds aren't just static. You get the sense that these worlds are going about their day to day business. There's also alot of room to explore on these worlds. Which is part of what drives the game. It's part exploration and part action game. The story is moved along in the form of cutscenes which are quite humorous. You'll wish there was a rewind feature so you could watch them again. The sounds are also very crisp and clean. There are alot of different types of sounds working here but to their credit the programming team never makes it seem cluttered.The controls are very smooth and intuitive. After a very short learning curve (about maybe 30 minutes) you'll be blasting away. Ratchet's wrench can also be throw like a boomerang from a crouch. You might think that it would be difficut to aim but it's not. You can also fire weapons from a first person aiming mode. There are 36 different weapons in Ratchet and Clank. So there's no shortage of ways to blast the bad guys.In a time when video games have gotten almost too serious it's great to see a title that is a pure joy to play. Ratchet and Clank is one of those rare games that makes you smile from start to finish. There just aren't enough words to describe how much fun this game is. And for the new Greatest Hits price, there's no way you can go wrong with this title.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2004"}

At the same time, I was also a little weary. I used to LOVE the talent behind Obsidian. This, after all, is a studio formed by many of the top talent that formerly worked at Interplay and the much-venerated Black Isle Studios. Between 9 and 12 years ago, I went through some of the best gaming experiences thanks to the original Fallout games, Planescape: Torment and Icewind Dale. Despite this rich history, starting with Star Wars: KOTOR II Obsidian's products have become progressively worse. KOTOR II had a great story but was mired by several bugs and, well...depending on how you made certain choices, large chunks of the story towards the endgame unfolded without a shred of logic. Then they delivered Neverwinter Nights 2, which again had everything going for it, except for some horrendous bugs. At least one bug was game-breaking.It is the same story with Alpha Protocol. While the plot is serviceable, and the dialogue system is fairly engaging, the rest of the game leaves much to be desired. Graphics, character models and animations are clunky and laughable. From the very first trailer, the game looked long in the teeth. What is shocking is the fact that they used the Unreal 3.0 engine and still botched it up. No its not the best engine out there (*kaff* Crytek *kaff*), but its capable of building some pretty nifty looking worlds.The sound is very average. Personally I've heard worse voice acting, especially in some of the European imports. The music fits the mood (some plain Bond/Bourne rip-offs) but doesn't have much character.Gameplay is mostly bad, but there are a few bright spots. The gunplay is wonky - and is particularly frustrating if you, like myself, spent a couple of months earlier this year with Commander Shepard and Co. Mini-games like hacking get old fast, but that's a complaint I have about mini-games in a lot of RPGs. Surprisingly I like the time-limit in the dialogue choices. It really makes you feel like you are a spy under pressure and its quite a thrill to decide someone's fate in the space of 5 seconds. I also like the weapons/skill customization - which is fleshed out properly enough.A glaring hole is the (non-existent) artificial intelligence. My favorite bug is when baddies keep on climbing up and down the same ladder for no reason whatsoever.As far as plot goes...its okay. But then again story has never been Obsidian's weakness. I can see two reasons why Alpha Protocol turned out the way it did. One: Obsidian just wanted to shove this out the door when they inked the deal to develop Fallout New Vegas. And two: They just don't have a good game development process in place. Which is a pity, given the good writers on staff.I hope Obsidian is taking note as I am certainly not the only individual feeling this way. After this mess, I doubt I'll blindly go out and buy Fallout New Vegas - original developers or no (I am so bloody scared about how it turns out!) From now on, Obsidian is going to have to work hard to get my hard-earned money.My advice to prospective buyers: wait till the game hits the sub $30 mark - give it 6 to 12 months. Actually you are better of re-visiting an old RPG like The Witcher or something. Hell, fire up Dragon Age for the third time if you must! I know I did just to get the bad taste out of my mouth.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2010"}

Featuring detailed environments and complicated new battle mechanisms, this game demands a different kind of perspective than the first-person shooters from the original Halo series. You'll need to uncover the hidden strengths and weaknesses of each unit and play them to your tactical advantage, and that's just the beginning.UNSC: Be Part of a Legendary ConflictThe story opens with UNSC forces retaking the planet Harvest from the Covenant. At your disposal -- should you choose to take command of UNSC forces -- will be everything from a corps of highly-trained Marines to the Warthogs, Scorpions, and Hornets you'll need for air and land attacks. You'll take stock of the map and decide between holding your ground or advancing on enemy strongholds, all while trying to navigate the local terrain and outsmart Covenant forces. And when you need something extra to tip the tide in your favor, UNSC leaders can provide you with the ability to mobilize highly specialized units or call the Spirit of Fire vessel for support from above.Covenant: A Capable, Playable Enemy FactionThat's right, Covenant is playable in this corner of the Halo universe. This alliance of alien species has manipulated advanced technology, firepower, and tactical prowess into a powerful force that is engaged in a Genocidal war against human race, having branded humans as heretics. With the ability to play as these tough, alien fighters, you'll have advanced shield technology, the modular Citadel at the heart of Covenant's colonizing power, and, of course, the iconic Scarab attack vehicle at your disposal, adding a whole new dimension to your strategic warfare. The Scarab is a terrifying military vehicle crafted from heavy mining equipment. And with a mining laser that delivers massive damage across battlefields large and small, turrets for taking on air attacks, and the ability to clamber over any terrain, what's not to love about commanding Scarabs instead of fighting against them?Developed Exclusively for Xbox 360Most console RTS games are adapted from existing PC games, which can make their controls bulky or awkward, butHalo Warshas been developed for Xbox 360 from the ground up. This means the controls are sensitive, intuitive, and easy-to-operate in the midst of battle. And the UI is just as intuitive, so whether you're managing a unit of marines or a deadly machine, you can focus on creating a battle strategy instead of worrying about how to overcome a clumsy controller.No matter which faction you choose to play as, you can test your skills against those of other players in online skirmishes that allow up to six players with the New Xbox Experience through Xbox LIVE.","reviewerName":"Call me KID","summary":"changed my mind","reviewText":"This game is addictive even though it winds up being kind of simple compared to starcraft and warcraft, I'm playing story mode and it's the only game I've played for three days now, this game gets lousy reviews from some but as I said if you take it for what it is, it's kind of pretty fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2012"}

Some of you will love this game and others will absolutely hate it.  I fall somewhere in between.  This game reminds me heavily of Ubisoft's earlier Splinter Cell series on XBox 1.  Unfortunately, Assassin's Creed has more in common with the first Splinter Cell than the much improved Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory.SPOILER ALERT!Assassin's Creed has a really chaotic and messy story line.  The game opens with my Assassin killing an innocent man.  I promptly get chewed out by my two assassin friends for ignoring the \"Assassin's Creed.\"  My character responds that he does not like the rules and knows how to do the job better.  My companions lecture me further about how Assassins are really good guys that just happen to kill to achieve peace.  All of this sounds like a bizare Disney movie opening about the dangers of pride gone bad.  Then the game forces me into a confrontation that I know I should not be in.  My character has to enter a brightly lit room and take out 5 armed guys who are already facing my direction.  I know already this is a situation that my character should not be in and I am reluctant to move into such an obvious trap.  I'm an assassin.  I should be hiding in the shadows looking to kill in a stealthy manner.  I realized this bad situation is to have my assassin fail horribly and set up my character's fall from grace.After a few characters are supposedly killed, but turn out to be alive, the story moves on.  I get another lecture about how the Assassins are really good guys just trying to make the world a better place.  Is this game about a group of medieval boy scouts or a group of people who kill other people?  Does Ubisoft know what an assassin is?As you can tell, I hate the story.  It's poorly written crap.END OF SPOILERSThis game opens with a disclaimer about this game being written by a multi-cultural group of people with various religious backgrounds.  Basically, Ubisoft openly admits this game is controversial.  I believe this is also why the main game is sandwiched by sci-fi elements.  The main game would be just as good without the sci-fi stuff.  If the events of the game are simply a computerized simulation, then there is less reason to fuss over the controversy about a game set in the Holy Land.  I do applaud the attempt to cover a somewhat taboo subject of looking at the Crusades from an alternate viewpoint.  Anyone who plays this game needs to understand that your primary enemy in this game are the Knights Templar (a Catholic order).  Some people may be outraged by this fact.  By no means do I condone the open killing of any person or targeting of any religious group.The game mechanics are a little touchy.  They are decidely last-gen and lack the depth of other open world games.  For example, moving any faster than a slow trot on a horse means every guard in the area tries to take me out.  Did I miss the medieval speed limit signs?  Guards seem to notice me walking around even if I don't do anything illegal.  This frustrated me to no end.  Then I realized I'm wearing a uniform!  That's right, an assassin's uniform!  How cheesy!  Look at the rest of the guys in the assassin's village.  They are all wearing the same white hood!  Why would an assassin, who wants to remain anonymous, ever wear a stupid uniform?The gameplay is very repetitive.  Pickpocket, eavesdrop and beat info out of people.  It's like shampoo instructions.  (Lather, rinse, repeat.)  Only a small portion of the game is actually about killing people.  Perhaps, this appeals to people since you know what to expect.Okay...  On to good things.The graphics are pretty.  My assassin moves in a very fluid way.  He climbs buildings like Spider-Man.  The world of Assassin's Creed feels real.  You wander through a living, breathing land.My advice is this.  If you were a fan of Ubisoft's earlier Splinter Cell games, then you will probably love this game.  The rest of us should rent this game or play GTA IV.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2008"}

Graphics this good have not been seen on any system to date and there is quite a bit of technique and things to unlock.  Project Gotham does not lack variety and you'll be challenged to keep improving your times and abilities to move on or to unlock new things like new cars and helmets.  The game takes advantage of the Xbox internal clock so after X amount of hours played (or miles driven) you are rewarded with a new helmet or a new track!  Most cool!!The only fault I can find with this game is that it truly requires an investment of the player's time and patience.  Each car handles slightly differently and the ultimate trick is knowing the advantages and disadvantages of each car's powersliding ability which is a big part of the KUDOS scoring system.  To fully unlock every level and to earn all golds, it will require master-level skill and technique which many casual gamers do not possess and will quickly grow tired of failing or bored of the various stages.  Definitely not for someone prone to throwing controllers in frustration!If you want to get a sense of the XBOX can do, get this game.  If you like your racing game to give you a variety of tasks/stages and you enjoy chipping away at your games via unlocking and gradual learning, Project Gotham is for you.  If you are a casual gamer and not someone who enjoys the thought of replaying the same scene over and over again to get that elusive passing score, then Project Gotham is NOT for you.

{"product_name":"B000E991PC","description":"In Okami, the legendary monster Orochi has come back to life and turned the world into a veritable wasteland. Players become a wolf, an embodiment of the sun god Amaterasu -- the world lies in gamer's hands as they fight ominous beings and reclaim the earth from a curse that plagues it. It is crucial to help Amaterasu make the world a place where all living creatures can dwell once again.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"A Beautiful Masterpiece","reviewText":"Hands down, Okami is one of the finest Playstation 2 games ever made.  An engrossing story mixed with intricate gameplay make Okami a textbook example of how a game should be done.  Okami is a masterpiece that brings a huge world to life, and any action/adventure fan would be happy to have this title on their shelf.Okami centers on the legend of the Japanese sun god Amaterasu.  The game stays centered around Japanese tales.  You needn't know these stories to be engrossed in the games overall main story, though.  All you need to know from the get go is Amaterasu is the sun god reborn as a wolf to rid Japan of a demonic curse that has swept the land.  The God responsible for this was actually killed 100 years ago.  It's time to make sure history doesn't repeat itself, and it's up to Amaterasu to get rid of this evil God.  Amaterasu is joined by her companion Issun, who throughout the game will do all the talking, and also provides a nice sense of humor to the game.  At first the story is simplistic, but don't be fooled.  There are several subplots in the game that eventually become part of the overall story.  You'll do more than stop this curse from spreading across the land.  You'll rescue villages, battle fearsome monsters and everything epic in Okami.  It also helps that the game is a massive 30 hours of steady going gameplay.The story is mostly told through beautiful cutscenes, and quite a bit of dialogue.  None of the dialogue is directly spoken so you'll have to read it all.  It's unfortunate that a masterpiece such as Okami doesn't have voice acting, but in the end it's forgiveable.  The cinematics and artistic style of Okami are fantastic.  Visually the game is by far one of the best looking of any game this generation.  It's so distinct and original.  There's no game out there that looks like this.  Equally impressive is the fantastic music score that clearly defines the setting of the game and actually brings you into its unique world.You'll be able to explore quite a bit of the world.  There's a lot of running around to do and you'll have some excitement doing it.  Amaterasu carries around a sword like weapon all the time which she'll use whenever she engages in a battle.  Battling isn't tough in Okami, nor is it too frequent to the point where it's annoying.  So you won't be frustrated while traveling through Okami and putting up a good fight.  The battle mechanics work almost like any other action/adventure title with one exception: the powers of the gods at your disposal.Throughout the journey Amaterasu can use a brush technique to unleash her powers as well as the powers of her allies.  When in battle you can press R1 and it will bring up a canvas.  You'll then be given control of a paint brush and you can unleash several powers.  When it gets dark out you can use the paint brush to make the sun come back up.  There are other powers too, such as being able to cut through stone.  This mechanic takes a moment to get used to at first, but you'll adapt surprisingly fast.  Even better, this isn't a simple gimmick.  You'll find it imperative to use these powers to solve puzzles and progress further on in your adventure.  It's an integral part of the gameplay and storyline.  You don't start off with all the powers of the paint brush, of course, you'll have to travel through the game and get them.  This system certainly breathes new life into the genre as a whole.As you go on your adventure, you'll also be given chances to make Amaterasu more powerful.  You can learn moves at the dojo, and you can find health powerups, and get more ink reserves for your brush techniques.  There are also plenty of weapons and items to help you out on your quest.  The game is easy, even when faced against some of the bosses, but it's a lot of fun, and has a lot of variety.  You could go through Okami never actually dying once.  This isn't to say the game doesn't have its challenges.  Some puzzles have their own unique challenges that could leave you stumped for a moment.Okami is also full of plenty of other small things you can do as you traverse the land.  You can restore vegetation to the land, feeding animals in need of food.  These don't sound too appealing, but there are a couple of things that make it worth your while.  For starters, these scenes just look beautiful.  Second, you get praise for doing so.  Praise helps you to improve your powers and strengths.  These aspects of the game can keep you busy for quite some time.Okami is a masterpiece.  A highly expansive game with a vast world to explore.  It's beautiful cinematics and well crafted storyline, among a few other things, make this one of the best Playstation 2 games out there.  It's simply a fantastic game to play and the fun last for a long time.  Okami is the definition of quality.The Good+Engrossing storyline+The game is absolutely beautiful; among the best looking for the Playstation 2+The game sounds fantastic+Battling is a lot of fun+The brush techniques are really innovative+Plenty of side-quest and mini games to keep you busy+For an action/adventure title the journey is long, lasing for over 30 hours... on top of that the game is full of replay valueThe Bad-The only truly bad thing about Okami is that there is no voice acting in the game.  There's gibberish whenever a text box pops up, but no actual voice acting to speak of.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2006"}

Garrelts","summary":"An Unbiased, Comprehensive Review of GT5","reviewText":"I'm a fan of all things racing and have been anticipating the release of Gran Turismo 5 since I purchased my PS3 in 2007. After a longer than expected development time GT5 finally showed up at my door in Novermber 2010. Having played every previous Gran Turismo game with the exception GT on the PSP I pretty much knew what to expect from Polyphony's latest racer. Gran Turismo delivers in every key area, however, with varying degrees of success.As everyone knows GT5 has been in development for a long, long time. Some folks interpreted that to mean that GT5 should be head and shoulders above the other racers on the market. I'm not sure who the blame should fall on, presumptuous fans or the gaming media which is frankly more in the business of generating web-hits than reporting factual news. The hype machine did a number on Gran Turismo 5. It's no surprise that some players are disappointed.That being said, I'll start my review where most of the hype surrounding GT5 focused - the graphics. Yes, the graphics in GT5 are phenomenal. At times GT5 blurs the distinction between reality and video game. Then there are times where things or more specifically, the car models could look better. For those not in the know, GT5 introduces a new concept to GT - standard and premium cars. Standard cars are those vehicles that didn't receive the full graphical attention of the developers at Polyphony. The cars look good generally though pale in comparison to the Premium vehicles. I would describe the Standard cars as an upgraded car model from GT4. That isn't a jab at GT5 either as the graphics in GT4 are fantastic for their era. Premium cars on the other hand feature an insane amount of detail. It's difficult to describe just how close the Premium car models resemble their real-life counterparts. Polyphony has rendered these vehicles in painstaking detail down to the lug-nut on the wheels, stitching in the leather and tread on the tires. As of this writing there are 200 premium cars and 800 standard. Premium vehicles also feature a fully rendered cockpit unlike the Standard vehicles which feature the 3 familiar camera positions - chase, direct behind and bumper.Gameplay will be immediately familiar to GT fans only better than ever. Clearly a large focus of the development time went to trying to create a realistic physics model. Cars realistically demonstrate over-steer and under-steer, wheels spinout when jamming down on the throttle harshly. It's incredible to experience the nuances that Polyphony captured in GT5. Racing with a wheel (mine is the DFGT) will accurately recreate the feeling of driving the actual car. Throttling a Ferrari 512BB into a tight turn at high speed in order to out-brake an opponent has a razors edge feeling that can only be experienced in real life or GT5. Suffice to say that if you're a fan of simulation driving you'll probably like GT5. Fans of arcade type racers will probably find GT5 frustrating. This is a game that requires patience and practice not necessarily a lead foot.Speaking of patience, GT5 starts exactly as previous Gran Turismo games. You receive a small allotment of credits to purchase your first used vehicle and set off on your driving career from very humble beginnings. My first car was a '99 Toyota MR2. Not exactly a car that gets the blood boiling. In certain ways GT5 remains the same game we've played before and in other ways it's very different. For the first time in a GT game is a leveling system that affects everything from the cars you can drive to the events you can participate in. License tests are still present but not necessary to advance. A sufficient driver level will qualify you for an event.The main hub of GT5 is your profile page. From here you can access every aspect of GT. Your garage, race events, A-Spec & B-Spec (more on this later), GT Academy, online racing, community pages, auto dealers, used cars, tuning and repairs. Think of the profile page as your desktop for Gran Turismo. Menus have been streamlined from previous GT games. You no longer have to endure different maps (and loading screens) featuring auto dealers, every manufacturer are represented under the \"Dealerships\" meau.A-Spec mode is probably where most players will spend the majority of their time. A-Spec events include Beginner, Amatuer, Professional and World Class races. Again, expect to start at the bottom, racing some sub-100hp cars and work your way up. GT5 is not about instant gratification but a slow, measured build up to extremely fast and powerful vehicles.B-Spec mode makes a return from GT4. In this mode you're a racing manager and advise your drivers through a race using on screen commands. It's an interesting game mode that adds a unique way to spend your time in GT5. I suspect that this will be a love-it or hate-it feature though. Additionally for the trophy hunters out there, yes, there are several trophies related to B-Spec required for platinum.GT Academy is a new addition to Gran Turismo. Essentially the academy is driving school. There are a huge variety of events that introduce you to different types of vehicles and driving techniques. From buzzing around in super-powerful go-karts to taking lessons from Jeff Gordon in a Stock Car race or flying around Nurburgring in an AMG powered Benz. The events are great fun, unique and have incredible rewards for getting the best rating.Tuning makes a return to GT with a graphical make-over but essentially the same since GT4. You can purchase tires, turbos, engine upgrades, exhaust, and a slew of other modifications.The track selection in GT5 is almost as impressive as the vehicle list with 71 track \"selections\" which include reconfigurations of tracks or 26 completely unique track locations. Tracks vary from fictional GT tracks like Deep Forest to real-life circuits like Daytona, Indy, Nurburgring to city circuits in places like London & Rome to off-road dirt & snow rally tracks.Also worth mentioning are some great new features to GT5. For the first time ever in a GT game players have the ability to \"gift\" cars to online friends. It's a neat feature and if you play a lot online you can do some car swapping with friends. Additionally GT5 features a massive song list from all kinds of artists. Better than that however, is the ability to use custom playlists. In other words you can load your own music to your PS3 and play it while playing GT5! It's a feature more games should have.All that being said there are some blemishes that just cannot be overlooked. In the 5-6 years that GT5 has been in development many great racing games have been introduced and have raised the bar for what players expect from a racing game. A few of the areas where GT5 falls a bit short include:Customization: All the traditional GT tuning options are available but GT5 lacks the deep customization that games like Forza offers. All cars have the same basic options in GT and that's essentially it. No custom paint jobs, logos, vinyl's, body kits or anything. GT5 also offers far less unique rims than previous GT games ever did. Standard model cars cannot use after-market rims at all. It's disappointing that after all these years some effort wasn't made to include basic customization features which are the norm in many other racing games.Sound Effects: GT5 has some incredible cars including Ferrari's and American muscle cars. Strangely the engine sounds are almost the same. How can it be that the development teams at Polyphony spent years creating these ultra-realistic car models then didn't take the time to simply record the engines for the vehicles? It's a bizarre choice. We expect American muscle to sound throaty and Ferrari's to sound off with their distinctive high-pitched whine.Artificial Intelligence: Yes, the AI still tends to cluster in packs that look like they're driving on rails. Annoyingly the AI can and will frequently simply push your car out of the way or spin you. Try as I might I've never successfully spun an AI opponent.Graphics - sometimes:  As beautiful as the graphics are in GT5 there are areas where the graphics can sometimes be downright ugly. On my first race in the rain using a Ferrari F40 I couldn't help but notice that on the rare occasion that GT5s frame rate stutters certain elements of the vehicle became very pixelated. Mainly the problem was most noticeable on the windshield wiper blades (yes they're usable). Additionally shadows in GT5 tend to have the same pixelated lookThe jury is still out on:Damage modeling. As of this writing my driver level in GT5 is 15 and the game was recently patched (v1.03) to include some tweaks to the damage model. That said the current damage model is pretty poor, however, my understanding is that the damage model improves with the driver level. According to sources I've read the full damage model is unlocked at level 40. Love it or hate it it's a design choice that does make sense. Mainly in that repairs are often too expensive for low level drivers to recover from. I'll leave my final judgment until I get to level 40 and experience the full model. Unfortunately the sound effects during a crash are terrible and amount to nothing more than a \"thud\". Polyphony could have learned much by referencing Criterion Studios work in Burnout: Paradise or NFS: Hot Pursuit on the PS3.In conclusion, GT5 isn't everything the media hyped it to be. But then again no game could ever measure up to the expectations the media generated. Gran Turismo 5 is a fantastic game that is keenly focused on the racing aspect of the game and not peripheral features. If you're a GT fan or just a fan of racing I would highly recommend this game with the caveat that you must exercise patience to get to the best parts of GT5.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002I0K6DG","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason","summary":"Best Sci-Fi First Person Shooter on the PS3","reviewText":"Killzone 3 proves to be the best first person shooter in sci-fi games available on the PS3.  I bought it after reading mixed reviews when it went on sale and have been very glad that I did.Storyline:I don't know why so many people have criticized the storyline in Killzone 3.  It's not the main force to drive you to play the game and granted, sometimes it gets in the way of the games pacing, but compared to Killzone 2 it's vastly improved.  It's no Halo mind you, but it gives you a sense of the fight for survival after the ISA's war with the Helghast.  You get sense of the desperateness and perseverance of the ISA forces that have been trapped.Gameplay:This is a FPS, so you should mostly know what to expect, especially if you played Killzone 2, not much has changed.  The controls have tightened up considerably and it is more fun overall.  However, this time around we have a lot of unique features added, such as stealth missions, a jet pack (which is way cool) and some wicked cool weapons that you can use to obliterate your enemies.  I found the difficultly to be easier than Killzone 2, yet the cover feature seems to have gotten worse as I managed to get shot while hiding behind cover which by very nature should not happen.  I understand bombs, grenades but getting shot and killed behind cover, really??  The single player is enjoyable, also offering a co-op mode which is enjoyable, but extremely easy.Graphics:The graphics are about the same as they were in Killone 2, however, not every environment is a dark gritty battlefield.  The beautiful snow and ice areas are the best, using beautiful weather effects and wonderful textures and lighting.  The jungle is a nice idea but looks just so-so in my opinion.  the gritty war-torn battlefields you do encounter do look ok, but not as good as Killzone 2.  The shading and the textures in KZ2 were so focused on the towns/gritty war torn areas that they just looked better than KZ3, but KZ3 has better variety.Sound:The sound is good over-all, what you'd expect from a main PS3 title and similar in style and focus as KZ2.Final Thoughts:I'm not big into multi-player and I found the multi-player in Killzone 3 to be fun, innovative and better in scope and enjoyment than KZ2.  The maps are well designed and enjoyable over-all.  I really did find the not so great attempt at a story line to be admirable, though I often found it getting in the way of the action and pacing. The story isn't whats going to draw you into this game, it's the incredible game-play and solid co-op/multi-player.  The graphics are great and the sound is incredible.  If you enjoy sci-fi first person shooters, aren't into zombies and want something other than your typical call of duty / medal of honor first person shooter, than pick this one up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2011"}

Not only does having a separate Catwoman storyline add a completely new level of depth, but also gives an entirely new set of moves, gadgets, and upgrades. Even though her playability hinges on having set up and waiting a few minutes for the DLC it is well worthwhile.What can I say other than what has already been given in these other reviews? Obviously the graphics are amazing and I'm seriously considering a 3D TV specifically for this game. Great graphics, great side-quests, great playability, tons of fun, buy this game if you are a fan of Asylum, buy this game if you are a fan of Batman, buy it if you are a fan of great video games, because as far as I'm concerned this is one of the best ones available.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2011"}

Not necessarily due to the inclusion of Assassins Creed, although this is a very beautiful and fun game, but rather because of the white Vita itself. I also own the standard black Vita, and this limited edition white one really steals the show. Outside of that, the bundle comes with a 4 gb disk (you'll want to upgrade to a 16 or 32 gb disc however), and some cards for the Reality Vita experience.

Maybe it will get better with other games, but the prepackaged sports game is rather lackluster. Also, the controller seems a little buggy. I had to restart the PS3 a couple of time because it was not responding correctly.  The controller has a nice look to it, up until the bizarre-looking glowing ball on top. It's very bright in a dark room. Not sure why Sony couldn't come up with a technology similar to the Wii so that you don't have to have the expensive camera to detect your moves. Which brings up one of the biggest drawbacks--the cost. By the time you buy either the prepackaged set with the Eye and then buy the separate navigation controller, or buy all of them separately, you're spending well over $100, And that just gets you one controller. Playing with a friend will run into big bucks. Plus, you will still need the standard game controller, which brings up the second major drawback--it's not compatible with previously released PS3 games and current/future games that aren't specifically made for the Move. The current lineup of Move games leaves a lot to be desired. Standard Sony tactic when it comes to gaming--overpriced and under-supported.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2010"}

Garrelts","summary":"A Love, Hate Relationship - Skryim is a Mixed Bag","reviewText":"My first foray into The Elder Scrolls series came in 2007 with the excellent Oblivion. I loved the world Bethesda created, the freedom to explore, the freedom to make choices, the variety of quests, and the ambition of the game. I loved Oblivion so much in fact that I went back and purchased TES III: Morrowind and played that game seemingly endlessly. Suffice to say that the announcement of TES V: Skyrim was set to be one of my most anticipated gaming experiences of 2011.After logging approximately 100 hours into Skyrim (I have not finished the main storyline) I feel I'm ready to write a review. As the title implies, Skyrim is not perfect, far from it in fact. While there is a lot to like with this latest offering from Bethesda Softworks there is also a lot to dislike.I'll also state right off the bat that I'm playing this game on the PS3, as it's my console of choice, despite the fact of Bethesda's attitude toward the PS3 seems to be that of a distant afterthought. There are many well known issues with the PS3 version that specifically impact things like the frame-rate. Then there are issues that seem to plague all versions ranging from large bugs like backward flying, unkillable dragons to simple glitches like items becoming stuck in the players inventory. I'm sad to say that I've been exposed to all of these. It's widely known that Bethesda is notorious for releasing games in varying states of finish and Skyrim is no exception. I've heard from fellow gamers that Bethesda seems to treat its customer base as a free pool of beta testers and after seeing the state that Skyrim, Fallout 3, and Fallout 3: New Vegas were released in I'm inclined to agree.Back to the meat of the game, Skyrim takes place about 200 years after the events of Oblivion and as the title implies unfolds in the northernmost realm of Tamriel known as Skyrim. The player begins as a prisoner of the Imperial Forces riding on a cart with other prisoners on their way to execution. Events unfold and a dragon attacks the Keep at Helgen where you were set to be executed. From there on your immediately thrust into the vast world of Skyrim where a war is being fought between Nords siding with Imperial Forces and those siding with a rebel leader known as Ulfric Stormcloak. The story in Skyrim can be as much or as little as you make of it in similar fashion to past Elder Scrolls titles. For example you can simply choose to skip lengthy dialogue scenes or choose not to read many of the vast volumes of books scattered across the landscape in towns, villages, castles, dungeons and keeps. I've heard many complaints from JRPG fans that The Elder Scrolls games are lacking in substance but really there's plenty of back-story, it's just left up to the player to choose to experience it or not.Graphics are nice but not spectacular in the same way as cutting-edge PS3 games are like Uncharted. For certain this is a step up from Oblivion's graphics. Facial expressions of the games many NPCs have been upgraded and are immediately noticeable. The landscapes are breathtaking in many spots and the terrain in Skyrim is a vast mountainous expanse. There are snowy, fog covered peaks, with ragging blizzards to traverse to dense coniferous forests. Raging rivers carve through the environment from the mountainous terrain down to the forested hillsides and lowlands. The variety to the landscape of Skyrim is truly a marvel to behold! The lighting engine has received a major upgrade as well and dungeons feature a variety of lighting techniques, shadows and gradients of colors. The variety afforded by the lighting system is impressive. Exploring outside at night can range from a pitch-black experience on a cloudy night to a magical romp across the land as the Northern Lights are beautifully recreated in Skyrim. A vast, imposing moon can be masked behind fog and craggy peaks. Again, the entire world is impressively rendered. The menu system has also received a graphical facelift and unfortunately seems to be for the worse. While the new categories nicely organize the thousands of items you'll pick up throughout your quest in Skyrim the menu looks sparse and in sharp contrast to the setting of the title. You can no longer view your characters equipped armors and weapons right in the menu which is sorely missed. Thankfully Bethesda spent some time working on the 3rd person camera which seemed to be almost unusable in past TES games. This remains the only way to view your character and equipped items.The sound department has received equal attention in my book. The musical score changes to reflect your current surroundings from a peaceful melody as you meander through a forest meadow to an ominous track as you sneak about a bandit's dingy hovel. Once in combat the music really picks up and does a great job ratcheting up the tension. Voiceovers are thankfully much more varied than those found in Oblivion though of course you'll soon become accustomed to a familiar set of voices.The character creation system has been streamlined although you do lose some of the options past TES games imparted. Similarly the upgrade system has been simplified and is much more approachable to newer players than past games. There are dozens and dozens of perks to unlock via the leveling system. One level imparts one skill point to assign to an astrological sign correlating to a particular skill. Some perks require a certain level to be achieved before a it can be unlocked and learned. Leveling is accomplished in a similar way to past TES games - mainly by using the various skills at your disposal. The variety to your character customization is only limited by your ambition, planning, and of course the level cap which is set at 70.As far as an overall rating I hate to give Skyrim less than it deserves although in its state on the PS3 it's difficult to rate the title highly. Would I recommend the PS3 version of Skyrim to a friend? Probably only if that's their only means of playing the game. If you have a PC that can run this game then definitely go that route. For me playing through on the PS3 version of the game I have a love, hate relationship with this title. There's a lot to like but that can be quickly dissolved by the frustrating mess this game can become when the frame rate starts dropping.UPDATE: Bethesda released update v1.4 in early February for consoles and for the PS3 it was an immediate improvement to the framerate issue that plagued the title. The change was literally night and day; I went from experiencing almost constant lag to a smooth playing experience once again.All in all I logged in around 200 hours into Skyrim and the last 100 hours or so post update v1.4. There were some sporadic occasions where the framerate still hiccuped but nothing remotely comparable to the problems I was experiencing before. It's a shame that Bethesda continues to treat PS3 gamers with such low regard. Had they released Skyrim without the framerate issue the game would've certainly garnered better press and more importantly trust between developer/publisher and consumer.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00004YRQA","description":"Building a better system from the ground up sometimes involves digging into even the most mundane components. Take memory cards, for instance. To provide larger storage capacity and faster access rates--PlayStation2 cards transfer data 200 times faster than cards for the original PlayStation--PlayStation2 developers have upgraded the technology for the new memory card. The 8 MB Memory Card uses Flash Memory, the storage technology that's revolutionizing handheld computers, digital cameras, and MP3 players. In contrast, the 128 KB memory cards that were designed for the original PlayStation use memory blocks. While large files can spill over several blocks, you can't store more than one file per block in that design, no matter how small the file. The 8 MB Memory Card allieviates that problem by organizing and storing files much more like a computer hard disk.","reviewerName":"GC \"GRC\"","summary":"Just pay the extra money!!","reviewText":"The truth is that these memory cards do not have all that much space on them, so you will certainly want to buy two...I've made thousands of saves on these cards and only ever had ONE go corrupt so to say these cards work extremely well has to be an understatement.

{"product_name":"B003GT8IL0","description":"","reviewerName":"Hunter D","summary":"End of the line","reviewText":"I thought the PC expansions developers created better games than both FEAR 2 & 3 together. FEAR 3 got worse and the Alma scare or spook scenes were just extremely lame. The developers didn't even try and this game felt like it was made by amateurs meant for bargain bin release. I regret paying full price on release week for this game. Paxton Fettel and Point Man in this game were just lazily designed. They changed Pettel's look and he now looks like some uncool generic vampire count in skinny jeans. I thought bringing him back made no sense at all even in F2 Reborn DLC. The series went from supernatural cool to generic FPS with demon beast dogs. I don't mind the human soldiers, but FEAR is also about mutants and supernatural entities encounters which F3 totally missed on. I didn't try coop offline or online, but I'm sure it would have made the game slightly more enjoyable. As a FPS game its campaign was okay, but as a FEAR game I think it took a huge step backwards in overall feel and design.The online only MP game type that I played was about surviving waves of enemies. Personally, it wasn't very fun and not very good, but there are other game types too. I couldn't really find any matches other than that game type so I can't offer any opinion of the others.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2012"}
{"product_name":"B003P9C6QY","description":"","reviewerName":"Lemo","summary":"A generic third person shooter","reviewText":"I was really looking forward to playing this game since I was a huge fan of RF Guerilla, but as you've probably heard by now, the open sandbox style gameplay have been ditched for a rather uninspired, linear campaign.  This decision is to the game's detriment.The game that RFA most reminds me of is not Guerilla, but Dead Space 2.  There's a lone hero traveling through caverns and down dark corridors while blasting aliens and religious cultists.  I think that description gives too much credit to RFA though, since the story here is basically rubbish.  No explanation is given for why the cultists are doing what they're doing, and the story line involving the cult leader, Alan Hale, is dispensed with in a very unsatisfactory way.  Likewise, the origins of the aliens remain a mystery.So that leaves us the game play, which is for the most part good.  The destruction element is good and the game really shines when you get out of the dark caverns onto Mars's surface or into a vehicle where you can cause an amazing about of destruction.  The biggest flaw with the destruction element has to do with the structure of the game.  In Guerilla, the destruction was the point: the missions were all about destroying a convoy or blowing up a building.  In RFA, the game rarely forces you to destroy anything in order to succeed at the game - your primary goal is to enter a level, kill all the enemies, and maybe flip a switch.  The destruction is optional.There is fun to be had though, even if you have to go looking for it.  The game is worth a rental or wait for the price drop.  Definitely don't pay full price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2011"}

Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime finds you taking control of the little blue slime blobs that have appeared in every Dragon Quest game, and you are on a mission to save your friends before it's too late.  Taking advantage of the DS' stylus and touch screen support, Rocket Slime provides a great amount of fun via the slime mechanics and use of tanks in combat.  Not to mention that the game itself looks great and is popping with color and detailed animations.  Longtime Dragon Quest veterans will recognize many characters, sounds, and monsters from the long running series as they progress through their quest, which clocks in at a decent enough length, but hardcore RPG fans will be disappointed at the lack of difficulty that can make your quest all the more shorter.  This is Rocket Slime's most glaring flaw, but the good definitely outweighs the bad here.  The battles are fun to play and watch, and the multiplayer elements are a welcome addition as well.

Unlike the recent ports of V and VI, III got a huge upgrade in graphics and some redesigns and it's all the better for it. But there's still some things that are stuck in the past and how better would it have been if it was implemented. You're still going to get a pretty good Final Fantasy title with gorgeous graphics and the time-consuming Job system (in a good way) but other things knock down the game a tad.Story: It's pretty much the same as I and II: crystals are going haywire and 4 people are chosen to restore them and save the land. Yawn. But really, they were made at a time before things got ambitious like future titles VII or VIII or story-extensive ones like Xenogears. In other words, you're not going to really get anything major as far as plot revelations and if there is any twists, you'll most likely see some of them coming.Graphics: A lot of people will give high marks on the graphics front on the opening FMV alone. And I won't lie to you, it's quite awesome. It has that majestic quality that IX's opening had while having some pretty great action scenes as well. As for in-game graphics, they're pretty good actually. 3-D world with a tilted overworld camera, the graphics are impressive if you think in terms of DS capabilities. Only problem is that you can't rotate the camera, there's certain areas where it would've helped if you can turn.Sound/Music: Music's serviceable but it's not really memorable either. You'd have to probably listen to each track separately to focus on them since you don't really pay that much attention to them. That's not to say it's a bad soundtrack, of course not. But tracks probably won't instantly grab you like future installments where you can't help but notice how good the music is. There's no voice acting and the sound effects are appropriate but obviously not flashy.Gameplay: Same as always with options such as attack, magic, items and so on. But this game brought about the job system which got favored heavily when people played Final Fantasy Tactics. At certain points, your character can branch off into other classes, enabling a more diverse party. Want someone entirely devoted to protecting and healing the party? White Mage. Someone to throw powerful spells? Black Mage? Both? Red Mage. Then we get others such as Dragoons, Geomancers, Ninjas, Thieves, Monks, Bards and Knights. Of course some are more useful (Dragoons and Monks are especially sweet) but then some seem kind of useless.As for the difficulty, it can get frustrating at times. Instead of halfway save points and then the save point just before the boss, you basically save before the dungeon, take a deep breath and barrel through in hopes you make it through to the boss and kick its ***. You can leave to regroup but then you'd have to go back in and try again and should you get beaten, you have to start all over again. Doesn't help when some enemies can get 2 turns, especially bosses which gets even worse when Phoenix Downs don't even give your character much HP back so you'd probably revive only to have them wiped out again before you can cure them.Speaking of which, one major issue I had in the Dawn of Souls release was inns didn't revive dead characters. I spent my gil to rest my characters only to find my guy still dead. Here though we have 2 wellsprings: one that revives fallen characters while one acts as a rejuvenation spring but I don't think they cure status effects such as blind or poison. So to revive, use one pool; to heal, use the other and to heal/remove status effects, use an inn. It's pretty much your only option since Phoenix Downs can only be found or won in battle so those pools will be lifesavers.While it's not quite the great top-tier release reserved for Square games (since it most likely went towards XII) but still you'll get a solid game but if you're new, prepare to be schooled...in a fun way.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2007"}

Apparently this genre is unique in that it involves elements of both role-playing games and action adventures.  The other pirate games I have played focus on the main theme of trade, which is fun from the business and economy sense.  (Buy low and sell high; the more money you make, the more expensive features become available.)Sid Meier's Pirates! deviates from those games, though.  (Actually, this game concept came out in 1987, so perhaps the other games deviated from this one.)  Pirates! is based on an objective-clearing system (the more objectives cleared - and there are many - the higher your ranking), though it is open-ended to the point that you fulfill those ones you want to and with what priority.Some of these objectives include:*  Rescuing family members - gather maps and learn secrets to their whereabouts*  Finding buried treasure - you actually disembark from your ship, walk on land with a small band of mates, and compare your location to the map markers*  Courting Governors' daughters - this involves the eight directions of movement that must be done in sync with your female counterpart*  Sea battles - this is how you make your money, pick up some loot, and make your fellow sailors happy*  Attacking towns - if you tick off one of the four nations (Spain, France, England, Holland) too much, you will have difficulty entering their ports.  What finer excuse to engage in an in-game strategy interface and try to take the town by positioning range and melee units on a board map?There are other objectives in this game, as well, which bring out the great strategic and action value of this game.  Thus, the true genius of Pirates! is the amalgamation of action, adventure, strategy, and role-playing games all into one title.  I have not seen this level of diversity in a video game before, and I must say that this was perhaps the best $10 I ever spent on entertainment!The music and the graphics of Pirates! are somewhat sub-par for what we are used to nowadays, I must admit.  However, the game concepts are so simple, yet so diverse, that you won't totally be bothered by the sound or visuals.  Actually, the graphics of the ocean and land while you are at sea are pretty fantastic, though you will notice that some things just don't add up when you consider real-time events.On that topic (real time events), I think that is the greatest weakness of Pirates!  But again, the diversity of the game somehow makes up for that.  What I mean by weakness in real time events are these:A) You have the ability to sneak into enemy towns.  This is a great concept, but everything is done in super slow motion - even when you are running: your character slowly lifts his legs as he spacewalks through the beautiful Caribbean town, yet he is still able to turn on a dime.B) Sea battles appear slow-moving, but the awkwardness comes when trying to orient yourself with your surroundings: the water does not move according to the wind, so you cannot gage your movements, speed, or acceleration except by noticing the numbers changing on the screen.  Thus, you are really just moving in relation to your opponent, which is somewhat daft.  And finally,(C) Moving around on land does not show on your maps.  Also, you cannot cross one side of an island to the other and find a town waiting for you, as on the regular map.  I'm not sure what the limitations were to the programming here, but you will find some hold-backs that are hard to fathom in a truly \"open ended game.\"  I guess everything can't be perfect.To close, I highly recommend this game, Sid Meier's Pirates! for everyone who prefers video games as opposed to going out to crowded movie theaters (where people whisper, cell phones distract you, and atypical behavior is bound to happen).  I offer this comparison because Pirates! feels like a movie that I am scripting as I play it.  With the action sequences that I engage in, it makes movies somewhat worthless - I'd rather interact in my own pirate film than just sitting there watching it!  Swordplay is something I can't come by in my everyday life, for example, so watching someone else do it is cool.  But if I make the determination to swing low while my opponent goes high, and thus stabbing him over the side of the boat, I would say that that beats watching others on a movie screen any day.Given cost, excitement and interaction levels, and convenience, Pirates! at $10 is one \"movie ticket\" that can be replayed over and over again and will save you the hassle of inconsiderate, snot-nosed patrons all around you - this will be your new \"movie channel\" for a while.  Also, the replay value for Pirates! is very high - try coming back to this game after putting it down for a couple months.  It's like brand new.  Lastly, I'd say that this game still stands above the other pirate-themed video games that I have played; and this genre has turned out to be one of my favorites.  I think Sid Meier's Pirates! is probably king of the pirates video game genre.  Also, the ease of simply picking up this game and playing it says a lot: challenging, yet fun and easy to learn.  Gotta love that.So buy Sid Meier's Pirates for $10.  It'll be one of the better investments in entertainment in your life.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2008"}

Surine \"Stanley\"","summary":"Not the best ever, but the best for your 360","reviewText":"Though this game didn't quite meet my expectations, I will admit that I set the bar pretty high.  Knowing how much work was put into this game, I was expecting something amazing.  Though this game is a lot of fun, I was kind of hoping for more.The game feels somewhat like a combination of Sonic Adventure and classic Sonic the Hedgehog.  Many levels are often set in a 2-D world and are still in the style of the zones you remember from \"the goold ol' days.\"  Clearly, Sega recognized the fact that it would be best to update the classic levels we remember from the Genesis days rather than create new ones.  Those who have played Sonic on their Dreamcast will feel right at home with the similar jumping styles and controls of the new Sonic, and the levels with classic Sonic feel very much like a 2-D world.The method in how you play these levels is probably the biggest frustration.  Rather than playing one level after the other (like in the classic Sonic games) or an open-world environment (as in Sonic Adventure) you pick from different worlds then select the level within that world.  What becomes frustrating is each world has to be played with each version of Sonic, and you jump to the levels in some weird tower structure.  This means that the progressive battle between Sonic and a villian is completely lost, and the game has virtually no story.  You instead feel like you're playing random Sonic levels for no apperant reason.Obviously, the graphics have come leaps and bounds from the classic days, and there's something very satisfying about seeing your favorite video game character in high def.The levels do have a bit of variety in terms of what you're doing, but ultimately, your goal in each one is to reach the end (unlike finding the emerald as in Sonic Adventure).  Sometimes you're racing another Sonic to the finish, but usually, you're just trying to get through the level.  Many of the levels do have a \"classic\" feel to them.  For instance, the chemical plant returns, but with more details in the graphics.I will say that I miss the open world style of Sonic Adventure, though I'm guessing Sega abandoned this since players got frustrated trying to figure out where in this gigantic space they were supposed to go next.  The game does give you some freedom to choose what level you'll play next, that in itself can be irritating because you'll quickly wonder what you have to do next to open more levels.After some huge let-downs in the last 10 years, it's great to see Sonic at his best once again.  Though I wouldn't call this game \"the best Sonic ever,\" it's definitely the best you'll see on your 360 (or PS3).  The game is not without frustrations, but overall, it's very worth while.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-29-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00005QDPZ","description":"Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron IIfeatures some of the  best graphics ever seen on a home console, and it is a proper, old-fashioned,Star Warsgame. If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies. The ships move with a fluidity and grace you wouldn't have thought  possible from such a tiny purple cube. The only flaw is that the missions are  needlessly short, but there's plenty of replayability, and by gosh there's those  graphics.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Andrew","summary":"Pew Pew!","reviewText":"This is one of the few Star Wars games that is fun to play.

And don't worry, he doesn't whine about his lost memories for half the game like you'd expect.The world is surprisingly well put together and thought out. There are few clich&eacute;s: dwarves are drunsk and elves are hippies, but that's about it. Everything else is dark and grim. Women and children are killed and eaten by monsters, pogroms are carried out by racist humans, law and order are corrupt and uncaring, and most women support themselves through the oldest profession. There are very few white knights in this, and you sure aren't one of them. The political games are surprisingly deep and thought out, but the storylines don't start to weave together well until the middle of the game.Graphics and audio are okay. Nothing spectacular, and some effects are laughably dated, even a year later, but nothing terrible. The rag doll physics are a touch out of place, but acceptable.Combat is somewhat slapdash, but novel. You have various style for various enemies, and you have to be mindful of what your fighting, or you can quickly be surrounded. What's annoying are the potions. You have to be a gardener, collecting every herb in sight and brewing potions like its going out of style at higher difficulties, and the books to collect the herbs are so expensive that you don't get much option to upgrade your gear early on. Inventory is weird, and while I appreciate the breath of realism that you can only carry 4 weapons, one silver, one steel, one side weapon, and one other, they should've given an option the carry more loot, as it's not worth it to curry dropped swords back and forth, even though youll desperately miss the gold.What make's this worth it are the quests. Some of the quests are multilayered in the extreme, with very little go here and do this instructions and more a vague outline of a problem, especially when you're tracking a murderer through a city slum, relying on your diligence in collecting information rather than clicking your way through a conversation until you hit the correct combination. Other quests are general monster hunts, but they still manage to be engaging.There are some drawbacks. The... \"romance\"... is slapdash and  stupid. I'm not a prude, but some of these romances side bars are ridiculous, and come down to a single fetch quest. Theres no real development of emotion or feeling of the characters, and it's like ever Bond film back to back with the number of these tidbits are thrown in your face. You never actually CARE about these characters, and they're dealt off like yesterdays lunch soon afterwards.Overall, a neat foray and a engaging, living world that is dark and gritty, with a storyline that is well layered and put together, combined with an entertaining main character. The fact that the studio was filled with 14-year-olds during development isn't enough of a drawback, and this remains a worthwhile buy now that its pocket change on Steam.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2013"}

Graham","summary":"Good soundtrack.","reviewText":"When I saw my friend playing this game I thought it was a genesis emulator because the graphics were so pixelated. I know minecraft has similar graphics, so nothing groundbreaking about that. The game itself is a pretty poor clone of 1991's arcade hit Smash TV, but instead of a game show, I guess your guy is just a crazy murderer.The first problem  I had is the UI. Its WASD to move and the mouse to aim. This is pretty awkward. Back in 1982 when they made Robotron 2084 they figured out the best control scheme for such a game is having 2 joysticks, one for moving and one for shooting. So naturally I ask why we aren't using an XBOX controller for this, but, since they are acting like its 1991, no xbox 360 support exists. OK fine I'll deal with this dreadful keyboard and mouse, but the mouse speed is so slow, let me speed it up like I've done with every shooting game released since WOLF3d. Sadly you cannot adjust the mouse sensitivity either.One thing this game does have that Smash TV didn't have was tons and tons of bugs. You can run into a room with 2 dudes in it, shoot one, the other will chase you about 10 feet, then suddenly loose interest and go back to patrolling the room again. I saw a dog run off the map entirely for no reason, and once an annoying error message popped up when I picked up a weapon. Bullets harmlessly pass through enemies when you shoot them at melee range,but fortunately they will miss you too. You can swing a melee weapon right through a wall or door like it isn't there. For some reason it takes longer to load this game than Skyrim in spite of it being about 200 meg.While the game itself is an unplayable disaster, the soundtrack is really terrific. Its almost worth suffering through the game just to listen to the fabulous electronic music. Its hypnotic. If you find anyone who believes this game is of any quality, simply mute their speakers and they will immediately come to their senses. I would rather pay 12.99 for the soundtrack if they promised not to give me the game with it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2012"}

He thinks this is unfair because, despite being well-schooled in the art of killing, he maintains that he's done nothing wrong. Heaven makes a deal with him. Take care of a little invasion problem concerning Hell, and our hero can enter those pearly gates.Weak storyline aside,Painkillerbasically amounts to a brilliant series of arcade-style levels and challenges. The settings include darkened monasteries, graveyards, a horrifying asylum, a medieval town under siege, and even H-E-Double Hockey Sticks itself. The level design is brilliant, varied, and jam-packed with enemies. There seems to be no end to the amount and variety of cool monsters to fight, and they each explode into chunks of blood and gore in a most disturbingly satisfying manner. At the end of each level is a challenge, such as collecting a certain amount of gold or killing a Boss within a time limit. Winning the challenge gives you tarot cards you can use to make the game easier. The different cards bring haste, double-damage, invulnerability, and so on. This simple mechanic makes the game far more replayable than your average shooter.The graphics are first rate, which means you need a powerful PC to run the game with all the detail settings maxed out. The only other problem is a CD-copy protection bug that makes the game unplayable for some (a patch is available).Painkillermay seem a bit silly at first glance. But the gameplay mechanics, replayability (full multiplayer is also available), variety, and brilliant level design make it one of the finest and most satisfying shooters ever made. -Andrew S.

With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents.

However, I have been a fan of Bioware games since Baldur's Gate, so I thought that I would give Mass Effect (ME2) a shot. Glad that I did. This is one of the best games that I have played in the past ten years. It's a well-polished, entertaining sci-fi thriller with good controls, great graphics, memorable characters, and a vast galaxy to explore. If the game has a flaw, it's the main story line--you know, small team of unlikely heroes defeats galactic threat against overwhelming odds. It's the usual sci-fi fare. Nonetheless, the good stuff is in the details, and ME2 gets just about everything right.Gameplay: The game is largely a third-person shooter, with a good dose of roleplaying and exploration. The shooter part is entertaining and accessible and gives each battle a bit of flare. Over the course of the game, you gain a number of high-powered weapons and upgrades, which make firefights more dramatic. The roleplaying elements mostly involve upgrading a few abilities of your character and his/her allies, as well as making various decisions about quest plots. The characters in the game are well-developed, and your teammates have their own stories and quests for you to accomplish. There are dozens of quests in the game. Some are part of the main quest; others are related to your teammates. Additionally, exploring the galaxy can open up a number of optional quests, which are typically short but imaginative. Many of the quests have multiple stages and help to flesh out an intriguing story or character. The game is worth playing a second time just to see how differently some of the quests turn out based upon your decisions. The ending, which is exciting but inconclusive, obviously sets up the sequel (ME3).The team structure of the game works quite well. You can usually take 2 teammates on missions. For the most part, they hold their own in combat and don't have pathfinding issues. Most teammates are talkative and add an illusion of realism to the game. The diversity of species in your squad makes for some interesting matchups, though I found all of my allies likable. You can even start romances with selected characters, though the game seems to limit you to only one such coupling per playthrough.Graphics: ME2 is a gorgeous game. Character models and animations are life-like, and the environments are beautifully rendered. The game has a lot of cutscenes which could be right out of a first-rate sci-fi movie. The game is well optimized, and I had no trouble playing it with a Geforce 8800GT video card on 1680x1050 resolution (mostly high settings).  A lot of care was put into creating the lush visuals, which give the game a very immersive quality.Sound: Like the graphics, the game has high-production values in the audio area as well. All of the voice acting is good, and the weapons, ships, explosions, and so forth are convincing. The soundtrack is fine, and the music generally fits the mood of events.Technical issues: The game is extremely well polished, at least with the 1.02 patch applied. In over 35 hours of gameplay, I did not experience a single crash, freeze, or other technical error. This is rather amazing for a PC game. ME2 comes with a decent manual. Very importantly, the game has a very reasonable DRM system. You need only have the disk in the drive--no need for any online registration or authentication that would otherwise make this single-player game dependent upon an online server. I really do hope that they keep this system for ME3.Replayability/Value: Given that I bought the game here at Amazon for $15, it is one of the best deals out there. It is worth the original asking price of $50, so I definitely got my money's worth. The game's flaws are minor, such as a rather conventional main storyline, some gratuitous profanity, and a bland but necessary mini-game involving mining planetary resources. However, the cinematic and technical achievements of the game are such that these minor flaws are just quibbles.I will replay this game again at some point (it takes about 35-40 hours to complete), but for now I'm looking forward to ME3. I highly recommend ME2 to anyone who likes shooters, roleplaying games, or simply a well-told and exciting story. You do not need to have played the first game in order to understand and enjoy this one.Pros:+gorgeous presentation, high-production values+well-formed and memorable characters+interesting quests and moral dilemmas+great visuals and voice acting+accessible controls and gameplay dynamics+reasonable DRM+does not require a playthrough of the first gameCons:-very typical sci-fi plot-gratuitous profanityRating: 4.5 stars","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001ABK1LQ","reviewerName":"irukandji","summary":"Rockband + Guitar Hero = World Tour","reviewText":"A neutered version of Guitar Hero III merged with Rockband. That is Guitar Hero World Tour in a nutshell. They really should have called this \"Rockband: World Tour\", I would have understood and would have been less disappointed.What did they change? The notes look the same as Guitar Hero III, except if you get the Wii version where they made the hammer-ons smaller. They added black \"transparent\" notes where you just hit the note without strumming, this is where the slider comes into play with the new guitars. They added sustained notes which you strum and hold on to, and simultaneously have to hit other notes or more sustained ones.There is a de-emphasis on highscores, there are only 3 top scores allowed, it's harder and takes longer to type in your name (since they now allow uppercase/lowercase & and numeric characters), and it doesn't pop up after playing a song, you have to select the option to enter your name. When playing \"Quickplay\", it is organized in one big list like Rockband instead of tabs like Guitar Hero III. You can only see your highscores and stars if the song is highlighted. The only good thing they added was that you can select up to 6 songs to play back to back.The interface while you're playing the song has been changed. Similar to Guitar Hero III, except made to look more sleek. It is harder to tell when you've got a 1x,2x,3x or 4x multiplier going since it is smaller and off to the side of the guitar. When streaking, Guitar Hero III would pop up with \"50 Note Streak\" on the screen, World Tour shows a streak but located at the top of your guitar and it is very small and harder to read and goes unnoticed most of the time. It was more fun with Guitar Hero III's \"streak notice\" because you knew you were doing good when you saw that, but now it's practically non-existent. My guess is since Rockband is so popular and since Guitar Hero: Aerosmith was rated lowest among users and game reviewers alike, they favored the Rockband look where fun isn't as important as making things look more presentable. Judy Nails, one of the characters you can select, has been nerfed from the previous installment. Her face is boring and her boobs are smaller, they probably didn't want to offend or turn-off their female demographic. There are also signs of pandering to the hispanic demographic by including a lot more Spanish songs. No German or others, maybe one French.The career mode is not the same as Guitar Hero III. It is worse. You select your difficulty, but at anytime you can switch it to Easy, Medium, Hard, or Expert and still progress through your career. You don't unlock songs by buying them, but rather unlock them as you progress through your career. You play gigs, which consist of 4 or so songs and some of them cost money, which is how you \"unlock\" them. You have to beat the entire gig for it to count, no bailing out on song 3 if you feel like quitting, or else you'll have to start from song 1 when you come back. Kind of irritating. If you got stuck this is where it is handy just to make the song easier by switching the difficulty just so you don't have to play the songs you already beat allover again. They've also added a beginner mode, which is easier than \"Easy\" and all you do is strum. You can also play the drums, sing with the microphone, or play bass guitar.They also allow you to create your own custom songs or custom characters. The custom songs sound like MIDI's. It doesn't record highscores for custom songs. You can download other players/users' creations.I did encounter one technical problem, and that problem was that it froze on me. I was on my 6th song on my setlist and went to check the leaderboards online and it froze. I lost all my highscores for all the songs.It is definitely not the best of the series. However, it is still fun and better than Rockband, but not nearly as good as Guitar Hero III or Aerosmith. The de-emphasis of highscores, guitar interface, and streak notice really made this less fun for me.My Rankings:1. Guitar Hero: III: Legends of Rock2. Guitar Hero: Aerosmith3.

Ramos \"Voltaire Tempentry\"","summary":"Amazing deal","reviewText":"Most people that read this will already know that Metroid Prime Trilogy includes 3 of the very best games released in the last 10 years. For those of you that aren't aware of the quality, ill brief you; Metroid is one of Nintendo's classic franchises, right up there with Mario and Zelda. The Metroid Prime sub-series is a recreation of the classic 2D games into the 3rd dimension.Now, MP3 Corruption revolutionized first person controls, offering smooth, quick, and responsive aiming. You point, and you shoot, its that simple. That control scheme has been introduced to Prime and Echoes, and their all the better for it.Now that everyone knows that these games are some of the best EVER made, ill get to the bulk of my review, which is more of a comparison. Ill compare the original games vs the version included in MPT.---------------Game ContentPrime - Im comparing the MPT version with the 2nd Edition GC, or Players Choice version.--Widescreen -  First of all, MPT offers all 3 games in a widescreen display. The method to achieve this, however, isn't that respectable. The developers zoomed in and cropped the image to be presented in widescreen 16:9 . During game play you'll hardly notice it (in fact you probably wont), but some cut scenes (maybe 20% of them) looks oddly choreographed, with half of Samus's helmet being cut off.--Graphics -  MPT offers Prime in 480p and some graphical and technical  refinements. You get bloom lighting covering ever light source, a subtle and nary noticeable touch. It creates a sort of blur around lights, as well as some better depth effects. 480p makes everything a tad sharper and more colorful. Lines and sharp details are more obvious and theres deeper colors. The best update is probably the locked 60fps. The game is VERY fluid, and no matter how much stuff is going on on-screen, the game never hiccups. Also, Retro has replaces some textures with higher resolution models. It basically means that the games textures look much better and more modern.The is NO dynamic water effects however. That means that instead of liquids reacting realistically to movement, its all static. The beam effects are also removed.--Other - All of the games Lore is now that of the European release (PAL). Lore in the Prime games are small notes presented in the view of the author of said note (usually a group of individual of significant importance to the overall story). The original release had to different versions of Lore, varying with the region release. Also, when activating the pause menu, the percent of collected and lore scanned will show up. Load times do NOT exist in this game. You will NEVER be waiting for a door to open. Its a huge difference from that of the GC release, which had 2-3 load period between each door.----------------Echoes - Echoes has no region different version, unlike Prime.--Widescreen - Just like Prime, its an odd widescreen mode. However, unlike Prime, none of the cut scenes appear cropped, and the games looks better and more polished because of it. The multilayer portion of the game is now in the main menu, and its only available in widescreen if 3 or more players are playing. The game produces black and green bars to recreate a 4:3 mode if only 2 players are involved.--Graphics - Echoes has no bloom or replaced textures, but it still looks better than Prime. The graphical difference aren't all that noticeable when comparing screen shots, but if you play the games sequentially, its a visible difference.  The game already had higher resolution textures in the GC version, and a sort of lighting effect that is similar to bloom. Character models are also much more detailed. The game is perfectly replicated on Wii, with no graphical improvements.  New to Echoes is a 480p mode, which offers all the same benefits as that of Primes 480p. Echoes does stutter and drop from 60fps more often than Prime though. Where as Prime would drop frames once every 2-3 hours, Echoes stutters 3 times more often. The average player will never notice it, so I'm just nitpicking :P--Other - Like Prime, when activating the pause menu, your given the amount of items collected and lore scanned. Load times are also shorter, but not to the extent of Prime, as you will find yourself waiting on the occasional door.-----------------Corruption - The only game originally released on Wii, is also a single version, like Echoes.--Widescreen - Corruption is the only game in MPT that has a real widescreen mode, no cropping used.--Graphics - Easily the most impressive looking game on the disc, Corruption has the best detail and effects of all the games. Being designed on the Wii exclusively really shows. Larger areas, more enemies, more detail, better effects, etc. While the graphical leap from Prime to Echoes was nice, Corruption is the only title in which the naked eye will see major differences. The frame-rate dips about as much as Echoes.NOTE - I had Corruption prior to MPT, and i played in 480i on a 4:3 CRT TV. The game never once hiccuped, staying at a solid 60fps. If your playing MPT in 480i, chances are you will never see any of the games drop from 60fps.Miscellaneous changes (not limited to MP3) - MPT has a new menu system, a \"new\" token system (its taken from Corruption and half-heartedly implemented into Prime and Echoes), and unlock able content is bought using said tokens, instead of scanning X% of items/lore/creatures. Prime and Echoes both have a new difficultly mode, \"Hypermode\". Previous versions had Normal and Hard difficulties, those are now replaced with Normal and Veteran respectively. Hypermode is the 3rd and hardest mode. Changes to visor and helmet opacity are now only available in game, and cannot be adjusted in the main menu. Boost Ball aiming is not included in any games, MP3 included.------------------PackagingMPT comes in an awesome steel book casing. Its a metallic tin instead of a simple white plastic as in most Wii games. It also includes a slip cover and a fold out booklet, highlighting the Prime sub-series storyline and including some concept art.As is obvious, Metroid Prime Trilogy is an amazing deal for $50. You get 3 of the best games of the last decade, all on one disc and packaged in an awesome steel book case. While i thoroughly enjoyed each games twice over, i couldn't help but feel that so much more could have been done in this re-release. Why wasn't the superior HUD and Map design of MP3 be implemented into Prime and Echoes? Why was there no new content included? No new modes, galleries, or bonus material. Regardless of the missed opportunity, MPT is one amazing deal that every Wii owner should have in there collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000INV44U","reviewerName":"R. Wiedlin","summary":"Best Multiplayer Game for the Wii","reviewText":"Mario Strikers is the first online multi player game for the wii. This created a bit of hype for the previously under appreciated sports game. Upon its release, the game does not disappoint.This game provides simple to learn controls, but at the same time creates dynamic and complex team setups and game strategy. The arenas further add to the games charm.I have very few complaints about the game, which is very rare these days. My biggest complaint is about the single player (cup mode). In this mode you go through rounds of preliminary round robin style qualification matches (between 6-10 matches) followed by 1-3 elimination rounds. If you win every single qualifying round and lose in the first elimination round, you have to start from scratch at the start of the cup, which is very frustrating.Also in cup mode, the level of difficulty dramatically jumps or falls. You can score a 20-0 win one round and then be knocked out 0-3 the next. The difficulty of the game was poorly designed in single player.That aside, no one really buys these games for the single player anyway. My only complaint about the core of the game is that there a few things unbalanced. Megastrikes in this game are completely unbalanced (one megastrike can score up to 6 goals). Fortunately, there is an easy to unlock cheat that enables \"classic mode\" where these megastrikes are disabled.All in All, I HIGHLY recommend this game. It is a much needed breath of fresh air for the Wii, which until now, only had a few good games on release that have now grown stale.GradingControls: A-, comfortable, easy to learnGraphics: B, acceptable, but nothing to blow your socks offSound: B, not annoying like some mario games, but nothing too terribly catchyReplayablity: A, Single player will grow stale after a while, but nothing beats knocking your friends around in Domination Mode or over WiFi!Overall: A-A great title to tide you over till games like Mario Galaxy, Smash Brothers Brawl, and Soul Caliber legends.

Paslay","summary":"Amazing game if you don't expect it to change your perception of reality...","reviewText":"I see alot of bad reviews for this game because \"it's too hard to stray from the path.\" \"It's not what was promised.\" etc. The fact is, although it didn't fully live up to its promises, it still made good on a lot of them. I hand it to Lionhead for being ambitious. Most developers stick with a tried and true formula that works, rarely trying to really push the way games are played.Final Fantasy for instance... Don't get me wrong, as far as RPGs go Final Fantasy set the bar. I'm a huge fan of the series, the only problem is, they rarely do anything wildly different. The stories and characters change a little, they add a few new facets here and there, but it's never anything revolutionary and it's generally the same formula every time.I agree, they probably shouldn't have promised things until they knew they could pull it off for sure, but that doesn't mean we should so easily forget about the promises they made good on. I'm rating Fable for what it is. A great RPG with a strong replay value. The story is intriguing (even though it's not terribly complex) the environments are well done and varied. As far as side missions and character customization, there's a lot to do. Furthermore, there's alot of room for playing how you want. You can be more of a Ranger type, or a Mage, or a Warrior or just mix it up for whatever the situation calls for.It's a great game but with all games some people love it, and some people hate it. Most will at the very least enjoy it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2008"}

The greatest 3-D weapons-based fighter will provide non-stop action, excitement and surprises as you go one-on-one against your favorite challengers.","reviewerName":"Steve","summary":"Review - Soul Calibur 2","reviewText":"Let me start by saying I both love and hate this game at the same time.  The game is absolutely addictive but is angering and frustrating as all hell.  Below is my opinion of the game.  Watch it is probably going to upset the little fan boys who I will have to destroy.The Good:Graphics 5/5 - The graphics are phenomenal, they are crisp clear and absolutely gorgeous.  The characters move, execute their attacks and get the butts kicked flawlessly without a single twitch, polygon or color out of place.  The backgrounds are also flawless, and the characters are very well developed.Sound 5/5 - The music isn't bad, neither is the voice acting.  Also the sound effects during combat are flawless, well timed, and perfect.Controls 5/5 - The controls are very easy to learn, attacking happens flawlessly and exceptionally smoothly.  Ultimately, the game is more of a button masher as I find that I get further by randomly pressing buttons than by actually attempting to utilize any real attacks.Characters 5/5 - The characters are absolutely awesome... most of them.  Astaroth was perfectly designed and he looks crazy as hell, also Ivy and Nightmare are awesome.  On the down side I find that Yoshimitsu was poorly designed and is done much better in Tekkan 5.  They should have made his look cooler and creepier as he does in Tekkan, not kind of loserish.  Additionally, why the hell would they put Heachi?? Couldn't they find a better cross over character from Tekkan? I think Devil Jin would have made a sicker cross over.. but that is me lol.  BTW, Voldo is awesome, my favorite he is the hardest to use, but at the same time if you master him, you can beat anyone or anything that stands in your way!Unlockables 5/5 - There are tons of unlockables.  You will be there for hours trying to buy everything from weapons, to game art, to new costumes.  Some of the new costumes are tackey, but thats ok, I prefer most of the originals.  Also, you can buy videos, and did I mention lots and lots of awesome weapons with all kinds of cool features.  Unfortunately you can't buy characters though, those you have to earn by beating them or by fulfilling certain aspects of the game.Game Modes 5/5 - There are tons of modes.  You have classic arcade which when you beat inferno gives you character profiles of each character after you win with them.  You have a time trial, you have survival and a ton of others.  Additionally you have a section called \"weapon master\".  While this section of the game is awesome, it can also be very difficult and super angering.  At first I hated the damn weapon master , but as I got used to it I found it more and more fun and far more addictive.  The crazy part is that once you beat it once, you have to beat it a second time, and holy hell the second time around is crazy hard!Truthfully the special moves are also awesome.  Ivy uses a cool sword that doubles as a whip which is great for long range attacks.  Additionally as angering as this game can get, it is absolutely addictive.  As much as I want to put the game down out of sheer anger and frustration, I simply cannot because of its addictiveness.Oh and what the hell you give me suckie Charade but not Inferno! I WANT TO USE INFERNO!!The Bad:What is with all the reading? This is so elementary, you have gorgeous graphics, you should be using them for gorgeous cut scenes, not making me read the story.Next the computer/AI in this game absolutely sucks.  The game does not have easy or medium or hard modes available for the weapon master, no, it goes from piece of cake easy (you blow through the game in less than 10 minutes in arcade mode and stuff like that), that you can just blow through the game by button mashing, to exceptionally hard that it makes me put the game down... The weapon master is super easy for the first 5 levels, than after that it is nightmarishly hard.. get ready to have alot of broken controlers after throwing them against the wall in anger! Dont dictate to me the difficulty, let me pick it.  Secondly, when the computer isnt just standing their taking your punishment, it is out cheating against you.  The computer has stronger moves than you, deals more damage than you and can block and execute moves that you cant.  Really? Put us both on the same set of rules!  Its mind boggling how Astaroth or Nightmare can connect with you from a mile away but when you play as them you are too slow to hit anything.  And please, dont even get me started on Cervantes... really? He kills you with a move that takes 90% of your life in one hit, and he uses it repeatedly.. real fun!  Also, the characters are oddly skewed, the female characters tend to be faster more fluid and deadlier, while the male characters are slow as hell. How does it make sense that Astaroth has a gigantic ax and is massive but he deals less damage than Taki who is tiny?  I can understand him being akward and slower, but weaker? really now?In my opinion, this is a great game.  Pick it up, play it, enjoy it, but definately remember that it can get crazy hard and the AI can annoy the hell out of you!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2011"}

That much was true for some of their older games, and this collection has most of the games that helped mold that campaign.The graphic smoothing option is really nice, and anyone familiar with emulators (not that I am) will remember the Super-Eagle modes in emulation. It basically takes the pixels and smooths them out, making it look like a flash game rather than a 16-bit pixel game. A good example is that ofDouble Dragonfor Live Arcade. This feature is eye candy for some, but others may want to just leave this option off. I prefer it in some games, and some I'd rather have the graphics a little pixelated because the feature smooths things to a point were it just looks to different. No sound enhancements, thank goodness!The games all have individual options. For instance, if you like the graphic smoothing forGolden Axebut would prefer to have Sonic in his true graphic format, you don't have to swap manually between the two. Another nice thing is each game has a save file, not a built-in save slot. So if I'm late for work and I'm on the end boss of Streets of Rage, I can save, quit, and load later.While there's several really terrific games, including most of the Sonic games, the one thing that should have been added is theToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotronseries, as well as a few others. SEGA has some of 16-bits finest games, and there were certainly a lot more than 49 exclusives. Also, given the fact that the PS3 supports Blu-Ray and even the Xbox 360 has a disc capacity of 8GB or more, I'd have loved to see some 32x games or even some of SEGA CD's really good games (Night Trap, anyone?). Anyway you shake it though, this is a terrific collection, and thank goodness for Trophies! The Trophies in the game are pretty easy to get and there's only one per game, but those are just added bonuses to a killer collection. I just hope they have some DLC soon.My only big complaint is the lack of online play. Sure, lacking this feature keeps the games true to tradition, but c'mon! It's the 21st century!This is the SEGA collection to get, although I'd have loved to see a \"Collection, Vol. 1\" so I could expect to see another one in this same category. There's a few things missing from this library to call it perfect, but overall, 49 games for $30 is a killer deal. Add that to your trophy collection. Now, where's the \"Beat 'em Up Arcade Collection\" featuring The Simpsons Arcade, X-Men, and the many, many other great co-op beat 'em ups of the 90s?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00CX8VY4S","description":"","reviewerName":"UziHorowitz","summary":"Ignore the Bandwagon Haters","reviewText":"Ever since Watch Dogs was re-revealed to the world after its stunning 2012 E3 debut, this game has gotten a level of unnecessary hate that was just silly to watch. The internet bandwagon haters went into a tizzy screaming &#34;downgrade&#34; like a bunch of children, going off on incessant temper tantrums, causing us sane gamers to just sigh at their behavior.Anyways, were they right? In one word: No. In two words: Heck no.Now with that said, it's certainly true that the graphics do not look as good as the 2012 E3 debut, but it's also true that Ubisoft said that that version was an unfinished build running on PC hardware, so they weren't lying to anyone, and I'm certainly not an Ubisoft apologist seeing as how I find most of their games disappointing. But even then, while it doesn't look that good, it still looks pretty great most of the time, especially at night. It's true that daytime is less impressive, but it still looks rather good overall. I would recommend turning down the brightness a good bit in-game for the best results.As for the game itself, I'm surprised how much I'm enjoying it since like I said earlier, I'm not a huge fan of many Ubisoft games, so I entered this game with a healthy dose of skepticism. That said, I was blown away by what I experienced. First mission starts, it's stealth, and not only is the stealth really fun, the mood and setting totally sell the mission and opening of the game. Once you get out, you're introduced to the open world that Watch Dogs offers, and it's quite beautiful the first time you see it. Both the driving and gun combat are incredibly solid, but I'm more of a stealth guy when it comes to games, and Watch Dogs has delivered on that front. There's also a lot to see and do in the world, including hacking conversations, into bank accounts, seeing personal information of civilians, tons of side content, etc. It just offers so much.I must say that I'm also really enjoying the soundtrack. It has a lot more recent music recorded after 2000 like Spitalfield and Alkaline Trio, to name a few.In addition to all of the single player offerings, Watch Dogs has a very fun online component, and it's an absolute hoot. Granted, I haven't played all that much of it yet, but what I have played I have thoroughly enjoyed.It's a shame that the &#34;downgrade&#34; in graphics has caused too many to rage on internet forums, on Amazon, on Metacritic, etc., and trying to tarnish the hard work of the people who dedicated years of their lives to create this game. But hey, that's the world we live in.4.5/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2014"}

The main one is the Vital Suits, VS, which are like big combat mechs you can ride around in and fight with, lots of fun. On the one player game the main thing I like is the huge boss battles. The bosses all look great and are fun to fight. The game has several difficulty settings. The \"normal\" mode isn't too hard but it also has a hard mode and an extremely hard mode if you're up for a challenge. Of course the multiplayer is fun. It has different modes to keep things interesting.There are a few problems that keep this game from being better. The first is that you walk very slow. This problem is alleviated some by the use of a grapple that you can use to quickly move around in the multi-player stages, but in the one player there isn't as much to grapple on to. The second problem is the enemy AI. Even on the hardest difficulty the enemies all seem rather stupid. This makes the game on normal difficulty seem really easy, but the game can still be very difficult on the harder modes. A third problem is the story suffers a little from bad localization.The main thing that makes this game different is the use of thermal energy. In the one player game you are able to use the \"harmonizer\" to refill your health using thermal energy. In the multiplayer you don't have this option and only use the thermal energy to power VS and energy weapons. In the one player if you run out of thermal energy you will lose health until you refill it or die, but running out in multiplayer only means you can't use a VS or energy weapons until you refill. You get thermal energy from every enemy you kill, from \"way points\", and from T-energy storage containers. On multiplayer there are specific places you can stand at to fill your energy. You continue to lose thermal energy while walking around and you use even more while using a VS. This help balance out the game and you must consider your T-energy when deciding whether to use a VS or Energy weapons.Overall the good in this game out does its shortcomings. I really enjoy playing this game and would encourage people to give it a try.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2007"}

He looks more like a Teenager in Twighlight Princess for the WEI system, so I took the plunge.The cartoon like graphics don't get on my nerves as much as some people, in fact Nintendo is known for it. What really worked me on this game was the camera when you faced the bosses.For some reason the camera was always trying to give me great shots of Link, which is nice if you're watching a movie but not good if you're facing a target that is trying to kill you! And once the camera view changed, so did the directional control. I find myself more than a few times stuck against a wall or in a corner, while the various bosses would let me have it!I also didn't like the way the camera would swing wildly to the front view of Link, like a reverse angle, everytime he would come out of a door when exploring. It gave me motion sickness after about five hours of game play.Another thing that was a problem for me was sailing to the next mission. It seemed to take forever and I couldn't steer the boat very well, especially when the sharks would come out and attack or trying to dig for treasure in the sea.Aside from the problems I've had with the game, the good thing was the cinematic after you launch the grappling hook. When you find a target that you can actually hook onto, the game cuts to a cinematic that shows the grapple flying around it. Actually this was also a bad thing because it happens when you are facing one of the bosses and it really gets annoying to see the cut-scene when your adrenaline is pumping.Another good thing is that all the established features of the other Zelda games are here including the reviving fairies, the puzzles, the interaction etc. and the involved story line.I just couldn't get past the camera thing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2007"}

You have only 1000 dollars to spend and you can only pick one dog.  I picked a male Shiba Inu and then we were back at home.Home:  You are limited to your house after you come home from the kennel.  Your house is where you will train your dogs, feed them, and play with them.  It is also the link to everywhere else.  You have to calm your dog down before you can name it.  You have to say your dog's name several times before it actually learns it like any trick.  You then have to teach it to sit following the on screen instructions before you can do anything else.  After that you can basically do anything.Supplies list: This is where everything you found, bought and need for your dog.  They are divided into groups to make it easier to find what you need.Go Out:  This is the link to everything else.The following titles are located in Go out.Walk:  You will probably be spending the most time in this section.  Before  you can walk you have to draw the route you want to go and come back to your house.  When the stamina bar goes to the bottom, you can't go any farther and you have to redraw the route.  The more you walk, the more your stamina bar will increase so you can go to new places.  To enter something, just draw up to the entrance and continue on with your walk.  Your dog can only walk every thirty minutes.  The places that you can enter are:Parks:  These are wide open places that perfect for disc competitions.  Sometimes there are other dogs there who you can play with.  Basically your house except it's bigger and you can't teach your dog new tricks here.Gym:  These are used for practicing for the current level of agility trials you are on.  They contain obstacles that match the current skill level of agility trials you are on.  Only after coming here may you do agility trials.Discount Store:  Basically a pet supply store only the items are a lot cheaper.When you're dog is walking it's the only time you're dog goes to the bathroom so make sure you clean up after them or you will be fined.  If you go over a blue item box on the screen you'll find neighborhood dogs to play with or your dog will find a free gift.Info: Which is located in the go out section displays trainer points, friends list, your profile, trainer accomplishments, and things like that.Contests: Which is located in the go out section has three different contests you can enter each having five difficulty classes.  If you you get third place or above, you get a trophy with a cash prize and you move up to the next difficulty.  If you don't get in the rankings, you go down one difficulty level.Disc competition:  You throw a frisby and judging by how far it goes and if your dog catches it in mid-air will determine how many points you'll get.  Poke your dog to make it come back and do it over again.  You have sixty seconds to get a certain number of points.  If your dog misses it, you won't be awarded any points and your dog still has to bring the disc back.Agility Trial: You control your dog and make it jump over obstacles and go through tubes and things like that.  If you mess up on an obstacle you'll get a fault.  Get a certain number of faults and you'll lose.  Whoever has the best time and the least amount of faults  will win.Obedience Trial:  I have not tried this out yet but I believe if you say the right command and your dog does it correctly, you won't lose any points.  But if your dog doesn't obey the comannd, you'll lose points and whoever has the least amount of mistakes will win.You can only enter 3 contests per day with each dog.Bark mode: Multi-player.  I can't do it yet because my brother doesn't have the game yet.  You can play together.  I think that sums it up pretty nicely.Shopping:  Well this is where you buy and sell stuff.  The following titles are links.Kennel:  Buy and look at dogs.SecondHand shop: Sell stuff here.Interior Decorator:  Remodel your house.Pet Supply Store: Buy supplies here.  I usually just buy stuff from the discount store because it's so much cheaper.Dog Hotel: Since you can only have three dogs in your house, this is where you can put other dogs or just if you want to take care of only one dog at a time.  You should swap dogs every now and then to make sure they're fed and have enough water.(Your dogs won't die if you don't feed them or if you don't give them water.)The Dogs:  My family doesn't have a dog but the dogs in here act like real dogs.  I'm guessing it's similar to raising a real dog too.  The graphics display the dogs perfectly.  No other system could have been better for this game.  The town looks amazing when you walk through it.  I love watching my dogs wrestle and mess around in my house.  The sound effects are cool too.  I love how each dog has their own bark.Overall a great game, good replay value.  The game is kind of boring in the beginning because you can't do much but after you another dog, it's awesome.  A must buy.  My only regret is I want more places to go to when you're walking your dog.  I wish you could go to other people's houses and play with them instead of encountering them when you go over a blue box.Whoever wrote the review of them making Nintendogs for PSP is stupid.

I only recently played Rayman Origins and was blown away by the 2D platformer. As the name implies it takes Rayman back to the roots of the franchise. I still remember playing Rayman on my Atari Jaguar and Origins really took me back, but with stunning high definition artwork and silky smooth framerates. While the engine and graphics were undeniably current gen, the breadth of Origins as a game was fairly old school. The co-op and unlockable characters were nice but aside from that it could have been a game from yesteryear. And that extends to difficulty. Admittedly, my reflexes aren't what they were, but I found that Rayman Origins difficulty level was pretty consistently on the difficult side, even in earlier levels. Rayman Legends takes the stellar game play and design from Rayman Origins, beefs it up even more, then adds the wealth of features, modes and extras that you expect from a modern AAA title. Legends does not feel like a classic 2D platformer enhanced with modern graphics,  it feels like a modern 2D platformer, if such a thing existed. The quantity of unlockables in this game is staggering, from costumes to challenge modes to creatures and even classic Origins levels. I really like the challenge modes, once unlocked there are daily and weekly challenge levels where you compete with the world for best times or most lums collected. You get to see ghosts of other players close to your current rank to compete against which really adds to the experience. Creatures that you unlock will give you lums on a daily basis if you visit them (and lums are the currency for unlocking costumes, characters and the like). All these things combine to have you coming back day after day for a long time. Its just plain fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2013"}

I have not played the multiplayer.After installing the DX11 patch and the High Resolution texture pack, I have to say that this game has the best looking graphics I've ever seen.  Unfortunately, the \"wow\" factor of the graphics is not enough to sustain my interest in this run-of-the-mill on-rails shooter.  I'm quite shocked at how bland and boring the gameplay is.  It's nothing but going from checkpoint to checkpoint and killing everything in between.  That would be forgivable, but the AI in this game is really quite awful.  It's very, very easy to clear an area because the enemies rarely do anything other than stand in one spot behind cover and wait for you.  The fact that the suit options have been simplified (no strength and speed modes) means that my primary way of playing Crysis (running into a group and using strength to humiliate them) is no longer viable.  It's still possible to do some of that stuff, but you have to hold your melee and jump buttons for a couple of seconds before it will work, and I find it to be too slow to bother with. The game now feels like I'm playing the single player mode of Modern Warfare.  That's not a good thing in my eyes.  Crysis 2's multiplayer might be decent, but I really have no interest in it.I loved FarCry, Crysis, and Warhead, but Crysis 2 misses the mark so spectacularly that I can't even believe it was made by the same company.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2011"}

Here I am, eight years after the fact coming back to it to see how it plays and compares with later games in the series.It doesn't fare as well.I'm an old enough gamer (28) to still appreciate how revolutionary this game was for its time, both gameplay and pushing the envelope on what they could get released for a console (unfortunately still branded as a child's toy by much of society).  Still, the game is not much fun to play, even compared to its immediate successor Vice City.For starters, navigating the city is itself un-fun.  With no big map overview its hard to get oriented.  Much of the landscape/architecture doesn't stand out, so I found myself navigaing by remembering road curves/intersection angles on the small immediate-area map.  This is further hindered by objectives that you don't get to see where they are, only what direction they are in (until you're close enough to see them onscreen).  Also, finding the Pay N Spray (While being hounded by the authorities) is difficult without any locational indicatord until you've been on an island for an hour or two to get familiar.Many of the missions are simply not passable on the first try.  They're not that diffcult in the end, but most will likely take 2+ tries to figure out exactly what you're doing.  It usually has suprises like suddenly getting 5 stars wanted rating (or attacked by a half-dozen driving members of some gang) or suprise insta-killed by the FBI (or some other government people) abound.  Ocasionally it reqires out of the box thinking to react to an event and kill someone before they can get away (ie you have to know to block a certain alley with a bus/fire truck to cutoff an escape route beforehand or else its almost impossible to catch up).  The biggest fun-killer though is the constant aribtrary time limits that get thrown on the missons.Bugs abound.  I've had missions where targets become invincible, people I'm supposed to pick up in a vehcile don't appear, or they get stuck and stop following, or spawn inside a building/terrain feature and get stuck.Still, the game has some good aspects that stand out even now.  While the graphics are relatively bland, there is a lot going on and the game almost never hiccups or loses framerate.  The voice acting is above average even for nowadays; it must have been spectacular 8 years ago.  It's got that Rockstar polish...that touch of irreverant humor and good storytelling (even if its limited and your character has no personality; literally).GTA3 was a great and revolutionary game when it came, and set the ground for not only sequels, but launched a new genre of game.  The numerous improvements that have been made over the years though expose a lot of the gliches and problems in this one though.  Unless you are bound and determined to play all of the GTA games like me (or have already played them) I recommend steering clear of this one and getting one of its successors.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2009"}

Like its predecessors, this game is well-designed, a lot of fun to play, and has great writing.  It makes some use of the DS' touch-screen and microphone, but is primarily played with the usual control pad and buttons.The basic idea in this game is that Princess Peach gets kidnapped (no surprise here) and Mario and Luigi need to travel the Mushroom Kingdom and beyond to rescue her.  What's new is the fact the player also gets to control Bowser, and for a substantial part of the game Mario and Luigi are shrunk to a small size and actually inside of Bowser!  There's a distinct difference in how Bowser and Mario/Luigi fight, which serves to keep the gameplay fresh, and there are many times where what Bowser does influences what Mario and Luigi experience inside of him.Combat with both Bowser and Mario/Luigi should be familiar to anyone who's played a Mario RPG game before.  Battles are turn-based, with carefully timed button presses an integral part of both attacking and defending.  Good timing is important, but not too hard to execute with a little bit of attention.  An ingenious part of the game design is that different monsters have different cues for when you should defend, so that as you move from one area to another combat remains interesting.  Some of the special moves make use of the touch screen, and behave like short mini-games.  There are a few minor annoying parts of the game - I found the encounters where Bowser gets super-sized to be difficult to control, and it would be nice if you could just automatically win battles with monsters much weaker than your own, but these problems aren't a big deal.The look of the game and the sound and music are really great.  The game world is brightly colored and well animated, while the music is catchy without being annoying.  The game itself is also quite long; you should expect a typical play-through to take somewhere in the neighborhood of thirty to forty hours.  There are a few secrets and optional extras to explore after finishing the main storyline, although these are not as involved as what you might find in other RPGs.This game is one of the best RPGs available on the DS right now, and I highly recommend it for any fan of the genre, or for people interested in seeing what RPGs are like.  There is a lot of dialogue and text, so if you're getting this game for a young child make sure he or she is willing to read.  As long as you don't expect to find a platformer (heck, even if you expected a platformer), you'll have great fun playing this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2010"}

Forza 2 was a good one that should have been great. It had amazing graphics and physics, no arguing against that. But it made the same mistake Ferrari F355 Challenge on the Dreamcast did. It was too dang hard. The thing about simulations is that while they are interesting for exploring the possibilities in the real world without real-world consequences (wrecking cars that cost millions isn't something you can do any day of the week for real), they also tend to be a bit low on the fun factor once the novelty of the realism wears off (unless you are just an incurable realism fanatic). Thankfully, the creators of Forza learned their lesson and made this more than just a great sim, but a great game.If there is one thing Microsoft does well, it is stealing. Added to the already formidable Gran Turismo-ish simulation physics and real-world feel and the in-cockpit views borrowed from Project Gotham, we now have the rewind ability from the amazing GRID. When you take the variable difficulty of Forza, correct the ridiculous braking of Forza 2 (with brakes turned to 200% I still regularly slammed into walls), and add in some brightly colored graphics and brief exciting tracks (maybe a suggestion from GRID and need for Speed Shift) to replace the drab boring tracks from Forza 2. The rewinds go a loooong way to ease the irritation of crashing at the end of the final lap I experienced so many, many times in Forza 2.I can't say anything about the online features of the game, as I don't have an Internet connection at home. The garage and upgrade features are largely unchanged, but I am deeply grateful for the automatic upgrade/downgrade option so that I don't have to tweak a car endlessly to qualify for a race. As in the second Forza it's nice to be able to hire a driver to do the races you don't like, and the experience system for cars and drivers goes a long way to keep you playing. The new Touge events and other new styles are nice, but once again it feels like Forza is just playing catch-up to GRID (I saw the EXACT same Touge track in that game, though it is nice to see it in a more real-world light).In yet another move to copy GRID (and a very welcome one), the A.I. cars no longer race in perfect lines, but actually overshoot corners and spin-out and wreck from time-to-time. It goes a long way to making the game feel more like a race event and less like a cold calculating simulation.The presentation side of the game is a trade-off. While the menu interface is lovely, bright, and colorful, it also takes longer for menus, races, and events to load than any other racing game I have ever seen. I kid you not, there is actually a \"Menu Loading\" screen that you will see every couple of minutes. While the graphics are truly outstanding, the extensive loading is the price that you pay, and especially when you are racing a lot of short events, they can start to seem a bit much.The game requires a very large install, so make sure you have room on your hard drive (it even comes with a second DVD full of content you need to load the first time you play). And if, like me, you don't have Internet....you are going to be irritated to find that there are track and car packs included that are download only. That right. In a move doubtless designed to highly discourage buying the game used, instead of coming with a disc loaded with extra cars and tracks, the game comes with download codes for the content.This is a beautiful game. And you can tell by the demo that it has a much more colorful and generally fun atmosphere than the last Forza. If you like your realism, but don't like it to be punishing you will probably enjoy this game. If you enjoyed Forza and Forza 2 it's a must-buy. It is in my opinion, the best racing simulation in the world today...until Gran Turismo 5 comes out at least.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0001ADAME","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution. With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well. As if the technical edge wasn't enough of a reason to invest in the Xbox version, it's also Live Aware, and comes packaged with an exclusive multiplayer level (the Coliseum). Without the slightest hint of doubt, the Xbox version gets The Edge.Concept:Clean up the west as a merciless cowboy in this heavily influenced spaghetti western gameGraphics:The character models are not the most detailed, but the environments look nice and I love the cameraworkSound:A remarkable soundtrack lures players into the vibe of the westPlayability:Unnaturally short levels and satisfactory run and gun actionEntertainment:The stages should have been longer, but replay is abundant in the number of unlockables and enjoyableReplay:ModerateRated:8 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:Buck up, cowpokes. All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"TRFB","summary":"Great and unique Game","reviewText":"What other game allows you to play a western movie?!?!This game is so addicting.  I finished playing the game.  And the best part is when you play the game again and start a new game, all the guns, items you bought through the first time are there for you to use!!! That's awesome.  Some games don't let you carry items and weapons over to the next new game.  Great job.Also, great job on the whole ambience of sound, music and the way the graphics look.  Like a grainy western movie complete with lines through the film and dots appearing at random.I understand that some people don't like to play the game because it's linear.  However, keep in mind that it's like a movie.  A specific plot and path to complete.  The plot is a bit simple, but that's what the old western movies were made from.  Simple plot and a lot of cool shots!!So, I think this game is just fantastic.  I disagree that it was boring and repetitive.

It's great when we all get together that they can have a game to play together.  And yes, it is really cheesy, but it's fun and that's what counts.  I would much rather see a group of 5 - 9 year old kids playing this than Grand Theft Auto!The box includes: Skylanders Giants game, portal of power, 3 Skylanders figures, 1 character collector poster, 3 sticker sheets with secret codes, and 3 trading cards.Yes.  The Portal of Power.  Basically you plug this in and then the kids put the figure they like in the middle of the Portal and the game boots up the story with that character.  If you already have a Portal of Power from a previous version, then you don't need to buy the starter set, but can buy the standard set with the game and one figure.I know that folks talk about the story mode in this game being shorter than in previous versions, but I cannot attest since this is my first Skylanders experience.  But the kids haven't really said anything.  They actually go for the Battle mode.The voice acting is quite fun.  Graphics are pretty decent (playing the Wii version not the Wii U).  The story mode is fun and I don't mind it being a little short.  The battle mode more than makes up for it.I highly recommend this for youngsters.  It's a bit of a phenomenon, and the kids seem to really enjoy it.  Plus, getting the extra figures is kind of fun as well.  (happy shopping!)  You can buy them retail if you can find them (they often sell out of the better ones) or get stuck with high prices on ebay.  But it's fun to add the additional characters and build them up.  There was a bunch of additional content for the first game, so I expect Activision and Nintendo will be publishing some additional DLC (probably for a price) very soon.Fun for kids and adults.

Though the game play is similar it's a good thing.  The missions are interesting and fun.  The mini games and challenges provide hours of fun outside of the story mode.  The hunting alone keeps me occupied for hours.  Then there's the poker, blackjack, liar's dice, five finger fillet, horse shoes, breaking horses and treasure hunting.  The honor and fame systems give it a kind of \"RPG\" feel though you don't \"level up\" but it definitely impacts how people react to you later in the game.  I love the random encounters and the other various side missions.  Did I mention the hunting?  Deer, buck, goats, big horn sheep, elk, buffalo, armadillos, coyotes, rabbits, foxes, wolves, grizzlies, eagles, hawks, vultures, crows, songbirds, bobcats and cougars.  Those are just the ones I've come across and I'm only about 50% through the game.  Every one of those animals can be \"skinned\" except for the birds whose feathers you can collect and turn their meat, hides, claws, horns, pelts and/or antlers in for money at general stores and/or gunsmith shops.  You can also loot people's bodies for money and you can collect their dropped weapons and ammo.  If you're not the kind of person that likes to complete a game to 100%, then this game may not be one of your favorites.  I personally love collectibles and side missions to distract me while I'm bored with the main story line.  Which is why I also loved Fallout 3.  I am looking very much forward to DLC for this game.  My only wish is that DLC would add more area to the map to explore further.  However, the map as it is now is HUGE.  I ran from the far bottom left corner of the map to the far upper right corner on a fast horse and it took me close to 10 - 15 minutes...but that's with stopping to skin a deer or two and stop to help a few folks who yelled for it.In short...if you love open-world games with plenty more to do other than the main story line, GET THIS GAME!

I literally screamed in frustration as I tackled a boss for the umpteenth time, but my suffering made me empathize with Vincent far more than I might have otherwise.

Rhodes","summary":"Survive a Nightmare","reviewText":"The Good:+Very good story+Simple to learn gameplay but difficult to master+Multiple endings+Very pretty game+Fantastic Soundtrack+The meter of \"lawful\" or \"chaos\" presented here is much more unique than in most games. There's not being a \"good\" or \"bad\" guy, it is only about figuring out who Vincent is.The Bad:-The difficulty is going to turn off some gamers-It's a little too easy to screw up unintentionally-The stages near the end seem based a lot around luck rather than skill---Note: The Following review is lengthyIn recent times there haven't been a slew of games that have really stuck out. A lot tend to be either the next first person shooter or have you facing off against aliens as some kind of super soldier or something along those lines. And as much fun as those games can be, it is always refreshing to see something slightly different. Atlus often strives to give a good gaming experience and it shows here. Catherine is a very unique game that will challenge players and give them an experience that few video games can give. This is because of Catherine's unique design and style.You take on the role of Vincent. He's been dating Katherine (with a \"K\") for five years now, and it's come to the point where she wants to take that relationship to the next level. A level Vincent isn't sure he's ready for yet. While thinking this over at the bar one night he suddenly meets a spunky young woman named Catherine (with a \"C\") and she's almost everything Vincent wants in a woman. He begins an affair with this woman, but as the narrative goes on we see that Vincent is a conflicted man, confused by what he wants. To make matters worse, young men have been dying of mysterious deaths in their sleep and Vincent himself might be next if he can't figure out how to escape his nightmares. But what do his nightmares have to do with this mysterious woman named Catherine? Quite a bit actually and as Vincent dives into this mystery he'll learn more about what's really going on... as well as himself.The narrative in Catherine is quite amusing. Vincent is actually a likeable and sympathetic character. Despite his predicament the game manages to get you to understand just who Vincent is. But in the end it is ultimately you who will lead Vincent to what he really wants. Is he ready to settle down with the woman he's been dating for four years or is she truly not right for him?There are two aspects to Catherine's gameplay. The first and probably most unique is what happens during the day. You'll watch cutscenes, none of which are really long, and then you'll usually find yourself in the Stray Sheep. A bar where you can go and talk to your friends, send and receive text messages and get a few drinks. On the surface this doesn't seem like much, but as you talk to certain people you'll often be asked questions. How you answer showcases the kind of guy Vincent is. There's a meter in the corner that shows you going closer to a \"Lawful\" side (blue) or a \"Chaotic\" side (red). While most games make their choices quite obvious, no one way is truly \"good\" or \"bad\". No side is either \"heroic\" or \"evil.\" The game even encourages you to be as honest as possible when playing through the game. It gives a nice little twist as some of the questions you're asked don't have obvious \"lawful\" or \"chaotic\" answers. And again, because it bears repeating, neither side is better than the other. The impact of these choices will change Vincent's inner thoughts during some of the game's crucial scenes. Ultimately it's about deciding what Vincent wants and it's actually quite important for the player to be as honest as possible--at least during your first play through.The second aspect of Catherine's gameplay comes during Vincent's dreams. The nightmare stages are where the crux of the actual gameplay come out. You'll ascend towers by pulling out and pushing blocks that allow you to scale higher and higher. It's a simple game to learn, but as you progress things become a little more challenging. In early stages you'll be faced with sheep who are also trying to climb the tower who will do their best to knock you down. You'll also be faced with different types of blocks as you get further. There will be cracked blocks that will slowly crumble under you, ice blocks that you'll slide on, trap blocks where spikes shoot out and more.In between levels you'll be on landings where you can save your game and talk to some of the other sheep. Some will teach you techniques, others give you a chance to make choices that will affect your lawful/chaotic meter... but the most important aspect is what happens before each level. You'll enter a confessional and be asked a series of questions. These questions have a greater impact on your meter but are also interesting questions. You'll be asked odd question such as whether or not you prefer boxers or briefs and then you'll be asked other strange questions such as what really constitutes cheating: An emotional tryst or a physical fling? The questions aren't all black and white. And sometimes the answer you'd think would lead you more toward the lawful side will actually lead you more toward the chaotic one instead. Again, the game encourages you to answer them as honestly as you can.Catherine is an easy game to learn, but it's difficult the master. Some of the puzzles are very difficult. Without utilizing some of the techniques you'll learn from the sheep you probably won't find yourself getting far. The lower floors beneath you are also collapsing away. You can \"undo\" moves a certain amount of times, but that doesn't always make the game easier. Gamers who are frustrated easily might not enjoy Catherine as much. You're given rewards for getting to the top of the tower as fast as possible without stopping, including some unlockables if you're really skilled. But it's not hard to find gamers who find some of Catherine's challenges to be a bit much. You'll also encounter bosses from time to time and some of those levels feel as though luck plays a bigger part than skill itself. Luckily Catherine is quite generous with giving you extra lives, and being able to undo moves helps the difficulty somewhat. They also give you items to help you along the way.Catherine isn't a very long game by any means. Your first romp will probably take you just over ten hours to complete. But there is incentive to play through again. You can experience the story in different ways if you wish by making different choices which affect your meter. This also plays a big role in the kind of ending you get. Catherine has eight different endings. And which one you get depends on your choices. I won't tell you there are no \"bad\" endings in Catherine, however, each side of the meter actually has a different set of endings. This is partially why being honest is important. Because going the \"chaotic\" route doesn't give you a \"bad\" or \"evil\" ending anymore than going the lawful route will guarantee you a \"good\" ending.There's no doubt that Catherine is a beautiful game. It has a very anime like quality to it and some vibrant character models. The game is also populated with lots of different characters that you'll talk to, who are all well developed in their own way. The voice acting and the writing are also not so bad. There are some moments where the voice acting encounters a hitch, but not too many. The music, however, is a real treat. Much of the music you'll hear in the game are remixed classical tunes from some famous composers such as Bach, Beethoven, Holst, Handel and Chopin. You'll recognize most of them when they begin to play. Those who bought the game brand new will receive a music CD where you can listen to these tracks.Catherine isn't a perfect game by any stretch of the imagination. We talked about some of its difficulty, but it also has a couple of control issues every now and then. The biggest issue being they feel a little loose. It's easy to make Vincent do something you didn't intend, such as push a block or run in the wrong the direction unintentionally at just the slight tilt of the analog stick. Likewise, the final set of levels seem much more dependent on luck rather than any actual skill. You'll be more than happy to have that redo option once you get there.There doesn't seem to be much of any real difference between the PS3 and XBOX360 version.  No one version is really offers anything that the other doesn't.  So pick whichever one you want.  Both come with an art booklet and music CD.In the end Catherine is a great game. It's narrative and overall structure of its story makes it a game worth checking out. It also provides a challenge for players willing to undergo the trials. Though some will find the challenge a bit much, those who slave through it will find a sense of accomplishment for doing so. The dynamic of the meter and multiple endings also help Catherine out a little. Simply put, if you like puzzle games and good stories, Catherine is worth picking up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2011"}

Not that I'm endorsing one version over the other, but it's all about the controls.With that out of the way, Darksiders is a perfect blend of past game concepts i.e. God of War,Zelda and rail shooting stages like Panzer Dragoon.You play as the protagonist War, one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse who is unjustly blamed for the apocalypse by answering the \"call\" and in turn embarks on a quest to unravel the one who had placed the call.The gameplay is solid as well as the voice acting (And Mark Hamil is still doing great  voiceover work .)The weapons are very diverse for a hack and slash; from swords,glaves,a grappling hook to grenade launchers and automatic pistols.Yeah,with these \"toys\" War is as much of a badass as GoW's Kratos if not more.One thing I might add, although i like the orchestral in game soundtrack, there are scenes in which i have to add my own choice of background music (courtesy of xbox's custom soundtrack option) from Metallica's my Apocalypse to Megadeth's Blessed are the Dead:\"A crowned rider with arrows and bowA red rider with a great firey swordFlames come from the one called deathHorror and apocalypse follows(Ride!)

It does seem to be improved in some areas where Sonic Advance 2 wasn't, but there are pluses and minuses to this game as well.  This time, I will start by listing the positive:1.  Cool music and voices.  That's right, this Advance game has voices!  You have to love how the announcer guy says the title, the pairing, and \"congratulations\" at the end.  There are also voices to all of the characters in the game.  It's cool, but nothing big.  You aren't going to be hearing them voice sentences, just simple single words.  As for the music, it's really cool.  I love the Sunset Hill music, as well as Toy Kingdom, and many other of the catchy tunes.2.  The characters from Sonic Advance 2 come back for an encore, but in a whole new style!  This time rather than controlling one character by his or herself, you get a partner.  You use this partner to enhance your own abilities, and perform two basic team moves (one arial, and one ground) basic team move.  This is way too complex to go into detail for this review, but believe me, it's cool!  You only get to play as Sonic and Tails at first, but you can bump into other characters with Sonic to play as them.  You bump into a new character once every other area after the boss.  Also, there are some comical pairings like Sonic and Amy (the \"Lovely Couple\").  You should see Sonic's face!  He's like \"What did I ever do to deserve this?\" with this most bummed look!  Plus when Amy is his partner, she has hearts all around her, runs differently, and gives him a constant adoring look.  It's cute and funny.3.  The levels are lovely.  Either way, you will enjoy at least one of the levels graphic.  Absolutely lovely.4.  The Special stages are fun.  You are basically riding on top of a plane your partner is driving, and you are trying to collect enough rings to get the chaos emerald.  You may maneuver your character left and right on the top, and when you move one direction far enough, the plane will move with you.  Oh, and these stages are in 3D.5.  Omochao joins the series.  You just pick him up for hints.  This is good because he keeps you from being clueless in the game.  He has no voice though.Well that's the good about the game.  The following I list are the flaws:1.  No Tiny chao garden.  This is a first for the series, and it is actually rather disappointing.2.  Not much variety in the team moves, and maybe not enough characters.  Unlike Sonic Heroes, another game that is team oriented, you can only use two team moves that require charging with the R button.  Your team mate's biggest influence is the alterations on your own characters moves.  Also, there are only 5 characters you can create teams with (unless you count a temporary one at the end.  I would say more, but then it would become a spoiler).  You can't make very many team combinations with just 5 characters.3.  Amy is sliding back into her old ways, and some combinations just stink!  Whenever you team up with Amy, you should be admonished that you lose your normal jumping ability, and instead you get a jump that Amy had back in Sonic Advance.  Which is not a good jump, so look out below.  Otherwise, she is a good teammate.  Also, the following team combinations stink, or have something that may be undesirable to you: Knuckles and Sonic (You lose Knuckles' ability to glide and climb.  Instead you get a strange headbutt move), Cream and Sonic (Cheese loses his tracking ability), Tails and Knuckles (Just a warning that Tails loses his normal flight and swimming abilities.  He gains gliding and breaststroke abilities, climbing not included)4.  Just a little thing Id like to mention,  Tails can fly you underwater.  That looks funny, as he shouldn't be able to move his tails like that at all underwater.  I think it is a design flaw.5.  The special stages are hard to get into.  First you have to find all of the chao, then you have to beat the final boss, then you have to find a key in one of the levels and survive while getting it out, then you have to find the special spring that will take you to the stage (which is not in the level).  Oh, and the last Special stage is miserably hard like always.  Good luck...6.  The characters could have been more expressive.  I was hoping to see the feelings of what every couple thought of each other (you know, like Sonic and Amy).  Sonic and Knuckles are \"Fighting Buddies\", Sonic and Tails have \"An Unbreakable bond\", and Amy and Cream become \"Team Jubilee\", but that is where it ends.  Every other combo is just \"OK\".  What does that mean, neutral?  Anyway, I was hoping for more feedback from the characters.That's about it.  Before I close this review, here are some of the best team combinations you should try to make the game easier and more enjoyable: Knuckles and Tails, Cream and Knuckles, Knuckles and Amy (I have no clue, why Amy adds the extra moves), Tails and Amy, and Sonic and Amy (maybe that's not the best team, but you'll get a laugh out of it).  One more thing, you have to beat the final boss, with the all of the chaos emeralds, while controlling Sonic, to get to the extra boss and see the extra ending.  I recommend pairing up with Cream and borrowing her chao for the final boss.  You will get a different teammate for the extra boss, but I am not telling you who... Want a cool adventure?

Blizzard","summary":"An Interesting Take on the Japanese RPG","reviewText":"Noted RPG developer tri-Ace continue their work of creating excellent role-playing games with Resonance of Fate (RoF). In Japan, this game is also called End of Eternity. Not only does RoF follow the traditional RPG formula in many key ways, but it also reinvents how it is presented with a unique story and complex battle system. Unlike new arrivals, such as Final Fantasy XIII, RoF does not try to appeal to the mainstream. Instead, it is an RPG, not unlike Demon's Souls, in that the game appeals to the more hardcore gamer.Story: The main story of Resonance of Fate centers on three characters, Vashyron, Zephyr, and Leanne. The game doesn't really do anything too innovative in the story content itself, but the presentation is unique among most role-playing games. Unlike most RPG's where the story is doled out bit by bit over the course of a chapter or act, RoF's core story only occurs at the beginning or end of a chapter, and following a major boss battle. Thus, you can finish chapters at your own pace without the feeling of being dragged along by the story. This method of storytelling does have the benefit of allowing the gamer to pace themselves, but with several hours between story sequences, it feels a little disjointed and difficult to remember previous events. The story content itself is largely unremarkable, and to avoid spoiling it, I'm not going to mention it, but RoF does diverge from standard RPG fare in one respect: Humor. Like all Japanese RPG's, RoF can be a touch melodramatic and over-the-top at times, however, there were several moments where I couldn't help but laugh out loud at some of the (Intentionally) funny moments. This is a major shift from RPG's that take themselves very seriously. Each of the characters have an important role to play and the story would unravel if their backgrounds were not reasonably fleshed out.Gameplay: Resonance of Fate is meant for the more hardcore RPG players and it shows in how the game is played. The giant tower-world of Basel, think of the Tower of Babel only larger and steam punk, is where all of the game takes place and is split into 12 levels. Each level is a map covered in hexes. Initially, you are restricted to certain levels and cannot access the lower, and more dangerous, levels. From the beginning, not every energy hex on the map is open for exploration, you must use white hexes to open up the area, which can be obtained from battles. Some towns and dungeons are also locked using special colored hexes which are rarer. All energy hexes are specially shaped and you can only place them on the map in areas where the whole hex will cover an area and not fall outside the map. This adds a whole puzzle element to map exploration. If you unlock every hex on a level, you get the ability to warp back to your main base on level four from any station hex you construct on that level. Station hexes are bought using five colored hexes in guilds and allow you to save your game, rest, and head back to base. On the map, you will also find terminals which bestow special benefits on the party, such as being able to cause extra fire damage or increased experience. These terminals can only be activated using colored hexes and require a certain number of colored hexes to activate. As you lay down these colored hexes to activate the terminals, they can be chained with other terminals to increase the benefits but also over dungeons. If you enter a dungeon or have a random encounter on a colored hex which has activated terminals connected to it, you gain the benefit in battle. Terminals play a vital role in many battles and make or break some boss encounters. Towns and dungeons are similar in that you access them from the main level map, but how they are presented differ. Towns have NPC's you can interact with and purchase items from, along with a static camera, while dungeons have rotatable cameras and are like mini-hex maps, similar to the world map but on a smaller scale. RoF is entirely mission-based. The story and side missions are all lumped together in one screen so you know what is needed. Side, or guild missions, are obtained from the Hunter's Guild which releases up to three missions at once on a bulletin board for hunters, you, to perform. These missions can start out very easy, such as a standard delivery request, and can range to very difficult battles with boosted mini-bosses. Completing these guild missions gets you in-game currency and items, but also increases your hunter rank. For every one hundred levels of rank, you get a special item from the guild. RoF also does not have a deep economy even though you do have shops that provide basic equipment. The vast majority of your equipment comes from crafting, whose parts come from quests, broken down loot, or loot itself. You can customize your weapons any way you desire, though, the in-game weapon does not change in appearance, only the blueprint does. By themselves, the weapons don't do much damage, requiring you to customize them. This means that acquiring new weapons is more about the connection points and possible upgrades, rather than raw damage potential. You cannot simply add whatever part you desire to a gun since they have connection points which can restrict you to certain add-ons. Initially, you must take into consideration a weapon's weight as your characters can only equip so much, but this becomes less important as the game progresses. Another interesting, and somewhat superfluous, aspect is the degree in which you can customize your character's appearance. Each character has a wardrobe, which can be expanded at a boutique or exploring, each outfit style, called \"A\" and \"B\", has eight or so sections with items you can customize, from shirts, to pants, to holsters, to boots, even hair and eye color can be customized. So, if you want Leanne to run around Basel wearing a French maid's outfit, you can do it. If you want Zephyr to wear a reindeer costume, you've got it, too. If you want Vashyron to look like a gun slinging biker with all leather, black hair, and futuristic sunglasses, you've got that as well. Costumes don't impart any gameplay advantages, but watching Leanne dressed up as one of Santa's helpers tossing Molotov Cocktails in battle, is priceless.Combat System: Normally, I would include this in the gameplay section, but, due to the complexity, this warrants its own section. Random encounters, compressed dungeon maps (These are dungeon's without any hexes but interconnected battle arenas), and standard dungeon encounters are where battles take place. For the majority of the game, you have all three characters active at once and the battle occurs in an arena environment. Anyone who has played Valkyria Chronicles would get the system very quickly as it shares many of the same elements. Each character is equipped with some sort of gun, either a hand gun or machine gun, along with an equipment case, such as a grenade box or first aid kit. Machine guns cause massive scratch damage in many situations, but cannot outright kill an enemy. Hand guns cause minor direct damage while converting scratch damage into direct damage. Scratch damage heals over time but direct damage is permanent. Therefore, in most battles, you should send a machinegun holder out to cause scratch damage on an enemy one turn, followed by a handgun holder the next. A magazine case is available for the machine gun and can cause status effects on an enemy. This becomes increasingly irrelevant as your characters are able to dual wield later in the game. Both grenades and handguns can cause gauge breakage to an enemy, more on that later. During battle, enemies can only perform actions when you do, thus you can go slow and plan out an attack. To perform an action, your character must \"charge\" their attack. The speed at which a charge happens is determined by the weapon, it's add-ons, and distance from an enemy. As the weapon charges, the damage potential increases exponentially and the possibility of combat skills activating increases, which are obtained during level up, while a timer decreases. The timer indicates the amount of time a character has during a given turn, if they aren't doing anything or stop charging a weapon, the timer, and all other battlefield activity stops. The enemy can interrupt your charge by firing at you, and you can do the same, however, it seems as though you stopping an enemy from charging their weapon is more rare. At the bottom of the screen, you have the hero gauge, which can be expanded by defeating bosses or exploring the map. The hero gauge is vital, it allows you to perform hero actions and recover if your character is overwhelmed by scratch damage. Hero actions are similar to standard attacks with a few exceptions. First, you are entirely invincible and uninterruptable. Second, time slows down while the charge rate increases. You do have a maximum amount of charge you can have, which is tied to your level in a given weapon, but it is very possible to have two or more attacks that are fully maxed out on charge. Third, you can jump over an enemy or run past them. Some enemies have protective body armor that protects their main hit point (HP) gauge, firing from the ground hits only the armor facing the character while airborne attacks hit all armor equally. From the ground, it is also possible to launch the enemy into the air and juggle them, canceling their turn but also opening up the possibility of a bonus shot which removes the restriction on the amount of charge you can have and vastly increases the amount of loot an enemy drops. While the enemy is in the air, you can jump up from the ground and join them. If you fire your weapon from a higher altitude, you can cause a \"Smackdown\" which is similar to spiking an American football. Performing a smackdown increases the amount of loot they drop and dazes them for a few moments. The hero gauge will also \"revive\" a character that has taken too much scratch damage. If one of your characters is saturated with this type of damage, the hero gauge breaks in half, you lose half of the remaining colored bezels on the gauge, and fragments of it scatter on the battlefield. Those fragments can be reacquired after the battle or during the battle. However, if the enemy obtains a bezel shard, they recover hit points. If you really mess up and the hero gauge breaks again, or you don't have any colored bezels remaining, you enter a critical condition. During this state all damage done to your squad increases, the charge rate decreases, and all damage is direct HP damage. If you lose all your HP (Hit points), it is game over. You can escape from battle or pay a fee and retry, but if you escape, you leave the battlefield and remain in the condition in which you left it until you arrive at your base or an energy station. If you choose to retry, you pay a fee and you restart the battle from the beginning in the same exact condition in which you entered it originally. This is important to remember since you cannot simply leave a compressed dungeon map without using a special item. This means that if you are deep in a dungeon without an escape hex, heavily damaged, and try to leave, you are going to have problems returning to the entrance since most enemies respawn.Not all enemy units are equal in importance during battle. In some fights, there is also an enemy leader. If you take out this leader, you win the battle, however, some battles have no leader, necessitating an enemy-by-enemy elimination. Boss fights can also be tricky in that some are leaders with support units. These units can not only cause you harm, but automatically respawn. Hero actions are vital, you can cause an immense amount of damage in a very short time, ending the battle that much sooner. To recover hero gauge bezels expended from hero actions or a broken gauge, you can eliminate enemies or their armor. Each time you do this, a bezel is filled back in. Breaking an enemy's gauge causes their body, or their armor's, hit point gauge to fracture. To the game, a fractured gauge is treated like a full gauge. Therefore, if you fracture an enemy's gauge into four parts, you not only stun the enemy, but increase the number of bezels you can fill to four or potentially more. If your machine gunner completely loads the fractured HP gauge with scratch damage and a handgun or grenade causes the gauge to fully deplete, breaking the armor or defeating the enemy, you now have four filled bezels returned instead of just one. Hero actions can are plotted in straight lines, as you race to the end point, you are able to perform actions. You can also perform \"tri-attacks\", using resonance points obtained during hero actions. These resonance points are gathered by plotting, and completing, at least to the point of the intersection, a hero action passing between two other characters. During a hero action, a triangular pattern is displayed on the battlefield showing you the path each character will take. While performing a tri-attack, each character will perform an attack, in sequence, while running around the triangle. Like all attacks, you have to charge a tri-attack, however, the charging process for each character happens simultaneously. Most battlefields have walls and bunkers you can hide behind, along with exploding barrels and treasure containers. The leveling system in this game is also unique. You gain one point of experience for every point of damage you cause with a weapon. Each weapon class has an amount of experience it can obtain and the overall level of a character is determined by adding all three weapon class levels together. Therefore, if you have a level 30 in handguns, 30 in machine guns, and 30 in grenades, you have a level 90 character. After every four or five levels in a given weapon, you are granted a skill associated with that weapon. That skill compounds on top of any other skill you might have with that weapon and there is a chance for the skill to activate when you charge an attack during battle. Due to the leveling system, you should switch around weapons to ensure your characters have as many levels as possible. If this sounds complex, it is. This is one of the most complex battle systems I have ever encountered with an RPG. You must learn its nuances or you will become frustrated very quickly.Misc.: Having finished Final Fantasy XIII, I started looking for a new RPG to play, and found Resonance of Fate. This game may not appeal to all players or sale very well, especially since it is cursed with the worst release date in history, between Final Fantasy XIII and God of War 3, but it is certainly worth a look for gamers who love RPG's or a very complex battle mechanic. At first, I was put off by the complexity, and thus, the perceived difficulty, of the game, but as I spent more time with it, I began to appreciate the title more and more. Sure, the game is brutal, but fair, and the story is jarringly split, but the way it pulls everything together is fascinating. The graphics are very nice, though, after playing Final Fantasy XIII on the PS3 in 1080p glory (That's what it says on the back of the box) and Resonance of Fate in 720p, this game doesn't look as good, but it has an interesting and highly detailed steam punk art style. The story is a little generic and presented in a series of vignettes, but the humor and quirkiness of it make it a joy to watch. Audio is also fantastic. The voice acting, with the main characters anyway, is top-notch with Nathan Drake, Desmond Miles, err... Nolan North providing the voice of Vashyron. Musically, the game is all orchestral with the exception of some dungeons using rock. I intend to by the soundtrack as the music really is that good. There are a few stumbling points with Resonance of Fate. For one, collision detection isn't great in some battlefields. For instance, if I plot a hero action over a mechanical enemy and I jump, I may have several feet of clearance between the top of the enemy and my character, but I will still end up hitting an invisible wall, in mid air and falling, stunned, in front of the enemy. I may even plot a hero action all the way to the other side of the battlefield and hit the wall on the other side, even though the path indicated I would not be going over the wall at all. Same thing with bunkers, you need quite a bit of clearance to get over them. If you miss and fall, your hero action is terminated and you're stunned, totally vulnerable. During battles, you and the enemy have audio sprites and sayings, but there were a limited number recorded so it is commonplace to hear the same line spoken over and over again in the same battle. Some of these lines from the enemies are very irritating, like the 1920's sounding gangster saying how dangerous he is or the gang member who says a line about how strong he is but in a valley boy accent (Think valley girl but from a guy) or the overly synthesized deep bass of a mechanical enemy saying he's going to kick my a**. While doing random encounters trying to get a certain number of green colored hexes, this became maddening and I muted the television. This is a multiplatform title developed mainly for the Xbox 360, as denoted by the 720p on the box, so much of the PS3's power isn't utilized though the game runs well. In terms of trophies, this game favors completion more than repetition with the trophies being easier than Final Fantasy XIII's. The vast majority of trophies are earned through simply playing the game or exploring every nook of Basel, but there are some that are repetitive. The trophy that comes to mind is the one where you have to gain stars in all 50 arena ranks. Each rank has ten battles, so you must fight 500 battles to earn that trophy, which is very labor intensive and moderately aggravating if you wait until just before the final boss to do it. Think about it, if you play the game through twice, which is necessary to earn a trophy, and most of the enemies in the arena are much weaker than you, the process can become tedious, fast. If you are going for platinum, go up to level 25 in the arena during your first play though doing one or two ranks per chapter, then finish it off during your next playthrough. Overall, this was a great game, but it is not a Final Fantasy killer with story, nor is it a Grandia with a battle system. This game took about 60 hours to complete the first time and I project about the same for the second playthrough as the arena and the high-level map of Neverland will take a while to get through. Resonance of Fate is an excellent choice for patient gamers who thrive on stats and strategy over fast reflex action.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002BSC54I","reviewerName":"jmpg","summary":"New look, same old formula","reviewText":"I know most people on Amazon want nothing less than a 5-star review for Skyward Sword, but as a gamer who's been playing Zelda games for 20 years, I simply cannot give this game the highest mark. In fact, I'm really baffled as to how this game received so many perfect scores.In 1998, Ocarina of Time took the series into 3D, and the results were successful. The Wind Waker took Ocarina's formula and ran with it some more to greater effects. But, by the time Twilight Princess came around, I've begun to lose patience. It's been the same structure, same formula; only a different theme and look. Skyward Sword, really, does NOTHING new for the series. You have the same story buildup, predictable overworld, annoying companion (Fi), weapon-with-dungeon structure, boring fetch quests. It's just not enough anymore. Even as a standalone game, it's highly flawed.I feel as if Nintendo just tried to sell this game on two things- the graphical style and new motion controls, and hoped that gamers would forgive or even overlook its formulaic shell. It worked on many people; not me. This game was made with the Motion Plus controller in mind, to irritating heights. I really dislike it when Nintendo requires people to buy some peripheral attachment in order to play a game. No, it doesn't make a game \"better\". You wouldn't need such a scheme if your games were quality to begin with. With that said, the controls are way too dependent on motion to the point of gimmickry.I do like the graphical style. It's beautiful. I also like the characterizations in this game. I felt more for the characters here than Twilight Princess. However, after the first few dungeons, I really started to feel the grind of this game. The game is full of irrelevant gimmicks and annoyances, such as the dowsing ability, the weapon upgrades, and Fi the most annoying companion ever. Other things that hurt the game's flow is the inefficiency of the disjointed map (thus the new save system) and BACKTRACKING. A lot of things make this game excruciating and not fun.One last thing: it's 2011/2012, and Nintendo STILL cannot invest the effort to give the Zelda games some quality voice acting?? Heck, games as far back as 1996 had voice acting!This review will be unpopular to most, but I know there are many people who feel the way I do. Being a long-time player of the Zelda series, I've been TOO naive in having faith in this franchise. I've finally taken off my rose-tinted glasses. I cannot support this series anymore unless a big change happens. But I'm not holding my breath.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2012"}

Here's a few features the other consoles don't have:1. Blu-ray, which is clearly winning the format war. PS3 games can come on Blu-ray, the XBox 360 can't ship games on the optional HD-DVD player.2. HDMI 1.3, supports future video formats but more practically supports the new sound formats. HDMI 1.3 is extremely rare in today's equipment.3. Bluetooth.4. DLNA, XBox does have this as well. Both consoles work directly with DLNA to allow content sharing between your PC (Media Player 11) or any other DLNA device.5. Built-in WiFi. It costs $[...] for XBox 360 WiFi.6. Hard drive. Of course the XBox 360 comes optional with a hard drive. The problem here is that developers can't develop for optional hardware. It can be used for a bunch of things but doesn't help game performance by allowing caching like the PS3 does.7. Price. Am I crazy? How could I be using price as and argument for the PS3. Well, Take an XBox 360 Pro for $[...] and add a Wifi and you end up with the same price but still lacking HDMI and all the features above. The XBox 360 elite is a better deal than the Pro but add the HD-DVD drive and we're talking about a $[...] price tag.With an equal feature comparison the PS3 is cheaper than the XBox 360. The one advantage in price the 360 is, is that it's equipment is optional. Unfortunaly for the 360, optional equipment can't be developed for.Right now the XBox360 is the clear content winner. However, if you go to [...] and look at the reviews you'll find only 6 or so games above a 9.0 review. The PS3 already has 3 and potentially by the end of the XMas season will have already passed XBox360 in quantity of superb games.PS3 is quickly catching up and will soon pass XBox in sports games. With other exclusives like Uncharted: Drakes Fortune, Little Big Planet, Home, Metal Gear Solid 4, MLB 07: The Show, and much more Sony is not just offering up a bunch of first person shooter exclusives. It's offering a wide variety of interative experiences.While XBox 360 is the current leader, Wii has found a great and fun market, PS3 is truly taking things to the next level in addition to eventually surpassing the other consoles at their own games.The one exception I'd like to make is this. For kids and people who love Nintendo games, you may wish to buy both a Wii and PS3. No one makes games like Nintendo.

If you have followed the MGS series then you should enjoy this. Be prepared for more cutscenes then all the previous games combined. The last cutscene was over an hour by itself. The mission briefings are long but enjoyable. It took me 22 hours to complete this game but actually game play was probably 12-15 hours of that. If you don't like cinematic games and cutscenes, or don't like more slow, stealthy games, then you probably won't like this. There are lots of action scenes and you can choose to go through the game killing all the enemies or sneaking through the game and killing none. It was fun and a good conclusion to the MGS story.Controls: Nothing wrong here. Once you learn the controls, it's not that hard to.Graphics: It's PS3 quality. Voice acting is very good and believable.Gameplay: You can speed through a chapter or take your time and explore. Bosses are good and challenging in some cases. Lots of guns to choose from. You can crawl around and blend into the environment with your camo suit and mask (acquired after the 1st boss). You even get to play a scene from the original MGS game.Replayability: Lots of hidden things to get and you can replay the game with all the extras you acquire throughout.Sound: Everything you would expect from MGS.Overall great game. I would play through it again and change my tactics if I had time but I have loads of other games waiting so every game only gets 1 play through for now.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2011"}

Great for 2 players, not 1.","reviewText":"Straight out of the packaging, DOA is a beautiful game.  The graphics are very detailed, fluid, intense and colorful.  And so is the action for that matter.Though the game is 'Okay' for a single player, it is much better suited for cooperative play, or player vs. player.  You see, while there are many different game modes, (like survival and time attack) I can't believe this game so blatantly forgot a single player vs. computer mode for single fights (scored by KO's or how many round are won) that is present in any other fighting game like Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter.  What you say? No player vs. computer: Well, yes, there is survival mode in which you choose a character and fight CPU players right after another until either the CPU or you is knocked out, but you have no choice in who you fight or where in this mode...It's all random...I would really have likes a mode where you could pick your opponent and play for the best 2 out of 3 rounds lets say.Sound: Excellent control over sound.  In game settings you can adjust music volume, combat volume, special attacks/effects volume.  However, I hope you like Aerosmith...they provide 3 songs that you fight to throughout the game.  They are decent and adrenaline pumping,...but Aerosmith?  Should have been techno.Game Control: The game is somewhat sensitive to your hand on the game pad.  Could be a pro or a con depending on how you look at it.  The A, B, X, Y, white &amp; black buttons and triggers work great.  However, I found the 8 directional D-pad a little too sensitive...often resulting in wrong directional combos because you must press it PERFECTLY.  This fact carriers over to how you control you players attacks.  Like most fighting style genre games, each character has his/her own set of moves based on the pressing of buttons in combination.  While I see no other way around this and this is the norm for these type of games, in DOA, it can become ridiculous.  Basic moves are easy to pull off, but those spectacular moves require such precision and sometimes lengthy combo's you most likely only use them by luck.  Because of the fast pace of this game, DOA turns more into a button masher console that a true strategy game.Practice mode: You can practice your moves in a special mode, but as stated above you really need to have extremely great coordination to pull some of them off.  You get frustrated with some of the moves.Story mode:  The only real 1 player mode is slightly weird.  You pick a character and try to complete a 'story' by battling 7 CPU controlled players, then a boss at the end.  If you complete all 8 matches, you unlock a great graphically detailed end cut scene that centers around the character.  But here's the problems: 1) All voice overs are in Japanese with English subtitles.  The only English you here is: You Win, You Lose, Start.  Okay...Why?  If they can put this in English, why can't they do the rest in English?  Why do I have to read subtitles that go by so fast?  2) Flaws in the overall story:  Okay..you picked your character and now must fight 7 battles.  I get this, but some of the dialogue does not flow from one battle to the next.  Two sentences between characters before a fight does not give much of a story...or build up.  I think the strangest thing is the battle 8...the boss.  After you win battle 7, you are transported to a hellish like realm and must fight this evil looking samurai named Omega.  But it is really never explained how you got there or why you are there, who he is, why you must fight him, how he fits into any of the storylines, no dialogue.  Most stories have a build up to the last the showdown...a goal that players can understand.  Omega is just there.  If you defeat him (which he has really impressive yet hard to dodge special attacks) you immediately see the final cut scene.  End of story.  Very anti-climatic.Camera mode: Sit back and watch two CPU players knock each other silly, but neither wins.  Yes...that's right...all you do is watch, and there is no victory.  Um....why?All in all, DOA 3 has the potential to be a great game.  The graphics are there, the music and effects are there, the characters with special moves are there.  What's lacking is credible story, and a good 1 player mode.  This game is definitely fun if you can get someone else to play you...that's where it shines.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2001"}

Tekken, on the Playstation 2, is one of my favorites, with its shimmering waters and floating leaves. It's pretty amazing that barely a year later, it's been blown out of the water!First, I have to admit that the 'story mode' is very cheezy. Well, that's the same for any fighting game. You choose one of the many characters, choose an outfit, and jump into battles. Your person says a few words, the enemy says a few words, and they fight. With some good button-mashing, you can zip through any story in no time at all.That's not what these games are built for, though. They're best when played multiplayer against a real human opponent! The story mode and other training modes are just to get you to learn the moves. And this is where it truly begins to shine! There are a variety of fighting styles represented in the game, and each one has a wide number of moves. They're truly amazing once you get them down, and the graphics are incredible. Their movements are smooth and fluid, from the slice of the hand to the bouncing of the pom-poms.The backgrounds are true eye candy. There's a level where you're playing surrounded by aquariums, and even the floor you're on is the glass top of a fish tank! Another level has you fighting in the snow - and your feet mess up the snowdrifts! You can fight in a candle-surrounded room, with beautiful flickering fire, and knock them over with your opponent. Smash through a wall, and you're out on the roof! Roll off the roof, and you're down in the courtyard! It's truly like watching a fighting animation on tv, but you can control the action.Half the fun is figuring out the secrets of each level. Can you smash through the trees? Can you throw your enemy through that plate glass window? The water splashes with each step you take, the electric fence zaps your enemy, the neon sign flickers as you fall against it.This game definitely shows off the incredible capability of the X-Box, and is a must-have for anyone who loves fighting games. Even if you don't currently, this game might convince you why they're so much fun!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2001"}

To me, they are just the most addictive video games ever in the world. Since the days when Tetris and Dr. Mario reined supreme, they have spawned so much more within the linking chains of virtual puzzles. That also has been the case with the Nintendo DS. Although they have tried to make the status of must have puzzle games with Polarium, it really didn't add up all the way. However, when the thought of putting puzzles into action and space came around, the battales became uniquely outrageous.Meteos for the Nintendo DS is a really, great puzzle game that really tests your memory, thinking and the movement with the stylus in the blink of a eye. The object of the game is for you to defend you spacecraft, and try to connect three of the same, exact puzzle blocks across or vertical for you to launch missles at the mind-controlling worlds. Unlike most handheld games, Meteos really is all about the control of the stylus. Although you can try to use the d-pad and buttons in this game, they arguably won't be as easy or skilled as the stylus. The graphics in this game are incredibly unique and vivid not just with the worlds, but the fact that the blocks are specifically designed to test you through each one of the worlds. That makes you feel like you absolutely aren't playing the exact same game. The music also has the feelings of space-like conditions of Star Trek through a blender, and carries out fairly well with each turn of the game.Meteos is definitely one of the most addictive puzzle games I've ever played in years. This is absolutely the must have of all puzzle games for the Nintendo DS.

Unfortunately, I'm not too impressed with it's output this season.Graphically, the game looks pretty good. The players are relatively detailed, but the fields aren't as sharp as I'm accustomed to. I tend to love ESPN's graphics a lot more, but in reality, I like good playability over everything else.The offense isn't supposed to be too overpowering this season, though I'm putting up almost 38 points a game with a lackluster Ravens offense. Pass deep, lead the reciever, and it's a TD. The running game gets stuffed a lot easier this year, as the defenses are pretty nasty on the line, it's just unfortunate that the secondaries are garbage.The defense has been tuned up nicely, and hitting a running back three yards behind scrimmage is a blast. The hits are pretty serious. Again, the deep passing game is still a joke, as most d's get burned.I haven't gone online yet, as I'm just not impressed with the game overall, so I really haven't bothered too much with it. I'm sure the online capabilities are just as good as always, but I cannot be sure.The presentation of the games is pretty weak. It has no television feel, and it's the same Michaels/Madden dribble from the last three or four years, so if you've heard maddenisms in the past, be sure to have them repeated over and over and over again. The replays throughout the game happen during the play selection, which means you can watch them, but your play clock ticks away. If you choose a play, the replay ends. Like I said, no television feel.Overall, Im pretty un-impressed with the gameplay, and will definitely be trying ESPN's foray into the 2005 season, as I've always been very impressed with their graphics, sound and playability.If you're a diehard Madden owner, this game will probably satisfy you. Unfortunately, the franchise has not gotten better over the past few years, and this attempt shows it.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2004"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXCQ6","description":"","reviewerName":"G. Denick","summary":"Forget the \"Ascension\" subtitle, this is \"God of War FOUR.\" Five stars for scope (campaign review, spoiler free)","reviewText":"This review is strictly for the campaign of the game, which is what I'm sure most GOW fans will be returning for. I have not experienced the multiplayer, and I can't comment on its performance.Following the epic events of GOW3, I was skeptical that any followup in the series would be severely lacking. After all, how could Santa Monica Studios possibly top the mythological carnage of the previous title, when Kratos took down Mt. Olympus, slaying major gods and titans alike? Somehow, they managed to pull it off- this game is a worthy successor, and though it serves as a \"prequel\", I would not hesitate to call it \"God of War 4\". Don't be thrown by the newfound emphasis on multiplayer- there is still a substantial, full length campaign here, and its events simply beggar the mind.This franchise has been built on the notion of \"epic scope\", as befits any plot rooted in Greek mythology where the slaying of gods is required. GOW-A fulfills the high standards set forth by the previous installments, and delivers adventure on such a grand scale that it's oftentimes breathtaking. It is for that reason I give the game five stars (though I only rated it four stars on fun factor)... I simply have to give credit to the incredible amount of labor and detail the programmers crammed into this game. They did fantastic work here, and this is quite possibly the best looking console game I've ever seen.The action is as smooth as ever, with only subtle changes having been applied to Kratos' arsenal of acrobatic moves. The developers did a good job of adding slight tweaks to keep things somewhat fresh, while dancing around the problem of this story having taken place before Kratos attained his full power. Though the game is generally quite fun, at times I felt a bit of boredom and repetition set in, as I have been performing these same combos for almost ten years now, over the course of this series' existence. Despite the grand scope of the spectacle, which never fails to impress, there was an odd sense of tedium that occasionally hampered my play experience, particularly several hours into the campaign.Despite these minor criticisms, however, this is still a fantastic gaming experience. The scope, as previosuly mentioned, is unrivaled, and Santa Monica Studios has continued to explore the ideas of Greek mythology in an interesting manner, while applying their own creative liberties and direction to the subject. The concept of GOW has always appealed to me, and I don't think that this entry will disappoint any fan of the series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2013"}

Well, I cannot understand it because this game is the best Madden to come out in quite some time.COMMENTARY: The CBS commentary crew of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms make the NFL experience come to reality. With that being said, it gives the feel of actually playing a game on CBS. The duo have very creative things to say about players and certain plays. You hardly ever hear the same lines, over and over, again.**CONNECTED CAREERS**: This is the very mode that has caused many users to turn away from the game. No! It is not quite like the common Franchise mode that we are used to. Don't be too quick to judge!!!! I hated it, once. However, it CAN be better, depending on how you go about playing it. The user can play an offline or online connected career as a coach or a player. For both, the choice can be as a created, active or legendary coach or player. What I have learned is there are differences in this mode, based upon how you choose to start your connected career. For example, if you play an offline connected career, as a player, your rosters will be automatically altered by the CPU, especially during the preseason. Not to mention, during games, every other play will be simulated.On the contrary, if you play an online connected career, you can choose to start preseason with a 75-man roster or the updated 53-man roster. If you choose to have an online connected career as a player, you have the same option. However, choosing to do so, the same results will happen, as I mentioned above, as far as simulated plays go. So, if you have a problem with this, as I did, choose your career as a coach!!!!! Therefore, you roster won't be altered by the CPU and every play during the game can be controlled by the YOU, the player. Problem solved.GAMEPLAY/INFINITY ENGINE: The new physics-based Infinity Engine is as good as advertised. Movements are more fluid and interactive than any other Madden game on current-gen consoles. Not to mention, the animations don't dictate the plays, anymore. Catching animations are more realistic and fluid. They actually catch the ball in-stride, which opens up the chance for making bigger plays after the catch. No more catching the ball, and getting caught up in force field animations.Passing feels more interactive because the player is given the option to lead his receivers based on the routes they are running. Passes can be thrown to where on the receiver can catch it. On the defensive side of the ball, tackles are harder and more fluid than ever. Also, if the defender can't see the ball, he can't make a play on it. Also, the days of the Super Man-like LB's swatting passes are gone.GRAPHICS/VISUALS: Not too much to say about this. We all know Madden sets the standards for good graphics in their games.THE VERDICT: Overall, the game is superb, if you are willing to accept the changes that have come with the game. Though I didn't pay any money to buy this game, I would still say it is worth a purchase. Perhaps, if many of the reviewers, who game this game only one star because of the revamped Connected Careers mode, they can change their ratings, once they read this review.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2012"}

The all-new driver profile is the ultimate extension of the true driver&rsquo;s experience. This system gives each player a unique persona based on a player&rsquo;s driving skill and style - aggressive or precise. Driver profile impacts how a player unlocks cars, overall career progression and online matchmaking. InNeed for Speed: Shift, how you drive is who you are behind the wheel.For Racers By RacersInNeed for Speed: Shift, EA has brought together some of the world's best racing game talent and real race drivers. Developed in a unique collaboration between Slightly Mad Studios--developers and designers of the critically acclaimedGT LegendsandGTR2games--Michael Mann (executive producer at Black Box) and Patrick Soderlund, senior Vice President of EA Games and part of a racing team that recently competed in the fourth edition of the TOYO Tires 24H Dubai 2009, the result is an authentic driving experience unmatched on any game system.Additional Screenshots:","reviewerName":"Geekdomo \"GeekDomo\"","summary":"How to win - use the cars ahead as a brake.","reviewText":"Setup:PlayStation 3 120 GBLogitech G27 Racing Wheel for PC and PS3I have yet to wreck my car so bad that I couldn't drive it any longer on NFS:Shift. It is a much better sim than any previous NFS game. The arcade mode is still there in that you can use any car ahead of you to slow down into a corner. Get behind? Drive like a maniac and then slam into the cars ahead, sure the hood will crumple but you will blast them off the track and if your good you can then run ahead on to the next set and slam into them. Its like a mix of a demolition derby and a racing sim.There are a ton of redeeming qualities in this game though, so dont think its all bad;Cockpit:The cockpits of these cars look very authentic. I am a fan of Top Gear and have seen every car in this game on that show several times (except the Camaro) and the cockpits here look identical. When you drive a car it tallies up the miles you have driven it which is cool to say you have driven a few thousand miles in car X. It makes you want to keep a car longer just so you can become more proficient.AI:Not bad, many of them want to kill you and they will try to run you off the road. Which can help you get ready for online races because they will do the exact same thing.Cars:Very accurate but indestructible. Drive a Zonda or Veyron into a wall at 200 MPH and it will only dent the hood slighlty and may break the lenses.I can only compare this to another driving sim even though its an off road rally game. Comparing this toDirt 2and you will see some glaring issues. First off in Dirt if you hit a wall or even a hay bale at speed you may risk ripping a body panel off or even the wheel; ending your race. In Shift you can slam into anything you want and it will keep on going.Issue 2: the gravel is impossible to turn on. I realize hitting gravel at high speed means you can not turn as sharply but in Shift you hit it at anything over 20 and you will hit the wall.Issue 3: The car customizing is really difficult to do. Want to do ralley stripes on your car, it can take 30 minutes or more to get them all in place, hit a wrong button and all that work is gone.Pros:>> Wonderful car models>> Drive some of the rarest cars on the planet>> Accurate cockpits>> Cool animations when you hit thingsCons:&lt;&lt; Ultra difficult 1 on 1 sponsored races (if the guy gets away you might as well reset)&lt;&lt; Very easy to win races by using cars ahead as bumpers to slow into corners&lt;&lt; Little to no consequence for whacking a car or a wallOverall this is a very good racing arcade game. I will not call it a full on racing sim yet, maybe with the next iteration.Thanks for reading my review.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2009"}

After putting in time with BF3 this weekend, I came to the conclusion that it might not be for me.I will keep trying though, at least until after MW3 comes out.I will say this for the casual MW player that's trying to get into this game, you may find this a little daunting.Pros:It does look really really nice on the right set up.It handles pretty well so you won't spend too much time trying to config the controller to make it 'similar' in feel to CoDVehicles and lots of them!When playing MP you get points for more than just kills, if you are playing a support role like dropping ammo or repairing a vehicle you can rack up points and win rounds for just for that.Cons:It's more of a grind to get perks and gear. I will admit I am not one of the best MP FPSers out there but at least on MW you can grind out the first 10 levels in a relatively short amount of time even with a low k/d ratio. On this, it seemingly takes much longer. even after playing over the weekend (stopping to play GoW3 and Batman:AC) I am still JUST reaching level 5.Campaign is as by the numbers as you could get. While it does have nice voice acting and some different and intense levels, you can tell it's a MW clone.Too many cheap deaths. You can almost attribute this to the 'realism' factor. But too many times you will get shot and killed and almost never know from whence it came which brings me to...Spawn camping - a lot of those cheap deaths come from way too many people hanging around to pick you off as you spawn which makes it a good idea when you are about to deploy, to try and do so in a different spot.Also, at times, some weapons seem improperly balanced, I have seen a few times where you have a properly placed headshot and it still takes 2 or 3 more to drop your target.EA needs to fix battelog. I have tried the whole weekend and still can't log in!Indifferent:To a point, this game does attempt to get you to play as a team but it really only works if you are teamed up with your friends as even though you are in a squad, your squad mates still tend to do their own thing.I did notice a bit of a difference when I played with a group of my friends Friday night and rounds tended to be a bit more controlled when everyone knew what they were doing.Large maps - A lot of people complain about the map sizes and I kind of see why. Some maps, if you are knocked out of the action and cant respawn close by, you end up havimg to travel a ways to get back into the fight especially if there is no vehicle nearby.To truly be fair however, BF3 is doing the best that they can to win over MW hardcore players and speaking to some of my friends who are, they have been won.This game will not hold your hand and give you 'helpful' tips, when it comes down to it, it's just you and the person in your sights that matters.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2011"}
{"product_name":"B007VFHGZ4","description":"","reviewerName":"AeroEngineer","summary":"Best new game out there period, Most Complete game I've played","reviewText":"This game is incredible. If you have to choose one of the newer releases get this one. Graphics, game play, sound, story, things to find, etc it has it all. I'll go into the negatives first, which are minor and really depend on your preferences. I didn't have really much problem with any of the negatives I've listed though._______________________________________________________NegativesOne thing that might be a turnoff are the Quicktime events, i.e. button mashing and sequences of certain buttons,in order to progress/survive. There are a fair amount of these sequences and they can be frustrating and hard to understand at first. As the game goes on there are less and less of them though. Just get through them by getting online help guides, they're worth it and after mastered are not too bad.Other negatives to certain people are the pretty gruesome ways you can die in this game, gruesome backdrops at times(corpses, blood, etc), profane language and some sequences that are at heights and can invoke fearful feelings like in real life if you have a fear of heights.Also the game needs more genuine tomb raiding, it's more story driven(saving friends from baddies, LOST-esque) than exploring lost tombs/explicit puzzle solving driven. There are tombs you can explore with puzzles etc but they must be found. So the actual tomb raiding is integrated into the story mostly but is really a means to an end.____________________________________________________PositivesOther than those things this game is really jaw dropping. The backdrops are interactive and stunning to look at. I didn't think TR could get much better than TR:Underworld of a few years ago but this IS a better more complete game for sure.Flying through a forest with a parachute you picked up from an old plane, falling down a watery trench, navigating a river while you use your shotgun to blow away fatal obstacles, hunting with a bow in a tropical forest for food, and more than I can remember make this game amazing.Another example that comes to mind is that this game includes a cover system for when you are fighting human enemies with your bow or gun BUT it's completely automated for you. No having to hit space or other key to go into cover mode. Once the enemies are defeated then you automatically stand up/exit cover mode. Very simple but very smart and keeps you focused on your opponents, not on the mechanics of moving around.The weapons are upgradable in ways that matter, are satisfying, and are even necessary to progress in the game. The climbing is fun and intuitive as well with lots of different ways of moving. The puzzles are satisfying and not too hard. The sound is atmospheric and begs for at least a stereo set of speakers. You find and analyze lost relics, can upgrade your skills and can change Lara's clothes to 5 preset outfits. I'm sure I missed something so go get it for yourself!_____________________________________Windows 7HD6850 x1GB4GB RAM1680x1050 HighCreative stereo speakers with subwoofer","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2013"}

Travis emerges victorious and finds himself in the presence of Silvia Christel, a mysterious French woman who claims to be an agent with the UAA. Silvia gives Travis official rank of 11 in the organization. Now, it's up to you to become #1. No More Heroes takes place in the city of Santa Destroy, and you are free to explore the town to your liking, taking on missions large and small to collect money and purchase new weapons as you work up towards the 10 main killing contracts. Gameplay is all about using your Beam Katana (via Wii remote) to defeat enemies.","reviewerName":"Carlos A. Ramos \"Voltaire Tempentry\"","summary":"A Diamond in the Rough","reviewText":"As with most games developed with the hand of Goshi Suda (51), No More Heroes is a very unique, strange, and one of a kind experience (not taking into account its sequel, obviously). No More Heroes, a story driven action/beat-em-up game, was released in early 08, and was met instantly with critical acclaim. The game ended up becoming Suda's most successful game to date (both critically and commercially), transcending a cult hit status and becoming one of Wii's \"go to\" games.No More Heroes is about a man named Travis Touchdown, and his exploits to become the #1 ranked assassin. He must fight and kill the 10 ranked assassins above him. Playing to tradition Suda 51 style, the game is far from mainstream or \"normal\", using subtle (and not-so-subtle) sexual and oddball humor, interesting characters, and straight up weird situations and events.The one thing that should be obvious by now is that No More Heroes is definitely not for everyone; the game may be very offensive to some, and the amount of violence, blood, and sexual content makes it not for those under the driving age.The game consists of the player fighting his way through the top tier of the assassin world, meaning that you will be fighting several bosses (each boss is effectively one assassin in rank). And this is where the game is at its best. Each boss/assassin has an odd personality and/or backstory that makes the scenes before and after the fight VERY enjoyable and interesting. The actual fights themselves are some of the best designed moments in video game history, with interesting set pieces, locations, and weapons; one minute youll be fighting a magnum wielding detective at a base ball park, and the next youll be facing post-man in a movie studio.Players progress in the game by killing the assassin/boss ranked above you (you start at 11). In order to have a chance to fight said assassin, players must play a variety of minigames to accumulate money needed to \"pay\" for the opportunity to fight. This  mandatory element of the game slows the pace and story, which is unfortunate considering the fact that the story is so well done and interesting. The minigames are odd, and include Travis mowing laws, collecting coconuts, or removing scorpions (all within a time limit of course). These mundane tasks are boring and earn you little money. Thankfully, however, this is not the only way to earn money. Early in the game, the ability to take on \"Assassination Missions\" opens. These \"missions\" are glorified battle arenas filled with \"fodder\", or simple, low level enemies, and is the fastest way to make money in game.The game has you \"slashing\" at enemies (pressing \"A\") until they are weakened enough to be open for a finisher. Said finishers are what makes the gameplay so fun and satisfying. An icon indicating which motion to execute appears on screen, and when gestures are performed successfully, players get to \"slash\" the enemy in half with a fountain of blood and coins spewing forth. Wrestling moves are performed in the same fashion, and are just as satisfying. The controls are simple to learn and work amazingly well,but the game does have some \"hidden\" moves for more experienced games, such as the \"darkstep\".No More Heroes is a diamond in the rough. Its extremely enjoyable and fun, yet lacks a serious level of polish. A boring and barren open world, technical issues, and less than inspiring graphics bring the game down quite a bit and may be enough to turn off some people altogether. But in the end, all that matters is the fun factor, and in that respect, the game succeeds. The simple and primitive finishers give the feeling of actually \"swinging\" the beam sword, and its that satisfaction, along with a funny and weird story line, that makes the game one of the best Ive played this generation.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0000503MO","description":"The third title of the Gran Turismo series takes full advantage of the new PlayStation2 game engine, which is capable of rendering about 20 million polygons per second--roughly 10 times the number of total polygons of the series' previous installment,Gran Turismo 2. Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course. They don't drive perfectly, either; some will spin out and make other mistakes over the course of a race.","reviewerName":"D. R. Jeanclerc \"Reader, Listener & Obsessive...","summary":"A PS2 Classic at an Incredible Price","reviewText":"GT3 A-Spec is an extremely enjoyable racing game, combining exciting gameplay with incredibly beautiful graphics.Customizing and tuning the cars is one of my favorite aspects of the game because done properly, these tweaks have very real effects on each car's performance.  Pit strategy comes into play in the more advanced leagues and endurance races.  For example, sometimes it's advantageous to outfit a car with slicker tires that may not grip the road as well but allow you to go longer between pit stops.There are numerous courses and cars, resulting in a lot of gameplay combinations to keep you interested for the long run.My only gripe is that while the game touts itself as the \"real\" driving simulation, the cars don't take crash damage.  You can hit a wall head-on at 250+ mph and just bounce off and continue.  Scrapes with other cars also go with any repercussions.  This flaw unfortunately allows you to get by with sloppy driving technique and can turn the game into a Nascar racer.  For instance, if you enter a hairpin with another car on your outside, you can time it right and drift/slam into him, sending him into the wall while allowing you to make the turn with much more exit speed than you should.  This feels like a cheat.  Also, once you reach a certain level of success, you've earned enough money and obtained enough cars that finding challenging competition can be difficult.So to recap,PROS*  Beautiful graphics*  Deep gameplay with lots to keep you coming backCONS*  No option for real damage to cars*  No Internet/online play (hopefully in GT4 later this year)You really can't ask for much more out of your $....","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2003"}

The game can be beatin in less then 3 hours.  The game was fun for awhile but playing it for the second time gets really boring.  I was a bit dissapointed it ended so quickly.The Puzzles are simple, the graphics are pretty good, nice controls, average sound a pretty short lengh makes me give this game a3.1 out of 5..I honestly wanted to like this game but It was the lengh man!  A bit short...MORE THEN A BIT SHORT Acctually!But this is one of the better Comic book based-movie-based game to come out in awhile.  Better then that crap CatWoman but if there is a comic book game you should wait for it's the Punisher.  From my opinion that will probably be a really great Comic book game.

{"product_name":"B002I0JIQW","description":"","reviewerName":"M. MacMahon","summary":"Portal 2 Singleplayer is... More Portal","reviewText":"The original Portal was a great little add-on to Half-Life 2: Episode 2, but I wondered if it could stand on its own as a full retail release.  Well, Portal 2 has been out a few days and I finished it tonight and my overall thoughts are \"maybe?\"  The spectacle of a full-fledged singleplayer experience is there, but I'm not sure the variety is.  Let's examine everything more closely...First off I did not play the cooperative online mode and likely never will.  I am a singleplayer only gamer with rare exception (Battlefield, a little Enemy Territory back in the day) and bought Portal 2 for the supposedly 8-10 hour singleplayer campaign.  This is a review of that campaign and let's get one thing out of the way right now: Portal 2 lasted me 6 hours total.  From what I can tell your time with the campaign will vary greatly based on how easy you find the puzzles and for me personally I found them rather easy.  That's not necessarily a bad thing though, overly hard puzzles may have annoyed me or made the game feel even more dragged out, which would have been a shame.  In any event even at 6 hours I felt like the game pushed its concept a little long, so 6 hours is nothing to be mad about.  Just judge the price you want to pay accordingly.On the actual gameplay front Portal 2 is pretty much Portal with some new puzzle mechanics.  The different gels got a lot of pre-release hype and mostly for good reason since they add a lot of new ideas to the mix.  Running off some speed gel into a portal to fly up high, then landing on bouncing gel to go even higher, never really gets old.  There are also force fields, air cannons and these weird light tubes that make you float.  Overall by the end of the game you will up to your ears in different puzzle mechanics and apparatuses that never bog you down in too much complexity and remain fun to mess with throughout.  Sometimes you will go outside the typical test chamber but the puzzles remain the same fundamentally, there is no real significant variation in the themes and style of the original game.That goes doubly on the story front.  I won't reveal any spoilers but suffice it to say Portal 2 treads normal sequel ground.  Favorites are wedged into the story, the typical twists and allegiance changes take place and in the end it sticks closely to what made the original game work.  Maybe I was wrong to expect more, but I went into Portal 2 hoping to see the cool portals mechanic from the original game expanded to a grander stage.  Instead I feel like I just got more Portal, one test chamber and then another, despite some clever attempts to make it seem otherwise.  Hopefully Portal 3 will change things up.On the graphics front Portal 2 uses Valve's Source Engine again and looks about as good as Half-Life 2: Episode 2 or Left 4 Dead.  Some of the later sections really show off some large environments and cool design, but for the most part the game sticks close to the test chamber look of Portal.  The PC version is perfectly done as one would expect of Valve, my only gripe with it being the very frequent and immersion-breaking loading screens.  It's a really annoying blunder from an otherwise near-perfect development team to have a loading screen break up the action in a really jarring way repeatedly over the life of the game.  The PC version also forces Steam of course, making you activate the game online and tie your game to an account Valve can cancel at any time.If I sound overly harsh don't take it that way.  I thoroughly enjoyed the game, I was just somewhat disappointed by it.  If you go into this game expecting the next Valve masterpiece I think you will be let down.  If you go into it expecting more Portal then I think you will be very happy indeed.  I was somewhere in the middle I guess, and suitably was left a bit confused at the end as to how much I enjoyed my time with it.  I only paid $35 for the game (thanks amazon) so the shorter than expected length is not too much of a bother, but the limited scope of the game still grated on me a bit.  The goal of all my reviews is more to inform than to judge though, so read over what I have said and decide for yourself what the singleplayer campaign is worth.  I debated between a three or four star rating but in the end I feel Portal 2 rides the middle of my enjoyment-o-meter.  Six more hours of Portal is a good time, it's just not the next big thing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2011"}

The main missions and side missions are still timed but their are less survivors to save and I feel that I was given more time to complete them.  My first playthrough was 22 hours in one week that included collecting blueprints, collectables and PP trials that took up most of my time.  My second playthough on Nightmare was only 3.25 hours and that was just a speedrun on a Friday afternoon.Other differences between DR2 and DR3 are:-You can apply special attributes where you want them.  Unlike DR2, when you rank up certain attributes are placed automatically.  In DR3, you can upgrade your health asap or carry more inventory.-With upgrading, you can also upgrade your ammo stock and durability.  While in DR2, your ammo and weapons were alwasy limited, in DR3, you can find a good supply of weapons and also more accurate in today's standards.-Truley an open world where the only loading that has to be done is during scenes.  The map is really small compared to Red Dead Redempion or AC games but the amount of zombies on screen makes up for it.-Blueprints replaced combo cards but its not a bad thing.  Their are 101 combo blueprints and they are easier to come accross.  The only combo vehicle I made in DR3 was with the dirtbike but their are 11 combo vehicles to make.In total, I have killed 55K zombies on my first playthrough and another 8K in my speed run so their will be zombies to kill no matter what.  So do yoruself a favor and pick this up if you enjoy Third Person Shooters, Action or Hack n Slash games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2013"}

Life is a game that one plays according to the rules.\"  This is a famous quote from  the masterpiece \"Catcher in the Rye\". Little did J.D. Salinger know that one day I would use this quote to describe yet another masterpiece, a different one, a video game.But it's unlike any video game you have ever played.  This game will leave your jaw open, your eyes popped, your breath will be taken away from you.  You will be transformed.  Transformed into a fan of the best video game experience ever imaginable.***Story***:  You are Jack Cayman.  Imagine Bruce Wills in Die Hard combined with the Punisher combined with Wolverine.  The guy that does the voice of Jack is the voice actor from Wolverine animated series.  The plot thickens with twists and treats as it goes on.  Suffice it to say there is a criminal organization shutting down an Island and running a certain virus and a certain game where people brutally kill each other.  There is a purpose and you Jack have your own agenda. You have to play this game by the rules and you have to win it.***Graphics***: These are the most visually stunning graphics that have ever graced a console. It's like you're in a black and white comic, but with so much detail and so much depth that it will hypnotize you.  There is lots of yellow too, and RED for blood, and surprise - there's also BLUE - but you'll have to find yourself where, because when you do, it's one of the nicest surprises.***Music***: Only the BEST EVER.  It's \"Linkin' Park\" with \"Jay Z\" with orchestrated music - the soundtrack could have graced an Academy Award winning film.  It's that good.  You hear the lyrics while playing.***Sound/Voice Acting***: Apart from Jack, you have two commentators who are not only hilarious, but are just plain cool! One of them is the voice actor of Bender from Futurama.  Does it get any better than that? The sound of the chainsaw coming from the wii speaker is also....cool!***Controls***: OK, so this game is for the Wii, so obviously you would expect top notch controls from a new generation controller with your hand free on the nunchuk, and the other doing some nice slashing with the wii remote... does it work? Hell yes!!!  You move around with the analog stick on the nuncuk and you press B and then can use your chainsaw with the Wii motion. Vertical or Horizontal - works very well.  You can use A for punching and other weapons (also B works with weapons that you pick up). You can change weapons with the D pad. It also works very well.  The best is to grab someone holding A then you can head butt it with the motion control of your nunchuk, and you can also throw him around with the motion of the Wii remote.  Perfect 11/10.***Gameplay***: You move around killing hundreds of bullies, creatures, zombies and some other surprises.  The boss fights are really good too.  There are a couple of scenes when you ride a bike running down the villains or chopping them off.  You clear an area and move to the next one with a map.  There is a Multiplayer mode where you battle to score more points in certain stages called bloodbaths.***Cons***: I would have liked the game to have been longer (just because it's awesome - Please make lots of Wii exclusive sequels - please), On Line dueling would have added appeal, and the small fonts in the intro screens are too small for some reason.Now for ******SPOILERS*****  These are some of the ways you get to gradually/rapidly kill people:Stick various sign posts into people's eyes and brainsThrow them inside barrels/fire barrelsSqueeze them through tiresSqueeze them through Casino coinsUse spiked balls and stick them on their headsThrow barrels and break them on the poor creaturesThrow them onto rose bushes. again and again. Or onto hooks. Repeatedly.Throw them on electric chairsThrow them on electric gridsThrow them into spaceThrow them into tractor beamsThrow them into food processorsThrown them on spikesMake sure they're eaten alive by giant hands/creaturesHave them compressed/pressed to death by various devicesVarious swords or blades that will rip them apartFreeze them to death and then brake them to piecesVarious devices that grind them to deathThrow them into engines, fusionUse catapults, seesaws, and have them flying onto statues or swords or the moonThrow them into bottomless pitsThrow them on moving trains. With sharp edges and spikes.Place them through guillotines.Pick them up and bang their hands on huge gongs.Stick them inside toilet seats with acid (I think)Or use your torch, golf bat to rip their heads off, spike, spear, knives, katana, double chain saw (that's right), gravity gun... oh did I mention that once you (almost) kill someone you can make different finishing moves which presents a whole array of violent moves as well??It's criminal that I only had to pay [...] for the best game ever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2010"}

The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat.

I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better. Buy it immediately.Rated:9.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Revisit an old classic","reviewText":"I'm not exactly sure when I grew to love the \"Metroid\" series but I'd say it would have to be with the first Prime on Gamecube. While my first playthrough made me think it was just simply okay, my second play made me see all the great gameplay features and fantastic artistic design despite the fact its sequel, Echoes, was basically the same but slightly harder. Of course it helps to play the one that started it all and so we have Zero Mission, a redone version of the original Metroid. Many of its basic gameplay elements will feel familiar and while I prefer the first Prime, Zero Mission was still a fun playthrough.Story: Samus has been tasked to go to the planet of Zebes to destroy Metroids, a strange creature with life-absorbing qualities. But there's more to the planet than on its surface as we get environments, many of them hostile filled with creatures and huge beasts, not to mention 2 big baddies and series staples and we'll get to see some insight into Samus' origins.Graphics: The Metroids on the handhelds (and Super Metroid) never really had outright fantastic graphics. They were merely serviceable and aside from the well done cutscenes, the graphics ingame work within the context of the game but since this was Game Boy Advance, levels have a better amount of detail than before but nothing earth-shattering.Sound/Music: No voice acting but the music is typical of the series, where it has that sort of techno ambience and there's a couple classic themes and even some appearances from other games (look for that eerie intro music from Super Metroid). Sound effects are well done and they're not really flashy but they work well within the game.Gameplay: Exploration is the key as you'll traverse many environments and rooms to get to where you need. Hidden around the stages are powerups to further outfit your character, such as missile expansions and power bombs and the all important energy tanks. The game's simple to use but mastering it, as well as puzzles to get to where you're going or a powerup and there's times where I had to consult a walkthrough since getting somewhere probably wouldn't have come from trial-and-error since there was a couple of spots where I wouldn't have figured it out on my own anyway.The difficulty isn't really that considerable but one boss before the gameplay-changing last stage was agonizing. But enemies shouldn't give you that much of a challenge, what with the energy recharging Chozo statues and a helpful-but-not-distracting hint system that lets you know where to go but doesn't necessarily point at it with a red arrow a la Fusion. It's the kind of game where, on Hard mode, beating it nets you a lot of bragging rights, that's if people don't hear Halo's Legendary settings all the time.While I still consider Prime my favorite of the series, Zero Mission's a worthy playthrough and a chance to see where it all came from.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2008"}

I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better.

Fernandez \"lorenzferus\"","summary":"Good for a platformer.","reviewText":"In my opinion, Sly Cooper is the best platform next to Mario but don't get too excited because it's still a platform.  Sly Cooper looks great and makes good use of the cel shaded graphics.  That's probably the best part of the game.  The game can be more looked at as a platform on a rail or a combination of 2D and 3D.  If you have played Crash Bandicoot, you get the idea.  In fact, Sly Cooper probably uses an upgraded version of the crash Bandicoot engine.  The gameplay has a lot of new additions but for anyone who has played Crash Bandicoot the gameplay will seem very familiar at some points.The game has five different worlds, each is introduced as an entirely 3D environment, but that's just deceiving. Your real goal is to find the doors in which you will enter a mission and be forced to complete a linear 2D/3D railed obstacle course.  It's a little more creative than Crash Bandicoot where you literally where in a portal room and each of the missions had a door with a label on it.  The Objective of each world is to gather all the keys that lay in that world.  You collect the keys by passing the linear obstacle courses obviously.  Once you have collected all the keys of that world, you can now use them to gain access to the boss of that world.  Then you beat the boss and move on the next world.  Think Crash Bandicoot again, only you actually see yourself inside of a van, and you see your progress on a map in a cartoon like cut scene, this indicates your in the process of traveling to the new world.  In Crash Bandicoot, the portal room just moved up to a new floor with all new missions again.The game has awesome graphics, and very good dialog.  The cut scenes are literally cartoon quality.  At times, you will feel like your actually playing a cartoon.  The game has a story line, it's a rather weak one, but I thought it was surprisenly mature.  The story starts off by Sly Cooper giving you a history briefing about how his whole family was killed by some thugs the night his families jewel, &quot;The Thievious Raccoonus&quot; was stolen.  Since then, he's been on a mission to get it back.  I don't remember the last time anyone was killed in the story line of a Mario game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2003"}

It remains true to the Romero shambling/walking, survival horror genre. So, when a game is made by the same title, you'd expect that, at the least, the zombies would remain true to their nature in this Walking Dead mythos. You'd be wrong.While not the biggest complaint I have, the game should rightfully be called the Jogging Dead. That the zombies run at you, could have been a minor annoyance, if not for the slew of other obvious let downs in this product.The dated graphics are the first thing you will notice. They might be considered good on the original XBox, as for the XBox 360, they are exceptionally dated. The terrain is simple, the stages are pretty small. Even their LOD system for textures seems to be broken - at only about 7 feet away from your character textures look blurry.The pace of the zombies, as I've already mentioned, is not of the \"walking\" nature. They pretty much jog. Stealth works marginally well, however, where this game breaks a cardinal rule of stealth and survival horror games is that, even simply turning your back on an area/room you cleared can result in zombies spawning behind you. You can clear a room completely, close all the doors, and return to a room full of zombies. IT has limited ammo, as a proper survival horror should, however, it's random spawning is a huge let down.I was very excited to see an element used in this game that I hadn't seen done in years, and out of stage over-world map traversing system, with the possibility for random encounters and events. Once you leave an area, you get to choose where you will go next. You can customize your experience to maximize your travel speed, at the loss of possible random encounters, or vice versa. Here was a great opportunity for this title to shine. However, the random encounters are all pretty much the same - very limited in what you can find, and even the stages look all the same (a bout 5 different random locations, give or take). It is very similar to what the 1998 Fallout 2 game did, however, in this Walking Dead version, most of the time you only get one choice of destination. When you get a choice, it's between two locations, and there is no back tracking. It's really just a slightly branching path. The encounters are more boring then they are worth.You have a limited inventory, and it looks like no way to increase your personal store. Nor can you get your other team members to literally pull their own weight. This could be less frustrating if you could return to your vehicle and swap out inventory. This is just another indicator of the stage-by-stage design of this game.This, AMC Walking Dead game, has, in the end, many minor problems, or more, poorly implemented features - each of which, in of themselves, could be overlooked if this product did anything that it does do, better. However, it's just not exceptional in any way. And, for a 360 title, it's not even average. The production value is far less than I would expect, even if it were an XBox Arcade title. Doom 2 had more depth and freedom than this title. Wait for the price to hit the single digits, which I am predicting will happen in less than two months, then it's worth a look.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001TD6SK8","reviewerName":"evani1997","summary":"Great Addition to the DS","reviewText":"Like Chain of Memories, 358/2 Days (referred to as \"Three-Five-Eight Days over Two\") comes in between KH and KHII. In 358/2 Days, however, the game has a different protagonist. Instead of starring the usual protagonist, Sora; it stars Roxas, a boy who was first introduced in KHII.The 358/2 Days game takes place throughout the events in Chain of Memories. The group called Organization XIII just got a new member into their team - Roxas. At the beginning of 358/2 Days, Roxas starts off kind of lifeless. As the game progresses, however, Roxas gains a personality. The Organization hires Roxas to kill \"heartless\" (strange beings that eat people's hearts), and to do a bunch of other stuff throughout the whole game. A week later their group gets another member whose name is Xion (pronounced Shee-on). Xion begins like Roxas and gets a personality later in the game. Through most of the game Sora is sleeping in a special pod that will help him recover the memories that he lost in Chain of Memories. A strange thing about the Organization members is that they may look like humans but they're really heartless beings called \"Nobodies.\" The Organization takes the hearts that Roxas collects and gives it to a heart-shaped moon that they believe will give them hearts of their own. This heart-shaped moon is Kingdom Hearts. After every mission, Roxas, Xion, and Axel ( Roxas' best friend) meet at the top of a clock tower to enjoy some sea-salt ice cream (yuck!). That's the basic storyline of the game. While the story is a little weaker than the other games, it is still a good one. It's also a little less confusing as long as you have played the other games.358/2 Days' game play is very similar to the console titles. You are put in a free-roaming world trying to accomplish the objectives that you are given. This game, however, limits you from going everywhere because at certain places, you'll see a big X in front of the unavailable area. While exploring, you fight plenty of the heartless in real-time combat and gain experience points which will help you level up. In this game, you don't do anything but mash the same button over and over again (aside from using magic) to attack, but I had too much fun to notice anyway.  Throughout the game, you use a key/sword thing called a keyblade, which is the basic weapon of the Kingdom Hearts series. The weapon becomes customizable and can be upgraded later in the game.  You also obtain stuff like items and munny (yes, they spell it that way) found in treasure chests and enemies in the worlds you visit. Basically, it mixes the RPG genre with the Action-Adventure genre. Unlike the console titles, you start at a sort of hub world. Then, you receive your objective(s), go through a series of levels/missions, and repeat. Each mission tells you to do something like killing a certain amount of the heartless, doing reconnaissance in specific worlds, and occasionally defeating bosses.In this game, you are given a panel system. The panel system is a bunch of empty blocks that you fill with stuff that you either find in missions, or purchase at a moogle store (moogle is actually the only character from the Final Fantasy series that appears in this game). After every mission, you unlock more empty blocks that you can fill up with items. This system maybe a little confusing, but it is helpful for when you need to change your character's settings. However, the panel system is only customizable in the hub world that you start at before you go do another mission. Even though the game play isn't exactly like KHII, it still has some of the best game play on the DS (in my opinion).A new addition to this game is the multiplayer mode. Up to four players can help each other finish missions. The unfortunate part is, there is no multiplayer story mode. Also, you need a game cartridge for each player in order to play. I like how they chose this feature for this game since it's a DS game, meaning that you don't have to share a screen. What's cool is that you can choose up to 19 different characters in multiplayer mode! Note: Six characters need to be unlocked before being playable.There's not a lot of voice acting in this game since it's a DS game. However, when the characters do speak, I find that the voice acting is well done. The music is almost completely borrowed from other Kingdom Hearts titles, so if you've played both KH1 and KHII, you'll recognize almost all the songs. In other words, the sound in 358/2 Days is really good, if not great.For a DS game, the graphics are amazing! All the scenery and characters look really good. It's surprising that Square Enix could fit the open worlds from the console games into this one. After all, the DS can only hold so much in one game cartridge. Of course, that means that all the worlds except for Neverland from Peter Pan look exactly the same as they did in the console titles. Still, it's awesome that you get to see PS2 graphics at certain points in the game.The controls in this game seem perfect for the DS. The game has two different control options. In control option A, you jump by pressing B, attack by pressing Y, and press the R button to put the camera behind you. After a few missions, you unlock control option B. The only difference in control option B is that it allows you to control the camera angle by pressing the L and R shoulder buttons.The Kingdom Hearts series is one of my favorite video game franchises! 358/2 Days isn't a necessary chapter in the series, but it is still worth getting. However, I recommend this game for those who know the rest of the Kingdom Hearts story because if you don't know the rest, you\\'ll probably get lost immediately. The game is surprisingly difficult, so I think that the game being rated E10+ is pretty accurate. If you get this game because of the Disney characters, then you will be disappointed since Mickey and the other Disney characters are only in the game for two minutes.Final Score: 8.8/10For more details on games such as this one, visit [...]","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2013"}

After nearly twenty years of making some of the best RTS games on out there, EA has finally succeeded in KILLING the franchise. How did they do? By slowly but surely turning it into Hodgepodge of cartoonish garbage and then strapping it to a massively stupid DRM scheme. Usually when you see a flurry of 1-star reviews for a game, it has everything to do with DRM crippling an otherwise good-to-great game. A good example would be the recently released Assassin's Creed II from UBI SOFT which admittedly is a fine game. In this case, it's really hard to pick which is worse: the game itself, or the incredibly restrictive and moronic 'phone home need 100% internet connection to play' DRM scheme.I thought that EA had learned their lesson when they released Mass Effect II DRM Free (which I bought and enjoyed). Apparently not. Because they've attached DRM to this crap-log of a game that requires you to be connected to their servers to play it. I guess this is supposed to prevent piracy. (Hint, you can download the patched version for free right now--just google it). I'm not advocating stealing the game, as I think you should pay for the games you play. I am advocating NOT BUYING games that come loaded with DRM, and especially NOT BUYING really poor games in the first place.TIBERIUM TWILIGHT might just go down as one of the most unimpressive game releases in history. It currently has a paltry 60/100 at METACRITIC which is embarrassing for a major game release from a legacy franchise like C&C.; I expect that number to continue to tumble as even professional game reviewers give this piece of garbage the low marks it deserves.To EA, UBI SOFT, and all the rest that insist on this DRM nonsense: I will not be buying your games. Period. Enough is enough.I encourage everyone else to do the same. We've got to hit these fatcats where it hurts: the wallet. Go buy any of the excellent games out there that are DRM free and play those. Give your money to companies that respect you as a customer.0/5 Stars.

One of the greatest movies of all time.  Have you seen Casino?  Pretty much a remake of Goodfellas, same director, a lot of the same actors, but inferior.  Decent movie, but definitely not great.  Those two movies describe how I feel about Vice City. While GTA3 was probably the greatest game ever created, this game is merely playable.The good news about Vice City is that it's not Grand Theft Auto 4 - it's best to consider it a sort of expansion pack to Grand Theft Auto 3.  This means it pretty much uses the exact same engine as GTA3 that we all know and love.  I could go on and on about how great this free roaming city is, but then I'd just be re-reviewing GTA3.What people won't tell you is the bad.  Here it is.  First off, this game is full of bugs.  Some of them minor, some of them full on PC like crashes.  Didn't we all buy a console to get away from PC faults?  I've worked on games before, and I know for a fact that if Sony's team finds a crash, it automatically gets rejected and has to wait for another cycle.  Since the game crashed 4 times for me, I have a feeling Sony let these mishaps slide.  It's a shame, because Sony usually hasn't wavered at all.  They've actually prevented Sony's own games from being shipped, losing tons of marketing dollars due to mistimed advertising.Secondly, the game is way, way too gimmicky.  The amount of time spent on the missions were split between with 20% car based kill em or chase em missions, and the 80% on other types of missions.  The mission numbers themselves are not split up that way, but you spend more time and are much more annoyed on the gimmicky missions.  The gimmicky missions are the ones that involve a radio controlled helicopter, motorcycles, bi-planes, boats, going into malls, racing, and any mission involving another character named Lance.  The rc helicopter motorcycles, planes, and boats are just clumsy, annoying, unresponsive, and not fun at all.  Since each new vehicle requires a learning curve, I spent even more time being bored and frustrated with these vehicles.  Lance is the worst.  He's with you in some missions, but does the stupidest things, likes stands in front of you gun fire, or while you're hiding behind a wall from gunfire, he'll follow you and stop right before the wall, just standing there like a sitting duck waiting to be shot.  The races are hard, and since there is no freedom, all it is just a cheap racing game - those are a dime a dozen these days.  In fact, the four or five hardest missions were hampered by the cheapness of Lance, the utter horror of using the lame other vehicles, bugs and crashes, and/or the race problems.Thirdly, are that the missions themselves are not apparent.  In GTA3, I used a walkthrough for the missions.  I vowed not to use it for this game.  Unfortunately, I had to use a walkthrough to find the missions themselves!  Here's the thing that you are suppose to magically guess.  After completing one mission, you can buy properties.  Out of the many properties, there are about 8 assets to get.  They won't tell you which ones, so you have to buy them all up or guess.  So, each asset has missions.  Of course some of these assets won't even tell you the mission.  One is where you have to sell 50 items, but there is no mention of 50 items.  I suppose I was suppose to have guessed that as well.  Another is just plain stupid.  You buy a strip club, and the \"mission\" is to go to dance booth and stay there for fifteen minutes.  But no one bothers saying that that is a mission.  I would have never found that out on my own; I would not have even tried that as a guess, because I'm not desperate enough to look at a polygon stripper for fifteen minutes.So, in order to get to the last missions - you would to have guessed the following: buy 6 assets, including the print works and Malibu club, complete all the missions, including the ones where the mission itself is not presented, and then, you can go to the last missions.  Am I freakin' Miss Cleo here?  What the heck is up with that?  I'm here to play a game, not some King's Quest point, click, look, early nineties game.  If I wanted to wander around like a dumbass, I would have bought Silent Hill 2.Another thing is that Vice City is much smaller than Liberty City, and not as fun.  Liberty City had potholes, hills, tunnels, tons of overpasses, Chinatown, a red light district, posh neighborhoods, Mafia controlled areas, six rival gangs, and was basically huge and diverse.  This didn't seem to have that.Lastly, is Rockstar's emphasis on style over substance.  They added eighties music.  Isn't that why societies evolve and progress, in order to avoid the mistakes of past generations?  Why the heck do they want to bring back the most boring decade of them all.  A decade so boring, it's the only one Austin Powers hasn't even gone to.  Why?  Also, they decided to add more full motion video.  That's fine, but they repeatedly placed them in the middle of missions, and sometimes you can't skip over them.  While attempting some of the more badly designed missions, I'm forced to watch the same full motion video over and over again.There are some slight improvements.  Each asset and property has a save point.  Going to a golf course and riding golf carts is really fun.  Also, the auto aiming is much, much easier and a real time saver.Pros:Still free rangingStill one of the better games aroundExpansion of GTA3Cons:FMVs - more style than substanceGimmicky missionsSmallerHarder finding the missions than the missions themselvesBoats, rc helicopters, bikes need to go.BugsBad AI, especially with LanceDifficulty: MediumHours to play: 30Frustration Level: High","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2002"}

Both Spyro fans and those who didn't play the first game will revel in the  exploratory greatness that isSpyro: Ripto's Rage. Gone are the impossible tasks,  unbeatable enemies, and fragmented game flow. This game sports superior controls, more  colorful and faster graphics, a tighter story, achievable goals, and plenty of gameplay  variety.Don't be fooled by Spyro's cuteness--this isn't a kid's-only game. With multiple goals  and side quests, a fantastic soundtrack by ex-Police band member Stewart Copeland, and  a veneer of understated humor,Spyro: Ripto's Rageis highly addictive. The  playfulness of the main character comes through in the exploration of the otherworldly  levels using the new moves, including super high jumps, rapid underwater swimming,  and extended flight and hovering maneuvers.Determined explorers are always rewarded--sometimes with an ice hockey match or other  sub-game, sometimes with riches enough to learn a new move or uncover a new area.  Simply put,Spyro: Ripto's Rageis one of the best action/adventure games for the  system. Despite the fact that this game is a sequel, it manages to bring a fresh new look  and feel to PlayStation gaming.--Jeff YoungPros:Massive, fun levels are completely navigableCute and quirky sense of humor will appeal to all agesResponsive controls are an extension of Spyro's upbeat and exacting personalityCons:Camera angles can be problematic, but are completely adjustable","reviewerName":"seany","summary":"I uhh I um I...I like to blow up things with his fire breath","reviewText":"Just kiddingThis is a great kids game","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2002"}

{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","summary":"The crown jewel of the PS3","reviewText":"After gracing the PS3 with the much beloved and acclaimed Uncharted trilogy, developer extraordinaire Naughty Dog has closed out their work on the seventh generation of consoles in the greatest way imaginable. The Last of Us is not only the best work they've ever done, but it's also the finest exclusive game to appear on the PlayStation 3, and one of the absolute best games of modern times. It is a bold, innovative game that takes a lot of risks and rarely stumbles on its way to breaking new ground. The Last of Us is one of those games that defines a generation, and one that will continue to be talked about and remembered for as long as video games exist.After an unforgettable, emotional opening sequence that takes place right at the onset of a global catastrophe, The Last of Us jumps forward 20 years and puts us into the shoes of Joel, a hardened survivor trying to make it in an America that has been decimated by the parasitic fungal infection that began 20 years earlier. He ends up meeting Ellie, a 14 year old girl who may end up holding the key to getting rid of the infection once and for all. The Last of Us is the story of Joel and Ellie's journey across the country, as they attempt to reach a mysterious group of people who may be able to use Ellie to find a cure.Perhaps more than any other game that has ever been made, The Last of Us merges storytelling of the absolute highest order with gameplay that is as thrilling and exciting as video games get. Whether the duo are encountering hordes of infected monsters who used to be human, or random groups of bandits who can be more evil than their infected brethren, the game's seamless combination of exploration, melee combat, stealth, firearm combat, and puzzles is top-notch from beginning to end. The game's brutal violence and troubling subject matter can reach levels of intensity that few other games are able to muster, and playing the game in short spurts may very well become a necessity simply due to how intense things get. The Last of Us really does a great job of capturing the desperate feeling of trying to survive in a dilapidated land. Resources such as ammunition are rare, and players will have to hoard materials to scrap together whatever resources they can to help them stay alive. This crafting system is very well done and not only gives the game an excellent sense of progression, but it also gives victories a level of satisfaction that few other games in this genre can match.As good as the gameplay is, though, it is the story of Joel and Ellie that will resonate with you long after you finish the game. Joel and Ellie are two of the most memorable characters in video game history, thanks to a pitch perfect combination of brilliant writing, voice acting, and character rendering. These are characters that come to life on screen in front of you, and as you progress, you will start to not only feel the emotional toll that the circumstances are taking on the characters, but also the strengthening of the bond between hardened, damaged, and distant Joel, and brave, yet vulnerable, Ellie. Throughout the four seasons you will spend with them, from the absolute depths of despair to the rare, fleeting moments of peace, one of the most emotional, complex, and fully-formed stories that video games have ever told will unfold before your eyes, ears, and heart. Few games I've ever played have affected me this greatly, and I can say with confidence that The Last of Us is one of the best video games I've ever played in over 30 years of playing video games.It also must be mentioned that this is one of the most technically competent games around. Naughty Dog has stretched the 7 year old PlayStation 3 to its peak potential, as The Last of Us is one of the best looking games around. Environments, lighting, character models, and special effects are all absolutely top notch. The sound design is some of the creepiest, moodiest around, enhancing the gameplay experience tremendously.As if this wasn't enough, The Last of Us also completely surprised me by including one of the most enjoyable multiplayer modes that I've played in a video game in years. A slower, more deliberate competitive multiplayer mode that really emphasizes tactics, teamwork, and patience, The Last of Us' multiplayer offers a perfect antidote to those of you who have grown tired of the faster-paced, run n' gun stuff that Call of Duty and its clones have flooded the market with. The Last of Us would have been a steal at $59.99 just based on the single player story mode alone, but the multiplayer is icing on the cake. The game delivers incredible value.The Last of Us is one of those rare, special games that nobody who considers themselves to be a serious gamer should miss. The near unanimous praise from the gaming universe, including reviews here on amazon, aren't lying. This is one of gaming's finest moments, and easily the crown jewel of the PS3 exclusive library. It's been a fantastic generation for video games. They've some so far, particularly when it comes to telling stories, and The Last of Us is one of the finest examples of what makes this medium so special. This game is worth getting a PS3 for if you don't have one yet. Don't miss it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2013"}

Roman","summary":"Great fun at first, but as time goes on...","reviewText":"When Nintendogs came out a few years ago, it practically sold out immediately. It was a godsend for kids who couldn't have a real dog, and as dumb as it might sound, it was a fairly good dog simulator, especially considering it came out so early in the DS' life. Unfortunately, it suffers from the main thing all virtual pet/simulation games do- as time goes on, there's less to do and less reason to keep playing. Still, this is definitely a fun game for younger kids, but you might want to wait a few more months before dropping your dollars on this version.Nintendogs is a simple game: you start out by picking the dog you want to take home, then you'll get to name it once it warms up to you. Once that's done, you're all set to start taking care of it. Feeding it, giving it water, taking it for walks, teaching it tricks, going to the park, and finding presents while out and about, there's always something to do. If your dog gets dirty, you can give it a bath and brush its hair. If it wants to play at home, you can select various toys to play with once you buy some, or find them in mystery presents. In order to get money for more food, water, toys and clothing, you have two main options: sell the extra stuff you find at the pet shop, or enter contests. Competing in contests is the more practical way to earn money, and pretty fun. There are three different kinds: frisbee, agility and command. The frisbee one is easy, since all you do is throw a frisbee and hope your dog catches it, earning big points if you throw it far. The agility one takes some practice, and has your dog running an obstacle course that gets harder as you rank up, throwing in things like a teeter totter. The command one puts the voice recognition bit to the test, as you have to make your dog do select commands for the judges. Some of the tricks your dog can learn include sneezing (crazy, I know), spinning, shake and other classics. To prepare for any of these contests, you'll have to practice at home or at the park, and it might take some time, but once you get good, coming in first place in any of the contests is pretty easy.There's also a kind of dumb multiplayer bit where you can interact with another person's dog if they're in Bark Mode. This is mostly there to trade presents with a friend if they have something you want, or if they just want to be nice. Unfortunately, there's nothing else to do in Bark Mode. You can't compete in contests with or against eachother, which seems like a missed opportunity to me. This is one of a few problems I had with the game even when I first played it a few years ago. There also isn't much else to do in the game after you've gotten every toy, hat, collar and accessory. It may take a while to get them, but once you get 3 dogs at once and take them for walks every chance you get, it lessens the time. The voice recognition is usually good, but you might want to make some commands like 'spin' be different when you say them into the microphone, since the dogs will get confused every now and then, regardless of how clearly you speak. Finally, there's not much reason to buy Nintendogs now since there's going to be a new game coming out for the 3DS sometime next year: Nintendogs and Cats. I never got why there wasn't a sequel for Nintendogs on the DS or even the Wii, since a lot could be added into the game after all these years, but I guess they were waiting for the next step in technology. If you can get this game for around half the original price, then it's a good deal.The graphics still look good, and there's rarely any slowdown. The dogs look realistic while being a little bit cartoony, if that makes any sense. And I love how dramatic the camera angles get during the frisbee competition in the later ranks. Believe it or not, the game's soundtrack, while very limited, is good too. Some of these tracks will get stuck in your head, especially the walking theme. It's such a happy, yet proud track that will have you nodding along as your dog tries to eat garbage or mark its territory.Nintendogs is a fun game and all, but it's not the kind of game that will keep kids interested for more than 2-3 weeks. After that, they might check up on the dogs every now and then, or go for a new hat or something, but there just isn't enough substance. I'll admit, I put a ton of hours into this thing so I could buy all the themes for my house, but it was mostly out of boredom. Buy it used so you save a few bucks, or borrow it from a friend and wait for the 3DS game, which will have a lot more to offer.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2010"}

Then with Lara I feel I'm bad ass and I'm invincible, like happens when you use Solid Snake or Big Boss in MGS games.Well, this is one of my favorite games, It's undoubtedly one of the best games I played for the PS3 console.The story was great, the moves, scenes, and how bad ass is Lara... Had a lot of fun playing it, really liked the way you customize the weapons; I found it's like to take the best of Uncharted, Hitman and Batman and put those thing in one game! Eidos and Crystal Dynamics really did a great job in there.Another thing I liked is that in some parts of the game you choose the approach: if you want to go stealth or Rambo's way.Add that the AI is not static, they are not in one point or in one part, they use their own way to do their job. So enemies will move and try to surprise you to kill you.The only complain I have is concerning some characters, that you don't connect with the crew of Lara or Lara's friend. The only characters I get into are Roth and Sam. The rest are rubbish! You just don't care about them. Even if you have to save them, you are just like: why!!!!???? I don't want to!!! I just want to get out of this island and kill enemies and have fun!!!!*little spoiler* : Thankfully villians are good characters and Mathias is a great character, what to say about The Sun Queen and \"The Shadows\".Finally, I found the last part of the game epic!!!! it's fantastic! this is greatness!I did not spent to much on multiplayer but had fun in it, there is a lot to customize in there, but it feels kind of the same every time.I played more hours online and yes, It's kind of boring, I'll just do the necessary to get the platinum trophy.All in all I note this game 4,5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2013"}

It is very different from puzzles games like Su Doku, to crosswords, and al other kinds. The Nintendo DS has also definitely shown that added to the mind as well. With the success of Brain Age, it has really transformed how gracioualy we use the DS for our minds as well as our fun. Well, Nintendo has also brought out another game for those who've enjoyed Brain Age, and have taken it to the next level on the DS.Big Brain Academy for the Nintendo DS continues the strengths of brain stimulation that came before with Brain Age. In this game however, there are more complex challenges here to test your memory of your mind, rather than your mind and voice. There are several challenges here such as coin counting, verbal math where instead of a numerical equation, you're given a math problem in words, memory games where you have to indetify a pattern of musical sounds by several creatures and people, and pathfinder in which you have to move your canine through a pattern to find his bone. The graphics and the game look beautiful and really deliver with promise for the DS. The control also measures up quite nicely, by strictly through the stylus. Although the music is cutesy, it can be quite annoying at times. Sadly, this is the only flaw in the game.All in all, Big Brain Academy happens to be a worth-while game for the Nintendo DS.

It's a shame that the first title is not included here (I feel like Foxhound has yet to be outdone), but this remastered set does fine justice to the other two. The adventures of Solid and friends remain enjoyable, and hiding beneath a cardboard box will probably always be hilarious, no matter how old I get.Playing these games, however, made me appreciate just how much games have developed and matured over the course of this console generation. For instance, the acting in MGS2&3 oftentimes seemed ridiculous to me while playing this collection, when it used to be the cream of the crop. Modern games from the west have done a great job of continuing to push the evolution of the medium, with enhanced focus on motion capture and voice acting. The Uncharted series, in particular, comes to mind as a good example, and even MGS4, now that I think of it (not from the west). Another thing that games like Uncharted have learned to do is to perform character development during actual gameplay, as opposed to taking you out of it with the long, long codec sequences and cut scenes that MGS has become known for.I'm not knocking the MGS games, as these are some of the favorites that I grew up with. Hideo Kojima is one of my favorite director/writers, and Solid Snake is one of my favorite characters.

This isn't about curbing piracy; Securom 7x is a complete and utter failure at that. Every game that comes with it has been immediately cracked after it's release. Securom only hurts each of us, the honest, paying customers.What Securom does do is very, very frightening:1. Installs a program on your computer that has ring 0 (higher than administrator) privileges to your system. This can be used to data mine, or be a door wide open to computer viruses (likely created by the exact same people who cracked the DRM in the first place!) or jeopardize your system by creating hardware or software conflicts.

Nope. You just own the right to play it for as long as EA thinks you should, and only install it as many times as they want you to. Like renting movies? Well get used to it if you want to play EA games, because from now on, and with every Securom 7x game in the future, that is what you will be doing. Renting.Securom 7x is just about the worst thing to ever happen to gaming. EA are morons, and better start listening to their core audience of gamers. they've all ready taken a massive hit in stock price after the epic failure that was the Spore release.So what can you or I do about this? The answer is simple. Don't buy anything from EA until they get rid of Securom 7x once and for all. I won't be buying this game, or Crysis Warhead, or Dead Space, or any number of other games that I otherwise would because I refuse to let EA treat me like a criminal. I am not a pirate, never will be, nor am I into letting EA (big brother) have root access to my computer. If enough of us choose to spend our money on other games (Witcher for example) that don't come infested with this DRM crap, maybe just maybe EA will change its ways. And if not, at least we've contributed to independent game makers who understand that we want to pay for great games, but not let them put a DRM ring in our computer's noses.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2008"}

{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Would you kindly play this game?","reviewText":"How's this for a story? A man becomes annoyed with the current world, a world where the great are taken for granted and told that their toils are either for the people, for God or for the government. In response, he creates a fantastic environment, free from all of these turmoils. A place where all the great men and women of the world can create their own inventions without fear of consequence. In this place, men and women could do what they wanted.If this sounds like Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, you'd be correct. However, in this particular case, it's also the background story behind Rapture, the under-water city that takes centerplace in Bioshock. Many words have been bandied about about video games and their ability (or inability) to become art; you have folks like Roger Ebert saying the medium as a whole can never attain that goal. My personal thought that was that, as a medium, games haven't made enough strides toward that lofty goal. But Bioshock certainly takes a huge step forward.Andrew Ryan is a visionary the likes of which his namesake Ayn Rand would possibly write about in Atlas Shrugged. He exemplifies the qualities of a Randian hero and showcases Rand's philosophy of objectivism. He created the city of Rapture and filled it, much like John Galt in Atlas Shrugged, with the visionaries of his land. Rapture soon was a thriving city that emphasized science and growth and the importance of the individual. They dabbled in creating plasmids that changed a person's DNA, enabling them to do feats the likes of which had never been seen before.Then something happened.Flying over the Atlantic sea, you are Jack, a person who was destined for greatness, if you ask his parents, and whose plane is now crashing into the sea. Jack is apparently the only survivor of the plane wreck and swims to a lone building, a light house it seems, that beckons him onward. Eventually, he goes into a blathysphere and enters into the world of Rapture. But this isn't the Rapture originally envisioned in the pre-recorded film he watches as he journeys into the city. It is a city comprised of deadly machines, once-human monstrosities named Splicers who are insane and, of course, the Big Daddies and Little Sisters.Bioshock concerns itself with the gray area between right and wrong. This dichotomy between right and right is what fuels everything in Rapture. Roaming the landscape, the Little Sisters are twisted abominations of little girls who locate corpses (which they call \"Angels\") and harvest Adam from them with a long needle. More grotesque is that bottle at the other end of the needle that the Little Sisters drink from. Dutifully following them are the Big Daddies, giant brutes in ancient diving gear. These...things...are at the heart of the story and Jack's survival depends on them and whether he can harvest the Little Sisters or set them free.The conscience of the gamer is represented in two mysterious figures, Atlas (another allusion to Rand) and Dr. Tenenbaum. Atlas seemingly wants Jack to save his family and explains that the Little Sisters are anything but the human girls they appear. He nudges Jack to put them out of their misery and take the Adam they harvest so he can survive and save Atlas and his family. On the other shoulder perches Tenenbaum, another mysterious individual who created the Little Sisters and seems to want to do anything possible to save them. They are the obvious angel and devil sitting on Jack's shoulder, but the question is...which one is the angel?To go into further detail would be to spoil this amazing story. Along the route, twists and turns abound with moral, ethical and philosophical questions aplenty. What's interesting is the way Bioshock presents a stark opposition to Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism. Rand's heroes always contain the same qualities that Andrew Ryan exemplifies. But here, the artists behind Bioshock seem to be questioning these qualities by presenting a situation so familiar to Atlas Shrugged, and yet, so far removed.It is literate, thoughtful, disturbing and moving. Even if the gameplay didn't live up to the story, Bioshock would be worthy just for this reason.Luckily, that's not the case. For the gun hungry, sure, Rapture is filled with guns aplenty and even presents opportunities for you to craft your own upgrades. But that is just scratching the surface. Everything goes back to the story. Plasmids are located across the ruined debris of Rapture and contain the keys to recreating your DNA. Some early examples of Plasmids are the ability to shoot electricity from your hands to being able to set things on fire to telekinesis.But these plasmids aren't only used for fighting. Minor puzzle-solving crops up, some of which require plasmids in the same way as gear in Legend of Zelda. The biggest puzzle is how to take down the game's variety of enemies. While you can definitely charge in, guns blazing and sometimes survive, cases will present themselves where such tactics will end with you on the bad end of the Big Daddies' drill. Instead, you can create your own traps and war zones. Using plasmids, the environment and, of course, your weapons, you can create elaborate traps that will bring a smile to your face.A lot of games coming out right now that use the Unreal 3 engine don't look as spectacular as they could. In particular, character models tend to look shiny and/or completely ugly. This is not the case with Bioshock. Everything comes together, from the disturbing scenery, the art deco architecture to the the insane creatures and characters populating the world.Shadows and lighting also create a sense of atmosphere that drips heavily, much like the water pouring down the walls. It's stunning. The only complaint (and it is minor) is that the frozen portions you can melt don't look very convincing. When things melt, they don't leave anything behind. The only reason it sticks out is that the rest of the game is absolutely beautiful and amazingly crafted.None of this would be as effective, though, without superior sound. And Bioshock has that (mostly) in spades. The voice work is stunning throughout and the actors provide a great sense of dread. The audio diaries do an exemplary job of providing the backstory, but also work the best in crafting dread and terror. Some of the most disturbing things occur listening to them. Unfortunately, sometimes the characters' lines are repeated too often, ruining the disturbing nature of their dialogue.Musically, the game is also amazing. It flits into the picture at key moments, increasing the tension before it will flow away. You might not even notice it's there, but that's why it's so good.You know, the funny thing about hype is how people react to it. Game journalists can go blue in the face trying to get people interested in forgotten gems such as Psychonauts, Beyond Good & Evil and Stranger's Wrath, and since they weren't financially successful they become these gems. When a game sells incredibly well and is hyped to the max (both of which fit Bioshock), people say \"over-rated.\"Ignore the hype machine. I know you're tired of hearing about it. But give Bioshock a try, if you haven't yet. Download the demo for your PC or try it on Xbox Live. It is a game that's definitely worth everything that's been said about it and more.It is art. And no words by ignorant movie critics will change that.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2008"}

Walking Main Street down to Tomorrow Land is exactly as I remember it (with only minor changes, like the displays in the store windows not matching the real Disneyland.) My kids have been many times and quickly remembered where to go for each ride.The only downside of this game is that the rides aren't the rides, but mini-games with a similar theme. For instance, the Haunted Mansion is a mini-game where you float through space avoiding objects (like picture frames and candlesticks) and try to pick up coins. It's basically the same game as Hole in the Wall or the obstacle course games on Kinect Adventures. Matterhorn is a bobsled ride for a bit then it is a snowball fight against Big Foot.

{"product_name":"B0050SXVK8","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"An Excellent Buy For the God of War Fan...","reviewText":"Since I do not own a PSP I was unable to play God of War: Chains of Olympus(CoO) and God of War: Ghost of Sparta (GoS).  As a big god of war fan I had to resort to watching an LP of them to get my Kratos fix.  But just watching a God of War game isn't enough.  The fun is in the gameplay, and that is where both of these games shine brightly.  Throw in a very nice HD remastering for the PS3 and Trophy support and you come out with two quality games for a very fair price that should make any God of War fan extremely happy.GAMEPLAYThe core of the God of War series, the games have different gameplay styles.  For those who have played the PS2 and PS3 releases of the God of War franchise the level of polish between the games fits with the earlier generations of the games.  CHAINS OF OLYMPUS feels like a polished God of War(original) title.  The gameplay is quite similar as well.  Not much has changed here when compared to the original, but when you would compare it next to GoW 2 and GoW 3.... CoO then comes across with a slightly dated, unpolished feel.  It shows its age in the gameplay mechanics but it is also one of the older titles of the franchise.  GHOST OF SPARTA feels like a polished up God of War 2 with many of the gameplay mechanics, including quick time events, taking on the more modern God of War 3 style.Both games of course are a lot of fun to play.  Other than some coats of polish and optimization between the games, this is classic God of War action here.  Kratos on a rampage destroying everything he touches.  Ripping out Cyclops eyes, fighting minotaurs, epic boss fights... Both games have that classic God of War level design.  You will spend hours running around solving puzzles and fighting monsters only to find you've done a complete circle two times over, BUT in classic God of War fashion it never dawns on you that you have repeated areas.  It gives that classic 'God of War / Pandora's Temple' atmosphere that every game has had since, including the Origins collection.GRAPHICSBetween both games there is a clear graphics divide.  GoS looks pretty much like God of War 2 remastered.  It is crisp and runs great at HD resolution.  CoO however time has not been kind to.  It looks similar to God of War(original) remastered.  The game still looks great in HD but there is more sharpness to the textures, and the game comes across dated.  That's just visually comparing the two however... both games run fantastic in their remastered state; and while they will not live up to God of War 3 caliber graphics, they do not need too.  The graphics are crisp enough to be enjoyable on the eyes and not be a distraction.SOUND/STORYNothing was spared here, in typical God of War fashion both games have excellent dialogue with top notch voice acting.  The storyline in both games are very good, and for fans of God of War it will certainly hit the spot.  CHAINS OF OLYMPUS is more of a prequel to God of War, Kratos continuing his servitude of the gods prior to his decision to go nuts on Ares.  GHOST OF SPARTA takes place after the original PS2 title, and has Kratos attempting to find his brother whom he finds out is still alive after all these years.  Both storylines are handled well and give a satisfying conclusion that ties into God of War storyline, and God of War 2.REPLAY/LENGTHBoth games will share the replay value that you would of felt for God of War , GoW II or GoW III.  Once you complete the game you can play it at higher difficulties using unlocked costumes and bonus artifacts(cheats) etc.  CHAINS OF OLYMPUS is the shorter of the two titles, coming in shorter than GoW II but longer than the original.  Playing on Easy or Normal you can polish it off in around 4-5 hours.  GHOST OF SPARTA however easily clocks in at around 8 - 12 hours depending on difficulty.  Of course once you unlock infinte health or magic you can easily go through the games in under 2-3 hours for speed runs.Both games contain a Challenge of the Gods, but when compared to God of War and God of War II the challenges felt a bit easy.  GHOST OF SPARTA ups the ante with the end game content however.  Upon beating the game you can continue to earn Red Orbs at the combat area.  Using your red orbs you can unlock bonuses at the Temple of Zeus including 8 additional challenge of the god maps (Athena challenges).  Compiling the almost 1,000,000 red orbs needed to unlock everything will net you 8 additional challenge maps, 2 costumes, tons of enemies for the combat arena and lots of artwork and bonus videos.  This easily added about 2hrs of gameplay onto the game after completing it.OVERALL 92% (9.2 / A-)At the asking price of $39.99 (as of 11/6/2011) this comes out to $20 per game in essence.  That is well worth the price of admission to play two great God of War games, both having been remastered into HD.  The upgrade process definitely improved the \"visual look\" of the games, and for those who do not own a PSP, these people (like myself) can finally play the two PSP god of War titles.  With excellent gameplay and mechanics, great storytelling and voice acting, fans of the God of War series will not be disappointed in this ORIGIN package.NOTE: If you have not played God of War, check outGod of War: Collection. This is the remastered GoW and GoW II games.  While Chains of Olympus comes first in the story, it doesn't explain to you how Kratos gets his weapons or why he is in service to the gods.  Nor does it explain certain visions he has.  It could lead to confusion... but in some ways it puts some mystery into \"who is this Kratos person?\" which of course then is answered almost immediately by God of War.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2011"}

Not only was this game the biggest selling PC game of all time but it also offered a completely new experience for all those wannabe Gods out there, there was nothing like it before and apart from the numerous expansion packs the only thing that came close afterwards was Singles: Flirt Up Your Life which was basically The Sims, with more emphasis on bedroom antics!But now, after much anticipation, The Sims 2 has arrived! If there is anyone out there still asking \"but what are The Sims?\" then you really need to get out more, or maybe I need to get out more? Either way The Sims offers a simple concept, players get to create a little computer person (or a whole family), design them a house and then completely run (or ruin!) their lives from their career, relationships and even bathroom habits. So what is The Sims 2? Well take everything I've just said and make it 100 times better and you have The Sims 2!As soon as you start the game up the first major change that hits you are the games graphics which take The Sims totally into 3D, the 3 pre-designed neighbourhoods that come with the game are huge filled with tree's, rivers, bridges, flying birds and of course an array of houses (some empty and some housing numerous new families) and what's more, each neighbourhood is totally different with their own stories and overall style, fans of the first game will recognise many of the families in \"Pleasantville\" such as the Goths who now consist of a greying Mortimer and an adult Cassandra, Bella has mysteriously vanished however.The next change that hit us was the \"Create a family\" option which has also had a major overhaul allowing players to create totally custom Sims with a number of hairstyles, hair colours, pre-set faces, types of facial hair, eye colour and clothes and to make it even more editable, players can fiddle with numerous parts of their Sim to get him or her looking just right from the shape of their eyes, width of their chin and length of their nose; everything is customisable. In short, players can re-create anyone they want to from real life family members to celebrities to a spooky likeness providing they have the time and patience to mess around with the editor for long enough! As I'm sure you have guessed, this \"create a Sim\" editor is a massive improvement on the first games \"create\" mode but if we're going to be picky, one cant help wondering why Maxis left out other important feature changers in the editor such as height and a few more body shapes (at present we have thin and fat), I know there is always room for expansion packs (as we know from the original!) but with such an excellent \"Create\" mode, it's a shame they didn't go the whole way and add more body adjusters.So, you've chosen a neighbourhood (or created your own), have created a family of Sims and are now ready to move them into a pre-made house or design them your own. Should you choose the latter you will notice the next obvious change to the franchise. The build tool has been considerably improved, houses can have a maximum of 3 floors as well as foundations and a roof top floor allowing players to build much bigger homes for their families than in the first game and as you would expect, the game offers a much wider variety of floors, doors, windows, wall coverings and fences allowing players to really design a custom home from scratch and thanks to the 3D graphics and variety of build tools homes in The Sims 2 look much more realistic than ever before.Also to feature a lot more variety is the \"buy\" mode which gives a number of colour and style variations with almost everything that is available to buy, clicking on a bed for instance will bring up a number of options including the colour of the wood and bed covers allowing you to truly mix and match the objects in your house.So onto the actual gameplay and again, despite the concept of the game being the same (keep your Sims happy) The Sims 2 feels different from the very moment you being to control your families, for a start the `characters' that you create have a much deeper feel to them, they seem to show expressions, develop their own feelings and come with a host of new animations that allow them to show off their new personalities. No longer do they carry the very basic needs such as \"bladder\" and \"hunger\" (although you still have to tend to these), your Sims now come with life aspirations meaning they aspire to a particular goal in life from fortune (their goal is to be rich), knowledge (these Sims have a passion for learning), Family (self explanatory, family orientated), Popularity (these Sims \"need\" to be popular) and Romance (again, self explanatory).You simply cannot explain this without an example so take my family of Sims, \"The Simtons\" which consist of a mother (Sarah) and father (Dave) and a young son (Robert). Now, Sarah was blessed with the family aspiration and wanted nothing more than a big, happy family. Unfortunately for her she was partnered (by my good self!) to Dave who had the fortune aspiration meaning he was obsessed with earning money, getting the kid into private school and swatting for promotion. Down the road lived the young \"Andrew\" who carried with him the romance aspiration and whilst Dave was at work one day, Andrew and Sarah got to know each other pretty well, in fact, they ended up sleeping together, nothing too exciting so far right? Well unfortunately little Robert had seen the goings on and was stood outside waiting to greet his father from work in tears, Dave came home and Sarah came running downstairs all very innocent, she walked past Dave as if nothing had happened with a sheepish wipe of her mouth and a quick shake of the head Sarah thought she had gotten away with her quick rumble upstairs...Dave however had been told of what had happened and refused to speak to her for days, in fact it took quite a while for me to get their marriage back on track! At this point, you would've been forgiven for forgetting that these characters are not real people, despite the great job they do of convincing you otherwise!Another way they try to convince you of their realism is through their animations, Sims will now lounge across the settee with their feet up and head resting in their hands, in bed adult Sims will cuddle up to each other and when watching TV, parents and children can snuggle up together while two adults can get \"romantic\" on the couch! I bought one of my Sims a double bed after it showed up as a \"want\" of hers (more on this later), she was so pleased with her new possession that she promptly began re-arranging the pillows and then laid down on it and began day dreaming, it looked so realistic. Toddlers can also be found crawling across the floor in search of an adult and young children play a number of games including the very violent \"cops and robbers\" which involves one of them falling to the ground after being \"shot\" by the other!Ok, so The Sims 2 is more realistic, what else is new? Well as mentioned earlier, the Sims now develop \"wants and fears\" in addition to their \"needs\", wants usually accompany the Sims aspiration so a \"fortune Sim\" will constantly want expensive furniture, promotions and money whilst a \"popularity Sim\" will want to make new friends and host big parties. Fears can be based on a number of things such as the death of a loved one, a grade D report card or a rejection of a kiss, its your job to fulfil their wants and stay clear of their fears and watch the aspiration metre fill up, points are awarded for completed wants and a good aspiration meter puts your Sims in a `platinum' mood.Finally, your Sims will now age, there are 6 stages to a Sims life ranging from baby, toddler, child, teenager, adult and finally, old age and unlike in the original game, Sims can now die of old age. Families are also backed by a family tree meaning that the game remembers who is related to who so in practice, you could raise a child to a teenager, through adulthood, witness them raise their own children and finally grandchildren before he or she dies leaving a long history behind him. This feature adds tons to the depth of the gameplay.So that's the game, but the question is, was it worth the 4 year wait? In a word, yes. The Sims 2 is what everyone wanted The Sims to be, the graphics are great, Sims get a couple of days off work and school for socialising and brushing up on skills, everything is fully customisable from the houses to the Sims themselves and the aging system coupled with the aspiration system just makes The Sims 2 more addictive than ever and what's more, they no longer take 1 hour to use the toilet and no longer need to go to bed at 17:00 in order to get up for work in a morning! If you're a fan of the original, you will love this, if you hated The Sims first time around, chances are you will hate this one too but on the whole Maxis have done an excellent job of creating a successful sequel to the best selling PC game of all time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2006"}

Well this wasn't really executed as well as it could have been. You can dive under the ocean and swim around fish and sea life and hold down A and wiggle the Wiimote to pet it, or poke it, or even grab it and if it likes you you'll learn a new thing about that animal. The problem there is that it's like two lines of info and it takes three days to learn all of the information about the animal.

It would play on my computer and it plays on my new DVD player but it would not play on my X-Box.  I've also had some problems with DVD's skipping/stuttering that I haven't had on my new dedicated DVD player.I think it's just that the DVD drive the X-Box uses is cheap, so you might run into some problems.If you really want to watch a lot of movies, I suggest getting a seperate player that was built with DVD viewing in mind.  However, the X-Box will play 99% of DVD's just fine, so for this price you wouldn't be amiss to have this for a multi-TV family where the parents want to watch Gone With the Wind and the kids would rather watch pretty much anything on the other TV.If you're just hoping this will save you some cash, don't say I didn't warn you!  Now and then you might find you rented a movie that your X-Box has problems with but a real DVD player wouldn't.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2004"}

{"product_name":"B000MUXLOK","description":"InBurnout Paradiseplayers are treated to a rarity in the video games universe: a complete reinvention of an established franchise that equals, if not betters any of the previous games in the series. Yes, this is a large claim, but one that can be explained in a single phrase: Next-Gen Freedom.Driver's heaven is a wide open worldIn Paradise City even cars can fly.View larger.Go for broke in 'Marked Man' Mode.View larger.Nothing is off limits, even head-on crashes.View larger.Start a race any time with 'Easy Drive.'View larger.Although theBurnoutseries&#146; over the top mobile action has been its calling card since it ignited audiences on the PS2 in 2001, and later on the first generation Xbox console,Burnout Paradiseis the first game in the series that has been designed specifically for play on Next Generation consoles. This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Trevor Larson","summary":"Epic","reviewText":"Still my favorite Burnout game, and probably Criterion's last good game.

{"product_name":"B00005TNI6","description":"Final Fantasy Xis the first title in this landmark RPG series to be released for the PlayStation2. The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"The Duck of Indeed","summary":"Really Amazing Game","reviewText":"&#8220;Final Fantasy X&#8221; is a wonderful game, and if you&#8217;re a fan of the &#8220;Final Fantasy&#8221; series or RPG&#8217;s, I would suggest checking this one out.  The game has an interesting, complex story that tells the adventures of Tidus, a young man whose world is turned upside down by a giant creature called Sin.  Waking up 1,000 years in the future, he embarks on a journey with a summoner named Yuna and her guardians.  What starts off as just as a regular Pilgrimage to temporarily stop Sin from terrorizing Spira turns into something more.  This game also has many great characters, as well.In addition to a great story and great characters, this game is a lot of fun.  This game takes a long time to beat (it took me a little over 50 hours, and I didn&#8217;t even do everything), but it doesn&#8217;t get boring.  One thing to mention is the game is linear for a while, which didn&#8217;t bother me, but might bother some people.  Farther into the game, though, you have the freedom to go where you want, including a couple secret areas.  The game gives you other extra things you can do, too, such as finding items that let you understand the Al Bhed language and translate messages on old ruins, and you can capture enemies for the battle arena.  You will definitely get a lot out of this game.I always enjoyed the battle system in this game.  It is turned-based, as you&#8217;d expect from an RPG, but unlike some games, it gives you more time to make decisions.  Some games have your characters and the enemies getting turns every few seconds, but in this game, you have all the time you need to choose what you want to do.  Once you choose an action, then your turn ends.  I really liked this.  It is not as fast paced, but I get overwhelmed when I don&#8217;t have much time to make the best decision in a battle.  I can plan out my strategy better this way.I also liked that the fighting is more flexible than in other games.  You fight with three characters at a time, but you have access to all of them.  You can switch characters during battle at any time, plus you can even switch armor and weapons during the battle, as well.  I love that you aren&#8217;t stuck in a battle ill-equipped.  If I am stuck with a bunch of flying enemies and characters with short range weapons, I can switch to characters that can hit flying enemies right in the middle of battle.  It is much better than in other games where I am stuck with an enemy I can&#8217;t even hit.I also like the method of making your characters stronger in this game.  The more experience you get in battle, the more you can move around on this Sphere Grid and learn moves and upgrade stats.  As you move around the grid, your characters can learn new abilities, get more health, and more defense, among other things.  Each character has their own section at first, but farther into the game, your characters can go to other characters&#8217; sections.  Like Yuna can learn healing spells, and after a while, you can let Tidus learn healing spells.  And Yuna can go and learn Lulu&#8217;s black magic, and so on.A few extra notes.  This game also has pretty good graphics, good voice acting, and also very good music.  Like other &#8220;FF&#8221; games, there are interesting levels and character designs.  The game is very complex and well-made, and it can also be a good challenge.  My main problem is you can&#8217;t skip cut scenes, so it can sometimes be annoying when you die and have to watch a cut scene all over again.  I guess just make sure you&#8217;re really prepared for boss battles and save often.So anyway, &#8220;FFX&#8221; is a great game to play.  It has a great story, great characters, and great gameplay.  And with so many hours of things to do, I think this game is really worth your money.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0047TLIBU","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Better in some ways than DA1","reviewText":"This is all compared to DA1Pros:Hawke (the main character) talks!More dynamic/visceral combat.The upgrade/skill trees are more interesting.Less buggy/glitchy (I stress \"less\" because it's certainly not bug-free).Looks better in almost every aspect; almost no slowdowns during combat.Simplified potions, runes and poisons/bombs (a con for some, but it was overly complex in DA1).Cross-class combos (worth the time and effort).Streamlined quests: It was far easier to understand the next step on each quest. DA1 made it rather difficult sometimes.More complex (though less epic) story, dealing with politics, race tensions and slavery, among other topics.Cons:Armor is 95% exclusive to Hawke. Only weapons and jewelry can be used on allies.No dual-wielding weapons for warriors (I loved that in DA1).Combat can be too fast - it was hard to tell what was going on sometimes. (They would've been better served to have each hit do more damage but slow down the action. I want to understand all that's happening.)Recycled maps (they used the exact same layouts for different quests that were supposed to be in different locations, only with different color schemes).Most loot is junk (i.e. sellable). Why not just make it money so it doesn't take up inventory space and we don't have to go through the process of selling it to a vendor?The aforementioned cross-class combos: My warrior could take advantage of disoriented enemies, but it was often hard to tell when that occurred. During a scrap with 15+ characters on screen, it's really difficult to see a small icon above a single enemy's head (the indication that he's \"disoriented\" or \"brittle\" (\"staggered\" was more obvious)). An easy fix could have been text that appeared on/near the bottom of the screen indicating the direction of a staggered/disoriented/brittle enemy.The star system for rating equipment sometimes seemed flat out wrong.No specialization skill trees for allies.Conclusion: If they can take the best of DA1 & 2 for no. 3, we'll have a truly amazing game on our hands.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2012"}

(Too Violent Though)","reviewText":"Ok, so I was expecting this game to have abundant amounts of gore... well it did, probably even more than I thought. Oh well, besides the graphic (almost laughable) amount of gore, this game totally rules. There's nothing more comical than a villager/zombie coming at you with a chainsaw shouting in German... it hilarious and downright horrifying at the same time. The graphics in this game are wonderful! As is the gameplay... I don't actually own a Wii, but my friend does, and we played this for 7 hours straight. The story is great, (however shallow) and the controls are very well designed. As far as content goes, the language is NOT heavy, but the violence is extreme and gory and not really healthy for children under 15 or so. As a Christian I felt this game was mostly pure ethically, (there's nothing sinful about blasting away zombies.) This game is strictly good against evil, meaning the good characters do not practice witchcraft, murder etc. Another redeeming element of the game is Leon's genuine concern for the president's daughter, this was a good element as it shows how a real hero should act.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2007"}

I really enjoy this game, its a lot of fun. It's modern day combat(I'm glad the WWII games are gone) at a good price too. The characters are cool, but I wish you could chose any of them to play as, not only Preston. You have the ability to crouch, but I also wish you could lay down making it very difficult to get hit. Also, I wish it was rated M and featured blood & gore b/c that would be more real in a war situation. In my opinion, the enemy tanks are too mobile, too strong/hard to kill, and too intelligent. A game like this needs multi-player ability too.
