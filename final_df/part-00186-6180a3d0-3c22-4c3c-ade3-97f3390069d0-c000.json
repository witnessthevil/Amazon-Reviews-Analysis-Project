{"product_name":"B00005NZ1M","description":"When Microsoft releasedNFL Fever 2000on the PC in 1999, it gaveMaddena serious run for its money. It's been a few years, butFeverandMaddenare once again going head-to-head on the Xbox,  and once againFeverproves itself a serious threat to EA's perennial  football powerhouse. That's not to say thatNFL Fever 2002is a perfect  game, because it isn't, but it does offer great graphics, decent AI, and plenty  of bone-crunching gameplay.NFL Fever 2002features several gameplay modes, including practice,  single game, and season, which itself contains a couple of different options,  including dynasty and fantasy challenge.Fever 2002has a full NFL  license and includes all 31 current NFL teams--and 15 fantasy teams--along with  all the current stadiums. Dynasty mode is where most players will find  themselves, as this mode lets you manage all aspects of your team, including  signing and cutting players, negotiating trades, and making sure that your team  comes in under the salary cap.A great feature in dynasty mode is Dynamic Player Performance, which adjusts  players' ratings (which determine how well they play) based on past game  performances. So if you have a second-string running back who rattles off three  or four great games in a row, his rating will increase, which should keep him  performing at that high level. On the flip side, if a player has several poor  games, his rating will decrease.Because it was designed specifically for the Xbox (unlikeMadden NFL  2002, which was ported to the Xbox from the PlayStation2 version),NFL  Fever 2002looks awesome. Player animations are highly detailed, the  stadiums look fantastic, and the weather effects are topnotch. Beyond the  obvious features, though, there are many subtle details that really add to the  experience: the field will get torn up in wet weather, player uniforms will get  stained with dirt, and the crowd will begin to thin out if the game is a  blowout.In terms of gameplay,Fever 2002delivers a solid experience. The AI is  pretty solid, especially on the defensive side, and if you call a perfect game  it's possible to get a shutout against the computer, even on the higher  difficulty settings. On the downside, the computer rarely runs the ball, even  when it has a high-powered running back like Corey Dillon, and AI play calling  is rather suspect at times.Those complaints aside,Fever 2002is a lot of fun. It offers great  graphics, multiplayer is a blast, and the dynasty mode features a good deal of  depth. If you only want one football game,NFL Fever 2002deserves your  consideration.--William HarmsPros:Dynamic Player PerformanceGreat graphicsSolid defensive AICons:Computer rarely runs the ballGameplay a little arcadelike at times","reviewerName":"M.

{"product_name":"B002EE1P2W","description":"Set several years after the events of the first game in the series,Dead Rising 2contains all the fun and over-the top carnage which gamers associate with a zombie apocalypse. As with all releases in theDead Risingseries, it is a survival horror game. Players take on the role of an all-new character, with equally new motivations to survive and resources to do so. These resources include new weapons, expanded weapon combination/creation possibilities, and even two-player coop functionality. The game also features a 4-player online multiplayer mode and a dramatic increase in the number of zombies that can be faced at once.","reviewerName":"Tierra12 \"Tierra12\"","summary":"The Real Zombie Apocalypse","reviewText":"My first experience with the Dead Rising series was Dead Rising:  Chop Till You Drop for the Nintendo Wii.  The game was fun, but it did have more than its fair share of problems.  First off, it was on the Wii so graphically it is a very unimpressive looking game.  The next problem with the game was the horrendous voice acting, the mediocre story, and painfully bad dialogue.  The only thing that kept me coming back over and over again to play the game was the fresh take on the whole zombie genre.When I heard about DR2 I was excited for the game since I knew that it was being released on both the Xbox and PS3 which meant it would look and perform better than anything on the crappy Wii so I got the game.  I must say it does everything the first game did bigger and better.Let's start with the main character.  Immediately Chuck is more likeable than Frank ever was.  His voice actor really does a fine job portraying the character.  He changes up his voice appropriately per scene and delivers his lines in a convincing manner every time.  Then there's Chuck himself.  I like the fact that the game creators made him a caring father, a tough guy, and a handy man on par with MacGyver. I could immediately identify with the guy.Then there's the setting.  The game takes place in Fortune City (a newly rebuilt Las Vegas).  Being that I've vacationed in Vegas on more than one occasion and it's one of my favorite places to travel I could truly appreciate how much they captured the glitzy atmosphere.  They got everything down pack from the hotels, casinos, restaurants, to the show girls, slot machines, casino chips ECT.Then there are the zombies and psychopaths.  I've never played any so called zombie game that made me feel like I was smack dab in the zombie apocalypse like this one.  The zombie numbers are impressive.  They will maim your character in a second.  Also the psychopaths this time around made me go, \"Wow that person is crazy.\"  In game 1 when the psychopaths showed up I thought, \"Wow this person is cheesy.\"This game is definitely worth the price of admission.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2010"}

{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"D. Surine \"Stanley\"","summary":"Might be worth it","reviewText":"This is a fantastic game with many revolutionary changes never before seen in video games.  The most obvious is the advanced face recognition software that was used to capture even the slightest facial movements for you to determine if the suspect is lying or telling the truth.  I love how the game is broken up into separate cases, but in addition, there's also a contection from one case to another, adding another layer to victims who have similar M.O.'s.  The details in every clue become very important.  And all of these factors are thanks to the advancements in graphics and HD gaming.The mini-cases add a little variety so it's not soley one case at a time.  Just like a GTA game, you can enter any car you want and say it's for \"police business\" but doing this too much will take away from your intergrity.Though I haven't completed the game yet, I'm worried that the cases are still too easy.  The notebook your character keeps organizes the clues for you, but almost too well.  It doesn't really leave much room for you to do anything thinking on your own.  And even if you completely botch an interview, you'll still figure out who the suspect is because they're the one running away.  It would have been nice to have different difficulty levels to add more of a challenge for those who wanted it.Perhaps the game's biggest flaw is its lack of replay value.  Your only motivation to go back and re-play a case is to try and get more questions right to get more stars.  But after the criminal is behind bars, why would you?  Understandably, it's hard to make a game like this that could be replayed since all the clues are pointing to one person in particular.Of course, the game is not without flaws, but the 40's LA feel (complete with music), graphics, and game play still make it very enjoyable and completely different than most other games on the market.  My hope is that Rockstar will add on to this amazing start and we'll soon see additions similar to what they did with GTA IV.UPDATE - 5/3/12Now that I've completed the game and the retail price has been reduced, I thought I'd come back and add to my first review.  I'll agree with most reviews in that cases are repeatative, the outcome of a case doesn't change the story at all, and now that the game is beat, it sits on my shelf unplayed.  When I first played this game, I had it on the \"easy\" mode where the controller shakes when you're near a clue and the music changes when you've found them all.  This makes the game extremely easy, but I wonder how difficult it would have been without this support.  However, now that the price has been reduced to $20, I think it may be worth your money.  I think my initial review (and perhaps some of the others out there) would be very different if I hadn't bought it so soon at full price.  I think when you consider the price, the value is now worth it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2011"}

Despite the complex controls I soon mastered it and would whoop any one who dared challenge me.  Later when Smackdown came out I learned a new control style that was even easier to amster and brought a long a better challenge, because any one could master the controls.  Smackdown 2 provide me with the Hell in the Cell match (one of my all time Favs) and Ironman (For a dramatic finish) which I still enjoy.  Now we have Smackdown 3 and it is by far the best wrestling game ever.The graphics for one thing have had a huge boost from the days of before.  No more jagged looking wrestlers here.  Instead the graphics are super smooth and so on.  The music hasn't changed much.  Controls took a huge leap.  More combos now.  And an even deeper counter system (I was whooped on easy by my dad because of the counter system threw my guard off).  I nopw have mastered this system.The only match deleted (Besides the thousands of Special Referee MAtches) was the Casket MAtch, probably the least used (At least by me) and instead we have three new matches, LAst Man Standing, Street Fight, adn Ultimate Submission.  Also the ladder and TLC matches expanded slightly.The biggest change was the story mode.  Although it is incredibly short (4 matches at most) you use this to unlock a huge assortment of hidden things (mostly by defending your title) and thats it.  YOu fight until either the end of Smackdown or until you win a title (Which is eitehr on Raw, Smackdown, or PPV) and from there thats it.The thing I love the most are enterences.  Each are beutifuly crafted adn for once (Literally) you can preview your entrance before deciding.  Also there commentary but it OK at most.Also for fun you can edit wrestlers moves, I only did this once and that was with Big Show, I changed the Alley Oop to the Show Stopper because it's more consistant with the TV events.Over all this is a must buy for wrestling fans and any one looking for an awsome game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2002"}

Denick","summary":"Curious, quirky, and cosmic in scope","reviewText":"I liked this game. In no way did I ever feel like it was the second coming of \"Devil May Cry\", and it pales in comparison to the level of polish that \"God of War 3\" sports (most games do), but it was really enjoyable, if only because it was so gosh darned weird (I compare it to DMC and GOW because it is a similar, action-based game). I loved the concepts of witches and sages, heaven and hell, and the creature design of the various angels you must battle is a treat to behold. Combat is very, very tight... easy to pick up, with a staggering amount of depth, and a very cool combination of physical attacks and... I don't know, something like rune-based magic attacks, where your hair goes flying all over the place and punches monsters in the face. I told you: It's weird.I only wish (developer) Platinum had begun the game with the tighter, more compelling storytelling that only picks up toward the end of the game. In the beginning, I winced several times from the sheer immaturity with which the main character and the story is presented, though I suppose much of this is a cultural gap that is lost in translation from the Japanese audience to the western one. Despite that complaint, there's a lot to love here. As I mentioned, the combat and creature design is fantastic, and if you can actually decipher what's going on, there's a really cool story somewhere in here. Variety is another plus here, with crazy level design that mixes things up while paying homage to some classics (like \"After Burner\" and \"Devil May Cry\"... at the same time). Another strong point is some of the boss battles. They're not all great, but some of them really sing, particularly the second-to-last one. That battle is what I have always hoped this generation of consoles would achieve... not just epic boss battles, but DYNAMIC boss battles, where the setting actively changes in an exciting way (GOW3 opening sequence with Poseidon and Olympus is another good example).Below is a possible SPOILER, depending on how sensitive you are (I just describe a level).There is one level in this game, called \"Paradiso\", which is the game developer's take on Heaven, and it simply breathtaking. It is, without a doubt, one of the coolest things I have yet seen in this very long console generation. True gamers might want to play through \"Bayonetta\" just for that one part, if nothing else.Great job, Platinum Games. Personally, I'm hoping you guys knock it out of the park with \"Metal Gear Rising\".","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2012"}

Ricky the kangaroo, Moosh the winged bear, and Dimitri the dodongo accompany Link on this adventure.","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"A must own for Zelda fans","reviewText":"The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons & Oracle of Ages both proved to make history for two reasons. One, Nintendo did not produce these games. They handed off it to Capcom, one of the most respected producers and publishers of video games. Two, Capcom had originally produced three Legend of Zelda games at the same time and worked to sync them altogether as a trilogy of games. However, they had problems synching them so they cancelled one game and kept two in the end. What resulted was a pair of Zelda games that proved to be a must own for Zelda fans. Not only was each game worthy of a game in its own, but depending on which game you played first, it had an impact on the game play and ending when you moved onto the next game. Though they weren't perfect, the Zelda Game Boy Color games were a joy to play through back in 2001.In The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages, Link witnessed Nayru, the Oracle of Ages become possessed by Veran, the game's main villain. You had to save her because as a result, the time flow in Labrynna was warped beyond reality. By using the Harp of Ages, you can go back and forth in time and get past places that are blocked by the changes in the land that time brought upon. For those who have played Zelda games on the Game Boy will feel right at home. The game play is similar as are searching for items, heart containers and rupees. One major new thing here was the ability to befriend animals who had abilities you can use to progress in the game. Only after going through the numerous dungeons and defeating the enemies and bosses there will you reach Veran and have a chance to defeat him. Once you did that, you got a password to continue the story when you played the Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons.The PROS: It looks and plays like a Zelda game on a portable system. This time, it was in color and the story was pretty good. The graphics, sound effects and music are top notch. The controls are spot on and the difficulty of the enemies and puzzle solving progressively build up but not to the point that it's impossible to go forward. Capcom did a commendable job making the name under Nintendo's guidance and instead of just playing one game, it was two games to play through if you wanted to see the entire story so there was incentive to buy both games.The CONS: While the graphics and sound effects are top notch, you've seen them before. Unfortunately, they had been heavily recycled from Link's Awakening. The layouts for Labrynna and music for Oracle of Ages are different than from Link's Awakening but there are still too many similarities seen here. It's not a huge knock but you couldn't ignore it from the get go.In the end, this was a game worth picking up and you had to tip your hat to Capcom. Both Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons sold well despite the few flaws here. The idea of playing through two separate Zelda games that connect to tell you the entire story and the game play was affected by which game you played first was new to the franchise and it worked well. It was worth buying and hopefully Nintendo will consider releasing Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons to the 3DS Virtual Console service in the near future.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2011"}

The little things really make this game, such as how fast you can switch between weapons and the sounds and feel of it...guns don't just magically appear in front of you, you can actually hear the noises that go along with taking out your pistol or your main weapon...etc.  Fast paced, action packed, easily the most impressive COD to date.  HIGHLY recommended.CON: My video card is a Nvidia GeForce 6800...so it's not the most current one.  It was a little sluggish with the cinematics...but ran the actual game fine...just an FYI for anyone who has a slightly dated video card.

It beat out the N64, which was unheard of in japan.Unfortuantely, in America and Europe, this marked the end for Sega.A disasterous decision to release it 4 months ahead of the PS1, not only were some stores unperpared, some were so peeved that they simply said &#34;go to hell sega.'and only 2 million were sold in a 3 year period.but that didnt stop them (and the only thing that WOULD stop sega, was running out of money) from being innovative.In july 1996, with the release of one of the best games in the 90s, they made a 3D analog controller, this was before the N64, and a year before the PS1, being in the works long before the rushed N64. This helped sales quite abit, beating the N64 in summer sales, but the PS1 still neating all of them.Technical specs of the Saturn are far too advanced for me to type this out, so this is a abriged version:The saturn had a Grand total of.... *drum roll* 9 CPU's.yes.2 main 32 bit RISC CPUs very advanced.2 Graphical CPUs (unheard of even today)2 RAM CPU's (totalling to 2 MB of main work RAM)a audio sound chip (still unheard of todaay)a GUI CPU (nice touch)and a spare co processor that wasnt used for much games.this made deeloping games for it mental. Im sure some developers needed therapy after doing so.but still, this was a dang powerful Console, and couldve ewasilly competed. if it wasnt for mismanagement, something sega was doing bad transitioning to 3D.after it was dicsontinued in august 1998 in america, many sega buyers were quite unhappy.and a year later, they continued their console legacy, until caling it quits in 2001.the saturn has so many ups, and few downs. most being in history of the console.+alot of 1st party AAA cloass titles, such as NiGHTS, Virtua fighter 1 & 2, Panzer dragoon trilogy, some 3rd party games even make it look like a beast.+AAA build quality, being arcade materials, and having a very though out of CD drive, this machine wont break for decades.+ built in memory, so no memory cards are needed until it runs out. and the memry cards it does have hold several thousand blocks.+a pre DVD player having VCD's mean it can do FMV cutscenes great.+a legendary cult following, meaning fans of this system are still making games for it today.+top grade arcade driving wheels and fighting sticks give it almost a true arcade feel.cons:-very small 3rd party games make the library significantly smaller compared to the PS1, but makes up in its sega branded games.-not easy to come by in america, meaning it can cost some more money compared to others.but set those aside, this console is only a true gamers Masterpiece, and can be enjoyed even today, 20 yrs later.

{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"Shanghaied","summary":"Diablo 3: A Requiem","reviewText":"I remember the night of May 14th, 2012, and I&#8217;m telling you about it now because it&#8217;s a good metaphor for the product I&#8217;m going to discuss shortly.I was at a local Fry&#8217;s Electronics, standing in a huge line that wrapped around the building.  It was my first midnight opening, and it was an eye opener.  Probably a hundred odd people standing in a line that wrapped around the building, waiting for the ball to drop for a franchise that had been dormant for 12 years.I&#8217;ll always remember the people in front of me.  They were a group of overweight, bearded men in worn clothing, T-Shirts tucked in, and&#8230;. Fanny packs.  Yes, that&#8217;s right, fanny packs.The fanny packs do stand out in memory (too well, surprisingly), but that&#8217;s not the reason I remember these guys; I remember them because of the discussion we had.  They informed me (using heated language that wouldn&#8217;t be appropriate for this site)  how terrible this game would be, how it was a tragedy to the Blizzard name, and how it was further proof of the downfall of this once great company.I remember this because I had no idea why these guys were standing in line in front of an electronics retailer waiting patiently for the midnight release of a game that would ultimately be the biggest tragedy in recent video game history.  We&#8217;ll revisit this concept later.I did understand their argument perfectly however.  An always online requirement, which limits their choice on how to play the game and eliminated 3rd party modding potential (which in light of the heavily flooded servers during the first week I gained intimate appreciation of), no skill trees, a real money auction house that encouraged a &#8220;pay to win&#8221;  mechanic, and visuals that were styled in a drastically different manner than previous installments in the series.  And of course, the many conspiracy theories of the time regarding Blizzard&#8217;s denied intentions of making a console version of the game (we all know what happened with those).----------------------------------------------On some of these matters I sympathized deeply.  Diablo 2 should&#8217;ve been an alarming example of what happens when you design an economy that can be manipulated by external currency or influence.  In that case, it was understandable; D2 was the first big foray into a managed online environment. At that point in online gaming&#8217;s relative infancy it would&#8217;ve been impossible to truly foresee just how deeply the most dedicated portion of the community would work to game the system, even in a closed environment. As the community discovered, there really weren&#8217;t any lengths they wouldn&#8217;t go to.So in the case of Diablo 3 there&#8217;s a very strong argument to be made, in light of this, that Blizzard should&#8217;ve known the RMAH would introduce factors they couldn&#8217;t control.  Their hubris, likely derived from dictating gameplay in titles like Starcraft's knife-edged tuning and World of Warcrafts ongoing and so thoroughly controlled aspects of progression, balance, and player empowerment, are evident in it's inclusion and execution.  Things however must have changed in 12 years, and it&#8217;s got to be easier to control that sort of environment.They were wrong.  Immediately out of the gate, gold farmers began a campaign to prepare for the launch of the RMAH (some time after launch) and flooded the economy with gold.  Inflation on the gold auction house spiraled out of control, while gold on the Real Money Auction house plummeted in value.  The result?  People who actually wanted to play the game were without enough gold to buy items needed to progress.  Their alternative was to face the RNG God, who in Diablo 3 proved particularly merciless.You either paid more money for gold, or you scraped by with dull rares that did the job sometimes.  And the stat rolls on many of them would probably have benefited another class more than yours.  So many items dropped, so few worth&#8230; anything.  And forget selling mediocre off class items on the AH; they were abundant there, and no one was buying.-----------------------------------------------------------So why didn&#8217;t Blizzard just improve the drop rate?  True, that likely would&#8217;ve curbed inflation some.  But it would&#8217;ve left one thing intact; random drops still aren&#8217;t as good as getting exactly what you want for cheap.  The AH would&#8217;ve still dominated progression.Add that to the ultra punishing release-state inferno difficulty and varying class balance issues and the game felt like a chore to play in end-game; and no one wanted to at a point. Finishing vanilla inferno was so daunting and so frustratingly difficult that once/if you finished, you took a sigh of relief and went somewhere for a victory drink, and tried to forget Diablo 3.  It was uncharacteristic for the series.------------------------------------------------------------Over the course of it&#8217;s 2 year existence, Diablo 3 has changed.  The RMAH is gone.  Loot and it&#8217;s randomness have been redesigned.  Character balance has changed, and the overall difficulty of the game can be adjusted to better suit the player.  Most would argue this has all been to great effect.But remember our fanny packed friends, and remember that first impressions really do matter.  In many respects, their sentiments were correct and as convenient as hindsight is now, I believe they weren&#8217;t totally wrong.  Diablo 3 missed the mark in many ways and introduced many frustrating aspects that drew players away from the most important thing; actually playing the game.And yet, when you did play, and your character had a build you liked and could survive long enough to battle, it was glorious.  I would argue that if this game did one thing right above anything and anyone else it was how nearly perfect the gameplay was; to send your character into the foray against hundreds of demons and watch them smash them all to literal pieces; to revel in the way passive and active skills synergized to empower each other; to listen to your character taunt the hordes after a single blow levels an entire pack.  These things should&#8217;ve been the focus; the core of what this game should&#8217;ve been; and everything else we've mentioned now should've served to accentuate it, not mire it as a near afterthought.It took me 2 years, but I realize now why my fanny packed friends, who seemed to so desperately hate this game, were standing with me on May 14th at 11:45 PM.  It was because they probably love this game several times more than I do.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2012"}

It was called Pirates!, and combined ship to ship combat, swordplay, and resource management in a brilliant masterpiece much beloved. But times changed and people moved on and only the hard-core remembered...In a bold move much to be encouraged (remake classic PC games! Where's my Wing Commander 1 and Tomb Raider 1 and Tie Fighter Collector's Edition with improved graphics?!), the classic game Pirates has been remade with 3D graphics, new game play modes, new music, and re-balanced gameplay.Fans of great adventure flicks will look back fondly on The Adventures of Robin Hood and Captain Blood, stories where the rogue scoundrel is the romantic hero, robbing the rich and feeding the poor, in the end winning the fair damsel, the tower of loot, and the governorship all in one. It's great stuff, and other than this game, the only time I can recall that wonderful storyline being used in a game is the awesome PC classic air-combat game Crimson Skies (heck, the only movie I can think of that really is a throw-back to those classics is Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow). All I can say is it's about time!Like every Sid Meyer's game I've ever played, the beauty and elegance in the gameplay springs from the fact that the gameplay is at once incredibly simple and mind-bogglingly complex. To put it another way, you can do whatever you want, attain victory however you want, BECOME whatever you want.Take the over world map for instance. Like the recent epic Rome: Total War, you have a giant map of all the key locations of the time, each one with it's own economy and set of rulers with a certain way of doing things. What this translates to is that certain places are worth pillaging, certain places are worth courting favor with, and certain places are going to be very dangerous to hang around in for too long. And just like Rome: Total War, you will have to spend a lot of time moving your unit (only one unit or groups of units in this case) from location to location in order to accomplish certain missions. Remember those senate missions in Rome: Total War? You get something similar here with transporting immigrants, peace treaties and new governors. And what is that like? Well, it's a lot like the gameplay of such ambitious games as Freelancer and Escape Velocity (the former being horrendously boring and the latter being the greatest shareware game ever made). You get a wonderful feeling of freedom and immersion in the world of the game, find great joy in just negotiating with everyone.The world is a crucial element of all of Sid Meyer's games, because the interface is what connects everything, and it has to feel natural. This one does, but even so, it's the gameplay that will keep you playing. Oh, and what gameplay there is! First of all you control pretty much all of the real-time gameplay with the keyboard number pad. It may sound awkward to those who grew up on joysticks and game pads, but just wait till you try it! Controlling the ships is a breeze, you'll slice right through the sword fights and the dance game will have your fingers doing the waltzing. At first a little annoying to learn to control, once you get the hang of using the keypad for everything (actually you can use it to navigate menus too, and thus never have to lift your hand from the thing for hours at a time (how many games can claim that?)) you'll learn to love it.These mini-games of dancing with girls, battling ships, and sword fighting opponents are incredibly old-school. They make one think back to the good old days of the Apple II and the Amiga, when you played everything with the keyboard and had the time of your life doing it (it's just so much fun!). It may not be the cup of tea of modern kids who think all games are first-person blood-sports, but for someone who grew up on the NES and an 11 MHz Macintosh, it sure feels good to return to gameplay like this.Game play aside though, there is an amazing amount of depth that should go into your decisions of whether to engage in these simple mini-games (again that genius of simple yet complex). You don't want to take on a 40 gun Treasure ship and crew of 128 with a 2 cannon ship with a crew of less than 40! Likewise, it's not the greatest idea to engage in sword fights with big shot captains when you don't have any fencing upgrades... And of course your ship will be faster with a bigger crew and fight better, but it will also consume more food and when you divvy up the loot (what, you thought you could hold onto all of it yourself forever you silly goose?) there will be less left over for you.That's what makes this a great game. True, there is great music (kind of like the Pirates of the Caribbean at Disneyland), great graphics (look at the pretty water!) and a very well-balanced style of play. Heck, there's even a storyline for those who want it (REVENGE!). But ultimately it's all up to you? Want to raid towns (no time to describe that!)? Want to hunt for treasure or locate lost cities (likewise)? Want to just rove around dancing with every girl you find and blasting the heck out of ships loaded with Spanish gold? It's all up to you. Easy to play, impossible to master, and with more depth than the ocean. You'll find yourself playing into retirement, (What's the matter me hartey? Want to live forever?) trying to get a higher score and the dream life.This is a great game. Another Sid Meyers masterpiece. But then, you probably knew that before I said a word, especially if you played this game for more than five minutes. God speed young adventurer, and keep the wind at your back and your eyes on the treasure!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2006"}

I honestly thought Retro was gonna do a horrible job making a Classic nintendo game into a some what Fp perspective game with a 3d look but they sure proved me wrong.  Metroid Prime is not only one of the best Gamecube games ever but it is simply a masterpiece.  From the amazing 3d atomspheric graphics to doing some really great puzzle solving.  Metroid Prime never loses its touch and just keeps gaining strengh at what it's best at.  When I first got this game back when it first hit stores I was not that excited but after 5 minutes Lets put it this way.....wow.  That is what came out of my mouth when I played this amazing game.  I honestly don't know what you can find wrong about it.  It has some awesome gameplay like the visors which are an awesome in this game.  The beams are just oh so delightfull and keeps you on the game and won't let you go.  Not many games keep me up at night just making me play through and keep goin on to see what's the next chapter but Metroid Prime is one of those games that kept me up alll night and that really shows how great this game is.  I'll say it again it is simply amazing and I loved it.  Lets get to itThe graphics is beautiful.  The atmosphere in this game is pure and wonderful.  The waterfall, the huge world your in it's just...wow.  Retro proved to us what they can do with the Metroid series and the graphics are one of them.  The graphics are very detailed and takes your breath away.  If you have a problem with the graphics then you really are an idiot.The gameplay is very well done.  Scanning things are fun to do and there are lots of things to do in this huge world your in.  You pretty much have to collect items like Missiles, Bombs, Upgrades, Combos for your weapons, and Beams and the best part...VISERS! There is filled with things to do in this game and gameplay just keeps getting better.  The best part of the game play by far is the beams.  You have selected choice of beams well it depends on how many you've gotten.  There are some weapon beams you have to look for through out the game like the ice beam, lava beam and more.  And then you can find combos for that beam which makes the game even more fun but it sucks cause it takes away your missile.  The average amount of Missiles is like 250 I think but I beat the game with 215 and it's not easy and if you beat the game with less then 100 then you really are good.  With all that great stuff to do how can you not like the gameplay?  It's awesome!The sound is wonderful.  I loved the music in the game.  It was breath of fresh air for me.  Some of the songs are very memorable.  Each music senario went with the room or location of the game that you are in.  It really went well with it.  I loved the sound of the creatures you fight.  The sound and music is very detailed.  Lemmi put it this way...THE SOUND IS GOOD.The Good-The visuals are just so beautiful-The world is so atmospheric and beautiful-A huge world to explore-Getting 100% and everything = 26-30 hours of some of the best gameplay ever-The Bosses acctually make you think!-The level desighn for some of the areas are just brilliant as well as the puzzles-who is complaining about Controls?...They're perfect, you probably stink at the game..-THE MUSIC IT SELF IS 5 STARS!The bad-.......um..lets get back to the good : )This game is amazing, awesome and is not only one of the best GCN games but it is also one of the best games ever made.  Metroid Prime is another classic in the Metroid series and with all the hard work Retro Studio has done why wouldn't you give them credit for this game?  From awesome music to amazing graphics, Memorable Boss Battles like the Omega Pirate and Meta Ridley.  Not to mention the hours of finding beams, beam upgrades, bombs, Visers, combos, scaning things.  This game will have you up all night.  It will probably take about 18 to 20 hours if your aiming for a 90-95% ending like the one I went for.  Metroid Prime succeeds in aspect and that is why I am giving this amazing game a5 out of 5 stars!!!If you have a gamecube...GET THIS GAME!Lates","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2004"}

It would be a great game to play by youself in the basement in the dark...if you dare.  Having surround sound adds to the suspence..and keeps you right on the edge.The gameplay is okay.

I'm glad I did because I got more than I bargained for, a lot more. Originally my friend was playing this at his house and I was watching in amazement, this game looked pretty sweet so I bought it myself. Without going on and on with lots of details because there's a whole bunch of 5 star reviews that sum it up nicely. In essence this is an awesome game. The story, the graphics, the gameplay, Man! It's one of those games where nothing is fed to you, basically you start off and it's like \"Here's a gun, Here's a knife\" a cult group has kidnapped the presidents daughter now go kick butt. With non stop action and terror you take on hordes of zombies, nasty insects, morbid corpses with sharp teeth, crazy bosses, it's got it all. Oh and you collect money/items and get to barter with a friendly zombie who just loves to sell you goodies that go bang to aid you on your quest. Leon and The Merchant have taken a spot on the most memorable character's in video game history list. After playing through this game it's hard to forget them.

{"product_name":"B000MUW98O","description":"InBurnout Paradiseplayers are treated to a rarity in the video games universe: a complete reinvention of an established franchise that equals, if not betters any of the previous games in the series. Yes, this is a large claim, but one that can be explained in a single phrase: Next-Gen Freedom.Driver's heaven is a wide open worldIn Paradise City even cars can fly.View larger.Go for broke in 'Marked Man' Mode.View larger.Nothing is off limits, even head-on crashes.View larger.Start a race any time with 'Easy Drive.'View larger.Although theBurnoutseries&#146; over the top mobile action has been its calling card since it ignited audiences on the PS2 in 2001, and later on the first generation Xbox console,Burnout Paradiseis the first game in the series that has been designed specifically for play on Next Generation consoles. This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"R.

{"product_name":"B002I0HJG8","description":"","reviewerName":"Nakkiel","summary":"Fun, but is it worth a subscription?","reviewText":"Edit: Adding this in for endgame review. First of all chronoscrolls are easy enough to buy with gold at max level, so this ends up being a 1 time purchase and is worth the price. The end game instances are a lot of fun, but the problem is the people that play this game. Elitist to me means people genuinely good at the game that are intolerant of poor players. It is a word I hear a lot of players refer to people in this game as, but feel that is inaccurate. Instead groups tend to only be willing to try the instance if everyone already has a higher gear score than anything that drops in the instance and already knows and has done each boss. I have seen groups actually disband over 1 death without a wipe... If you so much as mention it is your first time running the instance they will immediately kick you and probably place you on ignore.In addition GMs actually constantly tell people in global to stop some of their worse conversations (Such as one that went on for about an hour about pedophilia) and the players will actually just keep talking about it while making fun of the GM. Not going to take a star off a game just because the community in it is terrible, but you should know that before purchasing.-----------------------------------------------------------------There are really so many things I want to cover that I don't know where to start. First of all this is a subscription game, which always has the problem of making you feel like you need to play often, even if you feel a bit burnt out, for the game to be worth paying for. To me this takes away a lot of fun that could be had playing when I actually want to rather than feeling obligated. ChronoScrolls do help alleviate that by letting you buy a month of play time from another player for in-game currency, but there is still the problem of needing to both spend a lot of time getting the gold for game time every month as well as saving for everything else you need in game. My character is only 50 ATM, so I will edit in my thoughts on end-game content in 10 levels.I'll start with what I think this game does well. The combat targeting system is a lot of fun, especially for damage dealers and tanks. You literally aim at the target and cast rather than just auto-target. The abilities are interesting and varied as well, some even requiring you to stand at a specific distance range. (Cross-hairs tell you target distance) Healers are still fun, but they use less spells and abilities just lock on rather than needing to aim. I don't really understand why they gave healers so few healing (and damage) spells and everyone else so many.. but they did. They have a relatively short heal range though; so game-play for them becomes getting in range of people needing heals without getting hurt, and there are plenty of abilities to help with that.The graphics are well designed and look great. Just a tip, if you are getting a weird glowing look to everything you need to tweak brightness in game options... it works differently than any brightness setting I have ever seen. Creatures in TERA are very well designed and just look very nice. The world is also very large for a relatively new MMO with no expansions. That does also mean it takes up a lot of hard drive space; 30 gig. Mods aren't allowed, but the UI is very customizable making them mostly unnecessary. Also glyphs make spells extremely customizable and your bank is shared between all characters on server.Unfortunately for all the good features TERA has there are plenty of minor bad ones as well. First of all this game's story is about as bad as it could possibly get. There are no talent trees, just glyphs. While the glyphs are limited by points making them serve somewhat like talents it really just isn't the same. When Nexus goes on (I think it is the game's equivalent of a raid instance, but it is open world) the entire server lags. Spells will go off up to 10 seconds after I cast them at times. There is no vertical synch so I constantly get screen tearing from overly high fps. The only way to play in first person is to disable the UI, meaning you can't see your own health, open a map, etc. Considering first person is the most fun way to play with this combat system that is very disappointing to me. There is also some kind of memory leak that occasionally crashes the game. It seems to be mainly while tabbed out of game, but has happened while just playing a few times.These are less serious issues that are mainly just nitpicking, but still could be better. Every time I log in I have to fix the sidebar location for some reason, which is really annoying. While there technically is auto-dismount it doesn't work with abilities, only gathering or if you are hit by things. So you can't just gallop up to an enemy and cast; you have to dismount. Stamina replaces gear durability, but rather than go down a % each death it does down gradually and drops to 0% on death. Rather than just a repair bill you need to either use a potion which costs gold or wait for a ridiculous amount of time. The problem with this is you aren't going to waste potions just to get the gradual loss back up, so this results in a lot of time standing around doing nothing next to a fire. I get they did it to force you to take a break (Probably because of the Asian woman that let her kid starve to death while she played WoW.)... but instead it is just very annoying.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2012"}
{"product_name":"B001NX6GBK","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"One helluva good time!","reviewText":"Let me start off by saying I am a GOW fan.  Like, diehard.  So I'm pretty critical when I hear the term \"GOW clone\" because, a, I compare all hack-n-slash titles to the series and, b, I'm a diehard fan when I find a game I j'adore.  That said, after seeing the truly E P I C trailers for Dante's Inferno, and knowing the story somewhat, and for the surprisingly decent price I decided what the hell (pun intended), I'll buy it and try it out.  Boy, am I glad I did...First off, Dante's Inferno does possess elements that are attributed to GOW.  That's not saying it's a true knock-off because there are elements to this title that are truly its own thing, but that's not denying its similarities to the aforementioned acclaimed series either.  Still, that being said, at least the developers decided to copy the formula that is THE definitive hack-n-slash formula because Dante's Inferno, even for a hardened GOW fan like myself, is still one helluva good time.  I'd have to go so far as to say that Dante's Inferno pretty much almost equals the epic awesomeness of GOW if it weren't for the obvious knock-offs here and there.Graphics-Literally, some of the best I've seen and I'd stake my name on them being equally as good as anything else out there.  They're smooth, polished and extremely detailed.  I love how the cartoon-esque traditionally animated cutscenes play into the story because they offer a completely immersing and unique backstory narrative.  The occasional CGI movie cutscene also is truly beautiful (and the graphics from the game itself are so detailed it doesn't look too overly apparent the CGI movies are in fact CGI), and it's apparent the developers invested a lot of money into the game.  I'd conclude graphics are as perfect as one can expect from this generation, rivaling -and at times surpassing- the equally amazing Uncharted 2.Story-It's a story we all know, even if we don't think that we do.  Dante's Inferno is rank with gore and blood.  This is presented EVERYWHERE, and the game achieves its M rating for a reason.  By far the most entertainingly, outrageously M game I've played...  It's kind of surprising developers didn't jump on the story before this because it's one that was just made for video games (or TV).  While it doesn't follow Dante's Inferno the book (naturally...) exactly, the developers really went the extra mile to create an immersing experience nonetheless, which -in my opinion- made Dante's Inferno the game better than the story we all know of from the book.Gameplay-Ah yes, this is where Dante's Inferno slides alongside GOW and where the haters hate the most about.  Third person fixed camera?  Check.  Gore?  Check.  One angry, extremely kick ass guy?  Check.  Sound like GOW?  Ok, ok, the gameplay is extremely similar to GOW and I won't deny it, however, it's still enjoyable as ever.  While some people would complain about how similar gameplay is, I don't get why they can't just enjoy the smooth controls and takedown sequences we've all come to know and love from GOW.  They're practically the same, so what's there to hate?  Just because Dante's Inferno developers partook most in this area doesn't mean the game isn't enjoyable.  Good thing they stole from the best because the best is the best for a reason.In the end, whether you're a fan or not of the title, don't let biased, erroneous judgement based solely on the fact Dante's Inferno plays almost exactly like GOW affect your judgement whether or not to pick up the game.  The only part I felt could've been left out (to DLC territory) was the malebolge parts...honestly, 10 of those are just uncalled for).  Overall, thought, Dante's Inferno is truly an epic experience with great gameplay (snatched right from the equally amazing GOW series), amazing graphics, great storytelling and epic cutscenes, and one all fans of hack-n-slash games can enjoy.  Trust me, you'll have one helluva good time!Oh, people are going to blast the game for the hilariously shocking trophy \"Bad Nanny\", but it's pretty damn awesome.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-10-2011"}

I'm more than a little sleep-deprived, and on the verge of conking out at my keyboard, but I need to urge people to pick this game up before I get some shut-eye. \"Dante's Inferno\" is one of the mostartistically refreshing games I've played in a while, and while it doesn't live up to last month's \"Bayonetta\", or the two PS2\"God of War\" entries, it still manages to entertain and surprise for the length of it's playtime.Plot: 3/5Drawn (LOOSELY) from the first part of Alighieri's epic \"Divine Comedy\", \"Dante's Inferno\" follows the titular Dante, a weary warriorwho has returned home from a crusade, only to find his beloved Beatrice slaughtered. All hope is not lost, however, and Dante seesBeatrice's soul being dragged into the depths of the underworld. Without a moment's hesitation, he leaps after her, hoping to save her from an eternity of torment. Whilst questing through the rings of the Inferno, Dante's checkered past comes back to haunt him, and he must literally battle his personal demons. Dante's story has genuine moments of intrigue, but it also comes across as the age-old, cliched\"I've gotta save my lady from having her purity stolen\" tale, and therefore loses some of it's zest.Gameplay: 4/5I'm not going to dwell too long on this, for one reason: \"Dante's Inferno\" rips off \"God of War\"'s gameplay wholesale. If you'veplayed that series, then you'll feel right at home here. Use a chained weapon to slice into demons, rapidly press buttons to opendoors, partake in timed button sequences, etc. A few unique things are added (choosing whether or not to damn souls and riding beastsare unique to this game), but for the most part Visceral Games managed to carbon-copy Sony Santa Monica's formula with success.Graphics: 5/5The art direction in this game is absolutely gorgeous. Each ring of hell has it's own unique feel, and navigating themis a blast. Climbing on walls made of people and walking on gross intestine-like floors are experiences that you won'tsoon forget. The only bad thing here are the enemies. While they are all very cool-looking, the game starts recycling thema bit too fast, and by the time you reach the circle of Anger, you will be fighting armies upon armies of clones. This isn'tbad, per se, as much as it is just lazy. Still, everything is rendered beautifully, and make this game worth playing on the PS3due it's high rendering capabilities.Sound: 3/5Music is... fine. Unremarkable, but still good. It doesn't really strike any new chords, but it's serviceable. The voice acting ispretty good, but again: unremarkable. The only noticeable things: Dante yells Beatrice's name a bit too often, and the Shades of the Inferno's utterings become grating to the nerves.Overall: 4/5In terms of gameplay, \"Dante's Inferno\" doesn't bring a whole lot of new stuff to the table. However, the art design and beautifulgraphics make up for the lack of an original combat system. Those in waiting of \"God of War III\", and those simply looking for a goodgame, will find their trip to hell to be an enjoyable thrill ride.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2010"}

It holds up to these other titles. In fact, I have played through twice and left a Fallout game hanging in favor of Fable. Without going on and on about every facet of the game, Fable 3 is just plain fun. I especially liked the Co-op play which is a big upgrade over Fable 2's cookie cutter Co-op characters. I do wish that there was more flexibility when saving progress - perhaps, like in AC Brotherhood, you could go back and retry stages. No major surprises with this one - just enjoy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2010"}

This is by far my favorite uncharted. I was really hesitant to buy it because i didn't like uncharted 2 that much (the story and the multiplayer). But this Uncharted is simply amazing!!!! I love the story and i cant stress that enough. I've played it twice already. It's so amazing but it really leaves me wondering what happened between Elana and drake. I also like the multiplayer in this installment. With UC2 i never made it past level 15. I got to bored and upset and decided to quit it since it was really annoying to me. It seemed like no matter what i did i couldn't get ahead. In this uncharted it is so much easier. Maybe its the guns or the game-play just seems like so much fun i don't know, but I'm already at level 30 and I've been playing online for 2 days straight..(well alternating between story and online) I'm loving this game!!! My only complaint is when your playing online in the other game if you struggle hard enough you can sometimes get loose, but in this one you have to have help from your teammates. Another complaint would be when i hit someone, than they hit me back, than i hit them again. after the second time i hit them they should be dead, but for some reason they can hit me a second time and than we both die.. -_-' Other than that i love uncharted 3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2011"}

If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster. While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C. Persia. And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Crono \"Mega RPG gamer\"","summary":"Great sound, atmosphere and story but extremely flawed.","reviewText":"Eternal Darkness is definitely on the list of over rated games of the game cube. Let me show you why.Graphics: These are easily some of the shoddiest graphics seen on the gamecube this generation. The game was originally developed for the N64 and released in 2002 and it definitely shows. But the characters are extremely flawed graphically, and the entire polish of the game is unquestionably rough. Games like Super Smash Brothers Melee and Metroid Prime were released before or right around the same time and are still some of the best looking games around, but Eternal Darkness certainly fails here and it's one of the reasons why it loses in the scary factor. 6/10Sound: The sound is terrific. From the voice acting to the various effects, this game has it nailed. Nuff said. 10/10Gameplay: Terrible is the best way to put it. One major focus of this game is exploration, but it mainly consists of running by objects and seeing if you can press the B button. Placing objects is even more archaic since you constantly have to return to the menu. Easily the weakest element of this game is the combat. Absolutely horrific. Each character gets one decent melee weapon to use and it uses the same A-A-A button combination attack. The finishing move hardly differs, and combat gets old very quickly due to the weak targeting and the lack of enemies. The only enemy you will be fighting is a skeleton in 5 different colors. Mars the entire game. 4/10Story: Superb. The story unrolls through 11 different characters through different time periods. It's very engrossing, but they should have shortened the number of characters and made it so that the game's best ending could be seen in one playthrough. Only the most dedicated will sit through 3 playthroughs of this game. 8/10Scariness: Eternal Darkness, contrary to what many would have you believe really isn't that scary. If skeletons are scary then you might actually be scared. If not, you'll probably laugh. 6/10Overall: A pretty big disappointment and not worth your time.

Burns \"Slackjaw\"","summary":"Kinect from a hardcore gamers' perspective (though self-professed)","reviewText":"Thank you for reading my review and I hope it helps you get off the fence on this great item.Being an owner of roughly every console since the Atari 2600 (yes I'm in my late 30's) I could not help but give my review of this system and a couple of games we picked up along with the Kinect system. I remember standing at a best buy for hours before buying the WII on launch day. It was a fresh concept with a new direction and revolutionary in what it did and how it did it. We enjoyed it but with the lack of strong first person titles it got old. But because it was revolutionary it endured and was a smash success despite it's lack of many quality games (yes it had great experiences) but not deep gameplay (though Twighlight Princess was a great game and showed the potential of the system) Here we are about 4 years later and with only minor exceptions the WII has found success by catering to children and the casual crowd along with providing some excellant fitness type concepts. I bring all of this up because it leads me to the purpose of this review.As a gamer that enjoys COD and Halo along with all of the other staple franchise properties out there I found myself on the fence about the MOVE and KINECT systems.  I've learned that not every concept works and sometimes a company is just trying to keep up with the Jones' rather than making a product that it plans to support and grow it's participant base. Clearly both Sony and Microsoft have been working on this technology for years but facts are facts... The Move is just not revolutionary in any way. It is a refined (yes very refined) Wii experience. The graphics are better by far and the company will put it's weight behind the product (as Sony always does) and likely it will have success of it's own.But owning all systems and having put the Wii through its paces why would I buy a better looking Wii?  The Controller is silly looking but even getting passed that, what does it do different than the Wii? We can argue graphics all day long and it is a valid arguement but seriously... It's a better version of something we have already seen and experienced. Until it does ANYTHING I haven't experienced before it's a pass for me. I've tried it in stores on demo. I have not bought it. I realize that this makes my arguement less credible as I don't own one. I have played it and tried out several games. It's the Wii on steroids. The games are what you might expect... First generation and meant to show its functionality. But it does nothing of note that my Wii doesn't. Being late to the party even if you refined the product is just not that exciting... yet.  I say yet because this could change with a press release or an addition to the functionality of the system.Which brings me to the Kinect...  I have a wife that games with me (plays Halo along with more interactive games(rock band, dj hero, Lips) I have 3 children- ages 10, and twins that are 3 years old.  So my gaming is not exclusive to my own tastes. I might buy Call of Duty Black Ops and Kirby in the same checkout. So I evaluate and research this thoroughly before making a jump to buy anything. I was going to pass on both the MOVE and KINECT but I have friends in the gaming industry and they told me that I should NOT pass up on the Kinect and further I should buy it now as it was likely the supply would be in question by xmas. So after several trips to best buy and Eb games I bit the bullet on a reccomendation and bought it.IT does not look like much. It is a bit pricey at retail 150.00 at EB Games. But you get a game along with it which really makes them equal in price (sort of) For example (and I priced this hardcore)Move kit is $99 (tricky part to Sony's offering is the following) It comes with one contoller, the eye toy,  and a game (no navigation controller).  IF you want to play multiplayer you will have to buy another controller at around $60.00 and an additional Navigation Controller) total would be around $230 and you have just one game to play so go spend another $50 on that.  Kind of tricky if you ask me. The Move was the lower cost option I heard at one time. But this is clearly a falsehood. I felt the same trickery when I bought the Wii.  Classic controllers versus Wii remote? Had to buy another controller for your friends and then there was the possibility the controller would break and you might have to buy another one (or a new TV). My kids tore one of them up in around a month. So there is an upkeep involved in keeping the \"car\" on the road with both of these systems.That's why I bit on the Kinect...  NO CONTROLLER!!!!!!  NO need to buy any more of em. No need to charge them or to replace them. I guess you just have to worry about breaking an arm or a leg because YOU are the controller.I didn't believe it could work. I had heard of Project Natal and thought that this was the next generation in systems. But Microsoft- for all of the delays and the fact that they were the last system to make it to retail- was simply biding their time. This is revolutionary. At $150 you get the Kinect Sensor and one game (kinect adventures)The game is Ok but is more to show some of the things that the system is capable of. It was easy to take it out of the box and plug it in. It was strangely small and unexciting at first look. You might even think to yourself... Really? $150 for this? But once you get the cords attached and start it up (and it's simple to plug it in and get going) you will be met with a stange feeling. The menus are navigated by voice command and hand gestures.(AN IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT SPACE REQUIREMENTS)!!!!!!!!You need to have space on this. Don't believe the reviews that say you don't. Sure you can make it work with 4 feet of distance from your Tv but You need more like 6-10 feet to get the most out of it. And height plays a factor. I'm short 5'6 and so is my wife but we had a friend over who is 6'4 and he needed about an extra foot for the sensor to fully pick him up. So after spending several hours rearranging the entire room to make it work we were ready to go. But keep this in mind- or you, like me, will be sitting there with an opened kinect but no space to play it. That can be a frustrating and tiring reality so plan for it and set the room up in advance.Once the space is good you are ready to go. There is an instuctional video that walks you through the motions and voice commands. Good to watch it even if tempted to speed passed it. Soon you are in control and you move menus like in the movie (Minority Report when Tom Cruz is using the computer with his hands. It's not that fast but it works that way.The interface is top notch and you can see why the Xbox Live interface was updated prior to launch for the experience and it works. You can use voice to load the game and connect back to various menus. It is purely magical for a 30 something to see the evolution and what this new product could do for gaming. It is a breath of fresh air.The Games-----We bought Sports, Dance Central, and Harry Potter (which is not a full Kinect game (buyer beware))Kinect sports is great fun. Track and Field is just too much fun. We tried the bowling and a couple other games. The best part to us was not the games (which were alot of fun to play) but the video after the games (the recaps) Gone is the avatar you watched while you jumped the hurdles or threw the Javelin.. In it's place is live video of you and your friends looking like dorks while participating mixed with avatar highlights. IT WORKS!!!!! SO funny!!!! We all were ROLLING on the floor as grown men made the most stupid faces and actions. It was hyserical!!! I am not exagerating. The Sports game is absolutely worth the price and great intro to the concepts you use in games. I give the sports title a solid 8/10 for the game itself and a 9/10 for the fun factor.Dance Central was also great fun. It is a one player game (somewhat missleading but I'd done my research on it) but there are times in game where people not playing can jump in and freestyle. The lack of multiplayer was but a small problem though as you can switch off and will want to if you are doing it right. The motion capture works FANTASTICLY on BOTH of the prior mentioned games and is only very, very, slightly laggy. I think the games individually dictate this problem. Some are going to be better then others at using the technology but do your research and stay away from the dogs (ie..  Sonic, fighting etc.) Yes there are bad launch titles much like every other system. Dance Central teaches you dance moves and counts your calories as you dance. IT is a work out and you will feel stupid making the motions but it will make you sweat and laugh and it also has the real video mixed with the avatars actions. Good stuff  and a solid 8-9/10. There are around 35 songs and more for download if you want to expand the song library but the opening titles will keep you coming back to perfect the moves. This is the best launch title I have played for the kinect.I have not tried other games yet but will update as I do. I spent too much time moving chairs and couches to make it fit my man cave. It was worth the effort as it is a magical feeling when you stand in your living room using your very EMPTY hand to make things happen. I don't see me getting tired of it and who else has this technology? Well, considering the MOVE is out and the Wii is overexposed it will likely be some time before the competition launches there own version. They will have to if they want to compete on the cutting edge!A Great family purchase. Maybe not for the hardcore gamer yet but it likely will. IF not... it's still pretty cool.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2010"}

I really like this remote. It's a great replacement for when I'm watching movies and things on my xbox. I wanted to point out that the remote was never advertised for regular set top, dvr or TV control outside what they included in it:TV controls include power on/off, volume up/down, mute and TV input.Live TV, if provided on the Xbox 360 by your TV service provider, can also be controlled with the Xbox 360 Media Remote.You can find these wherever the product is described or sold, so it was never advertised to control the channels or dvr. Your tv has to come through the xbox, which a couple services already do, but mostly this is a larger feature that is coming within the next 2 months. My only real complaint is that it takes a bit more pointing to get it to signal the xbox, but its never more than lifting my arm a few inches. It makes me think the receiver might me slightly recessed or have a smaller window in the faceplate than other devices.Definitely worth the 20 I paid for it.

The game has a in game tutorial, the inventory and skill screens are easy to navigate once you get into it and the controls are very easy.  I like the ability to dodge by flicking the right stick so you can easily avoid attacks while still being able to beat on your opponents.  Also it does a Borderlands where more people are in the game, there are more enemies, more danger, and of course more loot.  So it encourages multiplayer joining.  I chose the monk to be my first play through, though the other characters look fun, especially the deamon hunter.  The only thing I have to say is they should have allowed you to customize the characters so that way if you play with other people and there are two of the same class you can tell who is who a lot easier.  Only played an hour into it, but I can tell this will get as much play as Borderlands does and the multiplayer is a good change over the glut of FPS that is out there these days.  A must play for anyone who remembers the game, or wants to try it from the PC.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2013"}

The initial reception to this new installment in the Fatal Frame series was good enough to pique my interest.Fatal Frame II tells the story of Mio and Mayu, 14-year-old twins who become lost and find themselves caught in a mysterious village inhabited by ghosts and memories of the past.  As they seek a way out, Mio gradually discovers that there is a more sinister reason for their entrapment.  Armed only with a 'camera obscura' that can absorb the evil spirits her search for a way out becomes more and more desperate.This is a puzzle and fight game, and in normal mode the puzzles predominate and the fight scenes are pretty mild.  I wouldn't call the game scary, there is little that is truly horrible.  It does have a truly spooky atmosphere and will get a few good jumps out of a player whose attention wanders a bit too much.For the most part, I enjoyed the game.  Not just the play itself, either.  The setting, an old Japanese village, is quite interesting on its own.  I learned quite a bit about Japanese domestic architecture while playing.  The village is like a museum piece, and there is quite a bit to see besides the game itself - if only the lighting was just a bit brighter.Two things did irritate me.  One is that the twins are very unlikely heroines.  Mayu is intentionally weak and waif-like, but Mio isn't much better.  It is easy to get frustrated with a character who is generally at a lost, and whose fastest pace is more like a shuffle than a run.The second irritation is that this is one of those long winding passage to the last boss games.  The lack of a save point close to the last battle means repeatedly spending several minutes tediously walking Mio through dark caves, followed by 10 seconds of being summarily slaughtered - until you finally figure out how to win.  For me that is an exercise in patience that adds nothing to the game.Despite that, the game is worth playing.  I'm a bit surprised at its 17+ rating.  Most of the violence is being done to you, and there is very little blood.  This is something you will have to decide for yourself, but I would have given it a 13+ rating.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2003"}

It's been at least as immersive and engaging as Baldur's Gate 2 or Planescape: Torment.  The developers accomplished what they wanted to; to make a game where one can do as he/she pleases.  There are countless ways to play through this game!  Playing through as a thief type character is by far different than playing through as a more combat oriented character.  The world is huge, and it takes hours upon hours to explore.  There's so much that if you don't stop and turn around sometimes, you're bound to miss the enterance to an anscesteral tomb or a smugglers cave.Now about some technical things.  I'm running this game on a P4, 2.53 ghz, 768mb PC2700 memory, GeForce4 4200 Ti GPU.  The game runs great at 1024x768 resolution with full shadows and distance. Since the graphics are a little dated, and I more than excede the recommended system, I've chosen to install sevaral mods (which is another great way to keep this game fresh!).  Most notably, the \"Better Bodies\", \"Better Heads\" and \"Morrowind Comes Alive.\"  The first 2 make the humanoid people look less blocky and more realistic.  The Morrowind Comes Alive adds many more NPC's (generic travelers, to ones that have something to offer; be it goods to sell or hostile bandits with nice looot) at random places, giving the game even more of an immersion factor.Over all, I highly recommend this game.  In fact, I bought it to keep me from wanting to play World of Warcraft, and it's worked!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2006"}
{"product_name":"B002TDIEDG","description":"","reviewerName":"Charles \"Altered Confusion\"","summary":"Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective Review","reviewText":"Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective is a DS game in which you play the spirit of a dead individual who has the ability to manipulate inanimate objects around you. You will quickly meet Ray, a desk lamp, well a spirit like you who is fascinated with inhabiting a lamp. You only have until sunrise to figure out why you were killed, who killed you, and answer the most important question of all, who are you.Graphically you're going to get to experience a comic book type style. You'll see that some characters are a bit over the top, and if they have blue skin, they're probably bad guys. There are other characters interacting with the world of the game and it definitely gives you an anime sort of vibe, with their models. The game is 2D.The sounds of the game aren't too impressive, the game can be played as well with the sound off as with the sound on. Sure you'll miss the stimulating sound of a phone ring, but I think you can brave through it.The controls are going to be all about the touch screen of the DS. You're going to be tapping the Ghost Mode button to allow your character to move from object to object. You'll also have the trick button which will perform the objects action, if it has any.This game is all about timing, and patience. If you try to rush through a level, with out a FAQ, you might find that you missed a step and now you're going to have to let the scene play out before you can try again. You're going to find that you're going to be stopping the murders of several individuals, one who seems to keep getting killed, but she's you're only hope, so you're going to have to continuously bring her back. That's right, there's a way to witness death, other than yours, and then rewind time to 4 minutes before it happens, and try to change the outcome. If you succeed the story moves on, if you fail, well you'll get the option of trying the level over again.Now to keep you from flying all over the level you'll notice that you're only able to stretch your soul so far from an object, so you'll also have to find ways of using an objects tricks to get you from point A to point B, and change the course of time.To be completely honest the first couple of levels are intriguing, you're going to want to figure out what is going on, and you're going to find that there's a lot to the levels. The problem is that there comes a time in the game where you're going to hit certain levels where unless you trial and error it about 15 times you're not going to be able to breeze through it. There's a lot of near misses that you'll find in the game that will cause you to have to replay a level over and over again. There's also the dialog bubbles. The first time through you're going to have to suffer through what the game thinks is the correct speed for displaying the bubbles, which slows down the flow of the game to a crawl, and personally severally pissed me off. Thankfully the second time around you are allowed to hold down a button and the dialog will fast forward through.For a novelty game this might be an interesting pick up. I'd really recommend borrowing it from a friend or renting the game before buying. Then again if you do that you can probably beat the game in a couple of sittings. Either way this game misses the mark, even if it is ever so slightly. This game gets a 6.7 out of 10.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

They've simply improved upon some things from the first KOTOR. Some things, such as the graphics, seemed to work alot smoother. Also some of the character's individual stories were rather interesting.Now for the cons to this game. Good game, but it leaves you hanging. From what I understand, the game was rushed out for a holiday release and due to that fact, it lacks alot of explanations for the storyline. The first KOTOR was very in-depth and told you why Revan became the way he had. KOTOR 2, on the other hand, just lets you hang at the end. Another problem was that at certain points, the game seemed to act like it was overloaded and all your graphics would slow to nothing. That seemed to happen quite alot during combat. Also having the game freeze totally (and needing a restart) wasn't all that uncommon.While it's not a great game, the game will keep you interesting for about 30hrs at least. I recommend it if you can find it on sale, but don't go blow $40 on it. $20 is alot better really. If you want to take a chance without wasting much, borrow it or rent it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2006"}

It was about 7 years ago when I first got this I was around 13 , I was still living in the Kingdom Hearts 1 world I mean it was so epic , creative and lovable ...however we enter Kingdom Hearts 2 ..whole nother ball-game.Everything from the controlls plot dialogue to soras voice changing pissed me off I was honestly really depressed lol it was as if this game was the grown up version of my once lovable classic...however time since then has passed and as I matured I ;earned to appreciate the creativity and slight unappealing changes.These are MY Pros and Cons . Hope they can give you some idea on what to expectCons-1.Alright so if you are buying this directly after youve played kingdom hearts 1 your in for a rude awakening why you ask? because technically in the Kingdom Hearts saga this would be the 3rd story taking place , meaning events in kingdom hearts chain of memories (previously available only on the gameboy but now on ps2 aswell) happen before this so your going to be very very lost believe me and that right there will be irksome because without understanding the importance of chain of memories you cant connect to the game.2.The game isnt as cheery and laid back as the first one this time its more dull i hate to say slow paced and boring but again only at the start , ten times more if once again you dont know what already went on in Chain of Memories3.The camera angle wont be the same as Kingdom Hearts 1 , its not close like it was before thats eh whatever not a bigdeal iguess4.Depending on how you adjust and if you have an open mind the \"reaction commands\" will tick you off , when I first played with these I got very upset how it made everything easier and made one button do basiclly everything for me , there was no different button combos only the triangle for reaction commands and they all differed on enemy or situation , again ehh5.Soras voice changed! ugh took me a while to get used to that but got over it6.Its really easy I mean even if its your first walkthrough you could probably dominate in proud mode ...if leveled up correctly at the right times , which doesnt matter because once defeating a boss or mini boss you automaticlly level up , kinda defeats the purpose of trying hard.5.Hardly revolves around disney anymore so watch out for that theyll mostly be focused on the new baddies of the game and im not talking about malefecent (however you spell it) she seems like a puppet next to these guys6.No more long term disney dialogue , some sentences are taken out of a movie and placed in the game and it shows esspecially in the pride lands (lion king world)7.Drive gaunge depleats 2 fast and takes forever to restore , even if you get the ability upgrades they still take a lot of time to reload and depleate rather quick8.The magic gaunge ughh dont get me started , well basiclly now aero is an attack not defence your only defensive spell is reflect and you gotta time it right for it to be effective which suck because *spoiler* youll need to master it by the end to beat a boss9.This is another problem with the magic but i got over it , fire is now a swirl sorta circle thing around your body I cant explain it sounds cool well it isnt at first maybe towards the end with the full upgrade (firaga) and cure consumes all hp =]..great..10.Keyblades dont excite much like the first game but hey thats just me11.Summons are useless,short and deal hardly any damage at all , genies,,ehh ok better in this game at least and stich is passable for his defensive help he'll provide you (little though still can make a difference at time)Those are all the Cons I can think of at the moment now ProsPros-1.Keyblades will give you different abilities each , this means that if you dont have enough ap for lets say defender (defense  increase in a critical state) you will have it by equiping the keyblade that has it as a side ability2.MP gaunge automaticlly refills and once you get the upgrades itll much faster unlike the drive gaunge3.The drive gaunge forms are awesome and fun!..while they last.4.If you figure the story out you'll be hooked unless you didnt like the direction they started taking in chain of memories5.Reaction commands are fun at times6.Special Combos though they seem utterly useless at times and a waste of magic since they absorb all of it , they can be cool and effective example you can a sword slice and dice blitz moves with the reaction command with aladdin , a swirling attack finishing with a roar that attacks a wide radious of enemies with simba..etc7.You can swap party members out whenever you feel the need say you start out with beast and goofy and you need a healer all of a sudden , quick swap goofy with donald just like that8.The abilities are really good Id say better then the first9.Youll see the true antagonist of the Kingdom Hearts saga10.The new baddies of the group called the \"organization 13\" are kind of cool i guess kind of fun to fight someone other then a heartless a random monster or disney character for once11.This is for all the die hard fans and people with emotions , the begining intro is freaking epic like simple and clean the intro is called \"sanctuary\" and it even shows little clips of soras journey through the castle in chain of memories that led to this moment (though it still wont explain much youll still be puzzled but duh thats obvious)So Id say if your ready to get a little final fantyish and step out of disney cheeryness for abit pick this up at the price its at now you cant go wrongThe 3ds dream drop distance is a mix of this and kingdom hearts 1 but youll hate getting it if you havent played this one yet ! trust me on this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2013"}

Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo-Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$110 recommended retail price for a console with two controllers, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Robert Evans \"Robert\"","summary":"Amazing Console with amazing games..","reviewText":"The N64 had some of the best games on the planet and eventhough N64 was a great system it ended too quickly cause of the Gamecube.

Graphic wise the game is top notch, these are some of the best graphics to be seen on the PS2 yet.  Character models look like they're film counterparts and the animation is silky smooth.  Slowdown is minimal at best, even when there are hordes of enemies on screen at once.  Control is tighter than I could have ever expected, the easy targeting system and easy to execute chain attacks are very well done and simple to execute.  The action moves at a very fast pace, so fast that you might be able to finish the game in one or two sittings; this alone is the game's biggest flaw but there are a few extras.  Judging by your level by level performance, you can unlock extra features like a survival mode and even see video interviews with members of the film's cast.

Featuring detailed environments and complicated new battle mechanisms, this game demands a different kind of perspective than the first-person shooters from the original Halo series. You'll need to uncover the hidden strengths and weaknesses of each unit and play them to your tactical advantage, and that's just the beginning.UNSC: Be Part of a Legendary ConflictThe story opens with UNSC forces retaking the planet Harvest from the Covenant. At your disposal -- should you choose to take command of UNSC forces -- will be everything from a corps of highly-trained Marines to the Warthogs, Scorpions, and Hornets you'll need for air and land attacks. You'll take stock of the map and decide between holding your ground or advancing on enemy strongholds, all while trying to navigate the local terrain and outsmart Covenant forces. And when you need something extra to tip the tide in your favor, UNSC leaders can provide you with the ability to mobilize highly specialized units or call the Spirit of Fire vessel for support from above.Covenant: A Capable, Playable Enemy FactionThat's right, Covenant is playable in this corner of the Halo universe. This alliance of alien species has manipulated advanced technology, firepower, and tactical prowess into a powerful force that is engaged in a Genocidal war against human race, having branded humans as heretics. With the ability to play as these tough, alien fighters, you'll have advanced shield technology, the modular Citadel at the heart of Covenant's colonizing power, and, of course, the iconic Scarab attack vehicle at your disposal, adding a whole new dimension to your strategic warfare. The Scarab is a terrifying military vehicle crafted from heavy mining equipment. And with a mining laser that delivers massive damage across battlefields large and small, turrets for taking on air attacks, and the ability to clamber over any terrain, what's not to love about commanding Scarabs instead of fighting against them?Developed Exclusively for Xbox 360Most console RTS games are adapted from existing PC games, which can make their controls bulky or awkward, butHalo Warshas been developed for Xbox 360 from the ground up. This means the controls are sensitive, intuitive, and easy-to-operate in the midst of battle. And the UI is just as intuitive, so whether you're managing a unit of marines or a deadly machine, you can focus on creating a battle strategy instead of worrying about how to overcome a clumsy controller.No matter which faction you choose to play as, you can test your skills against those of other players in online skirmishes that allow up to six players with the New Xbox Experience through Xbox LIVE.","reviewerName":"Doc","summary":"A Halo Experience","reviewText":"In my opinion Halo Wars is Highly underrated.

The story is interesting, though a bit convoluted at times.  However the setting, the feel, the way they tell the story, all feel really good.  That's the high point of Alan Wake.  The story was enough to get me through the game, and have a decent time with it.Alan Wake's biggest problem is the way it plays, and the endless forest sections of the game that have you on a fixed path.  Time and time again the same enemies jump out at you, you fight them, rinse and repeat.  You fight the same battle, against pretty much the same enemies, in forests that all feel the same, time after time after time, from the beginning of the game until the end.  It gets really old.To make matters worse, the controls feel off, and the combat mechanic feels goofy too.  So the worst part of the game is the shooting and the forest corridors, and it's what you'll spend most of your time doing in this game.  The parts where you're indoors feel great and are interesting, but those sections aren't a big part of the game.This game left me wanting for what I had hoped it would be when I first saw it several years ago.  This game and Fable II were the two games (unreleased at the time) that convinced me I need an XBox 360, and both were a huge letdown to me.  I'm VERY glad I bought a 360 though, as there are plenty of great games that have kept me more than satisfied with the system.  It's just too bad that the two I was most excited for turned out to be duds.I read a reviewer that said that Alan Wake was like the first Uncharted, a good foundation which lead to Uncharted 2, which is one of the best games of this gen.  I'm not sure I agree with that.  I think Uncharted one's core game mechanics were fun, as well as having a superb story, it just lacked some technical polish and a bit of variety.  Alan Wake has the technical polish down, and the story down, but they have a long ways to go in terms of designing levels, and core gameplay mechanics.  I'd still love to see an Alan Wake 2, but they need to go back to the drawing board and spice the level design up, and make the core mechanics of the game feel better.  If you're going to have people shooting a gun through most of the game, it had better feel right, and satisfying.My advice, if this game looks cool to you, as it did to me, pick it up at $20.  For $20 you'll have a good time with it, and you'll have the right expectations.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2010"}

Wake is able to sleep again, but after he meets a mysterious woman, he begins to have terrible nightmares. As he puts these nightmares on paper for a new book, he soon notices that all the things that happen in his book are coming true right before his eyes.Using cinematic effects and technology such as real-time lighting, shadows and reflections, you'll be treated to a game that is oozing with atmosphere and able to invoke an emotional response from the player. The realistic environment features real-time weather and light changes that effect the game play for a remarkably immersive experience.Explore an Entire TownThe town of Bright Falls is 100 square kilometers, and players will be able to roam through this incredibly detailed area any way they like, roaming the town or wandering out to the lakes, forest, satellite towns, and more. The game gives the player goals, but how he chooses to go about completing them is up to him. Clues are scattered throughout the town, and solving mysteries will require players to pay close attention to the little details.Intense CombatIn addition to solving puzzles and exploration, the game also pushes players into serious action and combat; when night comes, creatures will take their best shots at Alan, and you'll have to be quick with strategy as well as weapons to beat them back.Alan Wake presents an unusual and new gaming experience that features a riveting, multi-layered story while giving the player the ability to freely roam a giant environment. It supports Dolby Digital sound.","reviewerName":"Michael","summary":"A sleeper hit","reviewText":"I am maybe one or two episodes into the game after four hours of playing in total, and I can with confidence say that Alan Wake is definetly a good investment of both of your time and money if you enjoy suspenseful games. This game doesn't rely on jump scares, which it does have occasionally, but rather builds up tension through its eerie atmosphere which is very well made. The game has lots of small detail, and pausing a minute to look around the environment and see the waterfalls, trees, and foggy area is a very nice sight.I haven't finished the game so I can't say how great the story is nor how long it is either, but so far the story is good and not cheesy at all. It exploits the fear of many when they were younger - the darkness, and how it slowly poses over everyone Alan Wake meets in a small town. It's brought some indeed really unique and disturbing story twists, which can be difficult to swallow at times.. However, for the sake of character and game development, there's small hidden items scattered around like script pages, radios, and TVs, which reward you for exploration by helping explain and foreshadowing events. I highly recommend finding the time to watch, read, or listen to anything you find as it contributes to the tale and makes the story and overall feel much more creepy.The game is rather linear but it does have optional/hidden areas that reward exploration that include supply chests or as mentioned earlier other things that push the story further. I highly recommend taking your time and trying to find everything as it not only helps you but can build up some great tension that further makes the game creepier. And also, take your time. Don't rush this game, it's a highly atmospheric game that needs to be played a little day to stomach and make the game more enjoyable.Combat is also unique as you'll always need a flashlight to break away the darkness that your enemies have as a shield. After it's a gone a few blasts from your weapon will finish them off. There are no melee weapons so you'll have to conserve ammo and find different ways to kill the monsters, which there are: Such as blinding them until they fall off cliffs and such. Since your flashlight can run out of battery and has to recharge this makes for some very interesting gameplay. You'll be dodging axes and chainsaws with the stylish dodge several times, which makes the game intense and fun.I have not encountered many glitches apart from the standard map glitch that's bound to happen (invisible walls in corners and such), and the only thing I didn't like is the camera. It's convenient that it automatically switches from left/right view in tight situations, but sometimes more than often this can get annoying. But nothing game breaking/completely frustrating.I was also very pleased to see my Xbox 360 new copy came with a free DLC code. Not sure which one but either way it's a great value.If you like atmospheric games with non-cheesy plots and intense action, with rewarding exploration, Alan Wake is your game! I highly recommend trying it at night with volume on and lights off for the maximum experience.-- UPDATE --I just finished the game last night. No spoilers to share, but that was indeed a very good game. The story was very complex and extremely detailed compared to other games. It was kind of like the Matrix, pretty complicated. The gameplay generally stays the same except for a few larger areas that you need a vehicle to cross. I also had much fun trying to find all collectibles. In the end, I found all manuscripts, hidden radios, hidden TVs, but 29/30 chests, and 97/100 coffee cups. It took me thirty hours but this is only because I did LOTS of exploring, checking every corner, checking everything for collectibles. On  rushed playthrough it could maybe last up to ten hours, but that's not how to play a game like this. If you're getting Alan Wake, take your time, play it a little at a time at night to take it all in and properly understand it, and to make sure it doesn't get boring because the game can feel repetitive at times. But overall, great game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2013"}

The graphics have been upgraded and I didn't find anything wrong with that part. The gameplay is very simple and easy to pickup but parts can become frustrating at times because you have to go all the way back to the checkpoint when you die. Most bosses are quite simple and easy but the Aparoid queen packs quite a punch. I'd give this game's replay value an ok but not great. I wish there were more single player levels.

Fact is, Nintendo forced Sony and Microsoft to adapt (Sony's Playstation Move and Microsoft's Kinect are proofs of that)because it offered a totally different gaming experience.Earlier this year Nintendo released a black version of the Wii(white was the only color previously available) and now they release a new red bundle with an additional game (New Super Mario Bros). This red Wii doesn't really offer anything new but it looks fantastic and would be a great purchase for the gamer you know (or yourself maybe?).The Wii innovates with its controls as you really make the move,best example would be Wii sports included with the Wii,it makes your gamer at home do some exercises while having some fun.Nintendo Wii can appeal to nearly anyone from the 3 year old kid to the seventy-eight years old grandmother.Its a unique system to say the least that is fun and original as well as full of options for example some games have you play with the nunchuk controller, some without and you play some games with you Wii remote on the side etc. plus you can buy a classic controller as well.The Live Channel allows you to buy classic games from the NES,SNES,N64 which adds to the experience of the console.Playing a classic game like Super Mario 64 on a the Wii console is great, the controls are better and the games do look better.You have to buy point cards to buy games but its worth the bucks you will spend,the library of games available continues to grow. The points needed to buy each games varies, for instance, a game can be 400 or 1000 points. You can also download channels for games (such as the Mario Kart channel), go on the internet, have the weather channel and much more. It's also nice to create your own Mii(me) an be able to use your video self in some games. You can create tons of Miis based on your family, friends and celebrities which makes creating fun!Zelda Twilight Princess proves to be a best selling game of the Wii along with New Super Mario Bros, Super Smash Brawl, Rayman Raving Rabids, Wario Ware Smooth Moves and a few others. The Wii has great and creative games for everyone which is why it's so popular, it appeals to practically anyone. The games found on the Wii are fun and original games making great use of the controllers. The included Wii Sports is creative and fun and for a game that comes with a console it proves to be a winner,with games like Wii Boxing, Tennis, Golf, Baseball and Bowling that you never get tired of (almost),it's a great party game.New Super Mario will please new and old fans of Mario and is an excellent return to the 2D style of side-scrolling games.For the older gamer seeking more mature games, there are nearly no any mature games(17+)which the PS3 and 360 support,that type of game while not Nintendo's targeted audience is lacking to the Wii.GRAPHICS:Cannot compare to the PS3 or XBOX 360 at all.The graphics are a little better than the Gamecube to be honest but don't match other consoles and it could be considered a minus if you're big into graphics.The graphics of the Wii are simple but cool,I quite like them actually, but if you're looking for amazing visuals this is not your buy.The Nintendo Wii is a fun,innovative and easy to get used to.A must-buy for anyone,even if its a second console.Easily the choice for partys and multiplayer gaming.The Wii is not a DVD or a Blu-Ray player and it doesn't have the best graphics but it is surely the console that is the most fun out there yet. This bundle makes it an even better purchase with this nice looking red Wii, the inclusion of Wii Sports as always and a copy of New Super Mario Bros, definitely one of the Wii's best game. 5/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2010"}

GT4 was infamous for its high difficulty and questionable car selection. However, the series is known as the best looking racing simulator, and the one with the most realistic driving physics. GT5 has all of that, but problems lie in other areas, but more on those later.The first things you will notice is the new menu which is laid out better instead of pins on a map. You will notice a used car menu (which tracks mileage now), a better maintenance shop, the ability to generate a unique user profile for online races, and now seasonal events. Seasonal events are updated quarterly and feature endless amounts of races so when you finish the disc content you don't get bored. Even tuning your vehicle is more user-friendly thanks to better descriptions and better visual guides. Polyphony really polished up the menus so everything looks more streamlined and not so cluttered and confusing. You know right where something is and how to get to it without referring to guides or searching around.Buying cars is really fun thanks to the huge selection and in-depth descriptions and history of each car. There are hundreds of them so car aficionados won't get bored or yawn at the selection. A few new car dealers are Maserati and Lamborghini to name a couple. There are a lot of selections that can cost millions, so you should stick to the used dealerships until your credits are in the millions. The car selection is varied and strong so I have no complaints here.When you actually race the physics are excellent, and the new cockpit view is amazing. However, only premium vehicles have high-resolution textures and a cockpit view. The rest of the cars look like complete crap and have no cockpit view. Why do this? I have no idea, but it looks tacky and unfinished and is a real blow to the game. The cars that do look good look photo realistic and the cockpit views are just amazing. Needles move on the dash, and even the rear window and seats are shown in the car. Driving the cars has a great feeling, but of course you will have to fine tune them to get some to drive properly. If you aren't a racing simulator fan you are going to hate this because it can take hours to get a single car to drive just right. Tuning the cars is very easy to do thanks to the clean menus, but if you add too much power to most cars they won't drive right anymore.Slip streaming has been added to the game, and driving properly such as gas goosing, late braking, and everything else has never been more important thanks to the updated physics. Most of the races are just challenging enough that if you focus and drive right you will win. I rarely had races where I was blown off by the competition, but being able to see the PP (Performance Points) that the other cars have helps a lot too. If you feel you need to tune something on the fly you can now do so in the race menu instead of having to completely quit the race. If you race it for long enough you will need to do engine overhauls and chassis alignments now thanks to the new physics system.While shopping for cars and racing them is fun, the first ever online mode, photo mode, and new community features are a plus as well. Museum cards can be acquired by logging in every day, new paint jobs can be acquired by winning vehicles, and there are just so many little things added that it all adds up to make a big difference in the overall experience. Winning licenses, however, is just as big of a pain as ever before, but the new special events are a nice touch such as NASCAR racing, go carts, and even Top Gear Rally events. Polyphony really tried adding variety to the game and it shows indefinitely.There are a lot of little problems with the game that add up to really frustrate you. For example when I select a race that has requirements why can't it take me to the dealerships to buy that car if its country specific or a specific drive train. Why do I have to memorize the flag symbol in order to know which dealership belongs to which country? I've already mentioned the cockpit and low resolution standard cars issue. Why are there still loading times between every menu and how come they can be so long? Some tracks look really ugly and weren't updated at all with cardboard cutout buildings and flat grass textures. Why are the graphics all over the place? There are so many questions as to why these issues are present, but I guess we will never know.With some other nice features like custom soundtracks, a huge selection of supported wheels, true 1080p visuals, 3D and Eye support. GT5 has so many options, features, and a huge car selection that will make any car fan drool. With exotics to classics you will find something to love about this game just remember to focus on driving and you will win that dream car.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

The farthest I've played was Doom 3 for movement-based shooting game. Quake 4 and Time Crisis Razing Storm failed to get me far into the game.I played this game with Move, using both Motion and Navigation Controller on the new PS3 Sharp Shooter gun shell. After adjustment period, I was able to really get into the Campaign mode. It's not overly difficult in the normal mode, as I was able to get about half way through the game in about 4-6 hours (with plenty of time to figure things out), and about 12 hours total to finish. This was possible because after getting killed, it would get me to continue without repeating too much already-conquered scenes (unlike Time Crisis Razing Storm). This is very important for me as I just don't have all day playing games. The repeated scenes are more if I decided to quit and reload the game to play at another time. It's also great that it can guide me on mission, so I'm not spending hours in a maze looking for ways in, around, or out (read: Doom and Quake).The graphics are very good (not super sharp at GT5 Prologue level). There are a lot of animated stuff going on including flying debris, snow flakes, multiple explosions/gun fires, moving soldiers and vehicles, and damages/bullet marks to structures and wounds for people. I can easily see the trade off there.The game overall so far is quite immersive, especially with the gun shell and move controllers. The story line is understandable for someone like me never played previous KillZone games. A great measurement of interest into the game - even with heavier-than-usual equipments (2 controllers + gun shell) - is that I don't feel the weight after few hours because the game is so involved!Have not tried the online multiplayer yet and will review that when I do.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2011"}

{"product_name":"B004ML44Y6","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"Visceral and violent...a sadistic fantasy come to life","reviewText":"As I played through The Darkness II, I kept having flashbacks to my youth, when I was completely obsessed with over-the-top, bloody horror movies that depicted violence and carnage without any sort of filter.  Taking control of Jackie Estacado and guiding him through this journey of insanity and horror feels like one of those movies come to life. It's visceral, intense, and definitively not a game for younger gamers (I'm actually surprised it got by with an M for Mature rating).  But for those of us gamers who have fantasized about having the most powerful and sadistic type of superpower, and using it to lay waste to the scum of the earth, it doesn't get any better than The Darkness II.At it's core, The Darkness II is a very competent first person shooter.  The guns in the game are awesome, loud, and powerful.  The shooting and controls all feel very good the way a modern FPS should.  The Darkness II's twist is that you also have control of an evil power, which is known as the Darkness.  This is manifested in several of the game's mechanics, most prominently the two demon arms that protrude from Jackie.  One of the arms is used to grab and throw objects, weapons, and enemies, and the other arm is used as a slashing melee weapon.  Together, they can be used to inflict extremely brutal executions upon your enemies that are a highlight of the combat.  Another main component of the Darkness power inflicting you is the Darkling, an small, impish creature that proves to be one of the best AI companions that I've ever experienced in a game.  He assists you in your journey as much as he assists you in mass murder.  As you defeat foes, you gain a sort of currently known as Essence, which is used to upgrade various abilities across 4 skill trees.  Unlike other games of this sort, the abilities in The Darkness II's talent trees are all very useful, and are structured in a way where you can pick and choose several from each tree in order to create a custom build that suits the way you like to play.  Since you don't get nearly enough Essence to completely max out the skill trees on a single playthrough, I really appreciated this, and was able to easily create a powerful version of Jackie that I really liked.What caught me off guard about this game was how engaging the story is.  I found myself completely wrapped up in Jackie's plight, genuinely moved at certain moments, and never really quite sure what was going on until the very end.  It's a suspenseful, personal story that will keep you on edge the whole way through.  The game features a nice cel-shaded art style and a good soundtrack too.  But what really drives The Darkness II is the excellent, enjoyable gameplay.  If you have the stomach for this sort of game, it is extremely satisfying to play, and feels good from start to finish.  My only major complaint about the game is that it is very short.  I finished the campaign in around 6 hours, and while I don't normally take issue with short campaigns in games, The Darkness II feels like it could have been longer to fully flesh out more of the story, as well as explain a bit more about the lore of the Darkness.  I didn't feel 100% satisfied at the end, and felt like there should have been a little more content here.  But regardless of this, the game is excellent.  It's a brutal, violent fantasy come to brilliant, interactive life.  If this sounds like something you may enjoy, like myself, you may just have a little bit of the Darkness in you, and I therefore recommend this game without hesitation.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E1JS","description":"","reviewerName":"Hernany","summary":"MORTAL KOMBAT: REMASTERED","reviewText":"Mortal Kombat is back... When I first heard about this game I kind of paid no mind. Because of how crappy MK became over all the years, so I was just thinking another MK with the same boring stiff style. Then I saw some videos and I LIKED it, then I played the demo and LOVED it, now I have the game and I'M IN LOVE with it. This is the best MK by far, for the longest I said MK3 was the best but this here outdid it all, finally they returned to 3D graphics on a 2D plane. MK now have 2-on-2 matches like Marvel vs. Capcom, Challenge Tower and Fatality Training (so no more excuses for not finishing your opponent). MK has even slim down their roster from that crazy 63 fighters in MK: Armageddon to about 30 fighters now and if you got PS3 like me you get Kratos and I can't think of anyone more suited for MK than the God of War himself and what make it even better they didn't dull down Kratos' style... They even have sequences from the GoW games for him in matches but you can only use him in versus mode. MK went back to their roots, one of my favorite things are: as you're taking and dealing damage the blood don't just squirt out onto the ground the fighters become bloody and disfigured. Now my absolute favorite thing is the super combo gauge as you take and deal damage your combo gauge fills level 1-enhanced special attack, level 2-combo breaker and level 3 the best of all X-RAY attack: the camera goes in and will show an inside view of the fighter who is being attacked while bones and organs are broken and shattered. The fatalities are all back to what they should be not that crap you got from MKvDC they brought the M-Rated worthy they introduced us to 18years ago. Now for my review: GAMEPLAY 5stars: there is four attack buttons, 2D fighting style and finally the fighters are more loose and flexible not stiff like previous MK, that's why I like this so much, GRAPHICS 5stars: this game looks great the stages are so well designed and so are the fighters and by the way this is 3D compatible which really sets the graphics off and after playing this in 3D. I have to get a 3DTV for sure. STORY MODE 4stars: it becomes harder as the chapters progress and you get a chance to play with different fighters but no fatalities. ONLINE 5stars: take your skills online and compete against others and even watch fights as if you`re at the movies (you can even cheer and boo the fight)in King of the Hill, FIGHTERS 5stars: MK dramatically improved their roster by cutting it down. If you ever liked MK get this game, if you thought about MK get this game, if you're looking for an M-Rated fighter get this game. I wouldn't be surprised if this won Best Fighting Game... This is the best MK ever made. MORTAL KOMBAT 5STARS... FLAWLESS VICTORY!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2013"}

{"product_name":"B006W41W4Q","description":"","reviewerName":"A Gamer at Heart","summary":"Premium Sound Immersion Comes at a Premium Price","reviewText":"Just in case my Amazon screen name isn't enough of a clue, I am a long-time gamer.  I also really like gaming headsets.  I have Turtle Beach headsets, Xtoons, and a myriad of others that I have collected over the years.  The last gaming headset that I purchased that claimed to offer a wireless solution with dolby digital surround was returned to Amazon because of the constant hiss, poor sound quality, and cheap construction.  Fortunately none of these problems were present with the XP400.I have an older xbox that lacks an optical output but as the instructions point out, you can simply use the optical out jack of your TV.  So, before you buy an adapter, check the back of your TV or your TV's owner's manual. Set-up was easy enough.  Charge the headset, connect the control box cables (one to the USB port on the xbox, one to the optical out of the xbox or your TV) and pair the controller to the headset.  Each earcup has some controls present, such as volume, chat, mute, and my favorite, the ability to select different preset sound/EQ settings. Our wireless connection has been great - no interference, chat works great, and no drop-outs.  We did not pair it with a cell phone because I don't mix gaming with phone calls but this is a great feature if you need the silence of headphones (for family or sleeping spouses) but don't want to miss a call.So how about sound quality?  I am happy to report the sound quality is excellent.  I am partial to deep bass in games, especially for war games like Modern Warfare and BF3.  Explosions and heavy machine guns sound as they should: deep, heavy, and skull rattling. The subtle highs of someone creeping up behind you to shank you in the back are not lost in all that deep bass, however.  Subtle highs ring through while deep bass rattles about.  The surround quality is also admirable - a helicopter circling in MW3 sounded so authentic in circling around my head that I thought there was a helicopter above my house until I realized there was one in the game.Sound quality is very subjective of course.  And these headphones are no where near the cheaper end of available headset solutions.  But that is where the beauty of Amazon comes in; if you don't like them, you can always return them.  But, I suspect once you put these on (they are nice, large, comfy headphones) and get used to the beauty of wireless gaming with excellent positional audio and sound quality, that you won't dream of sending them back.  Keep in mind you can also use these for movies and TV.  Are they cheap?  Not a chance.  But we spend money on what matters to us for entertainment.  Some people spend it on clothes, computers, new cell phones, and Ipads.  These are premium priced, but they also deliver a premium gaming wireless and sound solution.  Chances are you are a gaming connoisseur to be here in the first place because if you are not the kind of person who would ever spend this kind of money on a gaming headset, you likely wouldn't have stumbled across this product or this review by accident. In the words of Ferris Bueller, \"if you have the means, I highly recommend it.\"","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2012"}
{"product_name":"B006W41W4Q","description":"","reviewerName":"ThisThatNEverything \"thisthatneverything\"","summary":"Excellent...except for the fact that I can't hear some other TB users...","reviewText":"I absolutely loved this headset until I quickly learned that I had an issue hearing some other users who have wired Turtle Beach headsets.  I use this headset on my PS3 while playing online shooter games.  I strictly play with a group of about 20 different guys.  2 of these guys have wired Turtle Beach headsets and there is some sort of issue that prevents me from hearing them.  I hear everybody else just fine and they hear me.  The first night I used this headset I noticed that I was having troubles hearing 1 of these guys (the other guy wasn't on that night) but didn't think much about it.  The next night I had the same issues and everyone was confused as to why I couldn't hear him when they could.  He could hear me just fine but I'd maybe catch 1 out of every 10 words that he said.  I'd never had an issue hearing him before so I didn't really get it either.  When we realized that we were both using Turtle Beach headsets he switched to a different brand and we both heard each other just fine.  I thought this very odd and stated that when the other guy that had a different Turtle Beach wired headset came online that it would be the true test as to whether there was a compatibility issue.  Sure enough, when he came online I couldn't hear him either when everybody else could.  I switched to a different brand headset and heard them both clearly.  I emailed Turtle Beach about this issue and the reply that I got was that there must be a problem on the other users ends, not mine. They tried to tell me that there isn't a compatibility issue because it doesn't work like that but nothing else makes sense.  None of the other individuals have Turtle Beach headsets so I'm curious as time goes on if I will come across other Turtle Beach users that I can't hear either.  Maybe it's just the wired ones, maybe it's all other Turtle Beach headsets.  I'm not sure yet but I'll update this review if I find out.I wish I didn't have this issue because aside from that, I really love this headset.  The headset was pretty easy to get started for the most part.  The User Guide is very user friendly and I had no problem pairing the headset.  I did however have a small issue at first after hooking everything up as the manual states, I wasn't hearing game sounds through the headset.  I called my husband up to see if he could figure it out and immediately he unplugged the Digital Optical Cable from the back of the PS3 and plugged it into the TV.  He said it was because of the HDMI cable.  After doing that everything was perfect.The surround sound is awesome.  It's neat to hear footsteps and know exactly which direction they are coming from.  I've found this feature to be very helpful.The sound is very clear through this headset.  The people that I do hear, they are crystal clear and I don't hearing popping sounds like I do with some of my other headsets.  Everybody says that I sound fantastic as well.  I like the fact that I can manually adjust the volume of the game, the chat and the my own voice in the headset all individually.  This is very useful.The battery life of the headset is pretty incredible.  Right out of the box without charging the headset I was able to use it for about 15 hours.  When the headset needs to be charged you are able to do it while playing.  It comes with an extremely long charging cord that I also find very useful.Overall this headset is great.  My only problem is the issue that I described at the beginning of this review.  Hopefully by some miracle this issue will fix itself but I've had the problem for 3 weeks now so I'm not hopeful.  As mentioned, I'm not sure if I'll come across this issue often but it's quite an issue when you play with friends for many hours and can't hear them.  I would recommend this headset with the warning that I described above.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2012"}

You can still set up very tough fortifications, but they aren't invincible.  It encourages you to use a little strategy to punch through defenses rather than just throwing hundreds of units at the enemy hoping you break through.I like all the extra features, and it's got an okay, though very predictable campaign.Personally if you get this I'd encourage you to get the expansion too, it adds so many interface features and makes the game run so much better!Also, just so you know, you don't need Steam to install the DVD version, you can find the patches online.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00HD4R5YU","description":"World-renowned Kojima Productions showcases the latest masterpiece in the Metal Gear Solid franchise with Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes. Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes (on sale Spring 2014) is the first segment of the 'Metal Gear Solid V Experience' and prologue to the larger second segment, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain launching thereafter. MGSV: GZ gives core fans the opportunity to get a taste of the world-class production's unparalleled visual presentation and gameplay before the release of the main game. It also provides an opportunity for gamers who have never played a Kojima Productions game, and veterans alike, to gain familiarity with the radical new game design and unparalleled style of presentation. The critically acclaimed Metal Gear Solid franchise has entertained fans for decades and revolutionized the gaming industry. Kojima Productions once again raises the bar with the FOX Engine offering incredible graphic fidelity and the introduction of open world game design in the Metal Gear Solid universe. This is the experience that core gamers have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Chevy","summary":"A Demo Sold As A Game","reviewText":"Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes was released to show off the new Fox engine and let players get accustomed to the new control scheme. It delivers on those two goals. It offers fun gameplay and beautiful graphics (minus one complaint that I have). Considering that MGS 5: The Phantom Pain is two hundred times larger than Ground Zeroes, it is self evident that the price for Ground Zeroes is a bit high. The main mission and the five side missions all take place at the same location. Stealth reaps the highest rewards, as far as scoring goes, but players have the choice of being loud and proud if they so desire. I preordered this game because I thoroughly enjoyed MGS 4 on the PS3, I was anxious to see the new Fox engine in action, and I was ready for a new PS4 game.The graphics look amazing. Cut scenes are in-engine. Everything looks realistic, and it's easy to suspend disbelief and be drawn into the action. I do have one problem with the graphics, though, and it really stood out to me. I know I'm nitpicking here, but since everything else looks so great, I was disappointed to see this. The issue I'm speaking of concerns the tires on vehicles, mainly the helicopters. The tires look like stop signs, not tires. There were round tires on last generation consoles, so why not on these ultra-powerful new ones? Side view mirrors on the jeeps look just as bad. While this may not matter to a lot of players, I expect more.The A.I. is okay (normal difficulty), but there is room for improvement. I ran myself into a dead end and there was only one box to hide behind. A group of soldiers saw me go back there, but they did not engage me, nor did they try to draw me out. They simply ran off and said into their radios that they didn't see me anymore. I think the A.I. should know when the player is trapped with only one way out, but they don't. I was also seen going into an armory. They did not remain in the area and wait for me to come out, and they didn't come in to get me. They reported on their radios that I was no longer in sight, and then they just moved on. I hope this is fixed by the time The Phantom Pain releases.A lot of people are reporting this is a two hour main mission and about another hour worth of side missions. I actually got four and a half hours from the main mission because I thoroughly explored, accosted each soldier, and tried to find everything that I could, all without being spotted. Once I finished four side missions, I had 6.5 hours of gameplay. I haven't unlocked the fifth side mission. Four side missions are unlocked, but the fifth has a requirement (locating all 9 patches during the main mission).There isn't a lot of story. There are about forty minutes or so of audio logs you can listen to before you play (or whenever you want to listen to them) that offer some story. There are more audio logs you obtain during the game. I like the new map system, but there seems to be an issue with it. During missions, you will discover the location of items that get marked on your map. The issue is that once you collect the item, the marker on the map remains, and this creates confusion. You may find yourself returning to collect an item that you collected earlier, and thus wasting your time. I hope this gets fixed with a patch. I think the final cut scene should have been a playable sequence.I'm having a lot of fun playing this game. I appreciate good graphics and good gameplay. The controls work nicely. I still have some issues with controlling Snake while he's in the prone position (turning around, for example).  Voice actors sound good, but the enemy soldiers' words are cliche.MGS fans will like this prologue, but don't expect a lengthy campaign. If $30 seems high to you, then wait for a price drop. This is more of a demo than a complete title, but it has replay value so you can try different approaches and that adds to the fun factor.I'd recommend avoiding youtube videos that have spoilers, i.e. walkthroughs. If you're interested to see how the game looks, IGN has a good review that doesn't have spoilers.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2014"}
{"product_name":"B001ATHKVC","reviewerName":"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","summary":"Warhead Xpac","reviewText":"Though technically Warhead is a standalone game, it is more or less just another Crysis campaign. This one runs parallel to part of the original Crysis story, and the difficulty is clearly aimed at experienced players. If you played and enjoyed the original, you'll likely enjoy this. One must bear in mind, however, that this really is essentially an expansion pack- don't expect a full length game out of Warhead, or you'll be let down.Warhead places you in the nanosuit of Sgt 'Psycho' Sykes, who you might remember from the original Crysis. You might also remember that he is with you at the start and again at the end, so obviously this campaign runs the time between. And no, that wasn't all that long, was it? This is perhaps the biggest disappointment in Warhead- the campaign is VERY short. I finished it in less than 5 hours of play time, and at when the credits rolled I found myself staring at the screen slack-jawed asking 'where's the other half?' It doesn't help that the manual describes VTOL controls, and you see so many of the things flying around that you naturally expect to get another shot flying one before the campaign terminates. Not so.The mission areas, however, are very well designed. You'll see some truly awe inspiring environments and fight sequences, such as a memorable one aboard an armed Korean train. Graphics, as before, are top-notch with superb texturing and lighting, very realistic scenery and great attention to detail. Sound is also superb, with an excellent soundtrack and ambient sounds. This is a game that really makes you feel like you're in the thick of things. It also helps that some of the areas allow you a greater degree of freedom to play with than previous Crysis maps. You're rarely shoehorned into going in a set path, and are usually just presented with a green objective dot and told to get there somehow.There are two new weapons in the campaign- the AY69 (a short-range machine pistol that can be dual-wielded) and the FGL40 (semi-auto grenade launcher). Some improvements to weapons include automatic ammo-pickup and retaining ammo when you change weapons, so if you change back you don't start with 10 rounds left in the magazine. I suppose this is less realistic, but I'm not complaining- I hated digging in bushes looking for that rifle the guy inconveniently dropped down the hill when he died. There's also a handful of new vehicles you'll see, such as a hovercraft and an APC with a minigun on it. You'll also at times actually see friendly air support, which is a welcome change. You would think you'd have seen more of that in Crysis with that carrier sitting off the coast, but I guess all those flyboys had better things to do than bail you out.The campaign story is pretty much what you'd expect, and there's really no surprises in it if you've already played Crysis. The missions and objectives do tend to be a bit more fast-paced than the original, and you rarely end up bogged down trying to kill a whole base full of enemies. As with the previous game, you can often (but not always) choose to sneak around rather than mow them all down, but half the game's fun is blowing things up and watching the physics engine work, so unless it's your 2nd or 3rd time through you really shouldn't. As noted before, the game is definitely geared towards experienced Crysis players. Aside from not being able to make sense out of a lot of the plot, newcomers will probably be in for a rude surprise when they see armored vehicles shooting at them almost right off the bat.The game also comes with Crysis Wars, which is a multiplayer mode game. I haven't even installed it yet, so I can't really say how much fun it is, but if you're into multiplay it is there. I mainly picked this up to play the campaign, which I think is what most people are looking at. A lot of fuss has been made over the SecuROM protection, but I can't say I've had any problems with it. I don't think the issue of limited activations is a serious problem, due to how short this game is. It has limited replay value, and after 2-3 times through it (which doesn't take long at all) I really don't see myself playing it again. Thus it's really a non-issue where I'm concerned, though clearly others disagree.Aside from its brevity, Warhead is a great game. It's a no-brainer if you enjoyed Crysis, and the design and production values are superb. Just bear in mind that you're not buying a full length campaign, and you won't be disappointed in the least.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2009"}

I can't remember off the top of my head when the DS came out (2005?) but, seeing as I purchased my DS Lite in late 2007 as a Christmas present to myself, and it's 2013, it must've left some impression on me. In fact, it still does.I bought it mainly to play the newer Pok&eacute;mon games. I had an old Game Boy which I had dug up in 2007, and played through Yellow and Gold. When I heard I could play not only the Pearl and Diamond games with a DS Lite, but the Advance FireRed and LeafGreen as well, I was overjoyed. Since I hadn't paid much attention to the world of Pok&eacute;mon after Gold, I was elated when I saw pictures and videos of the Pocket Monsters in action in games post Advance. So I placed my Amazon order for the black Lite and FireRed, and it took me only a couple months to beat (which is fast for me, as I take a while to play games). I then purchased a copy of Emerald at my local Walmart for $15 (!) and played that for the rest of my last year of college.Any who, I used my DS quite frequently throughout the proceeding years. From Advance games to DS games, it got quite the wear. Even when the new fangled DSi and later DS XL were announced, I was not disappointed to own the older models as it played Advance games, and I didn't have a Game Boy Advance. During the hey-day of the portable gaming device--when adults were using it for Brain Age during their morning and afternoon commutes--I took it with me as well, opting to level my Pok&eacute;mon or learn Advance Wars (what an amazing game).Fast forward to 2013, and it's still getting use. There was a period where I didn't use it for about six months or so, but that was it. There's always a game for me to play, whether it's Tetris DS or Mario Kart or HeartGold or Advance Wars. My friend had given me his old PSP-1000, but I have only a handful of games for that. Even with my PS One Classics, the DS gets far more play. I'm not sure why it is, considering I love my old PlayStation games. The DS just seems like a better portable machine. But that's my mere opinion.When I first got it, my then girlfriend / now wife also played on it, and she's not a gamer in the slightest! Granted, she played Brain Age, but it was still a step up from what she played before, which was nothing. With the iPhone out now, my preferred portable gaming choice is my Apple product, but that's because it's with me all the time, and most games are pocket-sized versions of games which have already been out (e.g., Plants vs. Zombies), with the Angry Birds franchise being the only exception.The DS is still getting its use, and will be for a while. I read in the manual that the machine has about 500 charges in its lifetime, and I think I've hit only a fourth of that in the past 6 years. I'm currently in HeartGold still, and thinking about playing it for another year till I get White (then Black 2, and X/Y thereafter). I'm sure the DS will handle itself well for another few years; it's still in great condition, with a few minor scuffs on the bottom screen, so that should say how Nintendo handles its quality control.In other words, a fantastic and time-worthy product from Nintendo.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2013"}

Although 'linear' may evoke negative connotations, I am personally blown away by how well-crafted the linear path is.As the other reviewers have pointed out - beware of the fangled and draconian security measures that come with the PC version of this product. However, I think it's highly unfair to give the overall game a single star because of something that the publisher decided - most probably with little, if any input from the actual game developers. This is a review of the game, not a critique on access control technology. Take it for what it is.ATMOSPHERE:So lets jump right into the `fear' aspect. The frights are genuine and the stakes are seemingly higher. Yet I personally think I was more petrified in the first game - the sense of dread is not as deep (at least not through Chapter 6). I think the main reason for this is that Dead Space 2 has a faster pace than its predecessor. Everything from the layout of the levels, to the improvements in Isaac's locomotion play a role in this. Still, there were a couple of occasions where I felt as if I was doused with a bucket of cold water. And besides, I'm only starting Chapter 7 - maybe I'll be unpleasantly surprised with something truly horrific, before the game is over.The game also has a strongly unified design philosophy. This design philosopohy extends to everything from Isaac's various suits to the architecture. Speaking of which, the environments are very well designed and, despite the overall linear sense of progression, there is a different scene awaiting you in each section. You may be traipsing through an apartment complex one moment and a sinister Unitology church the next. Much of DS1's levels worked with the same color palettes. I'm not knocking on the excellent level design in the first game, but I applaud the developers' decision to expand into different environments with a greater variation of colors.In the first game we were exposed to a very industrial & corporate environment. In fact you got a strong sense of how mankind had progressed in those areas - be it from what you read on the logs or what you saw on the posters. In DS2, you get a more elaborate view of other aspects of human culture in the 26th century. The feeling is similar to what gamers experienced while exploring Rapture in Bioshock.GRAPHICS:Visually it's a step in the right direction, though it won't completely blow you away. As a `PC-first' gamer, I pay close attention to all the bells and whistles. I find it irksome that the anti-aliasing is practically worthless - so be ready for lots of jaggy lines. The strongest features are the lighting effects, the facial animations and the character models. I'm willing to forgive the occasionally sub-par texture-work because of everything else that the game has going on for it (hey if I could play through the rubbish textures in Fallout3/New Vegas, I can play through anything).The most impressive visual sequences come in the form of action-packed cut-scenes. It's too bad there isn't a quicksave/quickload to enjoy these sequences over and over again.SOUND:As an audiophile, I am blown away by the incredible sound-design. I'd say 70% of the scares come from the sounds you hear. Barring the occasional fleeting shadow, or flickering light source, the creepy sounds are what builds up tension. Throw in a BAFTA-winning composer and you have a very cinematic experience in store. Of the few genuine scares I have had thus far, one of them was because of the sound design - could feel a nerve between my ear and the back of my neck go ice cold. Hope you've got a good speaker or headphones for this one.The voice-acting is also quite good. I remember a time when silent protagonists were in vogue.Developers like Valve defended Gordon Freeman's silence as a blank-slate upon which gamers could impress their own personalities. Over the years I feel that this approach has lost its appeal. Games like Mass Effect and The Witcher (or even Halo) have proven that having a voice-over for the main character adds much more depth to a game. The person they cast for Isaac in DS2 does his job well - he doesn't sound heroic and he doesn't have anything particularly memorable about his voice. And that's a good thing since Isaac is meant to be an average Joe caught up in a nightmare.GAMEPLAY:DS2 retains most of the core mechanics. Importantly, strategic dismemberment makes a bloody glorious return - its easily the most fun to be had this side of VATS! Isaac's movements have been refined so that its smoother and more responsive. This was a welcome improvement as there are certainly more enemies to handle in certain areas. The way Isaac navigates in zero-G has also been overhauled significantly - it can be a little disorienting at first, but its definitely more realistic. The weapons feel much like they did before - and I'm glad they didn't tinker with them too much. My favorite weapon so far is the Javelin gun, which packs a heck of a punch.On normal, DS2 is a bit more challenging than the first game.  You can get swarmed pretty quickly if you're not slow and steady in your exploration. Also, keep an eye on that ammo counter. Not a big deal on `normal', but I hear that on `hard' you have to make every single shot count (can't wait for my second playthrough!) There were a couple of cheap deaths - but nothing frustrating so far. The camera went unexpectedly wonky in one particularly cramped space - which didn't kill me but it did cause a lot of hurt.Be warned that there is an obligatory and rather mundane hacking mini-game. IMHO, this gaming mechanic needs to be permanently abolished.One thing that DS2 handles particularly well is the seamless integration of chapters. Unlike the first game where you knew the chapter would end every time you hopped on the rail, here there is a simple text that floats up on the bottom right of the screen, with the chapter number. Its non-intrusive, and honestly I've only noticed that text a couple of times. In most cases its not until a save station that I realize I'm into the next chapter.BOTTOM LINE:With better pacing and improvements on almost all aspects of the first game, Dead Space 2 is the first must-buy game of 2011. The scares aren't necessarily as intense, but they are still there. I'm not done with the game and have no idea on how it ends. However, if the developers continue to treat the material with genuine care and not treat it as a cash cow, I would love to see the franchise continue well into the future.EDIT 2/1/11:Finally finished the game after a marathon 5 hour session.  Whats more, I launched a new game and played for another 2 hours after I was done. It really is that good. Wouldn't change a thing about my review - well maybe I'll just add that yes, one particular level took me back to the pure horror of the first game...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0050SWUTQ","description":"","reviewerName":"546598","summary":"cod","reviewText":"This is the best looking Dead Space yet. I'm playing the single-player campaign first. I'll update this review later once I get a chance to try the co-op campaign.Dead Space has evolved. The original was the scariest game I've ever played. The second moved on to a larger environment, updated graphics, and gave us more Zero-G along with more outdoor space time, and the third installment gives us an even bigger environment, more Zero-G space time, and a planet to explore all to a full orchestral score.Dead Space 3 is bigger than the first two games combined. It has a new weapon crafting system and upgrading weapons is different than the past two titles in the series. A rover bot is added to the mix that is hand-held and used like a scanner to find resources. When the signal is strongest, just set it down and it goes searching. The bots are used to get resources that Isaac can't see or retrieve himself.The single-player campaign is just that. There is no A. I. character that follows you around. I know this was a big concern for a lot of people. Co-op was added so we can play with a friend. There are more powerful enemies and better loot. It's really like a second game. Co-op offers additional things that you won't see in the single-player version.The graphics are about the best there is for this generation. It runs native 1080 and everything looks amazing. Visceral did a great job putting detail into every little thing. I appreciate the fine details.We have some new necromorphs that look awesome. They are no longer a mashed up looking clump of flesh like in past games. Some of these necromorphs are extremely fast so expect fairly frequent use of stasis. You'll recognize similarities between some of these necromorphs and some from past games.A large part of the game is in outer space where you get plenty of air time to explore. There's a graveyard of space ships and space stations to explore with plenty of creepy moments reminiscent of Dead Space 1.The ice planet looks awesome and the weather effects are nothing short of spectacular. Even outdoors, you'll get a lot of scares. Necromorphs pop up out of the snow or come from holes in the cliff's walls. They might even climb over the edge of the cliff to get at you.There are many blueprints unlocked from the beginning, but you can't use them until you collect enough resources; that's where the rover bots come in. Start using them early. You have 2 weapon slots and most weapons use an over/under system ala Alt-Fire. I have a carbine with a shotgun attachment and a line gun with a force gun attachment. You can craft your own weapon from scratch with tons of choices. You can even add attachments that add shock or acid damage to your rounds, for example.There is a story and it doesn't suck; it just doesn't make you care for the other characters so much. It tries to at times, but doesn't quite do it for me. The story for this game is one of self discovery. Rather than being character driven, it unfolds through your actions. The more text logs you read, audio logs you listen to, and the more you explore away from your waypoints, the more the story is revealed. You get certain parts of the story from the characters, usually through objectives. Isaac's mind has healed a lot since Dead Space 2. He still has episodes, but not near as frequently. He can decipher the marker's symbols to discover hidden messages now. Maybe since Visceral has mastered graphics and combat they will focus more on this issue for the next Dead Space title.Combat is dead on, not much more to say about it. The combat is solid. I even liked scaling the icy mountainside while avoiding falling boulders and fighting necromorphs along the way.I think this is by far the best game in the series. It's not constant stress and fear like the first Dead Space, but there is still plenty of it. Visceral did a good job of giving us some breathers between shots of intensity. A good series should evolve and not be exactly like its predecessors. Dead Space 3 does it well, while still keeping to its roots.I have to recommend Dead Space 3. If you haven't played the previous two titles in the series (I highly recommend them) you will still have a lot of fun with this one. With side missions and some extra exploration you can easily pull 25-30 hours out of this game and that doesn't even count co-op. It has high replay value because of game+ mode, which allows you to keep your tricked out gear for another play through.If you're not sure about a purchase, at least rent it, but try this game out. It's unique.Oh, and one last thing--when you finish the game--let the credits roll to the end because this is one of those games that has a little something after the credits are over.Update: Co-Op Review:","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SWUTQ","description":"","reviewerName":"D. K. Malone","summary":"Not the best Dead Space, but still pretty great","reviewText":"I remember when Dead Space 2 was first announced, Visceral was completely open about the fact that it was going to have \"a little more action than Dead Space 1 had, some set pieces to counter balance the constant dread.\" A big chunk of the fanbase immediately lost their collective s*** over this and decided that they had ruined the franchise, DS2 would be all action, no horror, blah blah blah. It was a ridiculous overreaction. I myself took a wait-and-see approach. About a year later Dead Space 2 was released, and all in all I thought it was very close to the first game. Yes, it did have more action. But not much. Just enough to add some flavor. I still thought it was about as close as we're going to get to \"classic survival horror\" in the post-RE4 era.The lead up to Dead Space 3 has been pretty similar. It was a long time ago that Visceral broke the news that the third entry in the series was going to have a new crouch/cover move, a dodge-roll move, human enemies that shoot at you, a co-op campaign. Again they were very open and honest that they were doing all of this in the hopes of attracting more fans. i.e. catering to the lowest common denominator. Cue angry fanmob weilding torches and pitchforks, rending their own garments and weeping tears of blood. I admit, I myself was not exactly happy when I heard these things. But I loved Dead Space 1 and 2 so much, I was so impressed by what the development team was capable of, that I continued to have faith. I never got as hyped up and excited as I had for the previous two games, but I never lost the hope that when the game did finally come out, I'd buy it on day 1, I'd play it, and I'd come to find out that there was really nothing to worry about.Well, I'm very happy to say today: that's close to what happened.For the most part, it feels like classic Dead Space to me. The new additions to the formula, the \"shooter\" stuff... The only occasions the cover mechanics are useful at all are when you're faced with human gun wielding enemies... and these guys appear so rarely in the game that it's a complete non-issue. The dodge-roll move... the only time I actually relied on it was against one particular boss. Other than that, it might as well have not been there. Most of the time I just felt like I was playing good ol' Dead Space. Making my way through grim environments, fighting off necromorphs, repairing systems (i.e. solving puzzles, and may I say a few pretty cool ones in the classic survival horror style) grabbing loot from containers and corpses. All at a very deliberate pace.One thing I was not enthralled with and never really warmed up to is the new weapon system- crafting weapons from spare parts. I dabbled with this mostly in the demo, and it seemed like every weapon I made was a piece of crap compared to the weapons I already had in my inventory. So I pretty much ignored this aspect in the full game. I'm sure this has a lot to do with why this game felt so much like classic Dead Space to me- I relied on the trusty ol' Plasma Cutter 90% of the time, once in a while I'd try another weapon for the sheer hell of it, but would soon go back to using the cutter. This game didn't feel like Gears of War to me because I chose not to play it that way, blowing everything away with a rocket launcher duct taped to a machine gun. Hmmm... maybe I'll try that in New Game+.Because of the addition of co-op, they had to ditch the traditional save point cameras and converted to a checkpoint system. I would have preferred save points. The first two games were generous with save points popping up often, but the checkpoints are sometimes few and far between. There are a couple of set pieces that are overly frustrating and annoying, worse than anything I can recall from the previous games. Climbing up a sheer ice cliff face while having to use stasis on multiple falling chunks and swinging gondolas is not something I will look forward to when I replay this game.The worst I can say about this game is that I did seem to notice a subtle drop in overall quality. There were occasions were I thought I was back-tracking through an area I'd already explored, and then I'd realize \"Oh, wait... this is actually a whole new area.\" DS 1 and 2 had their fair share of revisiting previously explored areas, but in this game some areas are literally copy/pasted. Generally speaking, there were other times when the overall look of things just seemed to lack the incredible attention to detail of past games. As an example- Apparently one of the team's new environment designers didn't get the memo that the little elevator holograph control panel in the previous two games wasn't just some generic abstract symbol meaning \"press here,\" it's meant to be an *arrow* showing the direction the elevator will move in when you activate it. I could only shake my head every time I'd get in an elevator and it would go in the opposite direction the arrow was indicating.All in all, I have to say that while this may technically be the \"worst\" of the Dead Space trilogy, it's still a damn good game and well worth playing if you're into the series. Ignore the whiners who blubber about it being turned into an action shooter, because you can ignore those aspects of the game, and it will feel just like classic Dead Space.EDIT: I've come back later because I wanted to mention something. When Dead Space 1 came out, I bought it on day 1 and proceeded to play through it from beginning to end at least six times before I finally started to get bored. I did pretty much the same thing with Dead Space 2. With Dead Space 3, I played through it once, and then started a second game but stopped somewhere in the middle. Coming from me, someone who loves replaying games over and over, that's not a good sign. All in all I guess I have no choice but to admit that Dead Space 3 simply isn't as fun as the first two.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2013"}

It is very cool to use the different Force powers and I actually use those more than my light-saber. The graphics were pretty cool for the Wii and it really isn't that difficult. Probably the only bad things I can say is that the game is pretty short as I finished it within about 5 days and that is playing at most 2 hours a day. The other bad thing is that there is no consequence for dieing. When you fight a boss, if you die, you just pick up right where you left off with full power while the boss only gains a little back. So you can die over and over again, but still manage to beat the boss pretty easily. With that in mind, the games moves you right through. I would recommend renting this game if you can.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Despite some flaws, Force Unleashed delivers","reviewText":"The eagerly anticipated Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is finally here, and Star Wars fans will find plenty to admire and enjoy here.  Others however may find a certain degree of disappointment to be found with Force Unleashed thanks to some noticeable flaws and glitches (especially here on the Wii), but if one overlooks these, a good time is to be had.  Featuring one of the best and most compelling stories you may ever find in a video game period, Force Unleashed also features some thrilling and jaw dropping moments that will make even the smallest Star Wars fan squeal with joy.  You play as Starkiller, the secret apprentice to Darth Vader, and you are charged with eliminating the last remaining Jedi in the universe.  Interacting with your pilot Juno Eclipse and a droid named PROXY, Force Unleashed also features some compelling and inventive characters to boot; so much so that you'll actually be caring about what happens to them as the game progresses.  As said before, Force Unleashed is loaded with thrilling moments, but a good amount of these moments are few and far between, and some technical and gameplay glitches really hurt the game as well.  Including times when the camera seems to want to work against you, the targeting system is frustrating in nearly every sense of the word.  The Wii-specific controls take advantage of the Wii-mote and nunchuk, and sometimes work out well, and sometimes prove unresponsive and hard on your wrists.  Force Unleashed also comes off at times as being too epic in scope to fit the final product of what you're playing; it just feels as if something is missing here that shouldn't.  Still though, the game looks decent, the music is superb, and the art design is great as well.

I've written in some comments to Sony about this, but they still do not listen, just keep re-hashing the same thing over and over again (which I know its hard to change sports games, but seriously.)Here are some suggestions that I wanted to see for 11 the Show.1. Enhanced Rivalry Mode - This would have been a really simple fix. My friends and I love playing rivalries, playing a 40 sometimes or 80 something series. However, half the time you are not playing your stars because they are tired. Some of you might say, simple fix, turn the stamina off. Well, we like to play it a little more realistically. They should allow you to create a schedule, that way you can put in off days and have your team fully rested. VERY EASY FIX.2. Trading - This is one of the all-time worst features that has never been fixed with the Show. They create some of the worst trades possible. Adrian Gonzalez got traded a year after his massive contract, things like that. There should be some sort of loyalty meter or something like that. How many times have you played the game, saw a team sign somebody, then the next year they are gone. Or the Phillies would sign 1B Billy Butler while they had Ryan Howard, it makes no sense and needs to be fixed.3. Franchise Mode - It takes forever to schedule promotions and enter the amount that you want. It shouldn't take THAT long to get something done like that. There needs to be better control of management in this mode too, it is difficult to tell what type of manager you need and so on.4. Contracts - When playing in RTTS the contracts you receive are HORRIBLE. Make them a little more realistic. Along with this area the end of the season awards are a bit of a joke sometimes, that would be harder to fix.Personally, the Show needs to major fixes because this is worse than the Call of Duty franchise.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2011"}
{"product_name":"B006VB2UNC","description":"","reviewerName":"Bill Stockstill \"&#34;Bill&#34;\"","summary":"EA Sports Fine Tunes The NCAA Series","reviewText":"This year's NCAA offering doesn't have any major new features other than playing as one of several Heisman winners in the game. Game play has been tweaked, especially passing. In game updates have been added and the lighting is a little more realistic. But compared toMadden NFL 13and its totally new physics system and all new Connected Careers, little has been done other than smooth some edges.One of the things that Tiburon, the EA owned Studio that puts out NCAA and Madden games, did was make the menu look even more like the graphics seen on Saturdays during ESPN's college football presentations. Another is further tweaking of light levels using something called HDR (high dynamic range) methods to make the fields look more like you see on game day. One of the things they added was an in game update to other games. This happens in dynasty games. The only thing is that its all canned and made up when you advance the week. So if you are playing in an offline dynasty and decide to play some games other than your team's that week, those scores won't show up on the ticker or be in any of the updates of later games. That, to me, is disappointing. Perhaps if they do NCAA like Madden where you have to play up to that game, and all games prior have been played, they could add game scores for games the user has played.One thing EA has done again, unfortunately, is left out many features and you have to pay for them as DLC. A few versions back, you could be the commish of up to 5 online dynasties. You can still now, as long as you pay EA for it. For $20 you can buy all the extras, details are in the game under the areas that they are available, such as Recruiting Advisor in online and offline dynasties.You can still edit rosters and on day one I found a roster that was pretty accurate to the real life players.Overall, the new passing is nice, but it won't blow you out of the water. Play action works a little better because you have better blocking and the qb moves faster.Updates coming up are supposed to include some free uniforms such as for Rutgers. If that turns out to be true, it will be a first, something FREE from Tiburon/EA in an update!Overall, its a fun and the upgrades, most of them at least, are good additions to the game. The game ratings are suspect again though. Remember that the studio that does this game has a student internship program with UCF so you will see some bias there toward them and against schools they don't like such as USF. They actually rated USF the second worse team in Florida and the worse in the Big East when preseason Athlon, Phil Steele and Andre Ware have them winning the conference. FIU is rated in the 80s so any set of team ratings that has Sun Belt teams rated much higher than BCS teams, you have to wonder how they came to these ratings. BUT, you can find rosters with better ratings online and they will start popping up shortly after release.Overall, a fun game. I have found I like a mode where you just Coach games which is almost as fun as watching a real game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000R0PLK2","description":"Electronic Arts Inc. The Orange Box 9849 Xbox 360 Games","reviewerName":"mom2twoboys \"Writer, Reader & Mage\"","summary":"Orange Box Review, Includes Pros and Cons","reviewText":"I'm 14 years old and I've played the first Half-Life, and have played both Left 4 Dead's, all by the same company, Valve. In this review I will discuss the pros and the cons about the Orange Box and all the games that come in it separately in one review. I hope you find it useful.The Orange Box: Action, Puzzle Solving, Minor Gore, Online Class-Based Combat.This review contains no spoilers.The Orange Box consists of five different game in one: Three sections of the Half-Life story (all making up three parts of the sequel to one game), Portal, which is a humorous-yet-serious puzzle solving game, and Team Fortress 2, the online-only sequel to a game I have not played.-----------Half-Life 2-----------------[ALERT]-- Please note that Half-Life 2 will make NO sense to you if you have not yet played the original Half-Life. If you haven't played the original, then this entire review on Half-Life 2 can be considered full of spoilers.Half-life 2 is, of course, the sequel to Half-Life, an alien invasion based game. In Half-life 1, you play a character named Gordon Freeman, a scientist working at a facility called Black Mesa. You and your coleagues are working to establish contact with an alien world, when something goes terribly wrong. (This is not a spoiler because it is the plot of the entire game). Aliens began pouring in, killing your coleagues and wreaking havoc throughout the facility. Eventually, a hostile alien force (I assume they're some kind of alien police, Valve doesn't explain things very well) takes over the world, holding humans under their thumb as the dominant species. You, Gordon Freeman, lead the revolution against the alien force that has ruled over the world since the Black Mesa Incident, and hopefully will become the savior of humanity.Pros:Extremely Interesting Story - Half-Life 2 is solely about the storyline. It doesn't offer any multiplayer or online play, but it makes up for it with its brother in the Box, Team Fortress 2. As explained above, Half-Life 2 is about an alien invasion, with you leading the rebellion against them. The story is completely addictive, but is pointless if you have not played the original Half-Life.Good Graphics - The Orange Box came out a little, little while ago, a few years. So it doesn't have the best graphics, but it was among the best of its time. The graphics are still practically picture-perfect, but aren't as good as today's games.Deep Characters - The characters in Half-Life 2 have lives of their own. Valve did such a good job on writing the characters that you actually develope feelings for them and what happens to them... All of the characters in the game are very different, and all of them will capture the way you feel towards characters in a game.Cons:No Multiplayer - As stated above, Half-Life 2 is all about the storyline, and has no online or multiplayer features. However, there's always Team Fortess 2, in case you buy the Orange Box instead of buying the games separately.Unique Controls - For those who have played strong titles such as Call of Duty or Halo, Half-Life 2's controls will be a change, for better or worse, especially with the unique guns it has in it. Do note that the controls are still quick and responsive, they are just unique to the controls most FPS titles share.Mature Storyline - This could be either a pro or a con. The storyline in Half-Life 1 and 2 are told very maturly, in a very intricate way. This probably isn't a game for younger audiences, though buy-knows-best.Half-Life 2 contains little blood, usually a bloody skeleton or a burnt face, but no limbs exploding or anything substantial. No sexuality, and a mild amount of cursing.---------Portal---------------Portal is a very unique game, combining puzzle solving, humor, and little action. You play the role of (character name not given in the game), who has been taken to a testing facility to be.. you guess it! Tested on. You are given a special gun that is used to shoot portals. You can only have two portals out at once, and when you (or an object you throw into it) travel through one, you (or an object you throw into it) come out through the other. You are given a series of testing chambers, all becoming more complex as you progress through the game.Pros:Brilliant Puzzles - Portal's puzzles feature you using your portals at the right times, getting objects to where they are needed in order to complete said puzzles, and getting there safely. Some puzzles feature acid-flooded floors, elevators, timed doors, portal-proof panels and much more.Great Antagonist - The antagonist of it all, GLaDOS, (no typos) watches your every move and makes sarcastic remarks on your performance. Abrupt inflections show her frustration as you complete puzzles correctly, which makes GLaDOS a unique character in a game.Silence - Most FPS games usually have teammates yelling at you or gunfire echo-ing in your ear, but Portal provides absolute (and much needed) silence to help you figure out its complex puzzles.Yet it's still funny - Portal is both a serious and a humorous game. With GLaDOS's sarcastic remarks and ironic outcomes of some puzzles, Portal makes a great game for both worlds, as some may say.Ending - Without giving anything away, I guarentee you that if you decide to get Portal, you'll love what the ending has in store. It's very memorable.Cons:Too Short - While Portal has an artistically written story that draws you in from beginning to end, the game itself is a little too short. On your first run, you can probably beat the game in about 2-3 days. Once you've figured out the puzzles, it can easily be beaten in less than one day.Dizzying - The constant need for portals in high and low places alike and the need to travel through them can make Portal a dizzying game for those who don't have, um, spinning experience. You have to fling all around and launch yourself all the time in Portal.Frustration? - Some people may find some of Portal's challenges to be too complex, and trust me, Portal can be very frustrating at times.Portal should not, and I repeat, not be bought by itself. It's too short to be bought as one game. It's like spending $40 for Pac-Man. It is definitely something to consider if you get the Orange Box, but it is not worth anything about $30 by itself. No inappropriate content, just some blood spatters on the wall when you're shot at. No cursing.---------------Team Fortess 2---------------------I have not played Team Fortress 1, and I strongly doubt that either of them have any story to them. Team Fortress 2 is a class based game, meaning that you can choose to snipe enemies from afar, build turrets to protect you and your allies, or even disguise yourself as an enemy to infiltrate them. Team Fortress 2 has something for everybody.Pros:Something for everybody - Umm as stated above, Team Fortress has several different classes to choose from (Nine to be exact)Humorous Massacre - While wreaking havoc on your foes, you may decide to mock them in a unique way (aside from teabagging them, while you can still do that). You can press (assigned button can vary due to player modifications) to do a special emote to mock your enemies. For example, the sniper can sarcastically mourn for you, or the medic class can play a sad violin for you.Fool-Proof Teamwork - The fact that you can be a medic, an engineer (who build machines to aid you and your allies) or a durable muscle-man who can take damage for you make sure that everyone isn't just stealing your kills, they're helping you get them as well!Cons:Intended Graphics - When Valve made Team Fortress 2, they made the characters and areas kind of cartoon looking, which can make it funnier or worse, depending on your play style.Gore - Unlike Half-Life 2 and Portal, Team Fortress 2 does have some notable gore in it. When you blow someone up, there limbs blow up in all directions in little bloody chunks.Please note that Team Fortress 2 can only be played online.-------------------------------------Well that sums up the Orange Box. It's definitely a steal, getting 5 games for the price of one, and all have good replay value. No inappropriate content, besides the gore in Team Fortress 2. Mild cursing in Half-Life 2, nothing major. I rate this game overall to have 4.5 stars, but Amazon won't allow halves.I hope you found this review helpful.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2010"}

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone.

Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"eternal now \"roejoerrer\"","summary":"Resident Evil delves deeper into action territory","reviewText":"We finally get a Resident Evil game for the next generation, only its an action game? In a strange twist, Capcom decided to go the Gears of War route and the end result is the new Resident Evil installation, which plays out more like a straight up third person shooter rather than a survival horror game. In fact there is really nothing much that fits into the 'survival horror' theme at all. Sure, there are infected people to kill, and there are giant beast bosses and other crazy things along the way, but nothing makes you jump, nothing scares you.Resident Evil 5 follows in Resident Evil 4's footsteps, and at times can feel like an extension of RE4. This is not a bad thing, as RE4 is widely considered to be the best Resident Evil game ever made.Resident Evil 5 is quite the straight forward shooter, with a few caveats. The in game menu is in real time, there is no pausing to grab an item from your inventory. Nope. You have to grab that medical spray can while the hordes of infected swarm around you. Thankfully you can map certain items to the directional pad, making for quick weapon/item switching on the fly.First off, Resident Evil 5 is the best looking game on the Xbox 360 and PS3 at the moment. It tops every other game in terms of visuals, and even edges above Gears of War in some respects. Realistic detail is everywhere, from the environments, clothes and skin. Animations are smooth and realistic. The environments are range from small desert shanty towns to underground caverns and temples, and each level looks absolutely gorgeous. The character models are insanely detailed and very lifelike. All in all a very impressive graphics package.One amazing new feature in Resident Evil 5 is the Co-op mode. You and a friend, or you and the computer can play together, and there are even melee combos and group QTE's throughout the game to keep the Co-Op useful. Also, your new A.I (or player) controlled partner Sheva tosses you ammo and health when she feels you need it. The A.I controlled Sheva can get a little too health and ammo happy, but its a nice feature.Story wise, Resident Evil 5 fits into the cannon somewhere, its not really important, but it involves another company and some infected folk. That's all you really need to know, oh and make sure to conserve ammo! While ammo drops are fairly common, you can run into the occasional dry area, and be forced to use your knife or the shock rod. The weapons are your standard variety: shotguns, machine guns, hand guns, rifle, rocket launcher, grenade launcher, grenades of all kinds. They all serve you well and are a blast to use.Each time you boot up the game to resume your place in the story you will be prompted to either manage your inventory, buy weapons and sell valuables found in the campaign, or upgrade your weapons. This mini store is a really cool addition to the game and upgrading your weapons is always fun.The game play can get rather intense as well, at times there will be up to ten infected stalking you, some with weapons of all kinds, others charging at full speed. These aren't your typical zombies, they can use weapons, move fast, ride motorcycles, and do all sorts of things.A couple of issues arise, you cannot reload or shoot while moving, which is kind of lame but does make sense in a sort of 'risk vs reward' sort of way. Kind of like the real time inventory menu.A mercenaries mode, a bonus menu and all sorts of unlockables add some replay value, but there is no multiplayer so to speak. Recently Capcom released a download that unlocks a multiplayer variant on your game disc, but you have to pay for it. This is a really cheap shot on gamers, and I think its kind of lame to have to pay for something thats already on the disc.Multiplayer ramblings aside, Resident Evil 5 is an awesome next generation representation of the Resident Evil franchise, with stunning graphics, intense game play and a semi replayable package.4/5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2009"}

Grab a cab and play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi.  Take a fire truck and earn money putting out fires. The game just never  gets boring.As in real life, there are consequences for your criminality. As your  random acts of mayhem mount up, the police start hounding you,  eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you  continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily  the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are  packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every  category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump  trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically  when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific  detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic,  pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing.  Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine  different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a  monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages  to get everything right.--T.

So I get it and play it. After 20 min of missions of killing things and blowing stuff up with practically no sense of purpose and any form of variety in the missions, I had to uninstall this game. Its horrible!!!  If you love games where its mindless killing (filled with great codes I should add), then go for it.

The new QB Vision Control lets you scan the field, look off defenders, and make perfect throws within your quarterback's unique field of vision. QB Precision Placement allows you to put the ball exactly where you want it.

As soon as EA signs an exclusive license deal with the NFL, they get lazy in their product.  Sure, the new quarterback feature adds another level of realism, but it was poorly implemented and needs a lot of work to bring it to where it should be.Pros:- The new quarterbacking system (thankfully it can be turned off) is a pretty cool idea.  Gone are the days when you can simply drop your quarterback 10+ yards behind the line of scrimmage and heave bombs to receivers you can't even see.  Defenders will now read your line of sight, allowing you to 'look off' a defender, or throw easy interceptions because you telegraphed your pass by not looking to other receivers.  I think this will be really cool when some of the bugs are worked out.  It's just clunky and you have far too many controller operations to pull off in a short amount of time.  Expect to be sacked 5 fold until you get comfortable with it.- The Superstar mode.  The ability to create a player, follow and shape his career.  Hire and fire your agent , determine your player's genetic makeup, score a part in a movie.- That's it...that's all that new in this freakin' game.Cons:This is where it get's fun...- Absolutely no change in presentation.  The game looks and plays (other than the quarterback mode, which thanfully can be disabled) exactly as 2005.  The only changes seem to be updated rosters and player ratings.  A huge disappointment considering they have exclusive rights to the ESPN presentation formerly held by NFL2K.  The commentary even seems to be identical.- Superstar mode kind of sucks.  Decisions you make seem to have little or no impact to your players ratings.  There just seems to be no logic in how different choices (and outcomes) affect your player.  This mode, while cool in theory, really was not played out well.- In the quarterback mode, if you throw a pass to a receiver not in your line of sight, you'll throw the most ridiculous 'dead duck' that you'll ever see.  These guys are NFL quarterbacks...I've see children that can throw a tighter spiral.- The online mode has a painful registration process.  You basically have to pay $2 to keep ESPN from spamming your email.  Infuriating.Bottom Line:Not only did EA get lazy as a result of the lack of competition in NFL video games (lack, how about none), but they bumped the price of the games back up to $50.  Save yourself the money and rent first.  I'll stick with 2005...","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2005"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J5UQ","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Keegan \"Keegs\"","summary":"Great Animation, Great Mature Story.","reviewText":"There is three things that is great about the game. It has incredible animation. You can catch the facial impressions of anyone and that leads into the second great thing about the game, it is the gameplay element to solve cases and using clues to interrogate people. You can see if their eyes twich, look a different way, or catch a little smirk on their face. The last thing is the story that these cases revolve around (especially the main story) a mature well told story that is unlike any game. The only other game that really has a realistic portrayed story was Heavy Rain. Its not about some super human, its about greed and corruption.Now the biggest negative is that game is done in a sandbox world which allows you to go anywhere but not do a lot of anything. You will have dispatch calls and each one is unique but you don't have the play ground that you done in Grand Theft Auto and Saint's Row games so it looks a bit misleading in its projection. Its still a great game and its focused on the story but one problem is that the story is already pre-determined, when you interrogate and make your decisions, there is no wrong choice that will impact the story in a different way.The gameplay is done well enough where its easy to aim and shoot. Its very similiar to Red Dead Redemption where it will auto lock-on to your enemies. The cover system works well. It does a good job transition from cut-scene to gun shoots. You will often find clues after or before these situations. In most cases you will arrive to a scene where a dead victim lies and you will have to investigate what happened. There is plenty of cases.The music is very fitting to the era and it looks like its in a 1940 Los Angeles and the game has a lot of influence from film noir and old school detective style crime solving. Now as you play you will have flash backs to when you (as Cole Phelps) to your service in WW2. There is a background story outside. Those segiments of your past will come back and play a role as you come across members of your squad through the game. Its a good game but not a great one. I recommend it to fans of story driven games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2011"}

{"product_name":"B008E6ZXTA","description":"","reviewerName":"DanD","summary":"A must-have collection for horror game lovers.","reviewText":"Okay, I'm not much into gaming history.  So I don't know if Doom was the first \"horror\" video game, or if it was Wolfenstein, or some other game entirely.  All I know is this: there was once a little kid who discovered a game called Doom II.  This kid played for hours and hours, and grew up into a borderline-stable adult.  Then he found that all three Doom games were being rereleased for the PS3.  This kid almost died of joy.The Doom world is a dark one.  You probably know this.  It's nice for me, coming back all these years later, with all the experience I have gained, and observing details that went right over my youthful head.  (And yes, in case you're wondering: I bought this collection primarily for the first two games, as I had never played Doom 3 before.)  For those of you who somehow missed out on having a demented childhood: you are a soldier.  You are fighting demons.  Sometimes with a chainsaw.  It's awesome.For the first two games, the graphics are about the same.  Gameplay/controls have been enhanced and modernized, yet none of the fun has been taken away.  (Trying to remember where all the secrets are will give you a headache, in the best way possible.)  Doom 3's gameplay is a bit stilted (a better weapons-select system would have been appreciated), and the loading times are a pain in the butt.  Still, it's pure, demon-slaying fun, with nice (if not revolutionary) 3D graphics.  On all three games, the sound is killer; normally I try to keep my volume down so as not to disturb my neighbors, but with this collection I just let 'em roar.  It's called \"atmosphere,\" something all three of these games have in spades.In short: the DOOM 3 BFG EDITION is a must-have if: 1) you played Doom back in the day and have missed it sorely ever since; 2) you love horror games and want to know their genesis; or 3) you're bored and want to kick some demon butt.  There's hours of fun here, not to mention multiplayer options (which I normally ignore, but here I'll give them a shot), new levels, etc.  If you are in any way disappointed with this collection, then you either have extremely high standards, or you're a demon and don't like to see your kin getting destroyed.  So sorry 'bout that.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"RPG Fan","summary":"One of the Best Console Games Available","reviewText":"I've never been a fan of the Resident Evil series so I can't provide the \"this Resident Evil is better than that one\" assessment, therefore my opinion is not as subjective.  I can say, however, that RE4 is truly one of the best console games I've ever played-- definitely on the top 5 list for the Gamecube.Playability is a 5.  I found myself disappointed after I had beat the game, not because it was short (it took me some considerable time to do), but because I was done and I wanted to play more.  It honestly is that great of a game,  I've even started playing it again.Graphics are top-notch and the atmoshphere created suits the mood of the story perfectly.  When \"El Gigante\" is pulled out you'll find yourself right beside the character, Leon, in disbelief that you know need to take out this monstrosity.  This game takes you in and along for the ride in entirety.My only complaint is this game does not have subtitles and/or captions during clip scenes.  There are many players out there like myself who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing and it is incredibly frustrating when captions are not provided in games.  About 25% of the American population has a hearing deficiency, that's 25% of the market the company is turning away and losing profits from.  Captions and Subtitles should be mandatory.Other than that one complaint this is an excellent game and a definite must-own.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2006"}

While this is nice, and adds a bit of flavor to the FPS genre, it does take some of the challenge away.Don't get me wrong, there's always the fight to stay alive, but it becomes more of a \"I just don't want to have to worry about playing that damn mini-game again\" type of deal.

I eventually purchased a PS3 remote for the Blu-Ray playback feature.After arriving, I never got around to setting it up until my 10 year old DVD player in my son's playroom started messing up.  I let him use the PS3 to watch his movies for the time being and I eventually set the remote up for him.  I have no complaints about the remote, it's a fully functional remote and if you used a remote for a standalone DVD or Blu-Ray player, this remote will be a breeze to use.  After setting it up, my son (8 years old) was able to use it without issue and didn't need me to show him anything.  Setup takes less than a minute and is easy to do.  Keep in mind however, that this remote communicates with the PlayStation via BlueTooth; not infrared, so the very popular line of Harmony remotes will not work with the PS3 or be able to \"learn\" this remote's functions.  This may be a slight problem for me in the future but for now it is not a concern.  Its only one extra remote laying around and my son basically took over the PS3 anyway.  I don't mind much since I only have two games for it which I've already beaten so I just leave it in the playroom for him to watch his movies.As far if you should buy it or not, it really depends on what you use your PS3 for.  It's an excellent remote, but if you have a standalone movie player that you already use to watch movies, then there is absolutely no need for this unless you are set on wanting to watch movies on the PS3 instead.  Additionally if you only have a handful of titles that you watch occasionally on the PS3, then you can probably get away with using the cumbersome PS3 controller for movie playback.  Bottom line, the PS3 is a gaming system; so while the price for this remote is fair, there is no need to spend the money on it if you are not using its movie playback feature frequently.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Sibelius","summary":"Not quite what I expected","reviewText":"With the combo of Squaresoft and Disney putting together an action RPG I sort of expected a whimsical gaming romp through a cotton-candy, brightly hued world full of laughs and amusements galore.  Was I ever surprised to discover that the finished product was mostly set in a dark, evil environment with difficult/challenging gameplay and a steep learning curve.  I'm guessing that a lot of 1st time RPG'ers probablly took a stab at this game with the belief that if it's a Disneyesque game how hard can it be? - only to quit the game midway through in frustration.In a nutshell this game is no leisurely stroll through the Magic Kingdom.  While Disney afficionados will no doubt be thrilled to explore worlds ranging from 'Aladdin,' to 'Nightmare Before Christmas,' they will just as well be shocked at the level of difficulty that players will be required to overcome.  Because of this, I would certainly not recommend this title to small children along with inexperienced gamers - which is quite ironic considering that this is the very demographic you would think the game would've been targeted towards.For the more hardcore gamer I would recommend the experience - 40 hour commitment notwithstanding.  Aside from the degrees of frustration you will face - there are also nuggets of memorable gameplay scattered throughout.  The summon spells utilizing Disney characters is one of them, and the gameplay set in the 'Winnie the Pooh' world offers a nice respite from the more frenzied settings in most of the game.  My chief complaint though is the awful game camera.  Much to my dismay, I found myself on the brink of motion-sickness on more then several occassions.  While the game falls short of the mark, i do have to give kudos to Squaresoft for attempting to take the risk of subverting the norms of the 'Disney' genre somewhat.  With that in mind I certainly look forward to seeing the sequel.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2004"}

Just in the character selection/creation screen they have the President from Metal Wolf Chaos, a game most gamers haven't even heard of.  Later I found a room dedicated to demon's soul and a town that sounded a whole lot like Corneria.For the well educated gamer this game will be pure bliss due to the abundant references.  For the newer gamers or folks who have fallen out of gaming recently they'll still get a good chunk of the references since many do come from very popular game series.In terms of gameplay it's simple and I'd say as a result of that it's unquestionably fun.  It plays like a classic Zelda game with a few differences.  Nothing major to point out, just slightly different.  6 main dungeons, 6 sages to meet, 6 spells to learn, and then the end boss stuff.  Plenty of optional locations to visit (even if many of them are simply to acknowledge another game) and plenty of additional items to collect (Like Zelda games maxing out your maximum health and magic will be a priority).The game may seem very easy in the videos due to the huge sword but you actually will have times when you're struggling for health.  Not saying the game is hard but it has just enough challenges to keep you on your toes.  The bosses have all been fantastic so far and they all make you figure out some type of strategy (and the game allows you to easily re-fight the bosses to get extra trophies).  The game requires a tiny bit of back-tracking (especially to get optional items) but items can be found or purchases to teleport you around quickly.The game offers absolute character customization (to the pixel, and easy to use!) a fun weapon upgrade system.For its budget price it's worth the MSRP, which you can't say about most games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

It knew, however, that it probably was never going to fill such storytelling shoes, but I don't think the game was a complete loss either.  I've often heard it told that many fans didn't like the story since it's a love story as opposed to a story where you have to save the world.  Granted, there's a bunch of sorceresses running around, messing things up, but it IS generally agreed that it takes a bit of a seat in the back compared to the more involved, psychological story of an antisocial kid destined for great things.Squall Leonhart is our protagonist.  Our Holden Caulfield.  Our kid that wants to make everything better, but doesn't want to be at the forefront of the stage.  Unfortunately, his talent quickly pushes him to the front and he is forced to lead his compatriots, SeeD (and one young love interest that's part of a rebel alliance to restore freedom), to destroy the sorceress(es).  He is more about questioning the world and his place in it, very teenage, instead of beating the crap out of the threat to the world.  A lot more effort was put into the questions of memory, place in the world, purpose, and love.  This, although brilliant for character development, left little time for us to enjoy or even feel motivated to kick some sorceress butt.  For that reason, the game gets four stars.However, there are still four stars to talk about.  The story is well thought out, if a bit obscure and sometimes too convenient (all orphans, really!).  We feel for the characters and may even feel akin to them and their internal or sometimes external debates.  The graphics, for the time of good ol' 1999, are amazing.  A mere two years after FFVII, the graphics took some serious leaps and bounds.  The gameplay graphics are almost identical, but the CG spectacular that you will be graced with was ahead of it's time (as proven by FFXI).  The gameplay is fun and there is PLENTY to occupy your time.  The draw system can be a pain in the ass, and then you never want to use magic 'cause it boosts your stats, but summons (Guardian Forces, GFs) and weapons prove to be more than what you need to not only get through the game, but excel at it.It's no VII, but as a separate entity (which is often difficult to convince oneself to do) it is a decent game.  It's getting progressively more difficult to find, hence the price, but if you want to blast away 80+ hours and reminisce on games before the 2000s, I'd recommend this one most definitely.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2013"}

In short, I was pleasantly surprised by this title.If anyone's familiar with Frontlines- Fuel of War (which was an excellent FPS), then you should feel right at home. Homefront cashes in on the possibility of war in America, except this time you're fighting against Koreans whereas, Frontlines, you fought against the Russians.The theme itself is highly comparable to FFOW, but in all honesty, Homefront doesn't accomplish the same \"gritty\" war atmosphere the way FFOW did.The story's quite forgettable, however, some events will happen which are included to give this game a \"moral factor. The very beginning of the game is epic and I must say that some parts were particularly brutal to say the least. Definitely reminiscent of FFOW, but that's where the similarities end.Onto the gripes-Graphics- In some levels the graphics seemed better than others, but to be honest, Homefront doesn't hold a candle to most FPS's. This is not to say the graphics are bad; because they aren't. But the little things which got on my nerves such as- Washed out colors, texture pop in and dull textures are not what I'd expect from a THQ game. Especially considering the vast library of games produced by THQ with good graphics.With that said, Homefront has it's moments but in comparison to Battlefield, Medal of Honor or even COD (the series I'm absolutely tired of playing), it doesn't stand a chance the least.Weapons- I wasn't blown away by any of the weapons besides the Shotgun, the \"Goliath\" and the \"Rocket Launcher\". Other than that, there are too many assault rifle variations for my taste. Some that have scopes, some with red dot sights or with \"flashy\" COD style lenses. You're given two types of handguns from what I saw and one type of Shotgun. But to be fair, there are a lot of different guns.Melee- I like a little melee in all my games. If I ever played a \"pure shooter\", I'd drop the controller altogether. With that being said, Homefront gives you a single melee move which is the same as COD, that being a quick knife stab. I wasn't particularly fond of this move being that it looks exactly like Call of Duty's melee.Story- The Resistance versus the Koreans in America. This was a decent concept and during some of the campaign it's pulled off nicely. However, I felt the story wasn't given enough of anything other than the feeling of being a rebel to free America. Your character isn't even given a decent background story other than him being a \"pilot\". There are certain points in which some characters display feelings for certain events (no spoiling), but again, not enough.My overall feeling of Homefront's story would be that it was loaded with potential and could've been a lot more.With that said, I'd still recommend this game. The gameplay's innovative, the graphics are decent, and for it's current price, you couldn't go wrong. I didn't bother with multiplayer being that I'm not a fan of it, but the campaign was pretty good.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J6DC","description":"","reviewerName":"Review Lover \"ReviewLover\"","summary":"Generic, average","reviewText":"Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is the current installment in Konami's revered and lauded gothic slash-em-up. I can't think of anything else to put in an introduction to this review - you play the Hero, another tortured Johnny Deadwife type, and you must stop the forces of darkness, and have a variety of weapons and techniques, some upgradeable, to assist you in this task. Blah blah blah.Since Castlevania 64, a Nintendo 64-exclusive in 1999, the series has attempted to break away from its traditional side-scrolling format with various degrees of success. While Castlevania: LOS does nothing unusual in its move to full-on 360 3D, particularly by today's adventure gaming standards, has the series managed to break free of the criticisms leveled at previous 3D installments of the franchise?GRAPHICS: 3/5There's better available for all platforms, so please don't buy this one expecting the usual Konami attention to detail. Environments and environmental effects are gorgeous, but as with most multi-platform releases, the bump mapping is turned up way too high, giving everything in the game world, particularly hair and fabric, a sort of plastic action figure look. Gabriel's wig is kind of ridiculous-looking, and Marie's head is modeled way out of proportion. Zobek could be lifted from any game, anywhere, anytime, and the creatures in the earlier levels are extremely generic, and unvaried. Facial animation just plain sucks - particularly when compared to the brilliant \"Enslaved - Odyssey To The West\", which I bought on the same day. Admittedly, things begin to look up by the time Gabriel fights the Ice Giant at the end of the first section of the game, and in the later stages, the level design improves a lot, which is a relief - but in terms of visuals, Castlevania: LOS is not the world-beater it needed to be.SOUND: 2/5Can you say generic? None of the usual Castlevania flair is evident in the game's soundtrack, and the A-List voices of Robert Carlyle, Natasha McElhone and Sir Patrick Stewart cannot help lift a tired, pretentious, Ye Olde Fakey Gothicy script past the mundane. The music is dull at all points of the game. At best, the sound design in Castlevania: LOS is functional. At worst, it's just plain boring.PLAYABILITY: 2/5There's nothing immediately wrong with the gameplay engine in Castlevania: LOS, but it will take you an hour or so before you realize why you're feeling so dissatisfied: this game plays like any other adventure game, just not as fluidly.There's nothing wrong with the game engine, per se - Gabriel moves and responds well enough, and - surprise surprise - there are some visibility issues with the fixed perspective camera, it's not enough to hamper the gameplay in a significant way. You collect experience to upgrade weapons and there are plenty of secret scrolls, health and magic upgrades to occupy your time when the screen is clear of baddies. So far, so usual.What kills Castlevania: LOS in the gameplay stakes is the stunning lack of identity in the game's engine, and the fact that the fixed perspective camera strips away any sense of real exploration of the game world. As you pass out of one camera perspective and into the next, the game effectively creates a series of \"rooms\" to explore. These rooms flick from one to the next with no thought given to how the level \"flows\", and several levels consist of many sequences of empty \"rooms\", so you dash through them only to find the level is over and you're another 5% done with the game.Castlevania: LOS has no identity to call its own. Gabriel fights like Kratos and moves like Batman, but lacks the freedom of movement of either of these characters to really be impressive. What he does within the game's limitations, he does well, but compare Castlevania: LOS to any of the God Of War games, and the similarities will be striking, but the comparisons unfavorable.LASTIBILITY: 2/5You can revisit old levels with newer power-ups and claim chests, artifacts and the usual adventure game ephemera, but beyond this there is little reason to come back to this software once complete. \"Batman: Arkham Asylum\" and \"inFamous\" are games that I go back to over and over again, for the sheer joy of playing an excellently engineered game in a beautiful setting. You won't want to do that with Castlevania: LOS. It's just not interesting enough.It's high time the Castlevania series went back to the gameplay-rich, exploration-heavy 2D games of old, and left the 3D shenanigans to more suitable protagonists. Creativity and gameplay excellence have gone out the window here, discarded in favor of impressive lighting effects and lazy scripting. Rent this first, and if you like it, wait for a pre-owned copy before  committing to buy. While Castlevania: LOS does nothing very wrong, it does nothing very right, either, and it's in this mediocrity that the heritage of an excellent series of games is totally lost.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2010"}

If you're new to things you'll see that the console ports of this game are getting rave reviews, while the PC version is being ranked as low as possible.  This is solely due to the changes made for the multiplayer component of the game, and not for much else.  Specifically you can't pick a dedicated server for the game, it picks one for you.Certainly the marketing has been more for the console ports, when I went to buy the game one vendor sold the PC port only online and the other had maybe 5 PC units and a whole shelf for the XBOX 360.I'll break my review into three parts for each mode of the game.  The single player mission I fault mainly for being too short (5 1/2 hours, I seriously did it in one night the first time), the extreme and unneeded violence of the airport level, and a general feeling we're playing a heavily edited version of the story where a lot of the linking elements are left out.  My problem with the airport level is the character goes literally in one scene change from soldier to undercover operative, and the massacre he's involved in is something they are trained to prevent, not to keep from blowing cover.  However this scene sets up the entire last half of the game so take it as you may.  The story felt like it was stretching to top the original, but considering how popular COD4 was this is expected.  Single player does offer repeated gameplay value and with experience is survivable even on the hardest setting.  The graphics were in general evolutionary as opposed to revolutionary, the outdoor scenes were more detailed and had better water/atmospheric effects.  You also get to shoot almost any exotic firearm made in the last twenty years.Spec Ops is probably the least useful game mode, where you play through various sections of the single player alone or with another player (as in a LAN Party) to beat scores, times, etc. It seems like something interesting when you're bored but I couldn't get very into it.And so now the multiplayer (let me zip on my flame proof suit first).  COD4 let PC players select their servers for the lowest ping and/or their \"favorites\" to play on, this made it easy for gaming clans to form.  People had fun.  In theory that's a great way to do things, except I kept seeing the same things happening--servers which banned \"cheaters\" but where the Admin and his friends would mysteriously do better than everyone else, bad attitudes from Admins who would randomly decide how the game should be played and which perks/weapons would be allowed and so on.  If COD4 allowed them to manually set up their servers so anyone coming in was locked into that type of game play it would okay, but it doesn't.  You have to be aware of what arbitrary rules the server has and play by them, and heaven help you if you had someone who would change things on the fly.  (Such as the lifetime ban I got on one server because someone started screaming this match was a knife fight only and didn't say he was the Admin, forgive me for asking just who he was.)So now MW2 picks the server and players for you.  Much wailing and gnashing of teeth was held at the game's release as pings were bad, but then there was an enormous number of people starting out, that was expected.  So I've played it for several hours, and you know what?  It's a good game and I LIKE IT BETTER this way.  There's more perks, weapons, and maps, and in general a lot more to do with the game.  True, it feels a little cartoony, but that's all.  For the last few weeks I've had good pings and not much problem playing.  And it's a relief to know I can just log in, select a match type, and just play the game as it is.  No one complaining not to use Martyrdom or rockets or Last Stand, no tough guys behind a microphone making up rules, none of that.  I imagine if I play long enough I'll start running into the same people but it's nice to not have someone who always dominates the game or who wants to get \"revenge\" because you beat them last time and they start team killing you.  I think some people are getting so upset because they're perpetually getting out of a comfort zone where they can win all time.  Too bad, I just play the game and enjoy it--that's all this is, isn't it?And yes, I know there's a hack now that allows people to select servers. No thank you, I won't be using it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000MK694E","description":"Take2 Games BioShock 21962 PC Games","reviewerName":"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","summary":"The definitive dystopia","reviewText":"I'll be forthright- I'm not normally what one would call a fan of shooters in general. I generally don't buy them for full price, and even when supposedly 'great' FPS games end up in the bargain bin, I usually end up passing them up for something else. With Bioshock I made a rare exception, and admittedly this was partly because of the sheer eye candy evident in screenshots. What really drew my attention, however, was the setting of the game.To put things as simply as possible, it wasn't a disappointment in any way, shape, or form. FPS purists beware- this game isn't much of a challenge. You can almost certainly finish it on normal difficulty even if you've never played a shooter before and have a near total lack of fast reaction time and hand-eye coordination. The game includes hints and an arrow that guides you to each objective, and if you die you're not penalized in any way. In fact, sometimes its advantageous to die to regain some health/eve without using your finite store of medkits and hypos. Additionally, enemies do not regenerate health unless- in some cases- they find a med station. These stations can be destroyed, which you usually end up doing anyway since they drop free medkits. After that, you can repeatedly attack enemies (dying along the way) until they get worn down by sheer perseverance on your part. Aside from all this, it's entirely possible (even- some may say- encouraged) to finish the whole game using nothing but your monkey wrench.This isn't to say that the weapons and shooter mechanics aren't done well. They are, and (especially in the case of plasmids) are quite interesting to play with. However, the action is just a sideshow for the real meat of the game, which is the setting. The city of Rapture is an incredible portrayal of dystopia: a magnificent underwater settlement that is a mix of sci-fi futurism and 50s-era glamour. It's all fallen apart, but you can see everywhere how magnificent it must have once been. It doesn't hurt that the game has a great story to go with the view, and the entire package is both attractive and compelling enough to keep you moving.The game plays quite well on my year-old machine, though I did see some stuttering an lag in certain areas. The areas and characters generally look excellent, and most are destructible and affected by realistic physics. In particular, water effects are incredible- the best I've seen in any game to date.As of now, there is no multiplay in Bioshock. The game includes some role-playing elements that facilitate replay, including multiple possible endings, plasmid and weapon upgrade choices, and- usually- optional areas and multiple ways to meet objectives. You have two resources in the game- money and ADAM- which are used to buy assorted goods (ammo, medkits, etc) and plasmids, respectively. You can also occasionally find random items that can be combined into ammo or other goodies at U-Invent stations. Additionally, any of the vending machines and stations can be hacked, which provides some additional benefit- usually more items or lower prices. In the case of many locked doors and safes, you have the option to hack or enter a combination. Audio diaries left by Rapture residents can leave hints as to these and other puzzles, and also serve to move the plot along.Though Bioshock isn't exactly challenging, it does offer many moments of intense first-person action that really gets your pulse pounding. It often doesn't matter that you know you'll respawn if you die, because that charging Big Daddy just LOOKS scary. Additionally, the game does get gradually more difficult as your progress, to match your ever-growing arsenal and (one would hope) skills. There are also 3 difficulty settings if you really need to make it harder.The bottom line is, Bioshock is a great game because of its setting and story. The technology is impressive as well, but the game doesn't rely solely upon it (as all too many recent games do). If you're looking for a challenge, then you might be disappointed. However, if you're just looking to have a good time, then this is perfect for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2007"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYLRK","description":"","reviewerName":"Gustavo \"VidGame Junkie\"","summary":"Propped up too much... but still good.","reviewText":"My first Xbox game was the fabled Assassin's Creed, where you roam the ancient world as the legendary assassin, Altair. Progressing into the later games, I ruled Italy as Ezio. Needless to say that I am a huge fan of the series. As soon as I heard that AC3 was coming, I was stoked. Trailers revealed a new way of looking at the AC universe with the introduction of a new game engine and loads of new mechanics. The game was propped up to look like a major blockbuster, blowing the other AC games out of the water. Unfortunately, it didn't make it as such. High expectations were not met, though were attempted valiantly. For me to explain, let's proceed to specifics.Before you play as the advertized Conor, you play as Haytham Kenway. The game does a very fine job at introducing Kenway's personality as well as the new mechanics for the game itself. After some plot progression, you play as young Conor in his native american villiage learning the basics of hunting, hiding, and the new tree running feature. The sad occurence within Conor's childhood most certainly will grab a few hearts, as well as heat a sense of revenge that Conor will have throughout the game. Along with this, you play as Desmond, the modern assassin from the series, in a series of short missions between Animus gameplay, which works well in keeping it short and sweet. The main objective hasn't really changed at all in the series: kill the Templar targets throughout the game to the head honcho.The story itself has some major drawbacks. Conor himself is very unlikeable. He has more of an attitude problem than Altair (which I had believed Conor would resemble after seeing so much Ezio). Even after Conor's training, he is still annoyingly impulsive and brash. Moving on to the ending of the game; without spoiling anything, the ending was very poor, in my opinion. An entire cinematic within the ending sequence is even not needed and only used to show off the detail an artistic nature of the developers. Aside from those things, the story is average and memorable in some cases. Some parts do get you involved, while others won't.Now, the main buzz about this game in the commercials was the epic battles. The trailer showing Conor rushing through an entire field of redcoats and seamlessly making his way past them...remember that? Unfortunately, that is not what is given. They were speaking truth about being able to add hundreds of npc soldiers in the area, but, especially in a mission similar looking to the trailer, it is very scripted and it averts you from doing all that epic stuff. However, the combat is true to the commercials. The combat is greatly improved and equally easy to master. The added amount of animations keeps things fresh, and strategy amongst numerous types of enemies keeps things challenging.Tree-running (the forest version of free-running) was another added feature that does very well to impress. The general speed in which Conor can climb is much faster than what Ezio could do even with a hookblade when he was 25. There are still rooftops to prowl in this game, but the guards on the roofs are even more touchy about you being up there. It almost disuades you from even thinking of rooftop exploration since the guards give you little time to get out of their sight.There are also naval missions in this game, which have really helped this game out. You captain your own ship and ride out into battle. They are immersive and visually exciting, and the naval battles are awesome. These missions are probably AC3's best feature.The crafting system is an intersting addition....but it is really pointless. Much like the renovation you did in previous games, you hire people to settle into your (newly found) property. In turn, you can craft different items (using the skills of your artisans as well as the things they make or find) that you can sell via sending a convoy to general stores. However, the rewards are not worth the effort. The only good thing about crafting (aside from some extra cash) is being able to craft weapons that you don't find in the stores, but you only get access to even the least valuble weapons (in terms of stats) after doing your renovation missions close to full. It is something that was certainly given too much time on.Some of the side missions are pointless as well, aside from achievements in collectables. Two of the sets of collectables don't really reward you with anything worth the effort. One offers you extra side missions when you collect enough and eventually a final reward, but even that doesn't even help out much in other missions. The game also has the return of Assassin recruits, with the mini-game of sending the recruits to other areas of the country to liberate from Templar control. The mini-game is much less frustrating, but the use of recruits is more so. I personally prefer to do things myself without extra help, but I can even tell that the Assassin recruits don't offer much more help than before. They have a wider range of abilties, some of which are useful, but I recommend keeping them out of battle.Sadly, once you get to a point where you feel that you've achieved enough in the game, there is a chance to get bored with it. After plowing through the game myself, I just found a lack of things to do. The game does offer some little mini-games (much like things from Red Dead Redemption), but they are easily ignored. I have played through the entire game without playing a single mini-game, aside from ones that are part of the story. I basically killed off the entire army in my free-roam runs, and even with the new and improved combat, it does get old.Finally, after the main story is finished, you are put in an epilogue so that you may continue your assassin business in colonial America. You are then introduced to an extremely obvious rushed portion of the game called Pivots. A complicated explanation for a relatively simple way of working the things; it'd be best to just watch YouTube videos to see how it works. Basically it unlocks cheats, much like the previous AC games. Once you unlock them all, they are pretty fun to run around with.I can't speak much on Multiplayer since I haven't touched that portion, but I hear nothing but good news. Yet, I think that the developers almost killed the single player portion by spending too much time and focus on the multiplayer portion.In the end, Assassin's Creed 3 will most likely not satisfy the expectations that have been built over the course of its initial advertizing, but that is not to say that the game doesn't impress. Though it may not be the best game of the series, it can be considered a welcome addition to it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2012"}

It's based on the same comic book series that show is based on, yes, but that's all. So I could not play as Rick or Shane, or watch the thrilling AMC opening credits, or even hear the haunting theme song of the show. No cameos by the stars of the show? Very disappointing. You'll see Glen, but it isn't Glen, if you know what I mean.Next, when is it time to actually play this game? Mostly, you're just watching cut-scenes or turning pages in the screenplay by clicking dialogue buttons. Not that the story isn't good, but I mean, come on! Isn't this supposed to be a video game? Aren't we supposed to be doing something?We need to shoot zombies, gather weapons and supplies (food, ammo, water), improve our skills, map territories, locate goodies, earn VALID trophies, etc. etc. But there is almost none of that.It's a good plot, yes. You play Lee, a convict who may or may not have murdered his wife's lover when the world goes all to zombie heck. You run into a little girl named Clementine who needs protection. Then you encounter other survivors with their own secrets and troubles and prejudices, and must decide how to deal with them. The high or the low road? Save the girls or just look out for number one? All good, except again, you're not really doing anything but flipping through several versions of the same screenplay, are you? What's fun about that?It did entertain me. That's why I give it three stars. But you don't really play the thing. And as far as this being a new direction in gaming? I certainly hope not, because it isn't worth your time or money.The selling point here was that you had to make your own decisions in this zombie-infested universe (much like Rick has to do in the AMC series), and those choices affect what happens next. I can't deny that. The product delivers. But it's just not a satisfying experience.The graphics are well done. Many of the sets worthy of a real Walking Dead Episode. Some of the ideas are genuinely intriguing, like a community who takes \"survival of the fittest\" literally, reimposing a kind of social Darwinism in an attempt to survive.

{"product_name":"B00BGA9YZK","description":"","reviewerName":"GarionOrb","summary":"Great gameplay and GORGEOUS graphics with a very subpar story...","reviewText":"Killzone: Shadow Fall was billed as the PlayStation 4&#8217;s killer app.  The game that truly showed off what the system can do.  It would serve to introduce us to next-gen visuals, and solidify Killzone as a franchise to be reckoned with.  Killzone needs that recognition&#8230;Guerilla Games has been steadily improving the series throughout its iterations, and frankly, it&#8217;s ALMOST there.Killzone: Shadow Fall is without a doubt the most beautiful-looking shooter I&#8217;ve ever played.  No joke.  If you want a good example of what the PS4 can do, this game is it.  Unlike the drab earth tones prevalent in Killzones 2 and 3, Shadow Fall is bright and colorful and crisp.  It almost makes this seem as though it&#8217;s an entirely different game.  In so many ways, this shows off the new system and its features while providing the tightest and most satisfying gameplay this series has ever seen.  That tightness is due in no small part to the DualShock 4 controller.  It is as central to this game as shooting a gun at angry Helghast soldiers.  From the game&#8217;s perfect use of the touchpad to the amazing triggers and analog sticks, I found the actual use of the controller to be a huge part of my enjoyment with this game.In this game you play as Lucas Kellan, an orphaned boy who becomes a Shadow Marshal in a world set 30 years after the events of Killzone 3.  The Helghast now share a planet with the Vektans, with a massive wall erected between the two.  Not surprisingly, things are tense.  Kellan is sent on a variety of missions to recover a Helghan weapon, and along the way meets several other characters throughout beautiful and varied environments.  The most obvious difference between this and past entries is the variety in gameplay.  Whereas Killzones 1-3 were one shooting gallery after another, Shadow Fall changes things up.  Sometimes you get tense shoot-outs, but there are also exploration sections, stealth sections, parts where you&#8217;re floating in space, and a few optional objectives thrown in for good measure.  It all lends itself to an experience that doesn&#8217;t get dull.  One level in particular mixes up all these different styles of play and it&#8217;s one of the greatest moments in a first-person shooter I&#8217;ve played.Also new to the mix is your own personal drone called an OWL.  The OWL can attack enemies for you, provide a shield for cover, act as a zipline to get to other parts of the level, or give an EMP pulse to stun enemies or disable their shields.  Also, it is used to hack computer terminals, which effectively eliminates the need for annoying hacking minigames, and to revive you if you have adrenaline packs available.  You select the OWL&#8217;s actions by swiping up, down, left or right on the touchpad, then use the L1 button to deploy.  This mechanic works phenomenally.  It&#8217;s very natural and surprisingly non-intrusive given how touch controls are normally implemented in games.  Best of all, this is the most you&#8217;ll ever use the touchpad.  The OWL is a great new tool that really enhances the game, especially in later levels where you have to switch its functions frequently.The game&#8217;s 10-hour single-player campaign is one of the best in Killzone history, but it&#8217;s brought down by the most poorly-told story I&#8217;ve seen in a while.  Honestly, I could barely follow the plot.  The game does a very poor job at backstory, and it&#8217;s difficult to know exactly why you&#8217;re doing what you&#8217;re doing.  The characters&#8217; motivations are either not very apparent, or painfully one-dimensional.  A few interesting villains pop up, but they&#8217;re barely in the game&#8230;one disappears completely with no explanation.  And worse yet, the story gets more vague the further in you get, and by the game&#8217;s conclusion it seems the writers just stopped caring.  The ending to this game is horrible&#8230;seriously it&#8217;s as though they needed to end it quick and came up with something so nonsensical I can barely find the words to describe it.  This is truly a tragedy because when combined with the wonderful art direction, soundtrack and beautifully-rendered graphics, the story could&#8217;ve been absolutely epic.  Instead it&#8217;s as though it was written by monkeys.  As a result, this brings Killzone: Shadow Fall squarely in the &#8220;just ok&#8221; category.Multiplayer is pretty strong.  I&#8217;m not much of a multiplayer guy, but I played a couple of matches and was pleased with what I saw.  The maps were large, and I love the rotating objectives.  If I were the kind of gamer who reveled in this, I could see myself spending many hours with it.So as long as you&#8217;re not expecting a good story, Killzone: Shadow Fall is a pretty good game.  Plus it&#8217;s good for fans and those who are new to the series.  And did I mention this game is beautiful to behold?  3.5 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles combines first-person, light-gun style combat with interactive pathways, multiple weapons and new enemies to create an entirely new Resident Evil experience that could only be delivered on the Wii.","reviewerName":"The Matrix Fan \"Video Gamer since 1979.\"","summary":"A fun Wii game, 4 S.T.A.R.S.","reviewText":"+ Pros:+ Combines storylines from Resident Evil , 1, 3, and a new chapter+ Answers questions about the events between/during each game+ Easy controls+ 3 difficulty levels+ 15 Upgradeable weapons- Cons:- No stage for Resident Evil 2- On-rail movement makes it easy to miss collectables- Similar frustrations like those in House of the Dead- Takes a long time to unlock co-op mode- \"Zombie Group Gang-up\" and \"PTRBOYD!\"I've been a fan of the Resident Evil series ever since it appeared in 1996, so once I purchased a Wii, I knew I had to add this game to my library.The Storyline:Each of the Resident Evil games (, 1, 3) are divided into 3 stages to play through as either a female or male character. Each stage covers various plot elements while going through the train car (Resident Evil ), the Arkalay mansion (Resident Evil) or the streets of Raccoon City (Resident Evil 3).With superior gameplay, stages become available that answer questions previously unknown to Resident Evil enthusiasts (like how Albert Wesker escaped the Arkalay mansion).The Controls:As with most Wii games; the controls are very easy to use. The Wiimote is used to aim your shots, and the B button serves as the trigger. If the A button is held down, the Wiimote can now be used as a knife, or grenades can be thrown using the B Button. The C button allows you to choose different weapons. The control stick is for the camera.This game is compatible with theWii Zapper, though I personally haven't found the need to use it.The Weaponry:One faithful staple of the Resident Evil franchise (since Resident Evil 3) is the ability to upgrade weapons - and Umbrella Chronicles is no exception. Each of the 15 weapons you find can be maximized for firepower, firing speed, capacity and reload speed, using the Point Stars you earn from completing stages.The Gameplay:Each level is in a first-person perspective. Since this is an on-rail shooter, the camera moves automatically from start to finish - using the control stick provides a very slight freedom of movement. Zombies, dogs, bats, Crimson Heads, and other monsters come towards you. If a zombie grabs you, moving the Wiimote quickly enough grants the player a chance to escape unharmed. There are weapons, herbs, and even secret Umbrella files hidden throughout every stage. When a stage is completed, you are graded on the following items:Clear Time (how quick you finished the stage)Enemy Hits (how many monsters you killed)Critical Hits (how many zombies/Crimson Heads killed with perfect headshots)Objects Destroyed (items such as lights, chandeliers, boxes, etc)Files Obtained (how many hidden files you collected)Getting an \"S\" ranking not only gives you the highest amount of Point Stars, but it also opens up other stages where you can play as other characters like Ada Wong, Albert Wesker, and others.The Cons:I was very surprised to see that Resident Evil 2 was not a playable stage, since it's not only the best-selling game in the Resident Evil franchise, but it's the #2 bestselling game for Capcom (source: geek.com). However, I learned that the success of this game has spawned a sequel called \"Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles\", which will be based on the events of Resident Evil 2.The same issue from House of the Dead which irritated me is also in the Umbrella Chronicles: we only have a limited window of opportunity to find secret files or powerups on the screen. If we miss that window, there is usually no second chance, and we typically have to start the stage over. Since the camera movements in Umbrella Chronicles are nowhere near as jarring or as fast as those in House of the Dead, this makes it a little easier to find powerups and hidden items.Co-op mode can only be unlocked by beating the 4th survivor mission of a hidden character. This is a very time-consuming task which should have been available from the get-go, in my opinion.Now, let's say your character has two or more zombies or Crimson Heads directly in front of you. If one of them tries to bite you, shaking the Wiimote allows you to escape. However, after the cutscene ends, the second zombie will gang up on you with a punch that's almost always unblockable - hence my term, \"Zombie Group Gang-up\". Normally this can be avoided by shooting earlier, but it's harder to get critical hits from far away.The last con stems from a gameplay element introduced in Resident Evil 4. There are moments in each stage when the screen goes inverse for a moment, and the character(s) face an obstacle that requires the player to push the A button or the B button or the A + B buttons or to shake the Wiimote. This is a very frustrating segment I used to call \"PRESS THE RIGHT BUTTON OR YOU'RE DEAD!\" but it was shortened to \"PTRBOYD\".If you like on-rail shooters for the Wii likeHouse of the Dead 2 & 3, this is the game for you. However, if you're more of a Resident Evil purist and like the older gameplay styles, pick up the Gamecube versions and have a blast.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2009"}

I didn't level my character all the way to 20 nor did I even come close to finishing all the side quests or finding all the areas on the map.High points:Game detail is stunning to say the least.  The atmosphere, soundtrack, and overall experience is one of the best I have seen.  The only drawback are some of the character / NPC animations that are not as smooth as I have seen elsewhere.  Secondly, the wasteland, vaults, destroyed towns, subways, and the greater DC area are exceptional.  The level of detail these guys put into this is simply amazing.  Additionally, this for me is what clearly separates and places this above Oblivion.  The graphics are a notch higher, and the feel of the game is so much more engrossing.Quests.  The main questline is excellent, however very short.  The sub-quests and side quests I have played are also very interesting with some really interesting plot lines and goals.  You also get some great rewards for completing many of them.Combat is a huge step ahead of Oblivion and IMO is much better than the previous fallout games.  Its similar to the old Tactics game where you can play in real time than switch over to turn based.  However Fallout 3 is much more fluid.  In addition, with VATS you can add a lot more strategy to what you do, versus the old swing madly and back up or side step like is the standard fare in Oblivion.  One of the best aspects of the game.Leveling system.  If you are familiar with the fallout SPECIAL and perk system than you will be familiar with this.  They did some tweaking (anyone miss the gifted trait??) however it does much more to balance the game out.  After playing for awhile I am glad they ditched the traits and gave you a perk every level.  Also capping skills at 100 was the best way to go with the level cap.Re-playability is excellent.  After I finished the game as a virtuous sharpshooter I started a new character that is a melee bad karma master.  Its a lot different and I am still having a great time with it.Low Points:Buddy AI.  Later in the game you start to get followers that will tail you around and help with combat.  The AI they use, while 80% of the time is fine, can sometimes be a big pain in the neck.  Example is that my aforementioned character was a sniper.  So I stealthed around to pop critical headshots whenever possible.  Even after telling my follower to use ranged weapons, often she would charge ahead with her super sledge and engage in melee.  So I couldn't get a clear shot and have to maneuver around to find an angle.Game difficulty.  After you get your power armor and plasma rifle, you 1-2 shot just about everyone.  I had to put the difficulty up just to make it more challenging.  In addition, when you have your mini-gun wielding companion, the difficulty generally takes a turn to the easy side as well.  You can put the game up to very hard difficulty which is challenging, however I think they should have tweaked it a bit more to level it out at the same difficulty level.I also have a small gripe with some of the perks.  It seems that as you level some of the perks you get higher up just aren't worth much and some make you very powerful.  It would have been nicer to see more perks that opened up more quest lines or portions of the game that would have not been available otherwise to balance out some of the purely combat enhancement oriented perks.Another petty complaint is that you pop heads off of baddies like a drunk popping caps off a free case of bud light.  Pretty soon every critical hit is a head flying through the air.  Cmon DEVS!! I wanna see... something different once in awhile....Noted Complaints from some other reviews.I have played both the PC and the XBOX 360 version.  If you have the machine for it, then get the PC version.  The graphics on the highest setting are unbelievable and much better than the XBOX version.  Also, DOWNLOAD it.  If you get it from Direct2Drive or a similar vendor you don't have the DRM / disk check hassle that everyone has been QQing about.Crashes and bugs.  Didn't notice any on the XBOX version and had 2 crashes on the PC version.  Both occurred at transition load points and both occurred after an auto save (the game auto saves A LOT)so it was not a hassle at all.  The game was much more stuttery and had sluggish load times on the XBOX while compared to the much more fluid experience on the PC (another reason why I recommend this version).Ammo, automap, and other gameplay issues.  It seems from some of the other reviews that some people have been having issues with having not enough ammo, weapons, etc.  I didn't have much of an issue with this.  If you run out of ammo, find a small town, and go raider hunting.  Loot - sell - buy ammo from stores / traveling merchants and BAM! you have much more ammo than you can shoot.  I was selling the stuff later on cause I had so much to spare.The map can be a hassle because it is a linear, single level affair and often your subways/buildings/ruins you are questing through are multi-level and not projected in 3D on your map.  Hey, it adds to the challenge.  It lets you know the  quest ends at the top NW corner of the map for instance, but doesn't lead you by the nose to get there.  Only one quest had me really pissed off - a multi floor warren of half collapsed sky scraper in downtown DC.  But other than that they were pretty much straight forward.As far as not having a bed, nowhere to repair, blah blah blah these people didn't play the game very much or just didn't understand it.  There are quests to get your own house, decorate it, your own room in a hotel, etc..  Also, you can repair your own items from like items you loot or pay vendors.  I don't understand how anyone with half a brain who has played the game for more than 2 hours can really complain about any of that.Overall, I don't think the negatives impact on the overall experience much.  I enjoyed the experience and place the game right next to Planescape: Torment as one of my top 2 fav RPGs of all time.  Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0000DJX7I","description":"Praised for brilliant scripts and open-ended gameplay, vilified for unapologetic violence and mature themes,Grand Theft Autohas deservedly become one of the most popular game franchises in history. This double pack contains the full versions of bothGrand Theft Auto IIIandGrand Theft Auto III: Vice City, enhanced for Xbox. Xbox gamers can rejoice that the grand king of video games--The Sopranoswith a gamepad--is finally available on the big black box.Grand Theft AutoWithGrand Theft Auto IIIRockstar proves that not all developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games. This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking more structure can embark on dozens of missions driven by a genuinely interesting crime-story plot or steal cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and you can go on vigilante missions. Grab a cab and you can play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi. Take a fire truck and you can earn money putting out fires. The minigames are a good way to unwind after a particularly difficult mission. With so much to do, the game just never gets boring.As you'd expect, there are consequences for criminality. As your random acts of mayhem mount up the police start hounding you, eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic, pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing. Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerGrand Theft Auto III: Vice CityHow big is this game? Even publicists for other games end up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto IIInever dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops.

{"product_name":"B000W5Y49G","description":"The Wii Zapper is a gun peripheral that allows the user to insert a Wii Remote and Nunchuk, both sold separately, into either end and play a compatible game. The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. The Zapper comes withLink's Crossbow Training, which helps to familiarize the player with the Zapper in a shooting gallery style game.Link's Crossbow Trainingcontains three game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger.Features:Target Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.Defender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.Ranger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments.The Wii Remote and Nunchuk are sold separately","reviewerName":"Hongster","summary":"Zapper Review","reviewText":"For those who are looking to buy a gun peripheral I would recommend you to buy the NYKO PERFECT SHOT!  It is so much superior to the Zapper in so many ways and the best part you don't have to hold the gun with 2 hands, it's an option and not required.  Well unto the review for the Zapper.The Zapper needs to be held with both hands for you to use.  You do not have the option to hold it with one hand and expect to play any game using it.  Because of this nature, your aim will be slowed down when compared to holding the Wii remote by itself.  In addition the trigger takes a bit more time to register than pressing the 'B' button by itself on the remote.  Now the reason why this is any good is for 2 reasons:1. It comes with a game and it is pretty decent (+2 Stars)2. It is better than some of the other guns that are for sale (+1 Star)For those who want the real light gun experience on the Wii will buy the NYKO Perfect Shot as there is no real substitute for it (as of this time) If you really want the Zapper anyway for the Link Crossbow game then it merits a purchase as well, though if you are only considering for the gun peripheral then this is not the right purchase for you.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2007"}

No real variety.*  Repetitive levels - You get 3 areas of Springfield, yet you play the missions twice during the story mode...daytime and evening.*  Levels not very interactive - Sure, you get X number of gags in each level, but you can't interact with most pedestrians, you can't do much exploring (most yards you can't enter, very few buildings to enter, etc)*  Limited number of characters to play as - It'd be nice if you could complete some of the levels with different characters.  Sure, Marge and Lisa have a place in the story line, but wouldn't it be fun to play as Willy, or Fat Tony, or someone different?  Some characters are just bland and it'd be nice to be able to change the pace a bit.*  Replay value is nearly nil.  Once you defeat the main story, what else is there?

The second game is back with more mini-game fun that's fun for single players as well as groups.You really don't care about the premise in these games, but here is is. You go to different parts of the globe and are trying to learn to \"act like the locals\". In usual quite tongue-in-cheek fashion these activities are completely non-PC. For example, while exploring the US you do things like yap incessantly on the phone in a movie theater, or whack your kids for acting up on a road trip.What makes the game great is that every mini-game uses the Wii in a different manner - and they're all quite fun. You're \"spider rabbit\" soaring along a city street. Being a Rock Band fanatic, I love the rock band part where you play along on drums, brass, guitar or mic on flower power songs.As you move along through the world, you unlock new games, new costumes, and much more. My boyfriend loves the plunger shooting games. I like the music games. If you play with young kids, you can easily find many games that are great fun to play together. If you've got a group of adults over, it's just as fun with them.The graphics are very well done. Yes, this is a Wii and hot a high-def PS3 or 360, but even so, when you look at the detail in the leaves on the trees or the cracks in the city streets, it's really hard to complain. They do an awesome job here with the capabilities of the Wii. The sound is just as good - the right balance between cartooney fun and realistic noises.On one hand, I'm sure every person can pick out a certain mini-game and say \"I really don't like X\". However, I bet you I could easily find another 10 people who adore that game.Another caveat is that some of the games get a bit *too* silly. In one game the characters eat a lot of chili and therefore \"fart\" themselves along a path. If you're easily offended, you might not enjoy this.Still, if you've got a good sense of humor, this game has a lot to offer! Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2008"}

It's meant to be enjoyed by two, three or four players.  The sheer silliness of the games with things like shooting at the Rabbids with plungers makes it fun.

Mass relays were discovered making it possible to travel great distances in short time. The citadel is home to the council that governs all of space in an alliance of several alien races. A mysterious force is threatening all sentient life and you must locate the source. Spectres are elite warriors sanctioned by the council. No human has ever become a spectre yet. Humans want to be a part of the council, but there race hasn't proven itself yet.Gameplay: 3rd-person shooter. You travel around the universe as an Alliance military soldier named Commander Shepard tracking down Saren, a rogue spectre, trying to unravel the mystery behind his betrayal to the council. Once you take on the job, you become a spectre yourself. You have a space shift named the Normandy with a full crew. You have missions that advance the plot and tons of side missions along the way. Some of the side missions include exploring each solar system for metals and supplies. Each solar system has a planet that you can land on to explore. You explore the planet in a motorized vehicle and on foot. You have a radar that lets you know what is nearby such as deposits of medal. Once you examine the deposits, they are flagged and collected by the Alliance. There are tons of planets to explore in this manner, which can become more tedious over time. You also examine the solar system from space, scanning planets and asteroids for deposits and usable materials. On plot-advancing missions, you are generally on foot and have 4 different weapons to use including pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, and sniper rifles. You can also use grenades. You can buy weapons on planets with an armory but most of your weapons and armor upgrades will come from searching enemies' corpse, containers, etc. You have multiple party members but only 2 can be with you on missions. You have to upgrade their weapons and armor. Each character levels up and you can choose multiple categories to distribute your talent points such as each weapon class, bionics, tech, and special class abilities such as soldier, spectre, etc. There are multiple locations to explore including the citadel. Each location has unique side missions. Dialogue is a choice based similar to Jade Empire and Knights of the Old Republic. You can converse with all your side kicks and get to know them (you even get to share a bed with one of them if you talk to them enough). Conversations are the method in which you can be good or evil based on your dialogue selection. In Mass Effect 2, they call it renegade as bad. You are given several choices in plot missions that affects last into the next game, such as saving certain people, creatures, the council, etc.Conclusion: the controls are easy, the graphics are excellent. The story is engaging. It definitely leaves you wanting more. Pick up Mass Effect and start the trilogy off right. You won't regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2011"}

I am an old Civ fan since the first version so I was excited about how this would be on a console. I am very happy with the result.I've read other reviews that are knocking the game's short length and lack of options, but I think those people are missing the point of this game. This is not Civ for the PC. This is as close to pick-up-and-play Civ as you can get and still retain the deep level strategy aspect of it.Some would argue that since it has been scaled down that it loses its deep strategy. I disagree. After all, chess is a game with only 64 square and 16 pieces but unlimited depth of strategy.The graphics are more than good enough for a game like this. With this being a turn-based strategy I wasn't expecting much, so I actually think the animations are just overkill.I do have some gripes. I would have liked the world to be bigger. I like the exploration aspect of the game and with its limited size, you've seen everything in the first hour or so. Also, I expected a greater variation of units, helicopters, jet planes, APCs, snipers, etc.Give the demo a try, you may like it.

The AI customizations were also good, though I wish there were alot more. Overall I would have to say that the AI is not for me and I really don't prefer it over the way FF8, FF10, or even FF12 was. Why is it such a bad thing to want to control my characters? I would just love to not be disconnected from the battles in the next installment. I hope that FF14 will return to the way FF has always been and get rid of the AI...unless they can improve on it greatly. Key word: greatly.And the final boss was a joke.

{"product_name":"B00CMQTVUA","description":"","reviewerName":"JoshJosh","summary":"Updated Review Now With Working Unit!","reviewText":"I am writing an updated review now that I have a working system and have played with it for a little bit. I'll keep my old review down on the bottom.I've been trying to use the system as Microsoft intended: Kinect, cable box, SmartGlass, etc. For the most part I am really impressed with what they have done. Setup was fairly easy even though I needed a few tweaks hidden in the options. The integration of the cable box to the interface is really good. The voice commands work very well, as does the auto sign-in. Kinect as an IR blaster works far, far better than I thought it would. I had to specify my soundbar and TV but once I did that, it worked great. The controller is an excellent upgrade over the Xbox 360 one - the triggers and sticks feel even better than the 360 pad, buttons are large, the d-pad is excellent, and the integrated battery housing cleans it up a lot. The system offers a \"resume game\" feature that picks up where you left off even if you turn off the system - similar to a Vita or 3DS. It works great, even though it is proclaimed to be beta in the options.The main menu interface is a nice improvement over the messy Xbox 360, even without the voice commands. SmartGlass is a bit underdeveloped but has nice integration to the system (volume control) as well as some games/apps (I tested it on NetFlix and Dead Rising 3). It does need some work though, and some of the apps really do need better integration (like \"My Games and Apps\").I do have some complaints. I don't like how so many things are separate, somewhat slow-loading apps. I get an achievement and \"hold for detail\" and have to sit there for N seconds while the achievement app boots up. It's not as bad as the PS3, for example, but still not optimal. The party system just seems confusing and I have not bothered. The install process is slow and arbitrary - some games let me hop in right away but some make me wait. Some do both, like Battlefield 4. The snap feature, while cool and mostly works as intended (I used it to watch TV while on a BF4 queue), needs better app support. Achievements should be snapping, for example - ideally showing the game you are on.I guess that is what it comes down to. The Xbox One does so much that you can't help but think of where it could get better. Even with the flaws, this is a very exciting system. There is a ton of potential here, I just hope Microsoft can realize it. I am giving the system four stars because, on the whole, I really do like it.--------------------------------------------Old Review:My wife bought me one of these for Christmas from Amazon. I was excited, spent about 30 minutes rearranging my systems and getting all the cords plugged in. Pressed the power button in anticipation... system lit up... and then immediately shut down. I called up Microsoft and yup, the system is a lemon. It's not the disc grinding thing, or some cruddy power brick, or anything like that. The system is just a broken, five hundred dollar piece of junk with no hope of ever doing anything it was designed and built to do. Thankfully they set up an expedited replacement process but in the meantime I am still out a system, with a bunch of cool games (NFS Rivals, DR3, and BF4) and no system to play them on.I've supported Xbox and Microsoft to the tune of thousands of dollars over the years. I know on some level it's just bad luck, but come on. I can't believe MS is still putting out this garbage after all these years. It's so disappointing. Hopefully I can update this review later with actual experience with the console.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2013"}
{"product_name":"B001ET07O0","description":"The House of the Dead: OVERKILL charges you with mowing down waves of infected, blood-thirsty zombies in a last-ditch effort to survive and uncover the horrific truth behind the origins of the House of the Dead. Survival horror as its never been seen before, The House of the Dead: OVERKILL is a pulp-style take on the best selling, classic SEGA light-gun shooter series. Back when the famous Agent G was fresh out of the academy, he teamed up with hard-boiled bad-ass Agent Washington to investigate stories of mysterious disappearances in small-town Louisiana. Little did they know what blood-soaked mutant horror awaited them in the streets and swamps of Bayou City.","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"Insanely violent, vulgar, and fun!","reviewText":"Playing the \"House of the Dead\" games in the arcade is one of the highlights of my teenage years, with so many hours (and quarters) being spent shooting down zombies, mutants and the like. The release of \"House of the Dead 2 & 3\" on the Wii proved that the games are still fun despite the graphics and gameplay not having aged well. \"House of the Dead: Overkill\" is the newest installment of the series and it's a completely different game. It's an on-rails shooter like the others, but it is done with an entirely new sense of style that makes it hard to put down. This game is seriously addictive.The story is essentially the binding that holds the stages together, and it's the standard buddy cop fare done in a Grindhouse style. It is a cross between the cop movies of the 70's, with all the cheesy acting and painfully bad (but intentionally hilarious) one-liners, and a splatter film. Think \"Planet Terror\" as an on-rails shooter and you have the basic idea. Each level takes place in a different area, be it a mansion, a swamp, a carnival, a runaway train, and even a prison, and your objective is to kill as many \"infected\" people as possible. While you are gunning down mutants, you will converse with each other in profanity-laden dialogue that is absolutely hilarious. I think this games holds the record for the most F-bombs in a single game, at least on the Wii. The game awards points based on a number of factors, more notably the accuracy of your shooting and the number of mutants you can kill without missing a shot. The more you kill in a row, the higher your \"violence meter\" gets. This results in more blood, more body parts flying, and ultimately more points that result in you being awared cash at the end of the level. This can be used for buying new weapons and upgrading the ones you already have.The \"Story Mode\" in the game is relatively short, clocking in at about 7 levels that can easily be beaten in under 2 hours (less if you don't die). However, there is plenty of replay value. I found myself playing through the levels again to get a better score, shoot more gold brain trinkets, and just re-live the fun of the level. Once you have beaten the story mode, you unlock the \"Director's Cut\" which is essentially all the same levels with additional scenes, more enemies, and stronger enemies that take more hits to kill. The multi-player option as well as the mini-games (target practice, surviving waves of mutants, etc) will also keep you busy with this game.The only real drawback that I can point out is the difficulty of the game - it's too easy. I only died a few times during the story mode, and after I got more powerful weapons, the game is a cake walk. The Director's Cut is a bit more challenging, but a shotgun or assault rifle makes it a breeze. Other have complained about frame rate, but this is not a problem for me.If you own a Wii and are unhappy about the lack of good adult-oriented games, or if you just want a good party game, \"House of the Dead: Overkill\" the game for you. It's style, humor and replay value are the best reasons for buying it. In fact, I think it's the game I currently play the most on my Wii. Either way, pick it up and have a blast.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2009"}
{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Different Enough...and Then Some","reviewText":"Guild Wars was huge.  Fantasy MMOs are typically huge, but are also a dime a dozen, and so standing out from the crowd isn't easy to do.  I love Guild Wars 2 because it really feels as if the designers did everything they could to streamline gameplay.  I'm still stinging over what NCSoft did to City of Heroes/Villains, but I have to give them credit where credit is due:  Guild Wars 2 is beautiful.  It's huge.  It's accessible to players and it's easy to pick up.I think what I like best about Guild Wars 2 though is that it appears to cater to every style of player--you can be a loner who wanders around and still get into impromptu group events, or suddenly find people helping you, with no loss to your XP or loot.  Conversely you can wander into a big battle, do your best to assist on the fringes, and get XP and loot along with everyone else.  Or as with all games you can group up and share quests together.  Whatever character type you create can stand on its own--no more timid magic-users having to hide and fling spells from behind a fighter.  Death doesn't punish your experience:  it can break equipment that is easily repaired for a small fee (and I've not had anything break permanently).  The only downside to sharing missions is that a mission that uses an instance for one or more parts of it doesn't co-share all party members to one instance:  each completes the step in their own instance (which also happens in other MMOs).While some of the more MMO-familiar tasks such as crafting take a bit of adjustment, the rest of the game is dive-in easy.  Character creation can be quick or you can tweak every last detail.  To help flesh out your character, races are given a bit of description and then you have a short quiz similar to Fallout 3 that asks you questions that shape the attitude and behavior of your character.  Each character has a life story that is an ongoing series of missions.  Each mission is somewhat unique to your character because it is driven by both your creation choices and the decisions you make in some quests.  It should be noted that there is no healer class:  everyone is capable of healing themselves or others and picking different heals as they level up.  Everyone can revive a fellow character who falls.  When you do fall, you have a bleed-out opportunity a la Borderlands where you can fight to survive:  vanquish your foe and you're back on your feet.  Fail, and...anyone can revive you on the spot if they choose to.Probably the biggest boon to Guild Wars 2 is its travel.  As you wander the world, you unlock Waypoints.  So long as no monsters are fighting for control of a Waypoint you can fast-travel to any Waypoint in the world with a click.  The flipside to this is it means if a waypoint is currently overrun with hostiles, you won't be dropped right in the middle of a killing zone.  There is a cost associated with travel, depending how far you're going, but it's so minimal it's more than worth it:  the time you save getting where you're going is spent playing and making more money than you would have saved by foot travel.  Waypoints also mean that if you do fall, you can respawn at any of the uncontested ones with a click.  The map is really interesting in that it hides areas you haven't been to...but will open them up if you talk to a Guide--who will also give you advice on what's in the area.  In every new location, this helps you decide which areas you'd most like to explore.Every game has an in-game marketplace these days...but usually you have to traipse back to your bulletin board, a local market stall, etc.  With Guild Wars 2, when your inventory is full you can sell items on the market from wherever you're standing:  just pick up the money from your sales the next time you're near a market vendor.  The only downside I've noticed here is that the first time you open the market in a play session it takes some time to load, so you want to find a safe area before popping up the market window.  But once it does load, everything in your inventory you *can* sell on the market is listed for you in the market window, to be sold with a click.  Sales automatically set prices at \"highest price the item sold for, plus the cost of selling it\", so if an item sold for 5 copper and it costs 1 copper to list, the game sets the price at 6 copper unless you say otherwise.  No more hand-setting every price or looking up what the resale value is:  it's right there!Ah, but there's so much more!  When you slip underwater, the game changes.  For starters, you don't have to worry about breathing.  Whatever weapon type you equip improves with use, unlocking progressively more moves...and underwater weapons behave the same way, offering an altogether different set of moves.  Like any good MMO you start to learn patterns of the order to use your attacks and you start preferring some items over others.  As you level you gain experience points that, instead of going toward abilities like \"Strength\", \"Stamina\", etc., are spent directly on skills.  The skills can then be slotted into one of up to 9 skill slots...but there is still an overall 'skill tree' that lets you boost particular areas of character development.I've played Guild Wars 2 in 3D, and the 3D is really well done.  It's very enjoyable looking into a toybox world and seeing things come flying, splashing, or whizzing out of the screen.  I don't have many problems with ghosting and I do have the depth turned all the way up without 'doubling' issues.Artistically, the world of Tyria is very creatively rendered.  There are times the distant view looks like it's been painted with a brush, only to grow more solid and real the closer you get.  Cutscenes are fully animated, down to mouth movements and posture, and the animated backgrounds pop out when playing in 3D.  I love the fact that there are frozen wastes, green forests, rocky mountains, volcanic areas, castles (new and crumbling, haunted and not), crypts (definitely haunted), and the massive steampunk fortress of The Charr.If you're new to fantasy gaming or MMOs in general, Guild Wars 2 is a great way to start.  You might consider the strategy guide just for its MMO-beginner tips, and if not, Guild Wars 2's Wiki is excellent.  If you're an experienced player, be prepared to give up just a little bit of the ordinary...to experience a world that is truly extraordinary.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2013"}

As heroes, they explore familiar battlefields, discover new lands, and take on epic quests and challenges in Blizzard's massively multiplayer online role-playing game. Blizzard has taken care to make the game accessible and fun both for hard-core 60-hour-a-week players and for more casual adventurers.","reviewerName":"Brendan Ross","summary":"Genre-Changing MMO","reviewText":"WOW is basically the MMO that changed the genre, and as such, consistent with other Blizzard titles, it's an incredibly fun and easy to get into gaming experience which offers a bit of something for everyone.Essentially what Blizzard did with WoW vis-a-vis the MMO genre was analogous to what Blizzard did with Warcraft vis-a-vis the RTS genre: namely, trimming down much of the tedium, stepping up in importance the aspects that are most fun, creating and driving a fun and immersive storyline, and making sure that the end product is as accessible to as many people as possible, both in terms of ease of gameplay and controls, as well as reasonable advancement thresholds and even system requirements (note it is one of the only developers that releases its games simultaneously for Mac users).WoW's design takes away much of the tedium from other MMOs for much of the game:  the design focuses on questing (although \"grinding\" is always an option, it isn't forced as in Lineage II, and if you wish to follow the storyline, there are ample quests to take you all the way from 1-60), allows a player to choose a preferred gamestyle (soloing is viable all the way to 60, as is grouping), makes crafting and other sidelines accessible to all players and so forth.  Things are streamlined to make them more simple, to emphasise the fun, the progression of the character, and the immersiveness of the gaming world, rather than to emphasize difficulty, make the game exclude all but the \"leet\" players and so forth, as has been the case with many MMOs in the past.Obviously, Blizzard's design is a hit.  A huge hit.  It's blown the door's off of every other MMO to date in terms of stable subscriptions.  And in a way that is why many long-term MMO gamers don't care for it: it's a mainstream game, and not a niche game (in fact, that really was Blizzard's point: to make an MMO that would become a mainstream smash like Warcraft did for the RTS genre).  If you're a Hardcore MMO player who likes challenge for its own sake, and wants a hard, complex game that weeds out the casual player, you won't like this one.  But if you're a more casual player, curious about online worlds, or someone who has grown tired of the grind that the more challenging MMOs offer, this game can be pure fun.Two warnings, however.  The first is that the game is rather addictive.  The main reason for that is its accessibility: until the late levels, you're generally never all that far away from progressing your character to the next level, and this tends to keep one playing.  So be aware that the game can begin to eat up significant amounts of time.The second warning is that the end-game is not like the rest of the game.  That is, once you reach the level cap of 60, Blizzard's design idea was to make the game beyond that point very challenging indeed, and really geared towards the hardcore player.  The content is either 20 or 40 man raids, extended PvP encounters, or reputation farming, because (at least until the expansion comes with 10 new levels) the only way to make your character better once you level cap is through better gear, and at that level virtually all of this gear is \"bind on pickup\", meaning that you can't buy it from someone, you have to either get it in one of the raid instances, as a PvP reward or s a reputation reward.  And the end-game is progressive in that you can't even colorably attempt the most difficult instances at end-game (say Ahn-Qiraj 40 or Naxxramas) unless you have run the previous tier of end-game instances (say, Zul Gurub and AQ20) many times to get your gear up:  that is, at the end-game level, having a certain \"tier\" of gear is essentially required to access the remaining instance content, and this is a very time consuming, non-casual process.  So just a warning that once you reach level cap, you won't really be able to advance your character much if you are a casual player until the expansion, and I think Blizzard's attitude towards this is that it is appropriate for the gameplay for level-capped characters to be challenging.  If you want to stay casual at level cap, your best bet is to PvP for the rewards there and, as many people do, experience the game from the perspective of a different class by levelling an alt character of a different race/faction/class.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2006"}

I don't have the patience for a stealth game and found myself getting bored and the horrible saving system didn't help matters. You can't save your progress and the checkpoints are few and far between. You'll spend 45 minutes painstakingly going through a section trying to find all the items and evade notice only to get killed and lose everything. I ended up playing the game on easy and turning it into a run and gun shooter, which is not the way it's supposed to be played. Of course it has amazing graphics but that's to be expected. It also has great weapons and gear selection, neat gadgets, excellent customization, and great humor but none of this was enough to compensate for the flaws.

Annoying controls.","reviewText":"I played Dead Space 2 right after the first version. I was starting to get used to the controls (except running) in Dead Space, then the sequel switched the controls on me. Bad switch, in my opinion. Circle for health replenishing? Square was a better choice. I also didn't need Triangle to be Stasis replenishing. L2 for running is still retarded. Why can't EA just copy Uncharted 2's controls? More natural. Also, the ability to do a quick turn like in Resident Evil 5 would have been nice.No maps in Dead Space 2? If they still exist, then they aren't in the same obvious place. If they don't, then EA thinks players are too stupid to read maps? The new Objective/Store/Save Station Locator is still handy, but I still want the maps.Gameplay is okay. Same as the original. I prefer killing necromorphs over solving stupid puzzles. I get enough real puzzles and problem-solving from advanced math courses and real work and don't care about puzzles in games. Also, headshots are my preferred killing method in any game. Aiming for limbs is kind of counter-intuitive, but whatever.Loading time is much faster. Good job with the fix, EA! (Did you fire the previous programmers?) Graphics is also better, but Nicole's face could be made scarier. Those Nicole scenes are just annoying, as opposed to being scary. In fact, the entire game is not scary at all, but then again, I am not a little kid....Overall, given that I didn't pay full price for Dead Space 2, I am not too dissatisfied. Average is my rating.

{"product_name":"B0041HROGG","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Bush \"mechanical engineer\"","summary":"Great \"slightly improved\" standard controller!","reviewText":"I bought my first XBox 360 from a friend, acquiring with it three used controllers with fried battery packs and a play-and-charge cord which stop charging if flexed, due to an internal break (and then caused the controller to disconnect, due to the dead battery packs...annoying).  When I passed these items on to another friend and bought a new slim 360, I needed a play-and-charge kit and thus purchased this silver controller mostly to acquire the charging cord.When I saw the controller, however, I was pleasantly surprised with its aesthetics, and have not since used the standard black one at all.Since I had been using worn-out controllers, this new one made a big difference in feel.  All the buttons worked properly but most importantly the analog sticks were no longer damaged.  Of course, this was to be expected with any NEW product.More significant are the two major changes to the controller, those being color and the D-pad.  I'm sure many people, like myself, consider color to be seriously low on the list of important controller attributes, but this silver controller is undeniably attractive.  Although the pictures represent it pretty well, I expected the silver color to be like most silver plastic...tacky and fake-looking.  Consequently, I was quite impressed with the quality of the finish, both of the silver controller body and the chrome D-pad and guide buttons.  I was equally impressed by the \"monochrome\" A/B/X/Y buttons.  I had overlooked this detail in the photos because after all, I know what a 360 controller looks like and didn't study the pictures too much.  The buttons are colored in differing shades of gray as though the color controller had been photographed in black and white.  I thought this was a nice touch.  The front plate of the controller (where the headset/chatpad jack is located) is finished in glossy black like the new standard black controller.The adjustable D-pad is the other new feature.  The standard 360 controller features an 8-way D-pad with a slightly raised cross pattern to allow easier access to the Up, Down, Right, and Left directions which are by far more commonly used than the diagonals (which seem to be limited to martial arts games, as far as I understand...I have never played a game which used them).  Unfortunately, this \"easier access\" really did not work that well.  I cannot count how often I have turned on night vision in Call of Duty while attempting to pull out a Claymore, or how violently I have had to mash the button to get the pop-up \"Telemetry\" display to go away in Forza Motorsport.The new controller instead features a D-pad which, when rotated 90 degrees one way or the other, locks the cross portion into a \"raised\" or \"lowered\" position.  The lowered position is basically the same as the old controller, while the raised position greatly accentuates the L/R/U/D directions.While this is a nice attempt to correct the complaints about the D-pad, it unfortunately falls a little short of functional, and still behaves mostly like the standard design.  The Playstation controller is much better in this regard because there are four separate buttons, but unfortunately this prevents the use of diagonals, unless two buttons were pressed simultaneously (which, by my analysis of the circuit board inside the 360 controller, is actually how the XBox design works).  However, D-pad aside, I greatly prefer the ergonomics of the 360 controller to those of the PS2 and PS3.The play and charge portion of this kit (and the main reason I purchased it) is also as good as ever.  The cord is more than long enough for me and probably most people, and doesn't get in the way of playing.  Although I keep the cord plugged in at all times while playing, rather than wasting batteries, I keep the battery pack installed because it is awkward to hold the controller without it, in my opinion.  Unfortunately, this is probably causing short-cycle damage to the battery, and it would likely be safer if I installed an empty AA battery holder in its place.Overall, I couldn't be much happier with this controller.  The D-pad, while improved, could still use some tweaking, but the new color scheme, the tried-and-true ergonomics, and the money-saving play and charge kit are all excellent.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is purchasing a new XBox 360 and doesn't have a charging cord, or who wants to replace their worn-out controller with something a little different and \"jazzed up.\"","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2011"}

{"product_name":"B006VB2UMI","description":"","reviewerName":"Evildead11","summary":"Terrible.  Simply Terrible.","reviewText":"Flaming dog poo on your porch is more entertaining and carries more quality than this installation of Madden. For as many years as this franchise has been on the market, one would expect that the developers would have mastered this game by now. You'd think that each year we would see a better, more polished version than that of the year before. Yet, over the past 5 years, this title has been hit or miss. Madden 2013 being the biggest miss yet. I can't even put into words how disappointed I am with this game. You can't play a season with your favorite team? Really?? REALLY?? I don't want to play online...I don't care about online play. I buy Madden every year to play through franchise mode with my beloved Lions. Not this year, though! My options are to join an online league (no thanks), play exhibition (boring) or play a \"career\" mode. Ok, so let's check out this \"career\" mode...I'll give it a chance. Chance given...it BLOWS. I decided to start a career as an undrafted QB...sounds intriguing. Well, 2 hours in and I've spent most of that time watching simulation. You can't control the RB in games or practice. You can only control the receiver if he catches the ball. Since I began my career as a 3rd stringer, I actually barely saw the field at all outside of practice. SUCKS. Ok, so the game modes are terrible - but what about the rest of the game? The visuals are not so great. Maybe I'm so jaded because of the game modes being so sucky, but the players look as if they have larger than normal heads. The animations are choppy and weird - dudes fall on top of each other and sometimes appear to be floating on air. They walk to the bench and congratulate players that aren't there. Jim Schwartz looks like Peter Griffin. It's a mess. How about the sound? Well, the crowd sounds like...a crowd. The play by play sounds robotic and repetitive. The sound effects on the field are fine, I guess. Those at EA Sports responsible for this abomination should be relieved of their employment post haste. A Detroit Lion finally makes the cover of Madden, and it happens to be the worst Madden I've ever played. So sad. I want my money back. I was warned that this game was bad, but being a Madden slappy I thought \"How bad could it really be? I mean, it's Madden!\" Well, I should have heeded the warnings and the bad reviews. They are all warranted. Do yourself a favor and pass on this game...SAVE YOUR MONEY. Don't listen to the Madden fanboys that rave about how great the game is. I can only assume they are EA employees promoting this flaming bag of poo they named Madden 13.UPDATE: After spending more time on this game, I've discovered that it still sucks.  \"Connected Career\" mode is not fun.  The players for any given team seemingly start off with lower than average player ratings (and you can't edit them).  I'm assuming this is by design so that you must practice and meet certain goals in order to gain XP with which you must have to purchase player upgrades.  So, if I want to put Mikel LeShoure in as my starting RB, I'll have to submit to the fact that he's rated about a 65 overcall (abysmal), and it takes about 3,000 XP just to improve his speed from a 78 to a 79.  Great.  I want to play a season of games, not spend hours against my practice squad just to make my players better by the smallest of fractions.Also, EA just needs to take the challenge option out of the game.  Why?  Because it doesn't work.  I challenged MULTIPLE plays where the opposing receiver was CLEARLY out of bounds when catching the ball and it was ruled a complettion and my challenge was overruled.  Really?  EVERY replay shown clearly demonstrates that the received didn't even get ONE foot down in bounds, let alone both.  I'm so irritated that this game is so poor.  I have loved Madden since the Sega Genesis days, and it has been getting worse and worse over the past 3-5 years.  The one redeeming thing I can say about Madden 13 is that the commentary is a dramatic improvement over last year's version.  It's still not very good, as they tend to talk about things completely unrelated to the game or play at hand, but Phil Simms and Jim Nance are much easier on the ears than the clowns in 2012.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2012"}

Not trying to bash GOW2 here since that's a 2008 game but the graphics will blow you away... in a good way :)The storyline is not as compelling as GOW2's but the graphics will keep you hooked up for hours. Not sure how multiplayer is since I don't play online but I think it can get addictive if the single player campaing is.

Don't listen to those folks. Listen to real gamers like me. I own every game in the series and Mario Party 8 is by far the best. The motion controls make the game. You don't have to get dents in your thumbs from mashing buttons. (Some games do use buttons but not to the extent where you will actually feel pain). The mini games are fun and the controls are excellent. This is the first Mario party game where I enjoy the majority of the boards. The best board is the koopa tycoon board where you put coins into hotels to gain posession of the hotels which also gives you stars. This board requires a little more strategy than most and it's a blast to play. There are two new playable characters in the game.(Blooper and hammer brother)The single player is deep and enjoyable. Multiplayer is the heart of the game. You don't have to play the main game to enjoy multiplayer. You can play loads of multiplayer minigames. This game is a must own for wii owners.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2007"}
{"product_name":"B0044SA734","description":"","reviewerName":"ickytips","summary":"An acquired taste...","reviewText":"Well, let me first start by saying that when I began this game, I really, really, really didn't like it; I thought it too much a Dark Souls-Skyrim-Dragon's Dogma rip-off.However, I was bored enough to continue playing. And, at the fifteen hour mark, it started to catch and it all made sense; sure this game takes many of its components from other highly successful RPGs, but it does it in a style completely all its own.It can get extremely overwhelming at time, especially when you've got 3 main objectives, 25 side-quests and 5 to 10 tasks, but I've simply controlled my rate at which I take on quests so I don't get overwhelmed and confused.Of course, this game is far from perfect; the bow and arrow system (auto-targeting) is weak (in my opinion), and the map is a pain in the buttocks -- not to mention how difficult and confusing it is to switch between quests and the map. I also hate how you have to destroy items (or sell them) if you fill up your inventory; although this is nice later in the game if you invest in the \"Mercantile\" skill, then, you get paid for every item you destroy (and anyone who's played the game knows you do A LOT of item destroying in the beginning).Graphically the game is beautiful, although a little \"cartooney.\" Personally, I prefer more realistic looking RPGs, e.g. Dark Souls. Regardless, this hasn't affected the fun or playability of the game.So, in a nutshell, this game's a slow starter but really grabs hold when it counts. It's fun, entertaining and worth the money. And, most importantly, it'll keep me occupied until the Dawnguard DLC drops in September.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2012"}

Kids will love the opportunity to immerse themselves in two gameworlds, first a scripted \"on rails\" adventure and second, a highly customizable, free-roam sandbox.As one would expect from a game aimed at a broad age range, the controls are nice and simple and do not require any complex combos to enjoy the game fully. Contextual help popups are liberally scattered throughout the game, helping to make the learning curve shallow and short. Gameplay is simple but not overly simplistic, with enough variety to keep both kids and adults engaged.The big question, of course, is whether this game takes good advantage of its Pixar license. Happily, yes! Character voices sound just like they do in the movie. The graphics are bright, colorful, and true to Pixar's signature style. And as a bonus, there are numerous references to other Pixar movies, especially in the free-roam sandbox.Bottom line: kids who love Toy Story will also love this game. Adult Pixar fans will enjoy playing as well, as long as one doesn't expect \"grown-up\" storytelling and gameplay mechanics (it'll help if you're in the mood for some mindless fun).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2011"}

Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course. They don't drive perfectly, either; some will spin out and make other mistakes over the course of a race.","reviewerName":"ooocarl06","summary":"a bit overrated","reviewText":"While not trying to belittle certain small aspects of this game, i feel that all in all it is a bit overrated.

The whole reason we play videogames is to escape from reality, an hour or so at a time. This game all but throws reality right in to your home away from home.In this game's favor, i do have to say that the selection of cars is incredible, and all the detail in being able to change things on your car, more engine than cosmetic, are a very nice change from the normal 50 or so stock cars. In conclusion, there is fun to be had here, just don't think your going to look like the king of racing in the process.If what you think your getting is a quick adrenaline rush from this game, your wrong. I found this game to be THE lenghtiest racing sim. Some races can take 2 hours to complete, thats just one race, nto a tournament, which makes tension and adrenaline difficult to find.In conclusion, if what you want is a powerhouse game that requires MANY hours to complete absorb all the content, this is just the ticket.

It is more of a puzzle-solving adventure game than anything, so don't go in expecting fast action GTA / God of War style gameplay, because you will be dissappointed. That said, it is an incredible game, but for the average gamer it requires some patience.Last year I bought a new PS2 instead of upgrading to next gen because my original 'fat' PS2 died around '06 and there were so many great titles I missed out on. Shadow of the Colossus was on that list, so I ordered it from Amazon along with a list of other great games I had never had the chance to enjoy after my original console went kaput.I had no idea what to expect from this game and all I knew was that it got rave reviews all over the place. I read an article praising it in Maxim when it came out and read some reviews here on Amazon and that was it. I actually avoided reading anything else about it because I didn't want any spoilers to accidentally come out before I got to play. Well, first game I played upon receiving my new PS2 was God of War and I followed it with Shadow of the Colossus. That in itself may have been a mistake because God of War is a button-mashing, enemy-packed, bloody action fest and SotC is, well, not. At all. In fact, SotC was so slow-paced by comparison that I put it away for awhile so I could come back to it later. For awhile I didn't think this game was going to live up to the hype at all.. but I could tell it was going to be a great game and I didn't want to ruin the experience by not letting myself get into it (I had to let the awesomeness of God of War wear off first, HA).Anyway, the game has some of the best and most beautiful original design and mechanics I have ever seen in a game. The controls are very different for a third-person game and it took a lot of getting used to for me. In fact, one of my bigger complaints would have to be the controls and the control response. The game is slow-moving for my taste, but you let yourself get into it and it is a very challenging and even addicting game. There is a lot of story and exploration involved and you just have to immerse yourself in it. I'm not trying to say that this game isn't exciting and intense, because it is. It's just not the same kind of intensity that most gamers are used to. Unique sums it up pretty well. But yes, beautiful game.

So far I only have this game and the one that came in the bundle. Kinect sports is a much better game and worth the money. I have tried all the games and they are a lot of fun but kind of strenuous for an older person (me). I tired myself out playing the boxing game and the track and field section. But my favorite is the bowling game. I used to bowl in a league so this game reminds me of the  old days. The game really provides a pretty good workout and will get you sweating pretty quickly. Basically it is just a lot of fun. Kinect is a really amazing technology. I hope to see more great games for it coming out this year.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00020LZAM","description":"Jak 3concludes the Jak and Daxter trilogy with a truly plot-driven adventure game filled with friendship, betrayal, death, and a long-awaited understanding of the Precursor civilization that has, until now, remained a mystery.One year has passed since Jak and Daxter saved Haven City from Kor and the attacking Metal Heads, yet Haven City is still immersed in deadly chaos as three groups fight for control of the streets. The people of Haven City have grown to distrust Jak's dark powers, and as rumors boil of Jak's ties with Krew and Kor, the city blames Jak for its current woeful circumstances. When the palace is destroyed by a surprise Metal Head attack, even Ashelin cannot protect Jak as the High Council's power broker, Count Veger, forces Jak into banishment to the desolate Wasteland. Jak is flown to the harsh island and dumped. With Daxter and Pecker bravely by his side, the three begin their next adventure where the battle for the city has just begun.Five times the size of Haven City, the Wasteland is a desert environment with multiple areas including mines and a volcano. Given the enormity and variance in terrain, vehicles play a large role as off-road transportation is introduced, fueled by a true-to-life physics engine. With a rugged new look and suited with armor, Jak is also equipped with an arsenal of new weapons with upgradeable mods that enable players to increase their firepower and enjoy the freedom to strategize and activate their arsenal at any time.As Jak has been exposed to Light Eco, players can now experience Jak's magnificent transformation to Light Jak. With a glowing electric blue aura and a massive wing span, Light Jak introduces new move sets, including the ability to glide great distances, emit an energy to block enemy attack, and power up at anytime, all of which provide the player with a sense of being invincible. Dark Jak also returns with more capabilities, forcing Jak to find a balance between light and dark.Additionally, game developer Naughty Dog continues to push the genre forward with the introduction of new technology. For the first time in the franchise, enemies feature realistic ragdoll physics, which will allow gamers to witness a unique death for each enemy that is killed. Naughty Dog has also implemented independent cloth movement technology and enhanced the enemy artificial intelligence (AI) with wall climbing and smart formation capabilities.","reviewerName":"Samario C.

Among other things, the Dunia Engine delivers realistic, interactive environments, special effects, real-time night-and-day cycles, and smart enemy AI.Expansive, Realistic EnvironmentFar Cry 2 is set in a fictional region of Africa where you are caught between two rival factions at war. The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah. Wild animals such as zebras, buffalo, gazelle are encountered during the game, with both players and enemies allowed to interact with them.Far Cry 2 features an incredible level of detail and realism, with a minimal in-game interface to detract from immersion. For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game. To fulfill your mission, you need to play the enemies against each other, using both strategy and skill.Huge Range of Weapons and VehiclesFar Cry 2 offers gamers a wide range of weapons, from a machete for hand-to-hand combat, to a sniper rifle that can stealthily pluck off enemies from afar. As weapons disintegrate over time, they might jam or even explode in your hand.There are also a large range of vehicles such as gliders, trucks, cars, and boats that will let you fly, drive, slide, and hover over the open landscapes.Multiplayer Options for up to 16 PlayersFar Cry 2 supports up to 16 players and has four gameplay modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond, and Uprising.

I don't feel like I need to run through all of that again here; at this point the information is readily available. This review is about the sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach, the feeling that I'm about to lose an old friend. That PC gaming as I've known and loved it for many years is dying, and will soon be dead. Murdered by greed.The future is here and it is scary: Ownership transformed into glorified game rental. Games infected with spyware, data miners or flat out Malware. A time when the gamers who made gaming a bigger industry than Hollywood will now be treated like thieves and pirates.If you've been a PC gamer for more than a dozen years like myself, you probably have a pretty awesome collection of games, both new and old. The beauty of PC games vs. console games is that even when you upgrade your hardware, there as ALWAYS ways to play your old games without keeping ten different gaming systems in your closet. I can pull out my copy of Alpha Centauri and start playing it anytime I like, no vintage system required. PC games have always been excellent when it comes to replay value. Sadly, that is not longer the case.PC game manufacturers have taken it into their heads that what we consumers really want is to RENT games. AKA: installation limits. We don't want to OWN anything, just rent a game for 3, 5, or maybe even a dozen installations (the number is not important) and then our games will cease to work. If we want to continue to play those games, we're forced to BUY ANOTHER COPY.I bet I've installed my copy of Alpha Centauri over fifty times across 15 or so different computers or upgraded OS, and I'll probably continue to play it into the future. Sadly, anyone buying Far Cry 2 will not have that option. At some point in the not-so-distant future, their install limit will be reached, and the game will be useless.Why is this happening? Because of greed. Because companies like EA, Ubisoft, and others are putting their bottom line ahead of their customer's best interests. Ultimately however, they're doing it BECAUSE WE ARE LETTING THEM. It's high time that as a class we stop giving money to companies that treat us like dishonest pick-pockets instead of paying customers. Only by NOT BUYING games that come with installation limits can we effect change.Happily, there are exceptions(check outThe Witcher Enhancedfor example). Some companies are realizing that gamers and pirates are two different species. Pirates will steal games regardless. Gamers will pay for them as long as the system is fair, and as long as gaming companies show them a little respect.I choose to spend my money where I get treated like a valued customer. Ubisoft has chosen to treat me like a thief, therefore I will not give them my money. I will buy my games from companies that respect the art form and the people who love it the most. People like me and you.Far Cry 2 itself is a nice FPS shooter. But I won't be buying it. The cost is just too high.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00006I02Z","reviewerName":"Rex Marksmanson \"HEYO!\"","summary":"All Steam authentication issues aside, it's a great game","reviewText":"I can't think of a PC game in recent history that was more anticipated then the sequel to Valve's blockbuster, Half-Life.  Early reports indicated that this game would indeed change many aspects of the gaming community such as physics and character models.  When it was released in November my excitment was only matched by my disbelief that it had actually come out, mostly due to the fact the game had been delayed on again off again for nearly 5 years.  So, was it worth the wait, worth the tedious Steam installation and frustration? Yes.Let's start with the storyline, which is second to none, and due to my hatred of spoilers I'm only going to give you the basics.  You return from your odd state of limbo to find yourself (Gordan Freeman) in a scary, totaltarian controlled city known as City 17 run by a group called the Combine.  What ensues is your involvement in a resistance movement, which will take you everywhere from the city streets to desert wastelands.  The characters you meet are simply incredible, each one has their own deep personality with voice acting that could just as well be featured in a motion picture.  You'll feel a certain attachment to protect those who fight with you, and a loathing for your enemy who are as vile as they are mysterious.Enemy AI is a little bit dissapointing from what was promised to us by Valve.  While they aren't stupid by a longshot, AI from other recently released PC games can match and even surpass it.  For instance, taking something like a small soup can and holding it in front of your face to use as \"cover\" will cause nearly all enemies in the area to cease fire and attempt to flank.  Even more ridiculous are their predictable combat methods which are as follows: take cover, throw a grenade, charge in, repeat.  By the end of the game I could have taken combine forces on with my eyes closed and speakers on full blast.  However, they will still challenge you, kill you and frustrate you, don't count them out, just don't expect true artifical intelligence.A majority of the game you are on foot, however 2 levels allow you to pilot both a hovercraft like boat and an off road dune buggy, adding an incredible element of fun and variation.  Your arsenal will allow you to call on everything from standard pistols to the jaw dropping gravity gun, which allows you to pick up and throw objects such as chairs, cans, metal shelves and more as if they were mere pieces of paper.The games graphics are gorgeous, beautiful, jaw dropping, the list goes on and on.  Without a doubt they are the best graphics so far for any game ever released, to say they have set a new standard would be an understatement.  Characters express emotions through facial features, enemy vehicles are detailed down to the last decal, even the infamous G-man's pores can be made out in the opening scene of the game.The multiplayer scene is why many people bought the original Half-Life in the first place, and this trend is continued with the second one.  Half Life 2 Deathmatch, a recently released (free) add on by Valve, allows to to participate in standard free for all or team based battles on most of the games maps, fun but not in depth.  For those of you who want to experience everything this game has to offer, look to the now corporate backed mod community which has spawned games such as Counter-Strike and Day Of Defeat.  Using the Half-Life 2 engine these mods allow a whole new immersion in these already great games, CS Source is available for free with the purchase while DoD Source will be released at a later date requiring a purchase for those who only bought the base edition.Does it live up to it's predecessor? Yes and then some, in fact it makes it's predecessor look like a joke in comparison.  It has all the elements of a great game, and a few minor bugs and issues aside, it is near perfection.  Don't miss out on this game, I say that often, but trust me...do not miss out on Half-Life 2, you'll regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2004"}

As Snake investigates, he gets drawn up into a huge quest. The problem with the story is that it just seems too much.

{"product_name":"B003O6DZSQ","description":"","reviewerName":"ahw","summary":"Fun for All Skill-Levels","reviewText":"Wii Party is a game designed to be enjoyed by players of all skills.  Which is both it's best and worst attribute.Like most party games, this is a game built upon a wide variety of mini games.  These mini-games are very short (a minute or two long each) and require the players to do silly things such as shake the controller in a chopping manner to chop vegetables, play games of hide-and-seek, navigate through space, or point and shoot at the screen (in a non-violent manner, such as shooting bb guns at tin cans).The game is very accessible.  The mini-games are designed so that the controls can be learned quickly.  They usually don't involve more than one or two different buttons.The different modes consist of different means of playing the mini-games.  Such as a board game mode where the objective is to reach the end.  At the end of each round, a mini-game is played that gives the winners some sort of advantage on the board (such as an extra die roll).  Or you can play cooperatively in a balance game which requires players to balance people on a boat.  A co-operative minigame is played after every round to determine how difficult the balancing gets.The accessibility is good in a sense that it allows hardcore gamers to play with novices.  This is a game you could play with grandma.  And grandma has a good chance of winning.  Many of the games have somewhat random and arbitrary outcomes.  For instance, one game requires you to guess which firework will have the highest explosion.  There's really no way to give yourself an advantage here, it's purely guesswork.  Some of the game modes themselves have built-in skill forgiveness.  In the board game, you could land on a tile that automatically switches your position with a random opponent's position.  Theoretically, you could be in last place, land on that tile, and switch with first place to win.I consider myself to be a fairly advanced video gamer.  I usually play with friends who don't play much video games.  I usually end up winning the skill-based mini games decisively but often end up losing the overall game (such as the board game) because I'll land on some tile that kicks me back 20 spaces, or get bad rolls.Which is why the skill-forgiveness can be the worst thing about the game.  I often joke with my opponents that the game is socialist because it equalizes all the players irrespective of skill levels.  I'm still having fun, but a little part inside me screams foul when I dominate every minigame and end up in last place.  Haha.  Just keep in mind that the ultimate objective of this game is to have fun, not win, and you'll be pleased.The game also comes with some aforementioned non-competitive game modes, such as the boat balancing game, or another game which purports to measure two players' compatability with each other.  The latter is rather silly, as the questions it asks are irrelevant and superficial.  I played twice with my girlfriend and ended up getting record scores for least compatible and most compatible.  But it's still fun to mess around with when you have a large group together.Play this game with your family.  Throw in some Halo when your hardcore gaming friends come over.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0016NRS8M","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"An Open World Action RPG with No Polish What-so-Ever","reviewText":"It's ironic that a game developed in Poland would have no polish.  It's a huge game that has a bit of everything, but everything in the game feels a bit broken.  It's like playing an early beta of a promising title.Story:  1/10In the credits 7 people were credited with the story.  Here is your problem.  It's hard to get 2 people to agree on a creative endeavor, let alone seven people.  The story is poorly acted and disjointed.  Parts of it are good, parts are campy, and parts make no sense.  I wouldn't have been surprised if a bunch of enemies just started dancing to Gangnam Style in the middle of a boss battle.  There are even poorly recreated scenes from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and Monty Python in the game!  It's face-palmingly bad.  To make matters worse, the main character only makes snarky comments about the adventure, which breaks immersion.  He says the same 5-6 things when he kills an enemy throughout the entire game: \"I'll bet you're glad you met me.\" \"That's rich.\"  \"Huhuhuhuh\" etc.  You can expect to hear these about 500 times each and they don't even really relate to what is going on.  The main character talks like a 16 year old playing D&D; with his friends, rather than a mercenary risking his life on a quest.Graphics: 5/10They look dated, the environments are ugly, the characters are plain, and the animations are rough.  The particle and lighting effects are also primitive.  This game looks about 6 years old.  On the plus side, the art direction in some of the areas are kind of cool.  But you really don't want to play this after you've played Assassin's Creed Black Flag.Character Classes / Inventory: 3/10Fighter, Ranger, Mage are the basic archetypes, defined by their attacks.Fighters can use a sword and shield, a two handed weapon, or dual weapons.  Blocking just reduces the incoming damage by a %.  They have special upgrades to take an enemy's shield away, a power smash to damage them through their shield, and various types of stuns.  There are a few special attacks for bonus damage as well.  All of the attacks are upgradeable for more damage or a better chance to Stun or Knockdown.Rangers are interesting because of the bow upgrades.  They have explosive fire arrows, ice arrows that slow enemies, multi-shot which fires a bunch of arrows at a time, an illusionary distraction arrow, and upgrades that reduce the time it takes to draw an arrow.  If you fire and release quickly, you only do a small % of your max damage.  If you draw the bow all the way back, you do 100% of your max damage.  There's also an Overdraw skill that allows you to do bonus damage with your shots.Mages have a complex spell creation system that allows you to choose a delivery system for the spell (Missile Aura, etc...) a damage type (Fire, Ice, Poison...) and then a modifier like guided, damage over time, etc...  The more powerful your spell, the longer it takes to cast.  But you also have upgrades that reduce casting time, so you can get your powerful spells out faster.  This is really complex, but rewarding when you craft cool spells.Unfortunately, wearing quality armor reduces your accuracy stat (Bow Damage), which is a bad idea.  In a simple game like this, your gear and character classes shouldn't cannibalize themselves.  Elf Armor actually makes you worse with a bow in this game!!!You can instantly swap between the 3 character pre-sets with the D-Pad. You can have 3 types of mages / a mage, fighter, and ranger / 2 fighter builds and a mage , etc.  It's up to you.  Customize your character sets any way you want.It's too bad the Inventory is just a bunch of gear in boxes.  There's no way to really sort it and if you have equipped gear, it only shows on the character build you have selected.  So, if you have different boots for your fighter and different boots for your mage, and you are playing as the fighter, you might accidentally sell your mage boots because they show up as unequipped.  This is inexcusable.Combat: Totally BrokenYour armor absorbs a % of incoming damage, the heavier the armor, the more it absorbs.  The attack animations feel very loose and make little effort to target an enemy.  Fortunately, the collision on the attacks is generous, so even if you slightly miss enemies, you hit them.  Many of the enemies have resistances to damage types, so choosing the right weapon for the job is crucial.  Some enemies can knock you down or knock you back.  The Knock Back attacks are broken because they always knock the player backwards no matter where he's facing.  So if an enemy pushes you from behind, you fall TOWARDS the enemy!!!  This is broken.  Unfortunately, none of this matters because enemies constantly get stuck on level geometry.  If you want to kill any enemy, just run around for a bit and they will get stuck on a wall, a tree root, a stump, a rock, etc... Then shoot them with a ranged weapon or spell until they die.  If you are in hallways and enemies attack, just run for a bit and the enemy decides he is too far from his starting point, so he starts to walk back.  Then shoot him in the back.  You can repeat this, until the enemy is killed.The Good Stuff!Lockpicking Mini-Game:Locks are composed of a number of rings, more difficult locks have more.  Each ring has 2 catches in it.  The catches are opposite from each other.  So if 1 catch is at 12 O'clock, the other would be at 6.  When you begin lockpicking, a timer counts down.  Your lockpick moves in a circle around the rings.  When the pick is near a catch, just squeeze the R Trigger to advance to the next ring.  Repeat until you hit all of the catches.  Squeezing RT and missing a catch, will bump you back a ring.  This sounds simple, but it's actually fun and addicting.Crafting:If you kill enemies and get junk loot, you can scavenge it for parts.  Wood, Iron, Steel, etc...  Then use these parts to upgrade your gear.  So if you scavenge a bunch of weak enemy swords, you can upgrade your powerful sword.  Each upgrade gives you bonus damage for weapons and bonus defense for armors.  Every few upgrades also unlocks a socket.  You can fill these with gems that give you skill or stat boosts.Bonus Skill Points:If you kill a bunch of monsters, brew a bunch of potions, pick a bunch of locks, or craft a bunch of gear, you don't get XP.  Instead, you get an instant Skill Point you can use to upgrade any skill.  There are weapon skills for Fighters, Rangers, and Mages.  There are crafting skills, sneaking skills, alchemy skills, and skills that give your character natural damage resistances or stat boosts.  Use these Bonus Skill Points any way you want.Leveling Up:Kill Monsters and finish Quests to get XP.  When you get enough, you advance in Level.  You get 4 Attribute Points and 2 Skill Points per level.  Attributes = Health, Melee Damage, Missile Damage, Magic Damage and Mana Regeneration.  Weapons and Skills in the game are restricted by your Attributes.  So you may find an awesome sword, but you can't use it until your Strength is 35.  Or you may not be able to upgrade your Shield Bash Attack until you go up 5 more Strength.  The beauty of this system is that you can apply these points any way you want.  If you are a fighter and want to become a mage, you can level up your mage related stats and skills then instantly start using good spells.  You don't have to use magic to make your magic more powerful, so this system is extremely flexible.Eyeballs:These eyes are spells that allow you to scout ahead.  Release the eye and you be able to roam through the world for a specified amount of meters from your position.  Some eyes are single use and explode when they hit an enemy.  This is a great idea!Sound: 6/10The music of this game is atmospheric, but the voice acting is awful and ruins the atmosphere.Maturity:  Older Teen / Young AdultThere's blood, drinking, swearing, and a partial nudity sex scene.Value: 4/10This game sells for about $5-$10.  It's 20-40 hours long and has multiplayer VS and Co-Op.  If you're dying for an action RPG, then you could pick this one up cheap to pass the time.Overall: 4/10This is a game with a little bit of everything.  Unfortunately, everything in this game has been done much better in other games of the genre.  Only play it if you're starving for an action RPG.  It's got some cool ideas and it is fun to level up your character or craft gear, but with the main components of the game glitching all over the place and a disjointed story that is not compelling, there isn't much of a reason to play this.If you like Exploration and Open Ended Worlds, play The Elder Scrolls Oblivion and Skyrim.If you like tight combat and great enemies, play Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen!If you really want atmosphere and good combat, play The Witcher 2!If you want to be a Pirate, play Assassin's Creed Black Flag!If you want a horrific atmosphere and like dying, play Dark Souls!If you want a game similar to this, but better, play Kingdoms of Amalur!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2014"}

I'm playing the game with move controller and the responses are nice and didn't really miss much action with it.I didn't enjoy the story much, not because it's bad but because I've two kids of my own and as I've played the game I felt the gravity of the situation that the main character was in.  That felt terrible.  Also, that is why I gave 1 star for the fun factor because it's not fun.

Mario Kart Double Dash (MKDD) not only grabs you, but also hooks you with its ingenous racetracks, colorful and funny karts and their favorite trademark characters.This game is one of the few to take advantage of the broadband adapter (sold separately). The broadband setup allows up to 8 players to play simultaneously using 8 separate TVs and consoles (requires an 8-port hub with patch cables), or 8 players on 2 TVs(4 players per TV) using 2 consoles (requires only a cross over cable to connect the 2 consoles). These kind of setups are fantastic for a LAN party or even a MKDD tournament.Racing in this game is now a cooperative effort, there's the driver and the thrower on the same kart. Characters are classified as light(e.g. Baby Luigi), medium (e.g. Yoshi) or heavy(e.g. Bowser). There are also three (3) corresponding kart types. Any combination of driver/thrower is possible but they can ride only on a kart as big as the heaviest character in the pair. Light karts accelerate fast, but are weak when colliding against heavier karts, and they don't have great top speeds. Heavy karts accelerate slowly, but they are strong and have the highest top speeds. This character/kart combination allows the player to experiment and find the best pair for him/her.The main event is the grand prix competition. In this event you race against human and/or computer opponents trying to reach the goal first not only with speed but by using your wits. Special items such as banana peels or green shells, among others, are scattered all over the tracks for you to pick up. Each item gives you a strategic advantage that if used wisely can make a difference at the end of the race.Apart from the grand prix competition there are also other race modes such as time trials (to measure how fast you finish a track), versus (race against human players only) and battle, which also has its own variations. These game modes combined with multiplayer capabilities makes this game entertaining for a long period.How many character are there to choose? Well, there are 16, but who knows if there is some kind of code to unlock others.How many karts? There are 8, but you unlock others as you start winning grand prix tournaments.If you want clean, fun entertainment for the whole family then this one is a winner.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2003"}

Accept the changes and it becomes a great game.","reviewText":"In my opinion the game is really nice. The campaign is sweet, fast, like the Declassified missions, to make the game tougher (wind, dust, time limit, specific weapons). The single player is as good as any other Gears of War game. The mission at the bay, reminds me of the WW2 Normandy invasion, it was brutal first to take over and then to defend. All missions are really intense like this one. Some missions will send you waves of enemies (inside the campaign), you have a limited time to prepare the environment like positioning the movable turrets and get you in position. You have the executions and the DBNO (Down But Not Out), usually the AI will run and revive you, but sometimes you will get killed. Maps are really nice!! and there are new weapons that appear for the first time in the Gears of War series.The campaign has a real boss that gives you a good fight.The multiplayer is fast paced. It is easier to get kills and do better, the pace is faster. There are 5 maps (with the update), but Epic will provide more soon. I hope Epic adds the removed features, because they are already at the main (single player) game, so it should be easy for them to add. Anyway I believe is worthy and it is extremely fun. I recommend itUPDATE: Epic published a FREE DLC with more maps and the Execution mode, with DBNO and executions NOW Available. So I am now giving 5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2013"}

They are short, great fun, perfect for all ages, and incredibly inventive!If you've never played WarioWare games before, you're in for a treat. These are definitely games that text your reflexes as well as your mental quickness. You are shown a silly situation in kid-like graphics and given only the barest of hints about what to do. You might see a man's face with beard stubble. You have to figure out that your task is to shave off the stubble before the timer runs out. You get 3 seconds.Half the fun in this is laughing your fool head off as you try and fail to figure out the key to the puzzle - and then doing it fast enough to win. Each of the puzzles gets more complex as you get deeper into the game. Maybe the first time around you just have to dodge one ball with the marionnette. Then later you have to dodge two, or three. You'll be busy slashing with your samurai sword, balancing brooms, tracking down hidden people with a flashlight, and much more.In addition to these games, there are also several mini-games you can unlock. You can play a fascinating breakout style game with a never-ending tower. Try balancing falling tetris-like shapes on a narrow board. There are TONS of profiles here so you can have friends over and let them create their own profiles. Some of the games even involve your Mii characters!Let's see, what complaints can I have about this. The graphics are really cheezy - but they're *meant* to be cheezy. It adds to the cuteness of the game. There's really no plot. The plot is really that you have to complete a series of mini-games before the timers run out, and then get through a 'boss' which may or may not be challenging. Who cares, the games are all fun by themselves.Add on to this the numerous ways you're told to hold your controller - like a samurai sword, like a mowhawk on your head, like an elephant trunk on your nose, like a waiter's plate. The variety is great fun - and the droning, zen-like voice that gives you the description of what to do is hilarious.Highly, highly recommended for all ages!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2007"}

Each profile comes with 12 \"G Function\" keys that can be individually programmed with macros of keystrokes to help speed up your gaming. You can shoot first, move faster, or just make your character dance the best moves with the touch of one button. You can even assign a color for the profile that changes the colors of all your keys (though the colors are limited to red, purple, or blue...even if you try to do a custom color).There is a USB plug on the keyboard itself so you can plug your mouse or jump drive directly into it. That's a really convenient thing. Also, there's a switch on the keyboard that disables the \"Windows\" and \"Menu\" keys so you don't accidentally hit them while gaming and knock yourself out of the game. The audio controllers on the board are nice as well. You can plug a headset and microphone into the keyboard, as well as control your media player or iTunes through it. There is a one-button mute for the headset and microphone that makes it easy to return to the \"real world\" while gaming and not say the wrong thing to your teammates.All in all, that's a lot to like!Now for the not-so-good: The keys themselves take a little getting used to. They really didn't seem as responsive in everyday typing as the much cheaper keyboard I replaced. The lighted keys are a cool concept, but the glow is very minimal and unless you're in a completely dark room you won't really notice it. Also, it comes with a wrist rest that's supposed to snap on the front, but it doesn't fit. The clips on the rest don't match up with the holes on the bottom of the keyboard. None of those things are necessarily deal-killers when considering the keyboard though. Still, for the money you'd think they'd have done a better job with the wrist rest.I've been fortunate enough to use a lot of Logitech gear on my computers, and I can safely say this keyboard--even with its shortcomings--is one of the best I've used and holds up perfectly with Logitech's other gaming equipment like the mouse and headset. Well worth the investment!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2009"}

Now you can feel how it was for those old-school role-players, when they discovered its intense, immersive gameplay!   All-new dungeons and dialogue scenes to challenge and thrill gamers","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"Just like I remember it...","reviewText":"Last year saw the release of Final Fantasy Origins on PSOne. A compilation pack of the first two Final Fantasy titles, the second of which had been previously unavailable in America, Origins gave gamers the chance to play through the first two entries in the series with a new coat of paint. Featuring updated graphics, full motion video cutscenes, several optional gameplay tweaks and more, Origins carefully walked the fine line of pleasing both veterans and newcomers to the games. With Dawn of Souls, Square continues to refine the old classics.As with Origins, the versions of Final Fantasy 1 & 2 present in Dawn of Souls are based off the Japan-only WonderSwan Color remakes. This time around, the scripts were re-written and numerous additions and tweaks to the games themselves were made. Most noteworthy of these changes is the ability to save anywhere outside of battle, an important feature in a handheld RPG.The focus of Final Fantasy 1 is less on the story and more on exploration and fighting. Those that have played prior versions will note that the GBA edition is more balanced in that it doesn't require players to stop and level up their characters to survive the next dungeon, resulting in a much more streamlined experience. The flipside is that the revamped FF1 ends up lacking the challenge of past iterations, a virtual cakewalk for those familiar with the game. The only real challenge is in the form of the four new dungeons. These randomly generated dungeons, which feature bosses from Final Fantasy 3-6, reward players with rare and powerful items once cleared. With each dungeon unlocked after the defeat of the respective Chaos, some may find themselves questioning if it's even worth the time and effort to reach the new content. Of course, it's this lack of difficulty that makes the title perfect for handheld gaming, as you can fight a few battles, save and then restart where you left off hours, days, weeks or even months later without worrying too much about having to start over. The other major change in FF1 comes in the form of spell use. Previously dependant upon a character's level, magic now utilizes the more popular MP system, helping to make the game more accessible to newcomers. Spells, much like weapons, must be purchased and require a user to be a specific level before they can be equipped.Notorious for its unique leveling system, Final Fantasy 2 has also undergone several alterations. While characters still gain strength as they use an ability, you'll no longer need to rely upon attacking members of your own party to increase their hit points as this aspect has been more carefully balanced. A brand new epilogue, entitled \"Soul of Rebirth,\" has also been added.Of the two games, Final Fantasy 2 is the more story-driven, with a greater emphasis on character development. The stories seem a little tired and cliched, though that's mostly due to their age and influence on the role-playing genre. Fighting is handled by a traditional turn-based battle system, with random encounters occurring every so often outside of towns.It's also worth noting that Dawn of Souls includes some of the most impressive music on the Game Boy Advance to date, ranking right up there with Castlevania: Circle of the Moon. With two games and a bestiary on the cartridge, it's a testament to Square's prowess that they were also able to accommodate such rich and detailed sound.Though they may lack the depth and complexity of the modern games they inspired, Final Fantasy 1 & 2 are still quite enjoyable, and definitely worth playing if you're a fan of RPGs.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2004"}

Fast load times, plays 3D, web connected and updated, tons of apps.  And if you already have a PS3 and a bunch of games, a back up console now is not a bad idea.I'm not gonna go all into the details of a PS3.  Honestly, they've been out forever and what hasn't been said already?This particular 320GB Slim w/ UNCHARTED was a daily deal for $250 and it would have been about $120 just for a comparably good BD player.  I do still take issue with the fact that 99% of downloads cannot be done in the background and the controller sticks have convex tops which lets your thumbs slide off.  I gotta knock it one star for those stupid controller sticks, non-removable batteries, non-background downloads and still no IR.  Btw, the PS4 controller has concave sticks and background downloads.Anyhow, this was an awesome deal.  Probably one of the last chances to get a Slim since Sony replaced it with the Super Slim.  Which I read to be of lower quality.For those wonderring about the differences between the Slim & Super Slim:The Super Slim is the newest, smallest and slightly more efficient (10 watts less usage) model. It is also considered the \"cheapest quality appearing\" model with it's super thin plastic case and manual slide open door. Often suggested that Sony made those changes while keeping the selling price the same to make a better profit. It also has a slightly louder disc reading sound due to the thin case, but quieter fans. Hard Drive size can be 160 or 320 for the Slim and 250 or 500 for the Super Slim. All else is the same between the two.I wrote a rather negative review a few years ago on the PS3 because that PS3 went in the theater room where we often entertain and where putting up with long downloads that tied up the device and dead controllers was unacceptable.  While that remains an annoyance, if you're putting your PS3 in a set-up where those annoyances don't mean much (like me placing THIS PS3 in the bedroom) then there really isn't much to complain about.And as far as buying a PS4 or Xbox One, NO WAY JOSE.  Learned my lesson with the 360 RROD fiasco.  I will never buy another gaming console until it's been out at least 2 years.  Up yours Micro$oft!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2013"}

Yet, with the influence of motion gaming from Nintendo, it really influenced the way we played games with the motion of the wrist. Yet, there are so many games that have been so definitive to showcase with the Wii. The biggest one in my book for adventure is Super Mario Galaxy. With the joy of seeing Mario in space, it really changed the perspective on how we play adventure games. But unlike Sony & Microsoft with platformers, Mario will always be king, not just in gameplay, but also control, and that now with a new lower price for Super Mario Galaxy, it definitely is a great time to battle Bowser in space once again.Super Mario Galaxy, as a part of the Nintendo selects series, is definitely a great game from start to finish, as you are thrusted into space to rescue Princess Toadstool a.k.a. Princess Peach from the clutches of Bowser, as you not only brace yourself in space to save Peach, but also try and help Rosalina save her spaceship from the ruined damage. As you thrust yourself in space, you have so many dynamic enemies to master from a giant-sized spider spitting galactic venom, to Bouldergeist, a villainous enemy that is a deadly ghost that packs a punch when he protects himself with rock armor, and then grows vulgar arms. Graphically, the games looks amazing start to finish, while the music of the game brings celestial moods all the way to classic Mario themes from past games, to a epic orchestral Bowser showdown. The control of the game is very simple and easy to control Mario through the challenges from emptying trash to get a star, to trying to defeat foes without suffering damage to get stars.All in all, Super Mario Galaxy is a fantastic game is worth every penny and definitely one of the most defiant games that showed what Mario could really do on the Nintendo Wii. If you've never played Super Mario Galaxy when it originally came out back in 2007, than it honestly is a great time to get this game and watch Mario placed into orbit. I absolutely loved this game when it originally came out nearly 4 years ago, and you'll love it too.

Easily one of the best games of its  genre on any video game console, this long-awaited follow-up toGoldenEye 007is a must-have for Nintendo 64 owners--and a damn  good reason to be one if you're not.The futuristicPerfect Darkcasts players as Joanna Dark, a  secret agent who becomes embroiled in a sinister conspiracy involving  aliens and an evil corporation. Gameplay is broken down into missions,  each with objectives that must be unerringly completed before  progressing to the next mission. This is not your typical kill-anything-that-moves  game: putting a bullet in the wrong person, not keeping the  right one alive, or perforating a seemingly unimportant inanimate object  can often result in mission failure.WhilePerfect Dark's solo missions play out much like those inGoldenEye 007, the game's fantastic multiplayer options are  another matter entirely. Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy. However, the real fun here is in  the highly customizable Combat Simulator, a one-to-four-player  simultaneous-play mode that features both free-for-alls and team-based  challenges and can include up to eight Simulants, computer-controlled  combatants of varying behavior.Although Simulants make for decent adversaries or teammates, you'll want  to grab a friend--and an Expansion Pak, as only 35 percent of the game  is available without one--to fully enjoyPerfect Dark.--Joe  HonPros:One of the best first-person shooters on any video game consoleOutstanding multiplayer game with huge replay valueBevy of game options, cheats, and secret featuresExcellent training mode with challenges all of its ownCons:Graphics get ugly when playing with more than two players","reviewerName":"Ice Cream Man \"Neighborhood Dope Dealer\"","summary":"Goldeneye 2?","reviewText":"ok, no, no!

People who have played the previous two games might enter this game thinking that you can enter the same combat rhythm as before, but that's definitely not the case. Combat is more difficult as the counter button can't be spammed as much and the thugs sneak a lot more punches in. Adding the giant dudes, the martial artists and venom thugs adds more variety to the combat as well. I found the addition of the electric shock gloves to be an excellent one as it saved me from getting my butt kicked by the thugs. It's also just a TON of fun to use. The predator maps are also more expansive than the previous games as well  and have more layers in the levels to keep things more interesting.Although Arkham Origins reuses areas from Arkham city, it still feels fresh and different due to the Christmas setting as well as New Gotham across the bridge. It may not sound like much but the new areas and the new setting are enough to make the experience more fresh. Grappling across the city is not as intuitive though as it was in the previous game but It's ok though since you have the batwing at your disposal.One of the big advantages this game has is the character of batman himself is far more explored in this game than the previous two. His relationship with Alfred is more fledged out and he has a lot more character in this game than the previous two. It's also cool to see Batman kinda disturbed when he comes across what the Joker is capable of.The boss fights are also better in this game too.  They take more risks, are incredibly intense and have a more dramatic flair to it. Even the side mission bosses are better in this game than the previous game.The games story is a lot more intense and visceral than the previous games as well. There's a lot of twists and turns to it and it keeps you on your toes. The story line in this game is definitely ahead of a lot of other video game blockbusters out there. The crime scene investigations add a lot of mystery and suspense to the story as well.  They're even a little bit violent and scary which is a good thing. As great as the overall story is it might suffer from being a tad bloated which is kinda the norm in a lot of DC storylines (especially the TDKR and MOS movies)For better or for worse, AO takes a lot of inspiration from the Nolan movies. Plot points, as well as batmans costume, bat plane  and the batcave look right from the movie. I think a lot of fans love the previous 2 games because they have the ultimate Batman feel to it whereas this game has more of a Nolan influence. It still works pretty good though.A lot of people have come across game glitches and bugs. I have not so its hard for me to comment on that. But if you pay 60 bucks for this game and it crashes on you frequently then you have the right to rate it as low as you want. Also, the extra costumes that you get in this game are not as good as the arkham city costumes. Although I don't have all of the dlc costumes the ones I have just don't tickle my fancy all that much. The batman Noel costume and the new 52 graphic one don't compare to the arkham city ones.Overall if I was giving a professional review score for this game it would probably be a 9.2 range. I highly recommend it for fans of the Arkham series. And the 75 percent rating on Gamerankings is a joke.EDIT:  After completing the story and finishing some side quests I have come across some bugs. Thugs get stuck in the walls and frame rate gets choppy. It hasn't been bad but I can see why people would rate this game so low since it can be distracting and most people have had it a lot worse.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2013"}

Simply put, stop reading the reviews, don't give yourself too much knowledge outside of the game - just buy it, play it, and love it.How I can describe this game without giving too much away: It's like a mash up of some of the best titles over the years, and it combines their strengths perfectly, in a very engaging and well executed narrative. So, as I see it - the stealth and melee is reminiscent of Man Hunt - it's dark, gritty, and real, and involves the environment (no execution levels though, and that's appropriate for this game). It's like Heavy Rain - you feel like you're involved in a choose your own adventure type game. Parts of the story that could have or would have been a cutscene in other games are interactive events that you experience and participate in as a character.Half Life 2 - the post apocalyptic world, with ruins of a once great civilization, occupied by a questionable and conspiracy laden military government mixed with an \"alien\" common enemy is very compelling. It moves into a dystopic future that's more engaging and real than a cliche zombie game. The environments are full of nature taking back cities and ruins, and you're left wondering what exactly is going on through most of the game - in a good way. It's a nice blend of mystery and explanation.Ultimately of course it is its own game - the characterization, the future infected world, the attention to detail in environment - visual and audio is amazing. The specifics of the infection are really cool - a nice new take on the \"zombie\" genre, since it's not really zombies. Which is great, because I was apprehensive of another boring zombie killer remake.This is a game about story, about character, and dialogue. It does it interactively, and while there are cut scenes (game engine not renders) they're short and add to the story without detracting from game play. A lot of the interactions and character aspects come from events actually happening in the world and based on your character and other's actions.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2013"}

Granted, the game isn't perfect, it is FAR from bad!.  In fact, I think it's pretty damn good.  Aside from the facial features of the characters during conversations, the graphics are amazing.  The music is very nice, though it seems to be a bit off queue at times (not often, but enough to warrant me mentioning it.)  Over all, the game play is good. Combat seems pretty smooth, and it can be a challenge at times.There are some bugs in it, though.  For example, when I first came across the Judge in her office, Alex was floating in the air while they were having a conversation (his feet were about the same level as the top of her desk!)  The biggest problem I have with the game is the lack of save-points.  They are too few and the distance between them is substantial.  Unless you're using a guide, or have played through the game before (or fairly lucky/fast at playing,) the exploratory nature of the game makes it so you can expect a good 45 minutes to an hour between saves.  The challenge of the game steadily increases, and losing an hour of play can be demoralizing to some.  The story is good enough to keep me going back for more though (the nurses in the Grand Hotel ate me alive for a while there!)Advice for those playing through for their firs time:  Save as much as you can, and make multiple save-files. Otherwise you might find yourself starting over because you used up all your ammo or recovery items a few hours in.  Coming up with some solid tactics can save you a fair amount of grief later in the game.Over all, this is a very welcome addition to the Silent Hill series, as well as the Survival Horror genre in general!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2011"}

White \"Dragnilar\"","summary":"The best MK spin off game to date","reviewText":"Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks is hands down the best \"Mythologies\" title in the MK Universe. After having two rather poor spin offs (Sub-Zero and MK: Special Forces), it seemed as if MK could only do well in it's core series... until now.MK: Shaolin Monks is a re-telling of Mortal Kombat 2, through the eyes of Kung Lao and Liu Kang. The game starts at the end of MK 1 and runs all the way up to the climatic finish where you battle the great Shao Kahn. Along the way you will utilize the game's somewhat unique combat engine, which is basically a hybrid of a platformer like Devil May Cry and the MK \"Kombat\" engine. What is so great about it though is that it is not stiff like the \"Kombat\" engine, and allows pretty much free movement. You still have \"kombos\" and special moves, but they are all easy to execute and chain together, giving even a novice player an easy chance to get in the game and start kicking butt. You also have the ability to pull off fatalities on just about every enemy (even bosses, when you beat them!)The game also features an \"RPG\" like experience point system, which you can manipulate heavily depending on how good you get at killing enemies and keeping your combos going without getting knocked down. As long as you keep hitting enemies and killing them, your combo will increase. With each kill or 10 hits, you receive a multiplier point. After your combo ends, the points you earned depending on a number of factors, including your combo and kills, are multiplied. You then receive experience points based on that multiplication. The experience points then can be used to purchase new moves and combos in the status screen. The only downside to this though is the fact that the game has only so many combos and moves to purchase. You will easily have purchased every move available well before the game is over (for me, it was half way before the game was complete!)The graphics for MK: Shaolin Monks are kind of bad in places (especially in the cinematic cut scenes - everyone pretty much has the same face!) The in-game graphics are good though for the most part, although they seem gritty and un-finished in places. The dynamic lighting and the blood makes up for it though... if you like your violence red.Sound-wise, MK: Shaolin Monks is like any other MK game. The soundtrack is not at all that impressive, but it fits the atmosphere of the game, especially in the areas that are straight out of MK 2. The only qualms with the game's sound are probably with it's voice acting... but we'll get into that further in a bit.The story telling of MK:Shaolin Monks is another hamper on the game. While the game features some great MK action and appearances from just about everyone's favorite characters, the way they appear (or die) is somewhat non-sensual at times. Also, with the way certain things happen in the game, you will be left with your head scratching, wondering if you recall things being that way in MKII's story. To top it off, the game has some really BAD voice acting (best example is Shao Kahn... instead of using the MK announcer voice, they used some other random voice.)Despite the shoddy voice acting and rather butchered storyline, MK:Shaolin Monks is still the best MK spin-off game to date. It features a combat engine that is arguably better than the regular MK fighting engine, and it gives the gamer more things to do (tons of stage kills and environmental manipulations.) You also have a couple secret characters to unlock, as well as plenty of extra \"kontent\" to find along the way (including a hidden port of the arcade version of Mortal Kombat II!) MK: Shoalin Monks is highly recommended for any MK fan or just about any action/platformer fan.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2005"}

I loved Godfather 2 - to a lessor degree.  Godfather 2 gets kudos for how involved the player must get with controlling all the several properties and employees.  Mafia 2 is way too linear.  You follow missions and then the game is over.  No feeling of building an empire or exploring the map or really anything.  It is a title that, to me, disappoints.  I think I finished it in about 10 hours.  I have never finished a game that fast.  And when it's over it is over.  No option to continue to horse around, staying in the game and continuing to run your empire.  Nope, Game Over.  I would not rate it better than one star if it were not for the background graphics and music.  it just lacks that ability to draw you into the story......and keep you there.  I kept thinking as I played it that I wish Godfather 1 looked this good because it was such a better game too play and that this one, not so much.In short:Mafia 2 has so much driving for no apparent reason.  GodFather 1 & 2 had you drive to build up to something.Mafia 2 looks open world, but is not as it is ALL MISSIONS.  It is pure storyline that you must follow.Mafia 2 has excellent background graphics and music.  It's characters, however, look like something from Godfather 1.  Very dated graphics on the people.There are no \"joints\" to control or payouts to collect or any such \"feeling\" of true organized crime like was created in GF 1 & somewhat in GF2.Way too many cut scenes that go on forever.Way too short a game.It reminded me of the Godfather movie trilogy where Mafia 2 game is like Godfather 3 movie.  It just doesn't measure up.UPDATE 04/29/2011:  I popped the game back in just to see one more time if there's anything to do after you've completed all the chapters.  Nope.  I started certain chapters over and I tried different things like robbing stores, buying clothes and guns, stealing cars.  There's absolutely no point.  Money is really only needed to complete a mission or two - which was already done.  There's no rackets to control or even hookers to pick up.  And, to make it worse, the game stopped me in the middle of one of the ventures.  I had been stealing cars and having shootouts with police and just generally trying to see if there was any fun factor in replay (there's not) when the screen popped up \"Mission Failed\" and sent me back to the beginning of the chapter, never having saved any of that side stuff I did.  It was not a timed mission I was supposed to be on, but I guess the game didn't want me NOT doing the mission.  I took out the disc and it now sits in my \"sell it\" pile.Like I said above, it is purely mission based - point a to point b.  Maybe I'm missing something here, but I thought the game could have been so much more.  It's like they had a great idea with so much attention to the background graphics and then they just dropped the ball.  Godfather 1 & 2 are so much better.If I'm missing something here - if there is some cool stuff you CAN do after having done all the missions/chapters - please tell me.  I drove around forever, but there just doesn't seem to be anything you can really do...short of collecting wanted posters, I guess.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"Caraculiambro","summary":"the stupidest game ever made:  I hated every minute of it","reviewText":"I don't quite know how to describe how lame this game is.  It's certainly the worst video game I've ever played, though the makers appear to have had quite a budget.  But alas!  there is no fun to be had at any point in this game, and finishing it became a tedious chore.  I spent most of my time yelling at the screen.1.  \"Very easy\" mode isn't.  You're still expected to single-handedly defeat dozens of armed opponents without really knowing what you're doing or how things work.  Your partners are useless and will never take care of things for you.2.  The game provides no instructions whatsoever.  There's a manual, but what I mean is that every time you enter a new area, it's like a new mini-game with rules of its own that you have to figure out -- while you're getting shot at.  For example, suddenly you'll have an opponent behind a riot shield, which you've never come across before.  How are you supposed to defeat him?  Bullets?  Punching him?  A grenade?  The game leaves you to figure this out, meaning that your guy will be killed and you'll have to backtrack several times before you do.3.  The game constantly makes you go back and replay every scene over and over again until you can do it perfectly without getting killed.  Did the gamemakers imagine this constituted fun?4.  There is apparently no way to check your guy's health -- or improve it.  You're left guessing how much health you have.5.  The game presents a world but doesn't really let you explore it in any logical way.  This is the adventure you're going to have, and you're going to get through it precisely like this.  You are going down this alley, and no other ideas will be entertained.  You're supposed to clamber up a street sign, for example, but are not permitted to climb up the side of a garden-variety troop transport?6.  The game asks you to solve puzzles, but the solutions to them are illogical.  For example, you need to make your way to a certain temple, and the streets are blocked.  Uh, howabout climbing just over that barrel and continuing on our way?  That's my suggestion.  No, no.  Here's the solution:  clamber up a street sign, shimmy on over to a neighboring building on a clothesline, leap blindly to a neighboring building, climb the crumbling face of the next building, etc.  It was so ridiculous.  After playing the game for a while you could pretty much ferret out what to do whenever your character became stuck:  look for the most preposterously inefficient means of conveyance:  there's the way forward.  During most of the game (e.g., the Monastery), your character is not even permitted to try to open a garden-variety door.7.  The game provides no instructions on weaponry.  If you're about to ditch your gun for a lesser one, the game will give you no warning or advice. Does the game seriously expect me to know whether it's better to have a FAL or an AK-47?  How would I know?  I guess to kids these days, such knowledge must be second-nature, but they should at least have included some advice in the manual.  Nope.8.  The story behind the game is way too complicated to follow.  Your guidebook, certainly, is incomprehensible.9.  The game's battle sequences are preposterous.  A few thugs in Nepal, okay.  But you're telling me the bad guys shipped in dozens and dozens of commandos into Nepal just to kill you?  How did they get visas for all of them?  How did they get the arms into the country?  How are they getting supplies under the circumstances?  Don't they realize the hundreds of thousands of dollars this must have cost is not going to be offset by selling Marco Polo's treasure (if they ever do get it), and they'll be left with a net debt?10.  The game forces you to accept as \"co-adventurers\" NPCs that you'd immediately kill, if given your druthers.  This was frustrating.  Who's playing this game?  Him or me?  I say to shoot her and continue on alone!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2010"}
{"product_name":"B003PHLT8W","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"A console shooter like none other","reviewText":"Vanquish... wow..  Platinum games is definitely establishing itself as a game developer with style and quality.  Vanquish is a game that kind of came out of no where.  It was off the radar for a long time and suddenly showed up at E3.  This game throws everything it has at you from the start and despite a semi-weak story you can bet you will see a Vanquish 2 in the future.Gameplay: Insane.  Remarkable.  One of the best shooters I have played in ages.  Not to say games like Halo, Gears, Half-Life, Doom, Quake etc are average but those are games that focus on many aspects all at the same time.  Story line, new cutting edge gaming engine, MP elements... etc etc.  Vanquish comes bursting out of the gate in boost mode tossing much of that aside and focusing on a single element.  Shooting.  The polish on the gameplay is spectacular.  The AI in the game is spot on.  on \"casual\" you can expect the AI units to basically be there for target practice yet they still try to flank and will try to overwhelm you.  \"hard\" you can expect very difficult AI that will use cover to its advantages, flank you, and even throw grenades such that it traps you in one spot so a sniper could put you down.  The gameplay is fast.. vicious.. unforgiving of mistakes.  Your AI marines actually can put up a fight but don't expect much from them.  They tend to get in the way and get wounded fast but that is a plus since healing them gives you ammo or a weapon upgradeSound/Story: The sound is fantastic.  You will be behind a wall taking cover to heal up, reload or perhaps to take a smoke(yes that's right, Sam will smoke a cigarette while in cover if you wish; however there is a secret little use for this you will have to figure out on your own).  Anyhow, while hiding you can tell exactly what is happening or where people are.  From the sound of gunfire to the powering up of high energy canons etc.  It is polished and sounds fantastic.  The static from the comms, or the switching clicks of your gun remodeling itself into the weapon of your choice.  Boost jets etc.  Story.. well the story is there, don't be fooled by people saying the game has no storyline.  It just lacks polishing.  The game focuses heavily on combat and mission objectives leaving the storyline as an afterthought that doesn't show itself until the last 20 minutes of the game. Could be a good thing though as it could leave you wanting more, being a real storyline actually exists under all this chaotic actionGraphics/Presentation: The graphics are spectacular.  Presentation spectacular thanks to graphics and polishing.  The suit Sam wears is just out of this world.  The amount of detail and subtle things going on are countless.  From grenades switching out, drag flaps opening and closing while boosting, the BLADE changing shapes, visor opening and closing.  Just as much detail went into the environment and while invisible walls exist (in a way), the environment is also destructible on a small level.  You'll be behind a cement barrier safe and sound.. wait.. i just got shot how? wha... will be your reaction as you look back over your shoulder to find a grenade, missile or just constant bullet fire tore that cement barrier to shreds and now your head is out there just screaming hello to a sniper.Length/Replay: The game is short.. I beat it on \"casual\" in 4hrs 12mins.. \"HARD\" took me 40mins to get to act 1-5 and that is just 1/2 way through Act 1 so you can see how the game ramps up in difficulty and time harder it gets.  HARD seems like a 6-8hr playthrough as enemies have at least double the HP as casual and have the aim of a sharpshooter + the marines are basically just in the way at that difficulty ( GOD HARD difficulty scares me )  Replay is like any shooter. If you like it you will come back to it over and over until you find something better usually a squeal.Summary of \"cons\" I have for this game (with positive re-enforcement)- Storyline could of been polished better.  It is there and has the makings of a good storyline. [By the time you are done playing the gameplay more than makes up for the weak focus on story]- Scoring system doesn't seem that polished up(far to simple)  [seems like a last second addition in the dev process but a smart one.  Would like to see it evolve into Halo's scoring system in a way.  Have some detail so people can show off their HS count or nade kills.. melee kills etc]Overall Score: 96%A great shooter.  A game the console generation has probably been waiting years for.  While it isn't has hyped up as Halo, Gears, Killzone etc  and has *no multi-player*  the game really doesn't need it as badly as one might think (could just be that I grew up with games that were only SP prior to high speed internet being readily available).  It plays fine and has incredible replay value simply on the fact it keeps track of your stats and there are 112 hidden gold statues around the game. ... (*opinion*) besides, why spend time developing a MP mode if people are just going to be playing Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, Halo MP etc.  I would of liked to see a \"Co-Op campaign\" mode though.  It would fit the gameplay much better than a simple thrown together Multiplayer system like  Uncharted 2 has","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2010"}
{"product_name":"B008GEH9HO","description":"","reviewerName":"Arch Stanton","summary":"A Very Nice Handheld Console","reviewText":"Pros:Quality gaming engine is able to improve noticeably over DS gamesHigh-quality upper screenAn ever increasing and high quality game libraryBackwards compatible with DS gamesEasily portable with a protective lid sheltering the screensCons:3D is mostly uselessNo second analog stickRegion lockedThe 3DS was released two years ago and is only just recently reaching its potential. I've had mine for a year at this point and I can definitely say that I've noticed the number of people I encountered through StreetPass skyrocket in the past few months. I used to be able to walk down the street without picking up anyone at all. In fact, I went through the London Underground in rush hour and only had five hits. But now I walk down through my fairly small town and I pick up ten new people every time. It's made it almost tooo easy.The reason for this surge in popularity is obvious. The 3DS was marred by a rather dismal set of release games that was dominated by ports from the N64 and PS2, such asThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Star Fox 64, andTales of the Abyss. It was the same way for the first year and a half as everyone tried to figure out what to do with it, with the strange 3D features and motion controls putting some developers off. Fortunately, the system got over that and now has its own unique games likeFire Emblem: Awakening,A Link Between Worlds, andPok&eacute;mon X.As to the 3DS in general, the system is basically the same as the DS with improved graphics. Why improve on perfection I suppose? That machine was a near-perfect gaming platform with many classic games. The graphics however, were often quite blocky and sometimes ugly. The 3DS improves on that although most games keep the unrealistic style of DS games. They just do it better, with cartoony graphics that actually look like cartoons. Some of the visuals on the 3DS can be pretty amazing, but there are few games that show them off to the full. I think that the graphics level is somewhere around that of the PS2, as can be seen in a number of direct PS2 ports. This is good enough for a handheld system and means we can finally get rid of the blocky little shrunken men that dominated DS games. It's not as good as theVita, but since 3DS games are rarely about superior graphics that doesn't matter. Most of the best 3DS games would have worked just fine on the DS, they simply look nicer with better graphics. And that sums up Nintendo's strategy to a T: If it ain't broke don't fix it. And since the 3DS can do DS games better than the DS as well as play higher end games (Ace Combat looked pretty good on its screen) this system offers a lot more chance for expansion while allowing Nintendo to take few risks.The big gripe everyone has about the 3DS is the 3D part. And yes, it isn't great. If it wasn't for the fact that I dislike the non-clamshell design of the 2DS I'd recommend going for that. But the problems with the 3D have often been overstated. Yes, it rarely adds anything to the gaming experience; yes it means you have to hold the system at exactly the right angle to see it; yes, it can sometimes cause headaches; but then you can simply turn it off if you don't like it. There's a little switch on the side that makes it dead easy. I don't know of any games that require 3D to function so you don't really lose anything. What I generally do is put the 3D off when I'm playing the game, but turn it on for cinematics. Because animated cutscenes in 3D look absolutely superb. Sometimes they has left me utterly blown away.The motion control elements of the 3DS are similarly gimmicky, although I can see more potential for their integration into a good gaming experience. Under no circumstances should the two gimmicks be used together. The 3D is dependent on having the 3DS at a constant distance from your face, so if you have to move the unit around to use the motion sensors then you're going to get a headache quick.Another aspect of the hardware that gets people a bit upset is the battery life. The 3DS can't really play a 3DS game for longer than 3-4 hours, putting it well below the operating time of the original DS and even the Vita. However, that's only for 3DS games. The system can run on battery for eight or more hours when playing DS games, which isn't really any worse than the DS itself. The reduced battery life is just the tradeoff you get for superior graphics. There is no way around it. The one battery-related thing that does bother me though is that the sleep mode isn't very good at conserving energy. If you leave the 3DS sleeping for two days without a charge it will run out of battery. I assume this is related to Streetpass and could be resolved by simply turning the wifi off so I'm giving it a break on that score.The 3DS comes with with a number of programs preinstalled including System Settings, the eShop, Activity Log, Nintendo Zone, 3D Camera, and Mii Maker. These programs are fairly self-explanitory and cannot be deleted as they are essential to the functioning of the system. I'm not particularly happy with the eStore. It seems rather clunky to use, and crashes frequently. It's nice that it can background download, but it makes everything up to that point far too difficult. The 3DS can play downloaded games rather than using cartridges, and the fact that it uses standard memory cards means that this isn't that difficult or expensive to do. A major plus over the Vita and its Vita-exclusive memory cards.Also preinstalled are Face Raiders and Augmented Reality. These are both short games designed to be used with the 3DS's camera. They add digitally created figures to what appears behind your 3DS and allow you to, for example, shoot men with your face on them who fly about your room in little balls. It's pretty cool, and a real shame that no games have been made to take advantage of these features since. The other game on there is StreetPass. This is a collection of two games (though they can be upped to six if you pay for them) that depend on you collecting other players' characters via wifi. As you pass another 3DS in the street you will automatically sync with it and their character will show up on your Mii Plaza from which you can play games. I don't know of any other system that has social gaming features that make you feel as involved as this. I understand that Japan has something similar with cell phone games and I believe there was something like it for the PSP, but over here the only competition is Vita's Near, and StreetPass leaves Near in the dust. There's just no benefit to using Near whereas with StreetPass you get to play games with people you run into, even if they're not involved any more than that. Rewards include hats and uniforms for your Mii character.A major problem with the 3DS when compared to its predecessor is that games are now region-locked. European games cannot be played on American systems, nor can Japanese games. This is a real problem for me as I have a European 3DS. So at the moment I can't play games likeShin Megami Tensei IV, though I suspect that they'll release it in Europe eventually. Fortunately, the DS cartridges are still region-free and can be played in any system.The 3DS comes in three versions: thebase model 3DS, the 3DS-XL (this one), and the2DS. Now, the 3DS is fine as a system, but its screen is just as tiny as the DS's. The 3DS-XL however has a screen that's almost twice as big while still fitting comfortably in your hand or your pocket. It also has a longer battery life, giving you perhaps an extra hour's usage. Even if you only want to use it to play DS games it's worth the upgrade. It is of course, the most expensive of the three options. The 3DS is somewhat cheaper and fits in pockets easier, but I personally don't like how boxy it is. The 3DS-XL is all smooth lines and is only slightly bigger when you consider the increased size of the screen. But if small size really is important for you I'd go with the 3DS. The 2DS is really only for people who don't expect to carry it around in their pockets. The one-piece construction makes it stronger, but it does mean that it is less protected and you need a jacket or sweater to carry it in. The fact that it doesn't have 3D isn't much of a loss. I have friends who swear by the 2DS, and I can see its advantages, but if you expect to bring it everywhere I'd go for one of the other two options.To sum up: the 3DS is an excellent gaming system that improves on what didn't work on the DS while keeping all of the features that worked. If it features gimmicks like 3D and motion control they can be easily turned off or ignored. It's a small price to pay for quality. Anyone wanting a portable gaming system has no reason not to turn to the 3DS. I was never a fan of portable games since I came to them back in the days of Gameboy and Game Gear when 2D sprites were the way to go and difficulty settings often unforgiving. But the 3DS has made a convert out of me and consumes far too much of my free time. Definitely recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2014"}
{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"Charles H.","summary":"Good fun for a good price.","reviewText":"I've had my Wii for about four years now. It was 250 when I bought it. It seemed a little steep at the time, but fortunately the price has fallen considerably. With that in mind, I'd recommend the Wii to anyone and everyone. It's good fun for the price.As most surely know by now, the Wii makes use of motion controls. I won't beat around the bush: Waggling your remote around can be both tedious and annoying on some games. But fortunately, there are enough games that use normal control schemes. The Wii Remote is often flipped horizontally and implemented as if it was a NES controller. Also, they make a Classic Controller attachment for the Wii Remote (sold separately). With that add-on, you can play quite a few Wii games with SNES-styled dual analog controller.There aren't many graphical masterpieces on the Wii. People often say that its graphics aren't very different from those present on the N64, but this isn't exactly true. The Wii's image quality really is a lot sharper than most of the games present on that system. But since we can make some comparisons with a system released almost seventeen years ago, the Wii obviously can't compete with graphically with its HD competition.The Wii has some online functionality. It doesn't have a social network implemented in the same way the Xbox 360 and the PS3 do, but it does have a Wii Friend code system for playing with people you know. Many games implement online multiplayers. You can also download and purchase video games from Nintendo through the Wii Shop Channel. In additional to all that, you can even browse the web from your console. But unfortunately, the web browser is pretty terrible in terms of functionality.That's pretty much all I can say about the Wii, except this one additional thing: You can get a Wii through Amazon for as little as 70 bucks now. If you don't have a game console and are looking for a good form of entertainment, why not pick up a Wii? Most of the second and third party games are really cheap now too. The Wii is probably worth 150 bucks new, and its a downright steal for the price you can get it at used.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2011"}

While gaming, the added chatpad not only adds extra weight to the controller, but if you have bigger hands like me, actually cramps up game play.  This is most noticeable in using the right thumb stick, particularly in movement that requires the thumbstick positioned directly to the left.  In this game play configuration, my thumb actually hits against the frame of the chatpad.  While this does not impede movement or game play significantly, it does not feel comfortable.  It detracted my experience enough that I only attach the chatpad when typing, which I am finding is actually less and less thanks to most of the voice activated features on the Xbox.2. Regarding the standard Xbox headset: while the chatpad does act as a pass-through for voice (there is a headset jack on the bottom of the chatpad), the microphone jack is sloppy and does provide a feedback static if bumped due to a poor connection.  This may be a defect on the unit I received, but when playing games, I find the chatpad actually decreases audio quality (both transmit and receive) and I end up having to disconnect it anyway.I write this because while the simple and obvious workaround is to disconnect the chatpad when not using it, the connection is less than simple to connect (requires a bit of force) and becomes a burden.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2012"}

Flipping between 2D and 3D makes for some compelling puzzles and interesting hunts for secrets.  Overall the game is a blast, and my 8 year old son has gotten hooked on it.My only gripe:  far too much reading.  And by that I don't mean that I mind reading, but there are a few sections where you have to click through endless dialog boxes of \"plot\" just to get back to the game.  It's not bad, and some of it is kind of funny, but overall I don't really care about the plot - we're trying to save someone and/or find some stuff, right?  That's all I need to know.One other point that others have made is that the game is fairly easy.  By comparison I recently downloaded Super Mario Bros. on the Wii VC and I'd forgotten how challenging the older games are.  But I'm also now reminded how much I like that Mario \"floating\" jump mechanic vs. double jumps, which are fairly standard now in platform games.  The Mario mechanic, while not necessarily \"better\" is less forgiving but also gives better control.  Or something.Oh, and just one tip:  if you get stuck at a seeming dead end and can't figure out what to do you probably missed something in an earlier part of the level.  We couldn't get to the end point of one level and then figured out that my son had missed a sign we had to read after flipping to 3D earlier in the level.Anyway, this is a great game and it has the feel and fun of a classic Mario game, and that's all that matters for me.  Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2011"}

The missions are tedious, bullets are scarse and they try to make it difficult but in a dull way. Don't get me wrong: I love how some russian games developers are making videogames but somehow I think the creator of games like this one or Cryostasis have another notion of a fun game like we do. I was very fortunate because I was able to \"try\" the game before buying it. Save your hard earned money and look elsewhere. This game is not worth it.

The Havoc engine is what makes all the objects in the game interactive. You can move bottles, kick over chairs, blow up cardboard boxes, etc. Almost all of the objects can be interacted with. Unfortunately, the coolness feature of the Havoc engine isn't enough to hold up this game. The story is very weak, and I found myself skipping through it because it was so boring and slow. Max's lines were cliched and tired, and the dialogue was horrible. But then again, perhaps that was the intent. It just didn't win me over.The aiming style takes some getting used to if you've been playing Quake all your life, and the feature of \"bullet time\" where everything is slowed down (ala Matrix) makes it very easy to dispatch enemies. The other poor design of this game is that you have to beat it to unlock more difficult play modes. Everyone starts off in easy mode and you can only adjust it by going through the entire game once. As for me, I didn't find the game exciting enough to play a second time around, and don't know many people that would. Difficulty settings should have been unlocked from the start.This game would make a great demo to check out the cool effects of the Havoc engine, but as a feature game, it just doesn't hold up.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2003"}

I was originally introduced to MAG during the public beta.  Since then, the game has been really polished and surprisingly lag free.  The maps are massive, and you really get a sense that you are a part of something bigger than most online FPS.Every time you play it's a different story since you are most likely in a different area of the map, and must rely on a different set of squad mates to accomplish tasks.  It really sets up for epic battles in which the tables can turn ever so quickly!  Communication is a must, so I would highly recommend getting a mic.The only downside to this game is that the sabotage maps can get repetitive.  Hopefully they will introduce one more for each faction.  I've had my share of bad battles in which your thrown in with a group of players that don't understand the value of teamwork, but I'd say I've encountered that in less than 10% of the games I played.

I did have to wait for it to go down in price a bit before buying.It was nice they remastered the games trying to touch them up in spots however you could tell it was of lower quality (graphically) then the other PS3 games. It was about the same as the first God of War game maybe but maybe slightly worse (graphically again).The stories were interesting ones that seemed to just add to the God Of War saga without having to mess with anything in the storyline of the other games. The one game helped bridge the gap to something you find in one of the other games related to the god Hades.The gameplay mechanics were pretty much the same as previous games without being as difficult as say the third God of War. And the boss fights weren't to difficult. There were times here and there where trying to jump onto something else could require 3-4 or more tries because the game for some reason didn't think you made it or something. Which were the only the real downsides to it.Overall if you have played the god of war games and haven't checked out these, this would be a good chance to while they are still low in price.

The concept of traveling from world to world (Let alone being able to kill a beast to save a princess) in a video game was pretty much unheard of back then, so thanks to the power of the NES, it all became reality.The gameplay couldn't be any simpler. You run, you jump, you crush enemies, you grab items to upgrade yourself, etc. And once you experience (If you haven't already), you will have a thrilling time, even in today's standards. The level design is remarkable, and the music, although with few tunes, define the adventure occurring within your TV screen. Not to mention, the graphics are excellent as well.====DUCK HUNT====Okay...So some may not be able to play it perfectly, but for those that can, they will be able to experience something rather unique in comparison to what lots of other games have to offer. Duck Hunt is a simple arcade-style shooting game that you play using your trusty Light Phaser.Before the Wii Remote used its point-at-the-screen gimmick for shooters, the NES Light Phaser was the only way how to play a game using said gimmick. And Duck Hunt really showed it off. The ducks are flying! Shoot them down! You actually feel like as if you're shooting down those ducks, thanks to the lifelike structure sitting in your hands.If you own an NES, your library will NEVER be complete without this cartridge. Even if Duck Hunt doesn't work, you still have Super Mario Bros, which is (Let's be honest about this) the superior game anyway. Not saying that Duck Hunt isn't fun, but a full-fledged platformer like SMB can't compare to an arcade-style game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2012"}

Unlike other games that resort to using motion controls, this game returns to the use of a nonmotion guided control scheme to allow for a wide array of fun.  At its core, Brawl is a traditional fighting game with the usual onslaught of combos, playable characters, and modes.  However, surrounded by this core is excessively addicting gameplay, collectibles, music, and fan service.Potentially, this game is a fan service game.  It features hundreds of references to many Nintendo properties and even a few third party playable characters.  I could sit here and describe every single mode to you but that would take me forever.  Brawl packs so much but where the fun mostly lies is in its versus mode.  There is an online versus mode but due to constant lag problems it should be avoided.  This is the definitive local multiplayer game with up to four player support using any combination of wii remote control, nunchuk, classic controller, and gamecube controller.The only negative aspect of this game is the annoying single player mode called the subspace emissary.  It is all flash and no substance.  Basically a player plays this mode to unlock a few collectibles or characters (though characters can be unlocked by fulfilling other feats in the numerous other modes). There is no voice over work performed in the cutscenes in this mode, little background information is given, and it brings back to life an annoying gameplay mechanic from times past, replaying boss fights...Looking beyond the subspace emissary you shall have a game that is loaded with tons of features and all.  It will take more than 100 hours to unlock every collectible (yes because there is a collectible for having 100 hours of playtime),  for people who do not have tons of local players to play with there is a decent online mode or one can just constantly play against ridiculously over powered PC controlled opponents.Ultimately, if you are a Wii owner you need this game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2009"}

That day was almost entirely spent in a haze, as I swung my Keyblade about like it was 2002 again. But good chunks of that game bored me to tears, with its glacially slow start, repetitive missions, and the baffling inability to run around The World That Never Was save for the bland hub room you spend your time in. What I did like was the fun tile system and the story, which is by far the most tragic in the series. Re:Coded was fun but suffered from the most recycling in series history, where even the new areas have been copy/pasted into later areas.Fast Forward to 2013, and I bought a secondhand 3DS with which to play Pokemon X/Y, and the first order of business was to acquire a copy of KH 3D, or KH DDD if you're a pervert. I open my copy and sail away (literally). After the game's completely unexplained first fight (against Ursula of all people), the game immediately hit the brakes and spends the next hour and a half boring you to tears with explanations of systems you already understand in another version of Traverse Town.However, once the game remembers that you can figure things on your own, the game plays it's Get Out of Boredom Free card and shows you the doorway into a brand new set of areas for Traverse Town, and from then on, very little of your surroundings have been copied from past games.Flowmotion, a pink-colored mode of transport that fits the series like a glove, lets you go anywhere from the onset, but is difficult to get a hang of. This complements the old Command List combat and the new Dream Eater party members. They are the only way to get key abilities, so pay attention. Also new is the Drop system, in which a gauge steadily depletes, at which point you are forced to swap between the two separate protagonists, Sora and Riku. It makes for a new form of tension, as you manage both your health and your Drop gauge (via new items) in order to defeat bosses.The story is the usual mix of completely, ass-kickingly awesome, PhD levels of convoluted-ness, and manly tears. Riku has the lion's share of both character development and play time, and his arc (involving him owning up to his past and the darkness inside him) is the one to beat. Sora's story is still fun to watch, though I'd like to see him grow up a little. The end (and the unlockable secret movie) teases the incoming Kingdom Hearts III, and the credits literally spells out \"This leads to Kingdom Hearts III\" during the credits. Have fun waiting for THAT.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2013"}

Yes two of the games(COO/GOS)are digital downloads but you do get the three series games on physical format like with previous released HD Collection sets. I'm sure many and I agree have seen how the game plays and feels a little similar to the DMC series though of course there are differences you will feel a sense of deja vu if you played the DMC series games.  The graphics of the games for this set are top notch though expected of course with GOW3 the previous two games look to have been definitely remastered for this set release. So for fans looking for a kicka$$ game or have played on of the previous GOW games and are looking to get them all then look no farther as we have a very good set at a very affordable price too..Update 03-30-2013Some people have asked me about the video quality of the two digital games Ghost of Sparta and Chains Of Olympus and if they've been remastered.  I can't say how much of an improvement they are above the PSP versions when first released but at most I would say they they are at the high end of how games were during the PS2 console days.  Also while I didn't get the first god of war I did play the second at a friends place and have to say that the graphics do look greatly better then when they were first shown on the PS2. So while I can say for people who have the PSP versions of COO&GOS; if they'll see much difference but you'll see a much better video graphics quality with the trilogy on the blu-ray discs.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2013"}

The G11 was my favorite and this one is kinda similar to that one only red backlighting and a black keyboard.  This is definately a very nice gaming and multimedia keyboard with tons of macros which i can't even find things to use them for.  But it works very well for my games and has a cool function called Cruise Control, you push a button and it pushes it automatically like on a car.  Very cool.  The knobs for sound and lighting are very convienient and the detachable keypad is awesome because I never used that and it frees up so much space.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2010"}

Evans","summary":"very refreshing","reviewText":"Crimson skies is a very refreshing game to play.  It is really original in its plot, gameplay, and just overall style.  This is a great game even if you are not into flying shooter games, but this is just done extremely well.Graphics(9/10):  everything is detailed very nicely.  The planes, grass, mountains, oceans, buildings, zeps, sky, and the explosion from destroying an enemy is just beautiful to see.  There is not too much to worry about on the graphics side.Sound(10/10):  The sound is amazing for this game.  You can hear the water going by when you get close to it, the wind as you fly your plane around, when another plane passes you it sounds real.  The best sound is when you do a dive, and then pull up and the last second.  Even the music fits perfectly within the games style and time setting.Gameplay(8/10):  The gameplay is quite original.  You are a leader of a group of pirates called the fortune hunters.  It unravels to bring to each of the six different locations, where you can do numerous things.  You can destroy other planes and zeps, race your plane in a course for money, do little secondary missions, and just explore a massive map.  The only problem is that if you do not have xbox live it might not be worth playing after you beat it.  I have it so I am very content, but there is not enough afterwards to do to continue playing.Other than all that this game is really worth every cent.  With being a new kind of genre for xbox it is a big relief to playing the same old games.  This game never gets boring so make sure you purchase it or at least rent it to play it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2004"}
