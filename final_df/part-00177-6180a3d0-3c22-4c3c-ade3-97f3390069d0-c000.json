Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Battlemage","reviewText":"Sorcery should have been one of the Move launch titles because not only does it take full advantage of both the Move and the Nav controllers but it does it in a fun, energetic and often imaginative way.THE STORYSorcery is NOT an open world adventure. It's highly scripted and it follows the story of a fairy tale where you are the sorcerer's apprentice on a quest to, of course, rescue the charming princess who... but we're not supposed to reveal the plot, right? It's probably Okay to note that the story is a lot closer to a Brothers Grimm tale than Tolkien's.I can reveal that you go through the story, page by page, chapter by chapter and, as you overcome increasingly difficult challenges, your sorcery skills grow. I've only covered the first 5 or 6 chapters so far and I'm looking forward to playing some more after I'm done spreading the word through this review :)GAMEPLAYSure, there's a story and sure there's adventure and exciting combat but a lot in Sorcery is about showcasing the Move controller which is why I thought this should have been a launch title.You would normally play standing up because there's a lot of wand waving, shaking and turning. You move in the world and initiate certain actions through the Nav controller and you cast spells, aim them and perform various other combat actions such as shield-bashing with the Move. It's hard to describe and it does involve learning new skills and it requires some coordination and good reflexes but you are learning things and tricks as you go and you have the opportunity to practice a lot on the weaker enemies before you fight the first really difficult boss.From time to time you do die but you simply get back to where you were before the last battle started. It sounds like too easy but combat is hard and you may end-up dying 5 minutes into the battle so if you manage to die a couple of times in a boss battle it CAN be painful.Like I said, the game is highly scripted and sometimes the dialogues that make sense the first time you engage into some specific melee don't the next time you face the exact same enemies - how many times can you be 'surprised' that a certain enemy is immune to a certain spell and then here your wise companion suggesting that maybe you should try something else?Oh, and there are several levels of difficulty. I'm surviving on the normal level but I can see how very challenging it would be to beat the game while playing in the hardest mode.OVERALL QUALITYThe graphics are so-so, not exactly impressive with most of the enemies looking like Macy's parade floats but they fight... not too well or too smart but their relative ineptitude is more than made up by their numbers. Or this seems to be the case so far.What makes the game fun is the original Move-based combat system. You get to use specific gestures to select your spell and specific moves to aim it including the equivalent of throwing curve balls. The Move-as-a-wand is also your key to opening doors, the stir when you make potions and the shield when you must deflect incoming missiles or bash back enemies that get too close. The Move interface is surprisingly good, precise and responsive.THE FUN FACTOR AND MY RATINGScripted as it is, the game has been very fun to play so far. My first 5-6 hours of playtime took me through several chapters. It's hard to tell how far from endgame I am now but I assume there must be at least a dozen hours or so left to play because there seems to be more powerful spells to learn, potions to make and tougher bosses left to defeat.I'm giving the game 5 stars in the 'fun' category but I am not going to rate it as a 5-star overall, mainly because of the poor graphics quality and the overscripted and almost dumbed-down story line but this is not why most of as are going to play this game. As bad as the graphics are, the active waving of wands is immersive enough to make Sorcery a fun little game to play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2012"}

{"product_name":"B001TOQ8J8","reviewerName":"Greg","summary":"Army of... who?","reviewText":"Well... This is a bit different, isn't it?Those who show up to this party expecting a simple sequel toArmy of Twoare going to be a little surprised.  Sure the mechanics are basically the same: over the shoulder, 1st person shoot-em-up where your level of aggression (or 'Aggro', ugh) determines how much enemy fire you'll take.  But... that's about it.  The easy flowing, fast killing, light-hearted, meat-headed nature of the 1st has been thrown out and what's left feels a lot more like an AoT 'reboot': the Nolan remake of the previous titles Schumacher treatment, if you will.Things are darker, the characters take themselves much more seriously.  War isn't light-hearted anymore and your choices have reprecussions you can feel.  Rios and Salem seem war weary and, while they have some fun out there, are much more aware of total cost of bullets and blood (the new voice actors are infinetly more talented, by-the-by).  The side characters you meet are tired, sweaty, hurt and a lot more memorable.  The settings are dirty, smokey and... mostly on fire.  Gameplay wise, your avatars are slower and heavier, the physics are much more real world and you've got much tighter control over-all.  One the one hand, it's a much more compelling and cleanly made game.  On the other hand, it feels almost exactly like everything else going.  The paralles between this and Gears of War are now undeniable and it's even more clear how much it doesn't measure up.  It's a superior game to the 1st AoT in almost everyway... but that doesn't mean it's more fun.  If you loved, loved, loved the 1st one; if the atmosphere spoke to you, if the Rios and Salem made you chuckle, well... you might just hate The 40th Day with a passion.I didn't, I liked it much better, but I think it just shifted more in line with things I like:  stronger (much, much stronger) voice acting, memorable characters, interesting level design, elements of planning and thinking and strategy -- all stuff that requires more of an overall investment (which, understandably, not everyone is looking for).  The story is still weak-sauce (even less focused than the original), so much so I'm not even going to bother recapping it because, seriously, who cares?  Not the writers, that's for sure.  \"Shanghai's exploding.  From... mercenaries or something.  Good luck!\"  Seriously, it might as well have been zombies with guns at that point, it's the same exact feel.That is what it is, but I would be a total fool to bother writing all this an NOT mention the new and improved weapon customization system.  It.  Is.  AWESOME!  A few dozen guns are available and when you buy/unlock one it becomes more like you just got a bunch of new spare-parts to mix and match with.  Open the weapons menu and suddenly you're playing 'Sim: Arms Dealer' (a game that NEEDS to exist, now that I mention it).  And it's not simply about building one 'better' gun -- everything, every accessory, every adjustment, has a place depending on what kind of enemy you're fighting and in what situation.  Tight quarters?  Shotguns are great if they're heavily armored, but noisy and slow -- maybe an SMG with a sturdy silencer instead?  Open spaces are good for assault rifles and sniper rifles, but do you want damage or stability?  Will you be laying down cover fire or closing the gap? Oh and hey, why not color them in many, many different ways just for the hell of it?  For maybe the first time ever, I'm playing a game without an 'ultimate' weapon.  Yeah, the mini-gun spews a billion bullets, but good luck hitting anything.  That grenade launcher sure is sexy, but what're you gonna do when the bad guys get up close and personal or pick at you from a distance?  With only a few exceptions, every weapon has a place and any one of them can be tricked out with stocks and silencers and scopes and shields into a serviceable, bad-guy killing, tool of death.  It's a revelation and it MUST be expanded on someday... maybe into something all it's own?  I joked about a weapons SIM but, seriously?  Would you NOT play that freaking game?Oh, and there are morality choices now.  Sure, why not.Enough of that, I'm off to await The SIMs: Locked and Loaded with held breath...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0053BQREE","description":"","reviewerName":"Marvin Powell","summary":"One step forward, Two steps back, as always","reviewText":"I've been a long time WWE fan, as well as a lifelong Gaming fan, and I have limitless creativity and imagination. So naturally, a WWE video game would be my ideal gaming choice. However, the thing that sucks in our reality is that THQ, a subpar gaming developer that literally only cares about money and nothing else like gaming quality or anything like that, is the exclusive developer of the modern day WWE video game series. What this means is, if you want to play a modern WWE video game, you HAVE to play a THQ wrestling video game or literally nothing else. There have been three legendary WWE video games that have existed so far. The best being WWF No Mercy (2000-2001), WWE SmackDown!: Here Comes The Pain (2003) and WWE SmackDown vs RAW 2006 (2005). All of these oddly enough, were made by THQ, but since then, us gamers and WWE fans have been given garbage, with only SmackDown vs RAW 2010 showing a small glimmer of hope (mostly just due to the debut of Story Designer, which lets you create your own WWE cutscenes and storylines).The biggest problem with the SmackDown vs RAW series, now known as the 'WWE' series (which is a incredibly stupid name for their games to begin with) is that they usually self-sabotage their own games and purposely give us less each year to either add in new, terrible features no one asked for or wanted, or to simply charge the customer for all the stuff they left out via Downloadable Content (which like, half of all gamers don't even have access to). Yes, THQ is this greedy and shady of a company and \"WWE '12\" (again, really stupid name) is no different.Here, you'll be given some of the stuff previously seen in the SmackDown vs RAW series, like some match types, game features, and the usually-good Create a Superstar/Diva mode. But as always, it's the addition of one good new thing, and several others taken out completely. This year, that one new good thing is Create an Arena. It really just allows you to create a ring, rather than an entire sports arena's interior, including the set and rampway and Titantron, etc., but it comes one step closer to allowing you to create your own brand. (Now if they'd only bring back the Create A Belt option... then you could actually create your own wrestling federation from scratch.) Also, the Create an Entrance Video has been greatly improved, this time actually having pre-set animations and video footage in it, so you can make a far more accurate Entrance Video rather than just importing your Highlight Reel footage into a wrestler's entrance. While it's good, it is mostly limited to preset animations and cutscenes, most of which kind of imitate other more gimmicky wrestlers' entrance videos (like Kane, Undertaker, the Hurricane, etc.) And now that we've gotten all the positives out of the way...Let's start with controls. They have been changed. Yet, not reverted back to the SmackDown vs RAW 2006 and prior controls. But rather, a simplified version of the 'Grapple with the control stick' mechanics. You use the A button now, but it's still mostly the same thing. Of course, they change this now after it took gamers four years to get used to the control stick style, which they initially introduced back in SvR2007. Why did they change it? Simple. To appeal to little kids who they thought might've found the old style too complex or hard to learn. Of course, it's both insulting to us who have just now gotten used to the old way, as well as little kids who are too 'dumb' to learn how to pick up the control scheme. Of course, they also would want to appeal to the casual gamer, but not too many casual gamers would really play this series, because it's never been good enough to have that kind of appeal. WWE fans are WWE fans, so trying to make a game for the non-WWE fans, while alienating all of them is just stupid. But that's THQ and Cory Ledesma, for you.I will say, for the first time in years, it looks like they at least tried to make an effort with this game. But it's still simply bad for all the same reasons as before. They only like to make these games *their* way and their way alone, never bothering to appeal to fans and customers. They're control freaks, that way. Things like not letting females wrestle against males (a rule that does not even exist in the real WWE) as well as not giving you any real control over anything in WWE Universe Mode and having you try to play around randomly-set-up AI matches are things I mean when I say THQ only wants you to play by their style, as opposed to however you like. This extends to the \"meat and potatoes\" of the game, the Story Mode, known as \"Road to Wrestlemania.\" Since its debut in the 2009 game, it's always been a few select main eventers getting their own 12-week story that leads up to Wrestlemania. In these, you have to simply play as the Superstar, whether you like them or not, in order to unlock many things in the game. In this game, it continues to an extent and you get Sheamus and Triple H now that you must play as. No epic \"Here Comes The Pain\" year-long story with multiple paths and characters, and no \"No Mercy\" style storyline with a pyramid of alternate paths leading up to Wrestlemania or any other Pay Per View.Other features in the game, like I said, are the Create modes, and they truly are the only real fun that come out of these titles. Except for a limited number of Caucasian Male hairstyles and female clothing, you can make just about any human being to some extent. You then can customize their own moves, finishers, and entrances. For the creative, like me, making your own characters and unleashing them in Story Designer, or Universe Mode if you can set it up and have patience, is the where the true joy comes from and the only real positives about these games. Had they been taken out, there would be truly no reason to ever play these games from SmackDown vs RAW 2007 up to WWE '12.The gameplay is... bleh. You're either simply love it cause it's something new for a change, or you'll hate it because it's simply broken. The AI is improved now, but as before, the countering responses are still broken. Because you may be using a \"less experienced\" Superstar or whatever, the game won't let you counter or reverse moves that you KNOW you countered or reversed. The new match system tries to allow for limb-targeted damage, which has always existed in the games, but here, they make it so specific and put such emphasis on it, it's ridiculous. Even real life doesn't work this way. I know jiu-jitsu and can tell you you don't have to repeatedly beat down a body part in order to get someone to tap out. Nor does Alberto Del Rio need to strike the arm for twenty minutes to get someone to tap out to a Cross Armbar. Yes, this may make for good ring psychology on TV, but these are far from real WWE matches. This is a video game, and trying to imitate reality not only doesn't make for a fun experience, but THQ isn't a competent enough company to even pull it off, if they could.So, let's see... the create modes are still around, but the game suffers from a new learning curve of the new control scheme, while continuing to take out essential moves and strikes from the moveset pool, resulting in gameplay that is both repetitive, but also frustrating. This game might be fun for a week or less, especially if you're young, but keep in mind, this game costs sixty to seventy dollars new and is supposed to keep you entertained for at least a year. Story Mode is weak, but at least they tried to add in one where you can use a Created Superstar and have him get involved in the matches. As for other features, the same THQ limitations apply: No female-on-male and vice versa violence, no playing Universe Mode however you like (though you can now change the show brands and PPV dates), no real options or freedom for Road to Wrestlemania, and not even an option to change back the control scheme to the SmackDown vs RAW 2007-2011 format. Add in a roster that is missing half of the current WWE Superstars, as well as containing the lamest Legends ever in it, and throw in the fact that THQ does this crap purposely in order to charge us more for it via Downloadable Content (which like I said, screws over half of its customers, regardless), and then have the gull to charge sixty dollars for this? No. Just no.Had this been a new release, it'd be a 3 out of 5. Maybe if this was just how it was released, it could be forgiven and be a 3 out of 5. But considering that THQ does all this stuff *intentionally* and has the nerve to charge ten to fifteen dollars more than most games out there... that drops it down by two stars in my view. Not to mention, there are GLITCHES in the game! Yes. The only company you'll ever have that would release a sixty dollar game that is half-complete, but filled with glitches, is THQ.So, if you're a hardcore WWE fan, or under 13, you'll buy this no matter what, as long as you have a console to play it on. But if you've been disappointed with any of the WWE games from the past five years, then don't expect anything better here just because they changed the name and that's it. \"WWE '12\" is still garbage, but at least, THQ wants to give you the impression that they \"tried\" this time around. Of course, they left out a bunch of Superstars/Divas/Legends, and took out so much more stuff, and limited the gameplay and Road to Wrestlemania. But hey. As long as they say they \"tried\" and wanted us to have a \"Bigger, Badder, Better\" experience (which is not true), then it's okay to gyp the customers and blind them with bogus ads and hype, right?I feel like I'm in a courtroom, trying to give you my closing arguments, here. Bottom line, don't even THINK about paying for this game without giving a good hour or more to play, first. Either in a store or as a rental. Because there are so much better -and cheaper- games out there. This coming from a huge WWE and Video Gaming fan. I've played every major WWE game since No Mercy, and I've bought every Smack own vs RAW game up until 2008. Then I started just renting them. I rented this and wouldn't pay full price for it even if I was rich. There's nothing worse than supporting poor quality merchandise like these poor WWE games. Sadly, until WWE gives other developers the rights to make their games (which doesn't seem like it'll be anytime soon, since the games are now sponsoring actual WWE events now), we'll be stuck with this garbage THQ likes to put a shiny ribbon on. All we can do as customers is tell them are disapproval and not give them our hard-earned money.Like I said, don't spend a dime on this without playing it first. if you must have a WWE game for 2012, wait until the price drops under 35 dollars. And if you're on the fence about this game, just continue to play SvR 2010.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0014ULQB2","reviewerName":"J.S. Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"A Total Surprise","reviewText":"With the sub-par, one-trick ponies that is most of the games of the past two years, I was rather surprised when my rental of Red Faction Guerrilla turned into a purchase.This game is very similar in concept to Just Cause: 2.  You basically run around causing chaos, blowing sh** up, then fighting for your life as you head towards safety.But somehow this low-budget game seems to have done it so much better.  The destructable environments are by far the greatest piece of this game.  Bringing down a two-story building with nothing more than a sledgehammer is unbelievably satisfying.  Even more, as the building reaches it's critical state, the controller starts to rumble slightly in your hands - you can feel the tremor in the ground as the building prepares to fall.  Furthermore, the physics of the game allow for some tremendously entertaining/hilarious/jaw-dropping scenes where exploding vehicles ricochet off of cliff faces, or debris from a falling building spills down a mountainside.  I find myself smiling with child-like abandon at the never-ending wave of destruction.And that's really where Red Faction: Guerrilla shines.  It's just unending destruction, chaos, and mile-a-minute excitement.  Wrap that up in a game that can easily last 30+ hours, and you've got a recipe for good, simple, long-lasting fun.  Sure I'll probably never finish it - I'm sure I'll get tired of it long before I finish the story, but who cares?!  It cost $20 bucks.  If I get 10 hours of entertainment out of it (I've gotten much more than that already) then I've already had better ROI than many of the \"blockbuster games\" of the past two years.For the current price, this game is WELL worth it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0014ULQB2","reviewerName":"N. P. Stathoulopoulos \"nick9155\"","summary":"Whack Mars!","reviewText":"Red Faction: Guerilla is a very, very welcome game.For fans of the first two games (from the PS2 / original XBox platform), this is a no-brainer.  Rest assured, THQ has resurrected the franchise in a major way.  Mars, Geo-mod, miners, soldiers, shooting, insanity.Once again, you're on Mars.  It's sometime after the events of the first two games...200 years or so after the original.  This time you're Mason (is this like the most common video game name?) and you've come to Mars to work as a miner.  But Mars is anything but stable.  I don't recall the entire plot here, folks, but basically after the (evil) Ultor corporation was defeated by the Earth Defense Force (EDF) and the Red Faction rebels, the EDF became the new oppressors.  The Red Faction is back, as a scrappy rebel alliance of miners and citizens of Mars.  Once your brother is whacked by the EDF, you have no choice but to join the Red Faction and basically begin the violence and insanity that hallmarked previous installments.Thank you, THQ!  Like any good game, this combines elements of other good games, and adds its own angles.  Think of it a bit like the older Red Factions (obviously), Grand Theft Auto on Mars, Halo, and maybe the Godfather.  Mars is huge...there are about five separate sectors you need to re-claim for the people.  You get to drive around in various vehicles, GTA-style, and you can carjack the Martians/colonists (they basically acknowledge it's for the cause).  You have to reduce the EDF influence in the area while maintaining Martian morale, which is once again reduced by blowing away citizens.Plenty of weapons, and a lot of destruction.  A lot.  Geo-mode is no longer a few items...no no no.  Entire buildings can be taken down, and there are plenty of side missions where this is the entire point.And perhaps the best bit of all...the game is a challenge.  You will not finish this in five hours.  It goes on plenty long as you battle to take back Mars one sector at a time.  The game is flexible, too, with its free roam and side missions.  You can go and cause chaos, or go to the main mission, or a side mission, or just try looking for scrap metal, which acts as a currency so you can buy more toys.  The sledgehammer and the destructible buildings might sound a bit boring, but it's not.  In fact, you will enjoy trying to bring down an entire building with only your mighty hammer, and you will spend much time just destroying stuff.  Plenty of detail, a bit of humor (similar to previous installments), and the action is great.  Will not take fans of the previous games too long to get used to the 3rd person player control, the driving, shooting, or hammering.The game is great, highly recommended whether you know the old games or not.  Very impressive, let's hope THQ has another one in the works, hopefully with more than just a passing mention of the legendary Parker.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2009"}

People have complained about the graphics, but they're not so bad they're really worth judging the game by. Besides, as long as the game's fun, graphics don't matter all that much.Shooting's fun, the levels are interesting to navigate, and it's fun going around, messing around, and playing the mini-games.

The storyline is linear and it's not hard to figure out where to go next.Pros: Graphics, storyline, gameplay, voice-actors from the movie.Cons: Storyline is too short, tricky camera angles at times.The major thing I didn't like it this game was geared towards online play. Half of the upgrades you can get don't apply unless your online. I don't play online games. Unless you play through 6+ times there isn't enough XP to get a good amount of upgrades which sticks a player with two or three upgrades he/she focuses on at the most.

The graphics are stunning, gameplay is amazing. Well worthy of the series!I'm a huge fan of the Bond games, and we have all of the previous ones. We got this one as soon as it came out, and were definitely not disappointed!The graphics are a huge step up from previous versions. In the first 'training' mission, you're driving a car through city streets. The lights reflect off of the curves of the car, you can see inside to all of his controls and movements, the dents show up realistically, the back up lights glow softly, and if you bash it a bit, the trunk comes loose. The city around you has cobblestone streets, water rippling, streetlights that come down when you hit them. The attention to detail is just amazing!As you then move on through the various levels, you see this same level of detail everywhere. From the Austrian castle and other alpine scenes, to the city scenes, watery scenes and more, each really shines.The plot is very engaging and typically Bond. But in an attempt to show that this isn't about violence - he's a SPY after all, not a Rambo - you get bonus points for being stealthy instead of blasting in with guns, and for stunning or capturing enemies instead of killing them.In fact, just about every area can be 'accomplished' in many ways. Bluster your way into an objective by a full frontal assault ... or sneak in the side way for extra points. Since you're also rewarded for your time and health, often the sneaky, non-violent way is the best.You've got a huge array of equipment, weapons, armor and vehicles, and all work just the way you'd expect them to. I found the default controller configuration REALLY annoying, but a quicks stop in the config area got it back to the way I'm used to playing.Plus, there's multiplayer! Play with up to four people at once on REALLY great maps with quite a bit of customization options on each one. Grab some bots for practice, and play arena, team arena, king of the hill, capture the flag, or other game types.Definitely worthy of the Bond series, and highly, highly recommended to any first person shooter fan!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2002"}

Kennedy","summary":"Single Player Mode Same, But Multiplayer Mose Makes Up For It","reviewText":"Single Player ModeWhile I agree that the gameplay hasn't changed much, the ability to dual wield a weapon and plasmid has made single player mode a lot better than the first. Obviously if you still haven't beaten the first one, and you aren't intereted in multiplayer, save yourself $40 and buy the original.Multi-player ModeLike most people, I was a bit skeptical of this new addition. In this mode you play as one of 8-10 stock characters (depending on if you got the pre-order bonus at gamestop). There are also many different games to choose from: capture the little sister (capture the flag), Adam Harvest - team mode or free-for-all(hold the little sister for 3 minutes), Civil War (get 50 kills as a team), Last Man Standing (can't remember its actual name, but it is what it sounds like), and a few others. Your character doesn't mean much, it just changes your catch phrases (which do get a bit annoying after a few hours of gameplay).Like the single player mode, there is a story behind these modes. Atlas and Ryan (from the first game) have provided you with the tools for \"home protection.\" You must choose sides in the war that led to Bioshock 1.The leveling up system keeps the game pretty even, at each new level you get new plasmids, weapons, or bonuses. So you always are getting something new to try out. You gain experience from kills, assists, time holding the little sister, Adam vials you pick up (randomly placed on the map), taking a picture of your enemies (also gives you an attack boost on them until they kill you), and everytime you hack a machine.The gameplay itself is a lot of fun, because the levels are made the perfect size for the number of players. If you get into a battle it is a true war, because you are usually in a confined room. However,you can leave tight spaces in order to heal and grab EVE before getting back into the fray of things.Weapons include: pistol, machine gun, bazooka, grenades, shotgun, and more as you level up. Plasmids include: Incinerate, Electric Shock, Aero Dash, Freeze, Gysers, and a few more that are new as well as some from the first game. Bonuses include: faster health regeneration, evade enemy turrets easily,use less EVE, take faster pictures.Overall the single player is just an expansion of the first game, but the multi-player mode more than makes up for it. However, this is definitely one of those games that people will stop playing multiplayer once they get the achievements, so enjoy it now while everyone is online!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00030GS80","description":"There's always been a certain magic to Zelda games. The classic formula should have gotten old by now, but it hasn't. Perhaps it's because we all identify on some level with this shy, unlikely hero. Maybe the games remind us of our own childhood. Or perhaps these titles are consistently of such high quality that we can't help but love them. Regardless, The Minish Cap succeeds in all these ways &#x96; simultaneously embracing its links to the past while offering numerous innovations that keep gameplay fresh, exciting, and a true joy to&#xA0;play.The greatest of these novel concepts is the ability to transform from normal size down to the diminutive form of the Minish, a race of tiny people living right under the noses of the humans. This opens up entirely new realms of gameplay, as puzzles and even combat must be accomplished in different ways. When miniaturized, the smallest puddle becomes a deep lake, and the most mundane creatures become monstrous foes.There's a new item called the Gust Jar that allows you to suck up obstacles and enemies before blowing them back out in a burst of air. It's one of the cooler new power-up items I've encountered in any of the Zelda games, and adds yet another level of complexity to how you play. Another new ability allows Link to double himself, creating a ghostly after-image that mirrors his moves for a brief time. As you might imagine, this results in some clever and unique brainteasers that are a nod to the recent Four Swords games. In all these ways, the game challenges you to think in multiple dimensions and carefully remember details on your journey. A large cast of characters fleshes out the land of Hyrule, and monsters both large and small await your blade. To further connect you to the world's people, you will now collect items called Kinstones &#x96; broken halves of coin-like objects that can be fused with the Kinstones that other characters in the world have collected. By doing so, you'll open up portals, treasure chests, and secret doors all over the map. It's an addictive side quest that serves as a worthy compliment to the main adventure.One of my few complaints is that while the puzzles in the game are uniformly challenging, some of the combat is easier than I might have liked, especially against the bosses, who were often one-trick ponies requiring minimal skill. Even so, the fights are satisfying in their simplicity, and you have access to all the familiar weapons and techniques, including the boomerang, spin attack, and bow. The old and new features combine to make a game that feels both true to the Zelda heritage while offering an entirely unique experience.But more than any of this, the game charms you with its stalwart hero. This silent little boy with ruffled, messy hair is faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. Through him, the game establishes a hero whose pure heart and will are carrying him forward. All the elements of The Minish Cap (even its presence on the GBA) contribute to the idea of a tiny force for good that strives to triumph against a huge evil. It's a classic adventure that more than lives up to the legacy of a classic series.Concept:The time-honored Zelda tale retold in yet another new formGraphics:Mixing the familiar images of previous Zelda games with humorous and detailed new character designs results in an impressive success for the GBASound:Some of the most memorable and recognizable tunes in gaming sound great even on those little GBA speakersPlayability:Responsive and flexible with a nearly perfect learning curve that moves from simple to challengingEntertainment:Like many of its predecessors &#x96; a true classicReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerIssue:February 20052nd Opinion:There's a bird sitting on my head, I'm no larger than a toenail clipping, and I've been stuck on the same puzzle for the last three hours. Long story short, I'm having the time of my life. For any of you who played the remarkable Super Nintendo title A Link to the Past, The Minish Cap will bring a tear to your eye. This is classic Zelda gameplay in all its glory. The journey is a tad easy for my liking (boss fights are a breeze), but I can't get enough of the creative puzzles and new gadgets. Shrinking in height to a two-pixel speck is not only hilarious, it's one of the most compelling concepts that the series has offered up in a long time. Minigames are also in great abundance, and you can collect over 130 different figurines that shed some light on the characters in the world (which also happens to be one of my favorite aspects of Wind Waker). From its stunning visuals to its gameplay finesse, The Minish Cap is another harrowing Hyrule adventure that you'll remember for a lifetime.Rated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer","reviewerName":"Antonio D. Paolucci \"Collector of Entertainment\"","summary":"The New Zelda on Gameboy","reviewText":"Ever since Link had the face-lift on the Gamecube, my interest for the ageless boy wained a bit. The cartoon look and water-color settings just took a lot away from the old Zelda experience. But in this version, it gets back to its roots yet keeps the water-color look. It's the classic 2D style, moving from screen to screen in search of treasure and bosses, with a few story elements mingled here and there to keep your interest.In this version, Link is the apprentice to a blacksmith and is charged to bring a sword to the Picori Festival. During your mission, Zelda asks Link to escort her around the festival grounds. The day starts out great, and the festivities continue until an enemy emerges, the champion of the festival's sword-fighting competition. After a few brief events, the champion, Vaati, makes his escape, but in his wake he leaves a petrified Zelda behind, and Link must figure out how to un-petrify Hyrule's beloved princess. So starts Link's journey, and soon into it he meets a strange, hat-like creature named Ezlo, who becomes Link's essential companion as he gives Link the ability to shrink and visit the many Minish (tiny, fairy-like creatures) settlements all over the place. These creatures are out to help Link in his quest to regain a legendary sword.The game play is as simple and fun as it was for any of the other 2D Zelda games. You're constantly traveling to unlock new areas to explore, gain new items, and learn new sword techniques. But, after a while, this does get kind of old. And without a strategy kind, it's next to impossible to find absolutely every item in the game. It does add one thing that makes the game a little addictive and hard to put down, and that is the Kinstones, tiny shards of rock that, when joined with the second piece, unlocks secrets. Just searching for these little rocks is addictive enough, but when you find the match (you must check all the different people and sometimes objects across Hyrule) it's great to get the reward. It adds a little depth to a relatively simple game.Overall, this is a solid addition to the Zelda franchise, and is definitely one of the better Gameboy Advance games to come out last year. If you're a fan of Zelda and Link, then pick this up, or if you're looking for something to pass the time say on long field trips or on laundry day, then I'd also recommend this to you. It's easy to pick up and put down without ever feeling too lost.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2006"}

I have reduced the rating on the system due to this issue.Wii U, first impressions:So, my wife got me a Wii U yesterday, along with Zombi U.  I have been playing this for a few hours now and have come to some conclusions about the system, the controller, and the game.The system: The Wii U seems to be a fairly powerful system with graphics that are about on par with the Xbox 360 and PS3.  This is fine at the moment, but I can't help feeling that Nintendo made a mistake by not making it more powerful, as the Xbox 720 and the PS4 will be coming out next year and will be MASSIVELY powerful graphically and processor-wise.  Sometimes I have found that things load fairly slowly and I have had the system completely freeze once.  The networking on this system is TERRIBLE.  I was completely unable to connect to my wireless network or hard-wired connection until I searched the internet and found where someone told how to get around the problems.  This is unacceptable and Nintendo needs to fix it immediately.  You cannot expect a system to compete with the Xbox or PS3 if it won't even connect to the internet without problems.The controller: The Wii U controller is a revolution.  Period.  I've said it.  The potential for this controller is completely and utterly out of this world.  Zombi U is the only game I have at the moment, but I can already see the potential of this combination.  Nintendo simply expanded upon what they have been doing for years in the handheld world with the Nintendo DS and 3DS by making a console controller so your console works like a DS/3DS.  Clever.  It is not uncomfortable or clumsy like I expected and feels nice in your hands.  The display is nice and looks sharp.  The battery life is not great, but you can charge and play with the included adapter.ZombiU: The game is amazing, but rather difficult.  This is a perfect example of real survival horror.  This is anything but an action game and you WILL die repeatedly and horribly if you decide to try to play it like a shooter/action title.  The zombies are dumb, slow, and relentless... and they horde.  Your supplies are limited and you lose them if you die... in fact, you do not respawn if you die.  Your old character will become a zombie when you die and your new character will have to fight your zombie character to get your equipment and supplies back.  If you get killed along the way, so sorry; your equipment and everything is gone.  Done.  End of story.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00000I1BR","description":"Let me go on record and say that I was never a fan of the original Crash Bandicoot. Even though Crash was disarmingly cute and fuzzy, and even though the game's graphics were just about as good as they got in those days, the frustrating design of the game made playing it such a painful experience that I still have flashbacks when I see small marsupials on the Discovery Channel. But just one short year after his debut, Crash is back in a sequel that is so far superior to the original that I'm willing to forget the mistakes of the past.The new storyline is simple: A very gullible Crash is corralled into collecting crystals for the evil Dr. Cortex and gems for the terrible N. Brio. There are 25 levels in all; each level contains an easy-to-find crystal and hard-to-earn gems. Instead of being forced to approach the game in a strictly linear fashion, you progress through a series of five warp rooms. Each warp room contains five levels, which you are free to tackle in any order. After you have found the crystals in each level, you can progress to the next warp room. This system of warp rooms is a great innovation; it's clear how to progress in the game, and yet you have the option of moving to a different level if you're hopelessly frustrated with one area. Best of all, you can save your game in the warp room at any time (a big improvement over the original game's horrific save system).A lot of variety is packed inside this game. You'll navigate through simple run-and-jump areas, try to outrun a very mad polar bear, work your way through sewer systems, and even fly around with a jet pack. Within each level, the basic gameplay is similar to the original Crash: Running, jumping, and spinning are still the order of the day. Even though most levels are set in a semi-3D environment, Crash Bandicoot 2 is a platform game, plain and simple. The graphics are in a league of their own among PlayStation games, and the music couldn't be better. Unlike the original, Crash 2 is rarely frustrating enough to make you want to throw your controller at the TV. In fact, some expert gamers might find Crash to be a little on the easy side.There are only two real problems with Crash Bandicoot 2. First, the semi-3D setup is sometimes hard to navigate, and you'll find yourself missing jumps because you're unable to judge distances properly. Secondly, the game is just plain cheap at times; in some areas you must sacrifice many lives until you memorize a level's layout.In any event, these problems are balanced out by the game's excellent gameplay and intelligent design. Crash Bandicoot 2 is a topnotch platform game. If you're a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to check this title out. -- John Broady--Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

One of my favorite games as a little kid. It's much better than the original.GAMEPLAY: 27 levels, [2 hidden] 25 crystals, 42 gems, and a bunch of secrets!

You will get the blue gem. Plus, you can save any time, unlike the original. And you don't have to not die to break all of the boxes.GRAPHICS: Very good for a 1997 game.

At least they were if you liked 2-D platform games, andYoshi&#x92;s Islandis indisputably one of the best ever made.Yoshi&#x92;s Islandgoes back in time to recount the touching story of the various Yoshis' attempts to unite Baby Mario with his parents. You don&#x92;t actually control the Italian plumber-to-be but instead his dinosaur pal, who has the curious ability to eat his enemies and then immediately turn them into eggs, which he can then fling at more enemies.Since Yoshi isn&#x92;t particularly fast and can float in midair for a few seconds after making a jump, the whole dynamics of the normal Mario gameplay have changed, but the same incredible attention to detail and endless imagination that mark all of Nintendo&#x92;s best efforts are still here in full effect. In fact they&#x92;re joined this time, after the rather plain-looking prequel, by some wonderful pastel-shaded graphics that were jaw-dropping when the game was originally released in 1995 and still manage to impress now.As with the otherSuper Mario Advancetitles, this game also contains a four-player version of the originalMario Bros.arcade game, making it even more of a bargain than it already was.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"Good but not great","reviewText":"A late arrival in the SNES' life span and public perception that the game &quot;was for kids&quot; meant that many missed the Yoshi's Islandboat when the game first arrived. Here's your chance to make  up for sins of the past. While this sequel to SMW model it's Mushroom Kingdom predecessor (not that it's a bad thing) in many ways, impeccable platform-jumpimg controls, ingenious level designs, and a plethora of stimulating secrets, there are two key differences that set it apart from the plumber's fare: Yoshi can consume enemies to make throwable eggs (which trail behind him), and whenever Yoshi is hit, Baby Mario is knocked off his back, a countdown  begins and you have to scramble to get him back. The graphics are among the best ever to grace a GBA screen, a vibrant canvas declared in brilliant crayon and eye-popping pastels, Yoshi's Island is a veriable work of art. The music is magical, too especially the intstantly in the fectious &quot;underground theme&quot; and the sound effects are classic stuff. One minor problem, however: the egg targeting system seems unneccessarily weird. As the GBA grows up, SNES ports are becoming a less and less welcome sight on store shelves.

{"product_name":"B001NX6GBK","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"A Solid Hack n' Slash With a Few Problems","reviewText":"Visceral Games propelled themselves seemingly out of nowhere to become a top-tier developer after 2008's Dead Space. I liked Dead Space so much that I've played through the game 4 times! So when I heard Visceral was working on a video game interpretation of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy I followed the development of the game closely. Having recently completed the game I have some mixed feelings on Visceral's Dante's Inferno.The storyline somewhat follows the Divine Comedy though notable deviations are made. In Dante's Inferno, Dante returns from the Holy Land during the period of the 3rd Crusade to discover his father and wife, Beatrice murdered. Shortly thereafter Dante is himself stabbed in the back and confronts Death. This encounter amounts to the games first boss battle. Dante eventually triumphs Death and takes the symbolic Scythe as his own. This is Dante's only physical weapon for the remainder of the game. What proceeds is Dante's quest to redeem his wife Beatrice (and himself) that pays for Dante's sins in the afterlife by being condemned to an eternity in Hell.As Dante progresses in the game he will first encounter Virgil, his guide through the 9 Circles of Hell at the Gates of Hell. Immediately the first thing I noticed is the amount of detail poured into the environments. Burning rivers of blood, bodies piled high into walls, souls plummeting through the red-ashen burning skies - it's all a visual treat. The artists at Visceral definitely deserve praise for their work depicting the horrific scenes of Hell, perhaps better than any game (or movie) before. As Dante progresses deeper and deeper each of the 9 Circles features detailed and grotesque scenes that truly portray Hell as well, a hellish place.Gameplay is best described as a cross between God of War and Devil May Cry. I know there are fans of each that rabidly decry Dante's Inferno as a rip-off of those two games, but I like to think that plagiarism is one of the best forms of flattery. The combo system is very similar to God of War right down to the quick-time button pressing finishing moves for enemies and bosses. The currency of Dante's Inferno is souls which can be used to purchase new combos. A twist to this system is that the player can choose to be either benevolent or malicious. Throughout the game players will encounter named NPC's that can be punished or absolved. Punishing an NPC will result in Dante earning Unholy points. Absolving NPC's will grant Holy points. Players will then use the souls to upgrade skills via an in-game skill tree. Access to higher level skills is only possible by choosing a specific path.All told I'm a fan of the gameplay but caveat that by saying that a lot of the same issues present in games like God of War and Devil May Cry translate to Dante's Inferno. The camera for example is completely fixed and at times isn't in and ideal position for platforming or for combat. At various times I found myself frantically mashing the attack buttons to attack off-screen enemies.Also, although Dante's Inferno isn't a particularly short or a particularly long game - about 10-12hrs for a first time run through the game there are times where the game does bog down. A lot of the same types of enemies are recycled again and again. Like the aforementioned games, Dante's features areas that seal the player in a small area and require the player to defeat all the enemies before moving on. Dante's Inferno absolutely spams this gameplay mechanic to the point of being somewhat aggravating and monotonous. I guess the correct phrase is that the game starts to lose some of its steam along the way. Some of the levels (Circles of Hell) are excellent whilst others are just recycled. There are some other frustrating design choices in parts of the game that require specific feats for the player to accomplish that really spike the difficulty. For example in one area the player is tasked with completing specific trials. Each trial restricts the player in some way. For example one trial tasks the player with defeating all enemies in an area without using magical abilities and so forth. An extremely frustrating trial tasks the player with defeating all the enemies (lots of them) while maintaining one continuous combo. It's a spike in the difficulty that feels out of place in the game and tacked on to add hours to the completion time.Other minor annoyances I had with the game include the completely predictable ending. The character that Visceral built into Dante is also somewhat unlikeable and probably the most poorly voiced out of the cast. Also at times I felt that the script/voice acting bordered on corny and cheesy. All of these issues are relatively minor but still worth mentioning.Is Dante's Inferno worth playing? Absolutely. Is it on par with a game like God of War? In my opinion, no. However, this is a good first outing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M4","description":"It's often argued that Nintendo makes the best video games in the world,  but one thing the company isn't known for is scary games. If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster. While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C. Persia. And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"drqshadow","summary":"Unrealized Potential, Undeserved Recognition","reviewText":"Originally penciled in as a late addition to the N64's library, Eternal Darkness was eventually shifted over to the freshly born GC, where it was meant to be the first of many mature-themed first party titles brought to the system. Looking back over the years that have come and gone since, that string of adult-leaning N-published games never really came to be, and the Cube faltered in a similar fashion to its immediate predecessor. But this is now, and for Darkness, that was then. The birth of a new console meant an opportunity for a clean slate and instant anticipation.The storyline revolves around a blonde-haired, blue eyed, athletic woman named Alexandra Roivas. Constantly haunted by dreams of the undead, she's awakened late one night by a telephone call that informs her of her grandfather's brutal, untimely demise. As the man's only living relative, she's asked to meet with police about the situation, and quickly finds herself drawn into the web of magick, satanism and otherworldly struggles that had defined her late relative's life. The entire story effectively transpires on the grounds of the old man's mansion, which isn't nearly as dull and repetitive as you'd think, thanks to the inclusion of a single intuitive plot device. Hidden among her deceased patriarch's things, Alexandra discovers the necronomicon, a book bound in human flesh that holds the secrets of her family's legacy and the majority of the game's variety. Most of the book's pages have been torn out and scattered throughout the mansion, naturally, but upon discovering a new chapter, Alexandra will dive right in - somewhat literally. Each new set of pages tells the story of a different character and his or her interactions with the book itself, and as Alexandra reads, you'll take control of that character, playing your way through their tale. As such, Eternal Darkness feels more like a series of intertwined short stories than a single, game-spanning epic... a welcome change of pace . What's more, it allows players to travel unbound throughout time and space, adventuring through a roman war expedition one chapter, conquering an Indiana Jones style aztec temple the next, without the need for a silly, out-of-place object like a time machine (or worse).Truly, there are a lot of really good ideas at play here. I loved the idea of playing the role of an 18th century noble with medical aspirations, performing rudimentary autopsies on the bodies of demons after a battle. The suggestion of a steep tower of corpses, a sacrifice to an ancient, forgotten god, is an amazing mental image. Even the continued use of the book itself as a means to explain Alexandra's growth as a character and a magician was extremely well-concepted. Upon reading in explicit detail about a distant relative's discovery of a magical spell, it's only natural to assume she'd have a fairly good understanding of how to go about casting it herself. Imagination most definitely isn't the weak spot in Sanity's Requiem; it's the execution and realization of those ideas that bothers me.Take the system of magic, for example, what should've been one of the most important aspects of the game. The idea is that there are three distinct pools of magical energy, a red pool, a green pool, and a blue pool, that simultaneously have power over one color while falling victim to the other. Green is stronger than red, for instance, while blue overcome green, and red conquers blue. It's a brilliantly simple idea, but one that falls flat due to being underexplained and overly detailed. You'll know that the boss you're fighting is using a green special attack, and that you should be counterattacking with a blue assault, but exactly which spell you should be using is only revealed through an abysmal series of trial-and-error kamikaze strikes. Even then, half the time you aren't casting at the right time, or you're not standing in the right place, or the boss has shifted to another form. If I had a dime for every time I had to resort to an online FAQ after reaching the point of frustration during this game, I'd be able to buy a replacement copy and hurl the original into the wall, frisbee style, as stress relief.It's this maddening sense of frustration and helplessness that really strikes the most damning blow to my overall opinion of the game. After a half-dozen hours or so of gameplay, you'll be so utterly defeated and annoyed that your motivation to continue will begin to pay a heavy toll. As Alexandra learns more and more about what's going on with her heritage and what was really behind her grandfather's murder, you'll find yourself actually comprehending less and less. It's a problem I had with what was formerly one of my favorite comic books, Hellblazer, a year or two ago: because the story is supernatural and underworldly in setting, the writer(s) assume that the solutions to problems don't necessarily need to make sense, so long as they sound spooky and look cool.Much of the gameplay is in keeping with that same ongoing trend: stupendous ideas, lame execution. Probably the most unique element of the game is its \"fright meter,\" which slowly drains as the on-screen individual sees freakier and freakier things. I know I'd be a little weirded out if a rotting hunk of meat and bones suddenly climbed out of the wall and started lurching toward me... we're conditioned to expect our heroes to immediately continue their quest without missing a beat, so it adds a new dimension to the proceedings when you realize that video game characters can get scared, too. If your fright meter gets too low, you'll even start to experience some hallucinations and so-called \"horror effects,\" which are a real blast and range from the minute to the absurdly out of place. Sometimes you'll see something moving in the corner of the room, other times you'll actually foresee your own death, but the hallucinations will always subside at some point. They don't move the plot along, like the amusing asides in the original Metal Gear Solid did, and only seem to exist to provide a few extra \"holy crap\" heart-skipping moments. Which is par for the course with a horror game, I'll concede.Gameplay in general is fairly slow-paced and monotonous, with few action-heavy sequences and a whole lot of aimless wandering and exploring. Even the boss battles are usually relegated to long sessions of striking, wandering around avoiding attacks for a few minutes, and then striking again... like a hilariously slow chase scene. For a game that's so overflowing with narrow corridors, doorways and exquisite surroundings, you'd think that collision detection with the walls wouldn't be such a handicap, but in Darkness it quickly becomes your worst enemy. If your weapon should happen to strike a wall in mid swing, your character will immediately halt their attack and stumble backwards for a few moments, giving your enemies all the time they need to tear you to pieces. Attempting to fight a single enemy in a hallway is often like threading a needle: you'll miss half a dozen times before you get it right.In the same vein as the Resident Evil series, the teenaged bonding moments that are used to fill out a blockbuster horror film are replaced here with a series of riddles, puzzles and tricks. I expected as much, but couldn't have anticipated how easy and linear most of Darkness's riddles really are. With only a few exceptions, every item is miraculously found just before it's needed, to the point that the pieces basically solve the game's problems for you. If you find a statue, chances are good you'll find a peculiar, statue-shaped hole in the next room.Eternal Darkness' visuals have aged even worse than the rest of the title, and I'm not entirely sure they were ever really up to snuff. Sure, there's always the argument that these graphics were \"stunning when they first came out,\" but I didn't play this game when it was first released, and even though it's just four years old, today they look extremely shoddy. Human skin textures are particularly bad and lumpy, but even the environments and items suffer from weak textures and a ragged, blocky basic structure. The one exception to this rule is with the creatures themselves, which are all brilliantly designed and extremely well-executed. I'd compare the lot of them to most of the bad guys in Silent Hill and perhaps the most gruesome baddies of Resident Evil. It hurts just to look at most of these guys, the way their flesh seems to stretch and strain to withhold the ugliness that's going on underneath. The only thing I could wish for there is a wider taste of variety, since the rogue's list seen here is extremely shallow.Considering all that came before it, Darkness' audio is surprisingly well done. The Cube does everything in its power to deliver a solid surround-sound experience, and those effects come as close to accomplishing the spooky vibe these developers were obviously shooting for as any other aspect of the game.  Musically, the game's soundtrack is uneventful. It swells and sways as necessary, and occasionally gives a nice bit of mood to a location. It isn't repetitious, which is probably my greatest pet peeve about in-game music, and it doesn't get in the way, but it also doesn't stand out on its own. Let's put it this way: I wouldn't rush out to the stores to buy Eternal Darkness: The Original Symphonic Score. The voice acting in general is very good, with few exceptions, and though the dialog the actors are asked to deliver is usually stilted and unbelievable, they go beyond the call of duty to give their roles a personality and motivation that was sorely lacking in the script. Especially good are the noises, shallow screams and ambient ticks of the insanity effects, and each character's resulting reaction to them. While the same phrase is sometimes repeated at the conclusion of one of these sequences, it's not something that ever really bothered me and actually took steps to reveal the characters as more honest and true to life. If you're freaked out and seeing things in an unfamiliar mansion, I doubt the first thing to enter your mind is \"come on, let's at least get a little variety into the dialog.\" You're going to scream the first thing that comes into your head, whether you've said it before or not.To summarize, this feels like a series of very good concepts that were just drawn too thin, which is odd because the game itself, clocking in around twelve hours, is fairly short. There were so many superb, imaginative concepts that died on the way to the screen here that it really became something of a sad theme for the whole picture. Whether it was the truly surprising insanity effects, the unique limb-targeting system or the original system of magic, no matter how good the idea, the execution was always killing the potential for me. Despite the lingering offering of replay value here (there's supposedly a super secret ending if you finish all three potential paths) I just didn't find myself motivated to go through it all again, especially considering how slow, plodding and ultimately dreary the majority of the actual gameplay was. Considering the amount of people that had pimped this game to me, and the incredible reputation it seems to have gathered in the years since, I found myself more than just a little disappointed. As a \"must-have\" title for the GameCube, Eternal Darkness is nothing but a major league let-down.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2006"}

(by Laura)","reviewText":"Animal Crossing is one of the most unusually fun, and addictive games there is.  It is an amazing game that can show you just how far videogaming technology can go.  Like all games, however, it still has it's strengths and weaknesses through comparison of the other games.  I will share my opinion of: the bad, the neutral, and the good about this game.The Bad:1.  Resetti the mole may scare younger kids.  I will explain a bit more thoroughly about the character in the good.  Although I think Resetti is humorous, he will yell at you a lot if you either forget to save; or reset on purpose to erase an event like Spike painting your roof black...  Now, Resetti doesn't start out yelling at you.  He gives you two friendly warnings before getting harsh, so at least you have time to prepare for his temper tantrums.  There is one warning I would like to give the gamers out there, but it's kind of a spoiler.  So, if you don't want any surprises bad or good ruined, just skip on to number two.  For those of you who don't mind slight spoilers, the warning is this: after you reset your game a number of times (like 6 or 7) he will say he will reset your game and make you start from the beginning.  DON'T BE FOOLED!  This is merely a childish prank he plays.  The screen will come back on and he will be like \"GOTCHA!\" and nothing will have happened.  I warn you of this, because this nasty surprise almost had me upset.  After he does this, once he will pull this about every third reset (you will notice a pattern after this point) with the same result: nothing happens, he just continues to lecture you like always.2.  Your neighbors are not fully trustworthy.  Never carry valuable items, or tons of bells (the game's currency) with you when you talk to your neighbors.  There is no way of predicting how the neighbor will converse with you, and before you know it, you either lose most of your bells, or get your valuable item unwillingly traded for some piece of junk.  Also, NEVER play card games with a camper.  I suppose this is good for teaching children to be careful with their stuff, but make sure this doesn't effect their trust on people in the real world.3.  Paying off your mortgage can be tedious.  You will either have to fish or catch bugs until you are sick of it.  You can do jobs for your neighbors, but there is little chance of you getting money from them.  The \"odd jobs\" they give you, is better for getting furniture, clothing, and stationary.  You can also collect seashells, but that doesn't really give you enough money to make it worth your while.  That is good for the start of the game, however, so you can earn enough to get a fishing rod or net.  If you are a real dare devil and you have the net, you can shake trees to get small amounts of money, a couple of pieces of furniture, and three or four beehives.  You can use your net and catch the bees that fall out of the tree, but be careful that you don't get stung.  I will not tell you how to catch the bees, but I will tell you this: don't aim for the hive.  It doesn't work.  I have tried this, and with painful results to my character...  In the event you do get stung, your face will be ugly.  If you absolutely hate the look, save and quit and come back to get rid of it.  Don't shake trees without the net.  It's not worth it, as the bees are difficult to get away from.4.  Not very fun at night if you play based on your time.  Although there are a few things to do, the store closes at ten or eleven pm (depending on the stage) and cuts you off from earning money from selling (one of the main ways of making money).  On top of that, some neighbors can go to bed as early as nine pm, which is why I wouldn't advise asking for jobs at and after nine.  What happens is, someone will say, \"Mitzi borrowed my camera\" or \"Deliver this to Maple\" but you can't do the job after nine when they are in bed.  This means you will either have to decline the job (which upsets them), or agree to do it and wait until they get out of bed, which will likely be hours.  Not worth it.  The one thing that's good about playing at night, is there is the small chance you can meet Wisp.  I will not say too much to avoid a spoiler situation, but I will say it's worth it to meet him.  However, chances of meeting him are rather slim, and it has to be really late at night (were talking midnight here).  If you wish to play at nighttime in the game, but your parents won't let you stay up, I suggest making your town have opposite time.5.  The HRA system stinks.  This is probably one area the game designers failed, although, it's hard to get a good system for a \"beautiful\" home when beauty really is in the eye of the beholder.  It doesn't matter if your room is a complete masterpiece.  If every thing is mixed or your wallpaper and carpet don't match, you will get a low score, and the HRA will say ugly things about you in the mail.  There is a way to get a high score from them, but it's technical, concerning themes and junk.  Make sure to tell young children that it's just bad programming so they don't lose self esteem and think their house is hideous.  On top of that, the store owner forces you to join, so you have to deal with their antics whether you like it or not.6.  The neigbors... are unpredictable.  They are a lot moodier than they are supposed to be.  I have seen two of them talking, one even getting a new outfit, and they both walk away upset.  Befuddling.  You can't even talk to them when they are like this.  Also, save often if you want to guard your roof color.  The animals seem unnaturally obsessed with painting your roof various colors without your permission.  It's a pain.  All I want to do is keep my blue roof...  My mom has also noticed they can be rather insulting at times (particuarly the snobs and Gracie).  Most of this is good natured, however, just keep a slight eye on younger children to make sure they don't develop certain attitude problems.  This itself isn't a major problem, though.  I didn't even notice it until my mom said something.7.  The snobs can teach you acts of questionable morality.  The main one I wish to address considers the lost and found at the police station.  Players can falsely claim items at the lost and found.  I have been there many times.  Only once have I claimed something of my own.  Just make sure you explain to impressionable younger children why it's okay to steal from the lost and found in the game, but NEVER in real life.The Neutral: These are things that can be good or bad depending on how you look at it and/or what form it comes in.1.  Numerous glitches.  The game has some glitches in it.  If you don't like or want anything to do with glitches, this is instantly a bad thing.  If you are slightly more tolerant of \"beneficial\" glitches this is can be a slightly good thing.  If you pay off all of your mortgage (to the point you own an account) you can use the dopplegangler trick to earn numerous bells.  I won't explain it in detail, for it's neither here nor there, but I will say this: express a little caution when doing the trick.  It won't hurt the game, but there are certain steps you have to follow in proper order for it to be successful.  This is probably the only \"good\" glitch in the game.  The rest of the glitches, that I know of, can be caused by time traveling and are NOT good glitches!  Time traveling can be done by changing the time and date on your game.  While it maybe beneficial in some areas (like if you want Christmas in July), I wouldn't recommend doing it often.  I have heard it causes some \"bugs\" including: not being able to hear music in your house unless your close to the tape deck (this I have verified to be true), and trees taking too long to grow (I think this is also true, but may be corrected by slowing down time traveling to only a single day at a time).  On top of that, if you go too far forward or backward in time (believe me, I learned this the hard way), your town will be covered with more weeds than you can shake a stick at, you will get bugs in your house (nasty!), and if things stay a wreck long enough, your neighbors will move away one by one until the problems are dealt with.2.  The storage systems.  There is quite some room for letters and personalized clothing designs, but little room for furniture and such.  A basement will help, but only for a while.  If you are a pack rat like me, this could be a big problem...3.  Teaches apple polishing.  A term which here means: saying things to overly flatter your neighbors in order to get presents.  I mean think about it, are you really going to tell Winnie her clothes are unflattering when you can butter her up to get a free outfit?  I am not sure whether this is a good thing or a bad thing, so it goes in this section.  You decide.4.  This game is addictive.  I guess this can be good, because games are only addictive if you enjoy playing them right?  But I think this can also be bad, because it encourages you to play every day to see what's new.  Just be careful not to become so addicted you don't have time for things in the real world.The Good:1.  Teaches kids responsibility.  You actually can learn a thing or two about paying off mortgages, earning a living, and being neighborly.  Your character's mom may also give you a few tips on how to be social.2.  The museum can teach players some real fascinating facts.  It doesn't really matter what age you are either, you will probably learn at least a fact or two before you complete it.  The paintings aren't really educational, but look closely at them.  My mom recognized a Washington painting considered to be real, and I recognized a painting known as \"The Embrace\" in real life.  One thing I do not understand is: why is Blathers afraid of insects?  He is an owl, aren't owls supposed to eat insects?  It is rather humorous, though.  He seems to have something negative to say about every insect including the beautiful butterflies, and the ladybugs.3.  You can name your place and character whatever you want!  Provided it doesn't exceed the character limit, which is so short it's hard to do anything elaborate and is very annoying.  Regardless, it's fun to come up with names.  You can have only one town per memory card, but if you have a different town on another memory card, the two can interact which is very cool!  On top of that, you don't always have to base your town's time on your own.  You can arrange it where if you play at 3pm, your town will be 3am.  That way, if you base one town on your own time, and base another on \"opposite\" time, you can play day and night if you want to.4.  The neighbors can be fun.  It's true, they can be a pain like I explained earlier, but they can also be delightful to chat with.  You never know what could happen when you just speak to them.  They can give you a gift, a quiz (which results in a gift if you answer correctly, although, some quizzes have no right or wrong answers and you get something anyway), a showing of an interesting letter, and many other unpredictable surprises.  A couple of tips are: to use your common sense (like if Winnie asks you \"Don't I look good in this?\" don't say \"I'm sorry...\"), and don't lie to the guys that like to do push ups if they ask \"Is *put name of object here* yours?\" and you want it.  When the snobs ask the question lie to them if you want the object and it is worth half of your money.5.  The game acknowledges holidays.  This includes your birthday if you have told them.  How cool is that?  Seriously, my neighbor, Pecan, was waiting outside my house's door to give me a present on my birthday!  Other presents came for me in the mail!  And during Halloween evening, everyone is in costume and wants candy!  They also do a New Years countdown!  On top of all that, other non-huge events also go on throughout the year.  Like in June, there is a fishing tourney every Sunday.  Tell me, how many games acknowledge real time and events, including your birthday?6.  Teaches kids how to keep track of times and dates.  Special people like Wendel, Saharah, and Redd come once a month or so on a certain date.  If players want to see them, they will have to learn to keep track of the dates they arrive, and the times they will be there.  On top of that, there are certain weekly treats like a guitar playing dog on Saturdays, or a pig selling turnips on Sundays, so this actually may make kids want to be more coordinated.7.  Teaches the basics of stock marketing, and the work force.  These are interesting concepts.  Although fishing and catching bugs may be out of date for current businesses, the store owner, a raccoon who gives you a house and makes you pay off your mortgage, will make you work for him temporarily to help you pay off your first mortgage.  This gives player a small taste of the trial and error of working for a boss.  Notice how he freaks out when you change out of your uniform during work?  He will accept it, but in real life I don't believe bosses tolerate such things well.  This game can also teach stock marketing with the \"Turnip Market\".  When players want to learn how to buy and sell turnips for a profit, they will need to learn to buy the turnips when prices are low, and sell them when prices are high.  In real life, plain stocks work similarly.  It's rather impressive that game designers can teach such advanced topics in a fun form for kids.Well, I think that about raps it up.  Overall, Animal Crossing is a fun game.  I do recommend it for any age, provided younger children are slightly watched.  The game is pretty realistic though, and it is impressive what game designers can do.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00000J9J9","description":"One of the best things about the Game Boy Color is that it's  basically an original Nintendo Entertainment System that can fit in  your pocket.

All Mario can do is jump (and shoot fireballs with the right power- ups), but it is amazing to see how much gameplay can be squeezed from  these simple actions when the controls work in direct harmony with a  player's thoughts. The only element of this game that could have been  better is that the Game Boy Color's screen isn't quite large enough to  show the entire layout of the original game screen, so players may  occasionally need to press up and down on the control pad to see some  offscreen action.

For Example, if you went into the woods in the game and did not use a map you world get just as lost as you would in a real-world forest with no map.- Hundreds of quests (really big and really small) to perform you can skip any you want or do them all, plus you deicide the outcome weather it be good or bad.- Interact with NPC's, there are literally hundreds of them and they are all voiced acted and display emotions on there faces.- A very life like world in which Police chase thieves, wives nag husbands and wolves prowl the woods looking for prey.- Do just about anything you can think of like steal (anything), save people form gangs, fight in arena's, hunt animals, sail ships, become a vampire (pretty cool) or just hang back and do almost nothing the choice is yours.BAD:- This game may be way to hard for most casual gamers.- The loading in this game is can get annoying, this game will load often and some loads (not all) take a long time. The hard drive cuts down on some loading, but it's still a pain.- Some of the character animations especially those of your character are a little sloppy (but in 1st person you cannot see your own animations so it's not so much a problem)- The Hit Detection (or hit boxes) sometimes doesn't work well.- While the world is huge it's also mostly wooded forest area, which can be a little bland after a while.- Morality seem to play little in the game in terms of your characters development, you can do evil/good act but will not really be considered evil/good in the same way that you see in Fable or Jade Empire. In the end it's more realistic but a little underwhelming.IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- A first person Swords and Sorcery RPG (Click in the left thumb stick to toggle third person mode).- The games theme is very much close to that of the Lord of the Rings books or movie trilogy, by Peter Jackson, other similarities are found in the tabletop RPG Dungeons and Dragons.- This is a do as you please type of RPG (like Fable or Jade Empire), this not anything like Final Fantasy, you pick the quest and you choose the outcome, that said there is little to no character identity outside of your deeds and don't expect a party of other characters who tag a long like in most other RPG's (like Final Fantasy).GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind- Fable: The Lost Chapters- Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain- Thief III: Deadly ShadowADDITIONAL NOTES:- There is downloadable content missions/quests and areas for this game out on PC and Xbox-Live. Examples being horse Armor, Spell Tomes, The Wizard's Tower, The Thieves Den, Vile Lair, The Knights of the Nine, and The Shivering Isles just to name a few.- This is the Special Limited Edition (Xbox-360) comes with a bonus disc, which has a lengthy behind the scenes documentary, also on the disc you can view concept art work for the game, plus the limited edition comes with a small book on the history and people of the Elder Scrolls world and you get a real-to-life coin from this games world.- The world in the game if measured in real-world miles would be about 16 miles not including underground areas like caves, crypts, basements, and bunkers, also most areas in the alternate-dimension of Oblivion are immeasurable due to the fact that they are randomly generated and huge.- All Elder Scrolls games are first Person (the other Elder Scrolls games besides Elder Scrolls III where on the PC).- In the game (at the main city) you will see a poster for a gladiator type of fighting arena called Arena, the poster is the same picture found on the box art for Elder Scrolls first game called Elder Scrolls: Arena.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2006"}

And all day while I'm at work, I can't stop thinking about getting home so I can wave at the thing.  It's really a fun experience, and I'm 34 years old today!  The sensor was my birthday present!Okay, it's fun, you get that, right.  But here is what you NEED to know.Make sure you have a good size room that's free of obstacles.  I'd say an open 8'x8'is essential!Make sure the play space isn't under a fan.  Unfortunately, mine is, so I must be weary of whether I'm about to smash it while getting too excited.  This is going to be one of those things that becomes a YouTube joke, like the Wii remotes smashing into the TV.By far, the biggest disappointment is the fact that the accessory does NOT come with an LCD mount.  For those of you watching all the cool videos about Kinect that Microsoft put on the Xbox in the weeks leading up to it's launch, you probably assumed that the LCD TV mount was included.  It's NOT.  And what's worse, it's $40!  Right now, my Kinect is sitting on my TV stand, which puts it a little lower than recommended at 1.5 feet.  The recommended position is between 2-6 feet.  Don't get me wrong, the LCD mount that they sell looks VERY sturdy because it bolts to the VESA compliant mounting brackets which are pretty standard on these wall mountable TV's., it's just disappointing to be hit with another $40 purchase on top of the original $150.  The way it's currently sitting in my house causes it to lose my hands and fingers if I reach up.  So do yourself a favor, and try to get your sensor mounted on top your TV, or on a shelf just above it.I obviously have Kinect Adventures, which is a fun collection of mini games.  I am looking forward to exploring it more when I have time.  What I played of it seems as though it could get boring as a single player.  But co-op play or competitive play is what's going to make that game fun.  So bring a friendThe other game I got was Your Shape: Fitness Evolved.  This game is like having your own personal trainer without forking over $60 an hour for the luxury.  I got to play it for about 30 min last night, it it really got my heart beating.  And today my thighs are killing me from the squat thrusts.  This game, and all the whole Kinect concept is a wonderful idea for our over weight society.  Of which I am regretfully a member.  But maybe Kinect can bridge the gap between couch potato and fitness guru.  Only time will tell.I need to take a moment to talk about Voice Recognition.  It works well, but there is a caveat.  It was the impression I'd been given that I would be able to control movies using Voice Recognition.  This is not always true.  Microsoft's own website says Voice Recognition only works if you're watching streaming media.  An image on their site even shows a Netflix app in the Kinect Hub.  At this time, that app doesn't exist, therefore, you cannot control streaming Netflix.  The only video application I've been able to make this work in is the Zune Marketplace.  How appropriate that it would only work in a place where Microsoft is going to make a profit off every Zune rental and purchase.  This is a HUGE disappointment.  And I feel a tad betrayed because of this.  As of this moment you CANNOT use voice recognition to control a DVD, the Windows Media Player, or Streaming Netflix.  All you can do is use it to navigate the Kinect hub, launch the Apps within the hub, and navigate through Zune media.  What a drag for a feature with so much potential!  We can only hope that applications emerge to make this worth our while.Basically, this is an awesome accessory, which it probably worth more than $150 it costs.  It's fun as heck, and I am looking forward to seeing some innovative and games being made for this device.  Although, the pics that Kinect Adventure takes of you while you're playing make you feel like a total dweeb, it's too fun for me to really care.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2010"}

Aside from one mission where you are inside the belly of a giant worm this campaign has good pacing and is fun.  The worm mission was pretty slow and I didn't think it really added to the campaign.  Good idea but implementation wasn't on the same level as the other boards.  There are a variety of weapons, each pretty good in their own right.As far as the online play is concerned there are two issues that make what I think would be extremely fun, not.  There are a great variety of maps, each location having a good layout.  There are also a number of modes that are interesting.  The problem is that shotguns are overpowered so every single match reverts to a shotgun war. If you love shotguns this is the game for you. I would like to use the variety of weapons and it just doesn't happen for online play against other players, shotty's rule. Fortunately there is a mode called Horde were you can play cooperatively with other players to take on waves of bad guys that increase in difficulty with each passing wave.  This allows you to effectively use whatever weapon you want.  (the exploding arrow bow is pretty sweet).  If you have a group of buddies this is good.  PUG groups don't cut it because people are always dropping out before you can see weather you can go the distance or not (level 50).If you have a 360 a good title to have in your collection.  If you have a PS3 as well I would recommend getting Uncharted 2 over this (if you are in the market for a third person shooter and can't buy both).  I just can't get over the shotty spamming.  The funny thing is I saw an interview with Cliffy B. and he made an off hand comment that suggested he isn't a fan of people spamming shotty's, but when you give everyone a shotgun by default, what do you expect?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2010"}

Johnson","summary":"COD4 > COD3","reviewText":"With games being in excess of $60 these days, there are very few times I actually buy games new anymore, when I am 99% sure the game will be good and/or I have to have it no matter what.  Very few games fit these criteria and honestly COD4 did not.  I wanted to buy this game used, but there were none available.  Instead the guy behind the counter convinced me that this game was well worth the $60 new price tag so I bit and long story short, he was right.As you already know, COD4 takes us away from the WWII setting which is a VERY good thing.  I personally got sick of fighting in the same war in the 3 previous installments. \"Modern Warfare\" was a definite breath of fresh air.  COD4 takes place in the \"present\" with most of your battles being in the Middle East fighting against terrorists using MODERN weapons, that's right guys, no more panzerfausts or bren guns.Graphically, the game is beautiful; the scenery looks so real it's scary.  The way the environment reacts to your actions has also been done very well.  If you are hiding behind a wooden fence, you can easily shoot through the fence at your enemies and vice versa.  In addition as the bullets pass through the said wooden fence, you will actually see bullet holes.  For stronger barriers such as concrete, bullets will NOT pass through.  However if you shoot it, you will see a indentation in the wall indicating the bullets' vain attempt to pass through.  This is just a very small example of how the environment not only looks great but also reacts to your actions.  In short everything looks like it's supposed to.  It was obvious that a great deal of effort was put into making this game look as real as possible.The animations are also done pretty well and are very convincing.  Enemies and allies alike move and even die realistically.  Depending on where you shoot them, the enemies will react differently.  Shooting them with a non-fatal shot and many times you will actually see the guy crumble to the ground actually trying to drag himself to safety.  However don't think that he still won't be able to kill you, because he can.  In this position, the enemy will pull out his side arm and still fire at you lying on his back in an last ditch effort to take you with him.Sound is also great, as has always been the case with the COD series, so this is no big surprise here.  However that being said, I would say that to me the sound in COD4 is better than COD3.  However that may be just because I was so used to hearing WWII related sounds from this franchise and subconsciously I was just so sick of hearing it.The game play doesn't actually feel like COD game. (again, this may be because they all have been WWII related in the past)  Instead it feels more like Rainbow Six type game.  In fact many times while playing this game, I kept thinking to myself, is this really a COD game?  However this is not a bad thing at all.  I actually got into the game right away, and it is definitely not a \"slow starter\" like so many games these days.  You are thrown into the action fairly early on and it never really lets up.  If you like constant action then you will NOT be disappointed.Continuing with the game play is that the corny \"turn your thumb stick clockwise to set the charge\", or \"tap these buttons as fast as you can to stop the Nazi from overpowering you\" nonsense from COD3 is thankfully gone.  Sure that was cool at first, but I definitely did not like the way COD3 kept throwing it in my face 6 billion times throughout the game.  Now if you have to set a charge, then you just press one button and boom, your done and right back to the action.  If you are about to get killed by a dog, a well timed press down on the right thumb stick and you will break the pooches neck and that's it; then right back to the action.  In addition I don't seem to recall enemies concentrating all their fire directly at YOU in this game (as the case in COD3), instead everyone on your squad is fair game.  This makes the game seem more realistic rather than giving me the impression that the developers didn't know how to make the game challenging any other way than this cheesy method.  Thank you Infinity Ward!What is NOT gone and really my only complaint in this game is that it STILL uses the annoying check point system.  Why? I have no idea, but I absolutely loathe about games these days is that the game determines when you can save.  The only bright side to this is that the checkpoints are closer together than COD3 so while it's still very frustrating its not as frustrating as it could be.  I just beat the game on normal difficulty and currently going back through it on hard, and I found myself getting quite frustrated having to do things over and over and over again on certain levels. But I finally got through by taking a different strategy then what I was originally doing.  In addition, it seems to me that once you reach a certain checkpoint you can't go back to previous one.  I've had once instance where I reached a checkpoint at about the same time the enemy saw me, so it was instant death.  I eventually had to restart the level from scratch...this is another reason was the checkpoint save system is unacceptable.This is all I really have to say about the single player mode.  Bottom line, it fun as hell and you should not be disappointed.  Other than the obvious issue with the ridiculous check point save system I don't see anything else wrong with it.I've only dabbled with the multiplayer, but all I can tell you that it's VERY hard.  If you are used to playing Halo 3 online, then prepare to get pwned.  While both games are clearly FPSs, COD4 is much more difficult online at least that's the case with me but maybe I'm really just a noob.  In any case, you have been warned.I would give this game a 5 in both the fun and overall categories, but I can't in my right mind give this to a game that still uses checkpoint save point system that forces you to replay sections over and over and over again.  So minus one star on the fun factor because of the save system. Yes I gave Halo 3 a 5 fun/5 overall review but never in that game did I find myself being stuck on one section for over an hour due to not being able to make the next check point without dying.  That being said, this title is still a worthy game; one of the few games out there that actually would warrant a $60 price tag.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8LR","description":"WhenLuigi's Mansionwas first announced, many assumed it would  follow in the legendary footsteps ofSuper Mario WorldandSuper Mario  64. The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy. If  only it were a bit longer.--David Jenkins. --Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"The Duck of Indeed","summary":"Fun and Different, But Short","reviewText":"\"Luigi's Mansion\" is a fun game starring Luigi, who won a mansion in a contest he never entered.  Problem is, this mansion is crawling with ghosts and Mario, who went into the mansion earlier, hasn't been heard from since.  So it is up to Luigi to rid the mansion of ghosts and find out what happened to his brother.The game consists of Luigi exploring the many dark rooms of the mansion (which is four floors) and fighting ghosts using a flashlight to stun them and a special vacuum called the Poltergust 3000 to suck them up.  This is a very creative way to fight enemies that I enjoy very much in this game.  It's a nice departure from jumping on enemies like you do in countless other \"Mario\" games.  (The vacuum can also eventually shoot fire, water, and ice later on in the game, as well.)  I also really like that until the lights come on, you're exploring these dark rooms with a flashlight as your only source of light.  It's a bit spooky, but luckily not in a creepy way.Anyway, as you explore the mansion, you find keys to get to new rooms, lots of money, and a variety of ghosts.  There are regular ghosts, Boos (like from previous games), and portrait ghosts, which are special ghosts who hide their weak point extra well, and so may take a little thinking to defeat.  I think there is an interesting variety of portrait ghosts, who are actually people rather than just random enemies like the other ghosts.  It kind of gives a little extra bit of story to the game, like how the butler has a crush on the piano player, and the granny likes playing jokes on people.  It just made the game more interesting than simply capturing nothing but nameless ghosts.Besides the ghosts, it is also fun looking for money, which can be hidden anywhere, like in furniture or secret rooms or even secret ghosts or in more clever places, such as plants that only give up their hidden money when they're watered.  It gives you a reason to check out every bit of the mansion to try and see how much money you can find.Another fun thing is that some things are different depending on how well you do in the game.  Like the portrait ghost get turned into portraits after each boss battle, and the better you do fighting them, the nicer the portrait.  Also, at the end of the game, Luigi has a different mansion built, and it is nicer or uglier depending on how much money you found.  So that gives you a bit more motivation to do a good job with certain parts of the game.A few last comments.  The graphics look nice, and there isn't much to the music, but it fits the game well, nonetheless.  The game is pretty short, but the good thing about that is the game never really gets boring.  It may not have lasted long, but I certainly had fun the entire time.  Because it's short, I don't know if the game is really worth as much as it's selling for, but it is certainly a fun and unique game if you can get it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2012"}

Well, they had a reason to be excited. Spore was supposed to be a revolutionary experience, combining multiple genres while concentrating on evolution and genetics.Fast forward two years and here we have the finished product, ready to be installed on our hard drives.First of all, the game incorporates a draconian DRM system that requires you to activate over the internet, and limits you to a grand total of 3 activations. If you reach that limit, then you'll have to call EA in order to add one extra activation. That's not as simple as it sounds, since when you reach that point EA will assume that you, the paying customer, are a filthy pirating thief. You will need to provide proof of purchase, reasons why the limit was reached, etc, etc (it has all happened before with another recent EA product, Mass Effect). EA, of course, is not obligated to grant you that extra activation or even provide that service. In a couple of years they might very well even shut down the general activation servers, because \"it's not financially feasible\" to keep them running. What you will be left with is a nice, colorful $50 coaster. And you will be required to pay for another copy/license if you want to continue playing.This basically means that you are actually RENTING the game, instead of owning it. The game WILL stop to function in the future. That's inevitable, because even if EA keeps the activation servers going, there IS going to be a time when EA will simply cease to exist because of financial issues or federal laws (like most businesses eventually do).Second, the game was dumbed down to oblivion. Evolution doesn't even matter anymore. For example, you can add as many legs to a creature as you want, but the multi-legged creature won't be any faster than a single-legged one with higher leg stats. This gameplay element makes \"creating\" your creatures entirely pointless (cosmetic only, because everything is based on stats), and brings you about the same amount of excitement as dressing up a plastic doll.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2008"}

Bradford \"scottfbradford\"","summary":"Good graphics and Blu-Ray playback, but pricey","reviewText":"I was not particularly interested in getting a PS3, but with the release of The Prestige as a Blu-Ray exclusive, I finally had to get a player.  The only other options at a similar price were the refurbished Samsung BDP-1000, a similar player by Philips, and the Lite-On burner for a PC.  Since I also like to play games, I chose the 20 GB PS3.  Although the 60 GB model is easy to find online and in stores, the 20 GB model is much more rare.  I finally got one on Ebay and even with shipping it was cheaper than I would have paid in a store with tax.As a Blu-Ray player the PS3 has been great.  With 1.51 firmware, I watched Saw 3, The Descent, and The Prestige flawlessly.  Picture quality is on par with HD DVD.  However, I don't really like using the game controller as a remote.  There is a Bluetooth remote available, but I want an IR solution so I can use my Pronto universal remote.  Fortunately there is a solution using a PS2 remote, IR receiver, and PS2 controller to USB cable.  It takes a little effort, but works.I've also just finished playing Resistance Fall of Man, and I liked the game.  The textures were lacking, especially compared to Gears of War on the Xbox 360.  But I liked the story and gameplay a little better in Resistance.  But I do not like the Sony controller.  It is too small, awkwardly shaped, and feels too light and cheaply made.  The 360 controller is much better ergonomically and it includes rumble.  The motion sensing in the PS3 controller may be a good idea for driving/flying games, but it felt tacked on and useless in a shooter like Resistance.  I'm also not sure I like having the battery built in.  Only time will tell how long it lasts.  I hope Logitech provides a controller soon.  I really liked their wireless version of the PS2 controller.I don't play online, but I really hate not being able to download while playing like you can on the 360.  That was a dumb move by Sony and I hope it can be fixed in the future.  Also, the menu system is much like the PSPs and is clunky compared to the 360.When compared to other Blu-Ray players, the PS3 is reasonably priced.  But for a game machine it is expensive.  The 360 so far delivers a better gaming experience with a larger library and equal graphics and gameplay.  Resistance and Motorstorm are not good enough reasons to get a PS3 for gaming.  More good exclusives are needed and fast.  Ironically, I think adding Blu-Ray was a mistake from a gaming perspective, but I would not have gotten a PS3 if it were not for its Blu-Ray capability.  Microsoft has done the right things by getting to market first and locking up good exclusives and getting former PS3 exclusives onto the 360.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2007"}

I've played several in the past, but none had that Dark Knight flavor. As a matter of fact, none were worth playing for any reason. This one blows them all out of the water. This one also competes with ALL other games (regardless of genre) as one of the best games of all time. Well crafted, grity, dark, intense, meaty...this is IT. A great Batman game and a great game in general, don't let this one pass you by. With so many reviews already written here, and so many already saying the positive things I wish to express about the game, I'm just going to say that this gets my vote as one of the most perfect games I've ever played.

The game is based on the comic books and not the movies and is a great addition to anybody's superhero game library. The game can be played in 1, 2, 3 or 4 players, and if you're playing your game alone and somebody comes in and wants to join, you can simply do it pausing the game and adding the control to the second, third or fouth player immediately and if that friend or family member has to go or simpley doesn't want to play anymore, you can pause the game and simply turn off the control to the player.The game is long enough to keep you busy and fun enough to keep you playing.Compared to the first game this has better graphics, better sound but equally good storyline, my game didn't freeze as the other people in this page and it works perfectly.The good thing of this game is that you can switch from one character to another depending the situation, and you can use celebrities of the X-Men comic books, like Magneto or Toad.If you like the X-Men or the marvel universe and action RPG games this is your kind of game.If you've had a dissapointment as i did with marvel ultimate alliance and you think the game is over rated but you're afraid that this game will be a big dissapointment also, think again, this game is a lot better that the alliance, i can assure you that.Hope this helps.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2007"}

Now you can build almost anything out of legos and with such licenses that branch into star wars, lord of the rings and harry potter they also inspired video games based off of these licenses. Now Nintendo is coming out with an original offering for the Wii U called Lego City Undercover. But is this a city that you'll want to visit or should you just keep on driving?In this game you take on the role of Chase McCain an undercover cop as you try to solve crimes and bring law and order to this city. As you go thru the game you'll be able to run , jump and swing from light poles as you cover more ground and try to fight the bad guys. You won't be fighting crime just on foot as you can drive in a police car or even fly around in a police helicopter! As with the previous lego games you can use loose bricks to build things that you might need in the various environments that you encounter. If you can't get up on a ledge you can get a bunch of bricks and craft a box! The neatest thing about this game is you can choose from a variety of disguises and each disguise has it's own variety of attacks. You can turn into a robber that uses a crowbar or a construction worker that uses a jackhammer!What is awesome about this game is it is an open world game just like Grand Theft Auto as you can take missions or just explore the environments. The game pad can be used with special functions just like in other games as it has multiple uses. For one it's your map to the city and how you gain mission updates direct from HQ. You can also scan for hidden criminals and then run them down and arrest them! The controls for the game look and feel fluid as you'll be driving, fighting and wall jumping with the greatest of easeThe only problem is this is (for now) a Wii U exclusive so if you like this kind of game you're going to have to get a Wii U for it. But the game does look fun to play especially if you are a big fan of the lego style games.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"Evan M.","summary":"Timeless Classic","reviewText":"Even though this game states it is for the younger generation, I quickly fell in love with the series at a friend's house.

Like most people I came out of the movie theatre with sweaty palms and a strong desire to stab goblins, and luckily this little game is right up my ally.Playing as either 'designer-stubble king-to-be' Aragorn, half-pint, salt of the earth axe murderer Gimli or clean-cut Robin Hood crack-shot Legolas, you'll tramp around assorted Middle Earth locals, hitting things with your sword or shooting them with your bow.  If you're at all familiar with the Streets of Rage or Double Dragon games you'll be right at home here.The levels are right out of the movies, with of course a few artistic liberties taken in expanding them to a scrolling slash-em-up.  Expect Fanghorn Forest, Helms Deep and the wonderfully evocotive Balin's Tomb from the first movie.Bad guys arrive thick and fast in all your favourite flavours - Orks, Moria Goblins, big tough Uruk-Hai and of course the Ring Wraiths.  Your options in dealing with all of them generally involves hammering different button combinations in order to produce a variety of flashy sword moves and colourful special moves.However, this is really the crux of why The Two Towers game isn't going to set the world on fire.  Most of your moves are gained by completing a level with a high point score, so you'll find yourself replaying levels again and again just to up your score and buy that all important new 'goblin slaying thrust' move.  The moves themselves are pretty simple, but you'll be hard pressed to get them right when you most need them, swamped as you are in enemies.  To the game's credit, you will see a LOT of enemies on the screen at once, but sometimes its all a bit much.The graphics and sound are top notch and very realistic, but if only you could do a bit more exploring, a bit more strategic planning of your next attack and a bit less hammering X every time 50 goblins hove into view.  And most criminal of all, if only you could play with a friend.  More than once you'll be wishing you could team up with your mates against the lumbering cave troll.  The game AI handles all of your allies, but make no mistake, its you that's gonna do all the dirty work.In the short term this is a good, solid hack-and-slash romp, with great visuals and lots of bonus features to explore.  But at the end of the day you'll be wishing there was just a little more beneath the beautiful surface.  Roll on Return Of The King...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2003"}

Featuring detailed environments and complicated new battle mechanisms, this game demands a different kind of perspective than the first-person shooters from the original Halo series. You'll need to uncover the hidden strengths and weaknesses of each unit and play them to your tactical advantage, and that's just the beginning.UNSC: Be Part of a Legendary ConflictThe story opens with UNSC forces retaking the planet Harvest from the Covenant. At your disposal -- should you choose to take command of UNSC forces -- will be everything from a corps of highly-trained Marines to the Warthogs, Scorpions, and Hornets you'll need for air and land attacks. You'll take stock of the map and decide between holding your ground or advancing on enemy strongholds, all while trying to navigate the local terrain and outsmart Covenant forces. And when you need something extra to tip the tide in your favor, UNSC leaders can provide you with the ability to mobilize highly specialized units or call the Spirit of Fire vessel for support from above.Covenant: A Capable, Playable Enemy FactionThat's right, Covenant is playable in this corner of the Halo universe. This alliance of alien species has manipulated advanced technology, firepower, and tactical prowess into a powerful force that is engaged in a Genocidal war against human race, having branded humans as heretics. With the ability to play as these tough, alien fighters, you'll have advanced shield technology, the modular Citadel at the heart of Covenant's colonizing power, and, of course, the iconic Scarab attack vehicle at your disposal, adding a whole new dimension to your strategic warfare. The Scarab is a terrifying military vehicle crafted from heavy mining equipment. And with a mining laser that delivers massive damage across battlefields large and small, turrets for taking on air attacks, and the ability to clamber over any terrain, what's not to love about commanding Scarabs instead of fighting against them?Developed Exclusively for Xbox 360Most console RTS games are adapted from existing PC games, which can make their controls bulky or awkward, butHalo Warshas been developed for Xbox 360 from the ground up. This means the controls are sensitive, intuitive, and easy-to-operate in the midst of battle. And the UI is just as intuitive, so whether you're managing a unit of marines or a deadly machine, you can focus on creating a battle strategy instead of worrying about how to overcome a clumsy controller.No matter which faction you choose to play as, you can test your skills against those of other players in online skirmishes that allow up to six players with the New Xbox Experience through Xbox LIVE.","reviewerName":"MekoRush","summary":"fun yes, slow yes, halo yes, a simple RTS game","reviewText":"i loved this game, i acutally got all the halos before halo 4 came out to catch up on my halo-ness since xbox days and i sold all except this one. played it about 4 more times after completing it. its a great lil story and fun rts but it's nothing technical to get into. for the date it was released graphics are ok. story is great again. wish the characters would control themownself a lil bit","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2013"}

I wanted a simmilar game where I had control over the character. However, they may as well have put this one on a rail system, as even with control over where you walk to, you still follow the same paths each time, with not much more then 2 directions to chose to go in, usually either path results in ending in the same spot.As you should have figured out, it's a shooter game, much of the style of Doom & Duke Nukem games. However most of this game requires you to carry a flash light to see in dark areas, and then switch to a weapon when a zombie or monster creature attacks. I got fed up with that idea, and used a game shark cheat to make it always light. Maybe some people might enjoy that idea, but I thought it was just annoying after a while.As you progress your itinerary consists of a flash light, a night stick, a hand gun, a magnum, a saw/grinder, shotgun, sniper rifle & machine gun. By the time I had reached the end of this game, I was bored with all these weapons and seemed very disappointing to me that a boss that appears a couple of times in this game got a mini-gun to use (ya know that weapon usually found on military choppers that Arnie used in Terminator 2)I think there is around about 20 levels, give or take a few, and by the time I was half way through those, I was bored at the repetitiveness of each level. In fact, I was bored stupid by the time I got to the final boss and rolled my eyes when the boss keeps saying the same things over and over again until you defeat him. Then to top it off, the ending was just a complete WTF moment. (a major let down)The lack of options and extra games really has become a trademark of so many NDS games. This one is no exception with 0 other games to play other then the main game. No two player, no wifi, no nothing. And when you have completed the game, if you go back to your saved file and continue, you go straight back to the final level... you can not choose previous levels and there is absolutely nothing at all to unlock and make you want to sit through playing the game again from the beginning.Even tho it was longer then \"Touch The Dead\" I still only grant this game half a star better then that one.

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city. Players will be challenged to decide if they choose to save or destroy Empire City.Urban Exploration- Scale the cityscape to discover new vantage points and employ a vertical combat system. Utilize Cole&rsquo;s climbing skills to go where most people can not, opening up a variety of offensive and defensive combat options.Organic City Ecology- Watch the citizens and city react and evolve depending on players&rsquo; actions. Events will unfold based on the role players take in them, creating broader reactions in the city&rsquo;s people and environment.","reviewerName":"J. L.

It's going to make it difficult to go back to regular Forza games after playing this- with the exception of tuning which, while not needed, is greatly missed.Horizon has gorgeous graphics, great music and radio chatter, amazing day to night cycles and a nice list of cars and customizations (more cars will be appreciated as they come out). If you are looking for regular Forza here- you'll be turning off all the assists. If you're looking for Arcade like- PGR or Midnight Club- leave most on. It's that simple. For the game itself, there's very little to want for. I'd give this a solid 4.25 out of 5 stars.Now- the Limited Edition: This is the worst LE I've ever purchased. I wouldn't buy this if you're looking for 'the goods'. It's truly lousy in every aspect except the steel book case. Honestly- that's why I bought it. The 'bonus cars and liveries' are worthless. The VIP access on the storefront is a joke as there's very little 'storefront' to begin with. The pass you get- is junk as it still costs a LOT of credits to get from A to B fastravel. I'd give this LE a 1 out of 5 stars without any hope of redemption.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2012"}

For example, pushing up on your controller makes you sidestep your opponent&#x92;s attacks, yet also allows you to jump in the air by tapping up plus a direction. A revamped fighting system offers up three different styles for each fighter (one includes a weapon technique). The multiple styles provide countless varieties of attacks for any given fighter. Different combinations of punches and kicks can be combined for very lengthy and powerful chain attacks similar to those in theMortal Kombatof old. Fatalities are also back and rich in graphic representation.New fighters join the cast of old favorites such as Sonya, Kano, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Kung Lao, Kitana, Quan Chi, Reptile, and Shang Tsung. The lavish environments surround your fighters with animated backgrounds and rich skylines. On some levels there are even breakable objects and hazards that you can interact with, such as pools of acid--the perfect landing place for a thrown opponent.In addition to regular modes of gameplay (arcade, versus, etc.), there is an option called Konquest mode. This mode allows you to learn more about fighting styles, read up on each character&#x92;s personal history, and gain Koins. The koins can then be spent in the Krypt, allowing you to unlock a host of new characters, costumes, and early concept drawings.

The amount of blood spilled per fight is simply amazing. I'm not sure that a body actually HAS that much blood in it!First off, it's a great fighting game that is available on all of the major platforms. You can play single player or against a friend, and you hack, slash and impale in a variety of arenas with a variety of characters.Like all other games in this style, you can choose from a limited number of characters first (in this one about 10) and then as you go you unlock the other 10 characters. You can unlock arenas and alternate outfits and other items as well, including artwork.The unlocking is all done through earning money. Each set of wins you achieve gives you cash. You can then go down and open koffins (there are HUNDREDS of them) and each one does something. It's really good to find a website to get the printout of koffins! Many are simply empty, but some give you great items or extra cash. You can easily rack up lots of money if you know which koffins to open.The graphics are great, and the fighting is good. The arenas have great detail and each character's moves are very fluid. Each character has 3 styles they can cycle through, and a number of moves in each one. I have heard some people complain that there are only a few finishing moves, but really, that's just the one final blow in the fight. We hardly noticed in our gameplay.A fun fighting game for those who enjoy the genre, but not for young kids! The huge volumes of blood pouring out of the bodies is a bit much, and the game definitely emphasizes the violence of fighting.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2003"}

Rhodes","summary":"Complete the Final Fantasy Collection","reviewText":"After sixteen long years, Final Fantasy III finally sees an official release outside of Japan.  However, unlike previous games, Final Fantasy III has been completely reworked.  This is more than just a port with enhanced graphics.  Final Fantasy III includes some new secrets and side quests in addition to its graphical overhaul.  Final Fantasy III may be just about enough to please some hardcore fans, but was the wait really worth it?  Well, yes, but the game isn't perfect.The storyline of Final Fantasy III is entirely too simple.  The crystals are losing their powers and there are only four warriors that can come forth and save the world from falling into darkness.  Sixteen years ago this was a pretty standard story, but when compared to your average RPG today, and current Final Fantasy games, the storyline to Final Fantasy III is a joke.  There's nothing in this story that screams epic, and the characters involved aren't developed very well.  Luckily, we can let it slide because its sixteen years old.Gameplay wise, Final Fantasy III is pretty similar to most RPGs of today.  You'll go roaming through dungeons and towns getting into random battles.  There are a few quirks to the game that the DS utilizes.  You'll find moments where you'll have to zoom into certain objects for you to examine.  It should also be noted that you can use the touch screen almost exclusively in the game.  Using the stylus you can make your character run in the direction you want him to, by gliding it across the screen.  Taping on things makes your character examine it, and ultimately this is how you open chests and talk to people.  It works out, but it feels really clumbsy at times.  If you're looking to get through a dungeon with little hassle, just stick to the directional buttons.  To its credit, though, using the stylus makes menu navigation much faster, but for the most part, the stylus controls just feel tacked on.Combat is traditional turn based combat.  There's no ATB gauge like in later Final Fantasy games.  In each round you will choose all the commands for your characters to do, and then watch a round of battle take place.  It's simple, but isn't always fun.  Mainly because Final Fantasy III is a challenge.  If you began with some of the later Final Fantasy games, then this installment may be a little too difficult.  Sometimes combat is unforgiving, especially when faced with bosses that attack twice per turn, and have the power to take out a character in a single shot.  Even worse, the encounter rate is pretty high and running away from battle is often a wasted effort because you'll fail so many times trying to do so.  You'll probably get wiped out just trying to run from battle and failing so many times.  There are several moments when you'll be forced to battle for hours just leveling up.  This is fine for those used to old school RPGs, but many RPGs of today do not put so much emphasis on leveling up, and it may try your patience after a while.  It's great for people looking for a challenge, at least, but for some it may be a bit too steep.The job system is interesting.  As you go through the game you'll get crystal shards that allow your characters to use certain jobs.  Each job has its own set of abilities that can be learned with it.  For example, White mages specialize in the healing arts, black mages in attack magic and red mages can do a little bit of both.  You've also got other classes like warriors who can take damage for other party members, thieves who can steal and much more.  There are 23 jobs in all.  The jobs you choose for your characters also have an impact on your stats.  Mages, for example, don't have a lot of strength but they excel in magic.  Also, as you gain levels, you'll also gain job levels.  So it's not only important to make sure your characters are at a good level, but also at a good job level.There is a slight problem with the job system however.  It isn't nearly as varied as it could be.  As you go through the game you'll gain more and more jobs that ultimately replace the older ones.  In the beginning you'll get a Blackmage; as you progress you'll get a Sage, who is capable of doing everything a Blackmage can do.  Thus, later in the game, many job classes become obsolete.  It's really hard to compliment the games variety when later on many job classes are more of the same thing.  So while the job system is interesting, later games such as Final Fantasy V execute it much better and with more variety.The game looks absolutely stunning, at least for the Nintendo DS.  It is by far one of the best looking out there.  There are some moments where it looks pixilated, but you can't deny that the game just looks good regardless.  The movie sequences are also really pretty to look at and they run surprisingly well.  In battle is also fantastic.  Your enemies sport some amazing detail and so do the backgrounds in battle.  On the whole, the game just looks good.  Perhaps the only fault of the graphics is how restricted the animation of characters and enemies are in combat.  Your characters won't physically go up and strike an enemy.  Rather they just step forward and swing.  Very similar to how the Final Fantasy games of the NES worked.  It's strange to see, but you'll quickly get used to it.Another thing that seems kind of strange, though, is that the top screen throughout most of the game remains blank.  All the action takes place on the bottom screen.  There are few moments when the top screen actually displays anything.  You'll see the world map as you travel the overworld and while you're in towns.  There are certain moments where the top screen has text, or shows an important story sequence, but that's usually about it.  Other than that, when trumping through dungeons (as you do often) and in battle (as you also do often) the top screen remains blank.  There's nothing wrong with it, but it feels very awkward to play a Nintendo DS game where the top screen is blank.  They could've used it to display dungeon maps or enemy information or something.  The top screen has no impact on gameplay whatsoever.The music in the game is pretty good, though.  It's not as good as other games in the series, and there are some tunes that just aren't great, but the music is by no means bad.  There's no voice acting in the game, really, but we can let that slide.  Audio wise, the game is good.Final Fantasy III is a pretty satisfying experience for any Final Fantasy fan looking for a good challenge, and to see how far the series has come.  However, it may also shed a little too much of its old school charm in some areas, particularly its unforgiving challenge.  Still, it's worth it for Final Fantasy fans who want to see just how far the series has come.The Good+Finally a chance to play Final Fantasy III+Great visual look+Good music+The job system is interesting+It provides a good challenge+A fair amount of secrets and sidequestsThe Bad-The story is not all that great-For some the game might provide too much of a challenge, to the point of frustration-High random encounter rate-The job system is interesting, but there's not nearly as much vareity as one might expect from it-Throughout most of your adventure the top screen is just... blank... for a Nintendo DS game this just feels awkward","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2006"}
{"product_name":"B001BP4JY6","reviewerName":"Death is real \"GAMING ON A BUDGET!!!\"","summary":"Okay for the weekend.","reviewText":"I grew up on the ninja gaiden series and thought that this would be fun to play. But now I know why we just rented all the titles. Here are a few pros and cons to the game and you should just rent it.Pros:Good combat system.Good graphics.The combat system is good and deep for just a hack and slash. And there is room for growth as you upgrade weapons and find weapons. Graphics are clean and clear and very detailed. Along with a lot of other things that really stand out to make you look in that direction.Cons:CameraStorylinecontrolsMenu optionsThe camera could have been just a tad bit tighter so that you didn't have to keep adjusting it or hitting the R1 button to center it. The storyline could have been a little bit more deeper then just straight up revenge. And the controls needed to be really tight cause trying to get to higher places required you to jump to certain places and not being in the right place to do this usually meant hit or miss and then doing it all over again and again. And the last one is the menu options. This was probably the most frustating one of all cause to change weapons you had to open the menu, to use special items you opened the menu, to switch certain items you opened the menu and if you wanted to pause the game guess what? You opened the menu!. This is suppose to be a fastpaced game and you relied on the menu for certain things that are critical to the game. Which is how its suppose to be but in the middle of something I find myself hitting this button a lot to do certain things in the game and there was no way to map it to other buttons or set it up for that.Long? Yes. Worth buying? No. Worth playing? Yes. Any replay value? NO. Regardless of the flaws in this title its still pretty good compared to what is out there now and still a good title to play. Once again if your funds are low and you don't want to waste cash on a game this will hold you over for a long weekend or a week. But I would not recommend buying this title cause its just not that filling. Its like eating chinese food. No matter how much you eat, your hungry again later. And this title does fall into this group. Once your done, your done.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0009UBR3A","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Link lives on the Gamecube","reviewText":"The long awaited (and that's saying it lightly) Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is finally here.  Nintendo shocked gamers worldwide when they announced the eagerly anticipated game would be released for both the Gamecube and the Wii, and then threw another delay on the title.  Well, now, it's here, and chances are, you already know what you're getting here.  If you played the Wii version, you'll find that there aren't many differences between that version and this Gamecube conversion (Link's a lefty here), as it boasts some high-res graphics and the same compelling gameplay that Zelda fans would come to expect.  This time around, Link finds himself protecting Zelda and Hyrule from the Twilight: an evil force threatening the land.  Lucky for Link that when he needs to, he can transform into a wolf.  The wolf gameplay elements are a really nice addition to the classic gameplay formula that has been applied to Zelda games for years: intelligent puzzles, rewarding battles and large dungeons, and a very long and epic quest that just makes Twilight Princess all the sweeter.  The sound design, music, and controls are all wonderfully done as well, and overall the game boasts a kind of polish that hasn't been seen in an original Gamecube game in a long time.  If you don't own a Wii and Twilight Princess and are still holding on to your rapidly dying 'Cube, then you already know this is a must own.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2006"}

It was the game battlefield 1942 that gave the series its popularity.Graphics. Yeah, good for its time, but unless your graphics card AND you processor are more than three years old, you won't have any problem running it at max detail. The water effects are gorgeous and should be mentioned.Sound. This game has some of the best and most believable sound effects i have ever heard in a game. You will start sweating when you hear that enemy chopper comming...for YOU! The music is also great, unfortuneately, it is not used in game, and there are only four tracks.Gameplay. Superextraordinaryfantasticallygreat, this new word that I just made up is used to describe that gameplay. Basically, there are 7 roles you can play in a battleAssault - Good in fire-fights, tires quicklySniper - Sneaky, stealthy, fast, and camoflaugedSpecial Ops - Accurate weapons and good speed, but no armorSupport - You carry a big gun! ~oh yeah!Engineer - A guy with a shotgun and a wrench (help me!)Medic - You're like assault, except your not as good!Anti-Tank - Its more like anti - everything!Needless to say, the 11 maps turn into full-fledged wars, and man - it's really fun! The game really shines when you and your team work together with strategy, working alone dulls the excitement (Unless you're an assassin type class). The game has its flaws in gameplay, though, all the vehicles are really unbalanced, how the hell does one take out a tank with a sniper rifle? When I am seen by a tank, it ussually amounts to me running on top of the tank (because it's safe there), and praying that no enemies happen to stroll by the tank and notice me. (This makes the drives REALLY angry).Multiplay. One thing, if you are not going to go online with this game, forget buying it, go back to playing boring linear singleplayer shooters laden with repitition that makes you bored even thinking about it. Or, go and play an RPG (I recommend Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion).Value. The day I am writing this, the price tag is $7.99, unless you are ultra cheap, you probably realize that this is a superb game at an unbelievablely low price.Replay. Ok, I play it EVERY weekend for three hours, is that enough replay value for you?Ok, BF2 is not for everyone, if your the kind of guy who thinks shooters are cheap junk with no replay value, well, unless you want to be dragged kicking and screaming into the world of reallity, you probably won't want to buy this game. Or if you like futuristic shooters, you may want to check out Battlefield 2142, even though it's twice as expensive.For eveyone else - Simply click on \"buy\"Graphics - 9/10Sound - 10/10Gameplay - 9/10Multiplay - 10/10Value - 10/10Replay - 10/10Overall - 10/10 - Superextraordinaryfantasticallygreat++!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2008"}

This makes me think the Xbox 360 wasn't ready to push the envelope this early just to beat PS3 to the punch.)-Halo 3 comming out in the fall?(Come the fudge on Microsoft, the first Halo was a freaking launch title for the Xbox)Xbox 360 is the begining of the next generation of video games, but the fact that Microsoft is only caring about it's beloved 360, is almost as if its like telling previous Xbox owners to move up, or be left in the rain.  It feels like they're toatlly abandoning it, and only putting multi-console games on it(That's sad, cuz when the PS2 came out Sony still put out exclusive games on the PSX, like Final Fantasy IX, Syphon Filter 3, Fear Effect 2, and a bit more)  I just wish Microsoft could be that way so regular Xbox users could play good games to tide them until they're ready to move up.  Anyway, don't get me wrong, this still is a very good system and all, it's just the negletion that I hate.

I don't even give it a 'meh' - it earns a full out dislike, bordering on hate it.It's as boring and unexciting as BLOPS. But throw in the dozens of killstreaks/pointstreaks/deathstreaks, horrible lag compensation, a terrible spawn system, and dull and drab maps and you have this sad FPS called MW3. Seriously, there is probably as much customization required for streak rewards as there is for your weapons and perks. This is supposed to be a first person SHOOTER. That's probably why I liked MW1 so much - the focus was on fast paced and exciting gun battles. MW2 took us down the wrong path, BLOPS tried to steer it back to the right course, but MW3 veered us directly into the rocks.I really wanted to like this game - I really did! But after a few months and yet another painful session I've determined that this game is the worst of the lot. This is the last COD game I'll buy. I've given IW enough of my money and time - I'm just not interested in what they're selling anymore.Two year update: this game remains terrible to this day.  Even when I'm having a 'good game', I'm still not satisfied with the experience.  At best, I tolerate it.  But most of the time, I hate it.  It's not even worth the cheap price, not unless you're a masochist.  I'm always hoping that they'll fix the issues, but it just seems to get worse with time.

While FF8 was like playing characters in a well done anime movie, FF IX has you controlling rounded, playful looking characters that give the game more kid-appeal.The graphics in general are stellar. The opening sequence, the animation of water, of birds, of fire, and of other things normally challenging to an animation crew are amazing to watch. Gameplay graphics are quite good, although at times the pretty backgrounds can make finding an object or figuring out an exit to a room a bit difficult.FF IX is a bit restrictive in its characters. Your thief, mage, knight, and &quot;princess healer&quot; each need to pretty much specialize within their class. Each can find special items to help them learn and grow, and choose how to aim their growth. This can be done automatically for new players, or with great attention to detail for the more advanced gamers.Battle is also nice in this way - beginners can have the game pause while they choose exactly which magic to fire at their enemies, while those wanting a challenge can have the entire battle run in real time, depending on quick reflexes and fast fingers. In addition to the players, there are also 'helpers', or Eidolons, which add to the drama of a battle.Active Time Events (ATE) will show up occasionally to fill you in on the storyline, showing short movies of things happening elsewhere in the game. These are well done - if you've already seen a particular ATE from a different game, you can simply bypass these. Some ATEs help progress the plot, while others give the player help with new commands.In all, this is a great game for all playing levels. New and young gamers can set the game up so it gives you time to think during combat, and helps out out with skill setting. Advanced players can tweak all of the details themselves, and immerse themselves in the challenging card games that are part of the plot.

The controls and the handling are top notch for this racing sim but the design of the game itself is poor compared to Forza 2. After waiting to go through the installation process, the load times are not as fast as expected coupled by slow saving.The repetitive motion of buying a cheap car, racing the same tracks over and over again, to earn cash to get a required car to enter another race, then rinsing and repeating made the game a chore to play. Compare Forza 2's reward system for finishing sets of races in first place, unlocking cars to use in arcade mode, and being awarded cars for continuously racing one type of car, this game misses the mark.The other gripe is the invisible walls lining up some of the tracks and being able to bounce back into the race even when losing control and hitting the invisible wall. This 'demo' does not allow for cars to be tuned, upgraded or customized, and lacks real time damage while racing. In Forza 2, damage on the car affects the performance greatly, down to losing control of the car.There are too many bits and pieces missing from this and I hope this all gets fixed in the final release since Forza 3 will be out around the same time.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2009"}

Yes you can play for free on the Playstation but even Sony offers  online features that rival Xbox Live for additional cost.  If you have an Xbox it is worth the cost for Xbox Live as it makes your gaming experience much better.  This online Xbox Live code is a great value and often is priced much cheaper than you can get through Xbox Live or at a retail store.

I can't tell you too much of the story, but the object of the game is to go into these dungons, fight monsters, get the items in the sphere things, leave the dungon and rebuild the town that you are in.  The first town and dungon is pretty fun.  You are able to rebuild the town anyway you'd like.  However, if you listen to the townspeople when ever you start to rebuild, they will give you hints on where to put things.  OK, so I finished the first town and went on to the second.  That's were it became repetitios.  Same old thing, just in a different town.  Go into dungon, fight monsters, get items to rebuild town... BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.What makes it even worse is that when you are in the dungon, you have to keep an eye on your water supply.  When you run out of water, you start to lose health.  And, your weapons only have a few attacks before breaking.  Keep an eye on your weapon also, when it's about to break, you have to use a Weapon Recovery to fix it.  If you're too late and it breaks, your SOL.The characters in the game are rather annoying.  Especially the main guy, whom you can name whatever you'd like.  He doesn't talk which I don't like.  And has anyone else noticed he looks just like the main character from Dragon Quest VIII?  I know the two games are from the same company, Level 5 I believe, but come on, show some originality.Anyway, this is a game that kids will really enjoy.  There is nothing complicated to it, just really repetitious.Oh, one thing I forgot to mention.  When you are in the dungons and you decide to leave with out killings all the monsters, you'll lose half your money.  Same thing happens when you die in the dungon.

Reining \"Old School Zinger\"","summary":"Meet the new boss, same as the old boss","reviewText":"It seems unfair of me to give a game three stars after having played it well over 200 hours. Doesn't the fact that it kept me interested for that long prove that it's much more than just an \"okay\" game? Well, yes and no. So I will say this: When the game works, it's six star material. But it doesn't always.In the end, almost all of the good in New Vegas is cancelled out by the bad, and that is why it ultimately gets three stars. I can play games easily that have some glitches, or some technical problems. But with this game, it was almost unreal. Faulty textures, glitching, clipping, freezing, quests not updating when goals are accomplished, dialog options not appearing, random attacks from friendly factions, not to mention extremely overused voice actors. Sometimes when I press the V.A.T.S. button, nothing happens for a good 10-20 seconds. During that time even when pulling the right trigger to fire, nothing. As much as I loved the game for its story, atmosphere, weapon modifications and new downloadable content (Dead Money), I can't forgive such blatant and persistent problems.Now, when the game is working, it's fantastic, and I think another reason I feel slightly guilty rating this at only three stars is that I have assigned other games three stars as well that were nowhere near as good as New Vegas. But see, few games strive to accomplish what New Vegas does. There are so many choices, quests, weapons, npc's, history, etc. Most other games can't touch the level detail that went into the making of this game. But again, just because it tried to do a lot, it only really works some of the time. So I'm sorry, but if that's the case, you need to do less, but make that less more refined.I wanted to wait until I really had a good handle on the game before making a review. The day after this was released, back in October, there were already 50+ reviews. Talk about jumping the gun. There is so much to see and do in New Vegas that even a week is not enough time to experience it all. Unless you're not sleeping. And...don't do that mkay. Point is, I know three star reviews aren't popular when you just love a game, but I do really feel that this is what the game deserves. Too many flaws really have brought this game down. Even with the patch that was released recently, there are still many problems that exist. I have played through twice now, and though the game can be fantastic fun, when the game lags, or freezes, it goes from ultra fun to ultra irritation.If you've got patience, you should try this game. I have seen multiple reviews comparing this to Fallout 3, talking about how glitchy Fallout 3 was. Maybe because it's been so long since I played it I just don't remember, but from what I do remember, Fallout 3 was vastly superior to New Vegas, in terms of the number of times loads failed, of the game froze, or the V.A.T.S. problem (which I never experienced in FO3). New Vegas is still a great game...when it's working. Which it does a lot of the time. Unfortunately just not enough.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2011"}

Although it suffered a far from...happy ending and most of the DLCs offered little more than even more loot and a handful of unique items, it was a game I greatly enjoyed for hours at no end and was more than happy to replay it only to follow different paths every time the story bifurcated. I for one was sure left craving for more and the Obsidian/Bethesda people were more than happy to deliver. Even so, true to Vegas mentality, they seem to have let their winnings ride...The first thing that hit you in the Mojave desert is how...familiar this new world looks like. The graphics, which were excellent two years ago, are still very good - but they are no longer cutting edge. Besides some richer shadowing and somewhat more vivid colors, if there are any major graphical improvements since FALLOUT-3 I failed to notice them. Having said that, I must admit that I loved the skies, especially during sunrises and sunsets!Although both the story and the location are different from FALLOUT-3, I was happy to meet old friends: the handy PIPBOY-3000, the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skill system and the V.A.T.S. targeting aid. The gameplay seems to fit like a favorite old pair of jeans.Character development has both acquired more depth (with the return of Traits which offer advantages but at a price) but also made easier. There are new guns and more explosive kill-shot sequences as well as more skills and perks but I felt far less pressure to complete quests to gain experience points and translate them into perks, skills and traits as the game is generous in offering different ways to accomplish this.Notably, with all the conflicting groups and factions angling for an edge in controlling New Vegas, the story seems more byzantine than FALLOUT-3 and the choices one has to make now cut deeper. And after about 20 hours of playing it feels like I barely scratched the surface. This is a longer game than FALLOUT-3.Now some bad news. Whereas FALLOUT 3 had a simple disk-check, FALLOUT:NEW VEGAS comes with mandatory OnLine STEAM registration and activation. If you are wondering, the game lost its fifth star neither because of its somewhat dated graphics, nor its numerous bugs or occasional crash but rather its anti-customer DRM scheme. (That was a serious misstep BETHESDA, I was disappointed). Having to activate your game OnLine means that you never actually own the game you paid for at full price. If this does not concern you, well, you can now make an informed decision either way.RECOMMENDED.(But let's hope the hand dealt initially is improved).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2010"}

It's hard not to compare this to Grand Theft Auto for obvious reasons.  It's too bad the controls of different cars weren't as smooth as GTA's.  Lots of times it feels like you're sliding instead of rolling.  The only other gripe I have is that stupid dragon boss fight.  I didn't see any sense in adding this &quot;horror&quot; feature to a &quot;shooter&quot; game.  These two quirks prevented me from giving it 5 stars.  Surprisingly, I did enjoy the fighting scenes.  I stay away from fighting games because I am no good at them and they just don't interest me, but this game made it easy.  Although I did not learn all of the special finishing moves, the three I did know got me through it.  Upgrading your fighting, driving, and shooting skills got tougher, but the challenge was fair.The city is HUGE, bigger than any other map I've played in a game, except maybe &quot;The Getaway&quot;.

{"product_name":"B0001NBNGG","description":"The creepy tale of a possessed Japanese village (Hanuda) told through the eyes of ten playable characters in combination with some impressively innovative gameplay&nbsp;features should totally make my day&nbsp;&#8211; but playing Siren turns out to be sadly different than I was expecting.The game's two big features: sightjacking (where you see through the eyes of other characters) and the Link Navigator (which manages the plot's order of events) sadly don't add to the player's experience enough to justify their problematic existence.Sightjacking is more fun to mess around with than it is helpful to the player. Watching the paths of roaming enemies can offer useful information, but the stealth mechanic is so simplistic that the data is rarely necessary. In many situations, being seen by enemies is something that you can't avoid or recover from &#8211; they will find you, and they will kill you. This is fine by me, but when the only stealth-orientated skill that is offered is a painfully slow crawl (and a distracting yell, which had little to no effect that I could perceive), it doesn't make me want to be all that sneaky. There isn't a sound meter, no real way to know if enemies can see you or not (like a vision cone or shadow meter), and very little chance of distracting them with diversions. It is more fun and more efficient to just run through levels and see what happens than to use the sightjacking feature to suss out a plan of attack.Which leads to discussion of the game's other big feature, the Link Navigator. Siren's storytelling plan sounds like a survival horror Real World season: Pick 10 characters to escape the apocalypse and find out what happens over 3 days through 78 missions &#8211; you could call it Siren: Hanuda. The complication is that the order of events is jumbled and the Link Navigator is supposed to help you keep track. What this means, from a player's point of view, is that the game's story doesn't really get its hook into you &#8211; not even in the first few hours. The tales are too disjointed, the characters too many, and the plot too slow in getting going.The more conventional aspects of this game like sound design and graphics are also something that people will have mixed feelings about. The creatures' insane, maniacal laughs are honestly unnerving, and therefore good for this game. The graphics look to be actual pictures of the characters' faces and lend a realistic, but still skewed version of each person &#8211; they're detailed, but strangely flat. I think that this is a nice subtle touch, but others may disagree.I really, really wanted to like Siren, but in the end, I just didn't have much fun or feel like the innovative parts of the game were used to their advantage. It has good ideas, and I'm glad to see experimentation in survival horror, but this should be chalked up as a failed test in the genre.Concept:Navigate a horrific village as ten different charactersGraphics:Muddy and jerky&#xC2;&#xA0;&#8211; but it fits with the disjointed feel of the gameplaySound:The best part of this game, the sound effects are creepy and (for lack of a better word) ickyPlayability:The context-sensitive menu system is&#xC2;&#xA0;counter-intuitive and the stealth mechanics are pretty archaic and basicEntertainment:I really need a reason to care in a game this cerebral and slow-paced, and Siren doesn't give it to meReplay:ModerateRated:6.25 out of 10Editor:Lisa MasonIssue:May 20042nd Opinion:From a conceptual standpoint, Siren is chock-full of ingenuity, and is a soaring success when it comes to the delivery of unusual ideas. Forming a mental bond with your attackers so that you see the surroundings from their perspective is a great idea that leads to some unnerving situations. This gimmick only goes so far, however. I found its functionality, and the entire gameplay package for that matter, to be clunky, and above all, frustrating. I grew so disenchanted with trying to pick up enemy sight that I avoided using this technique whenever I could. I love the episodic approach to storytelling &#8211; but the execution of gameplay bothered me to no end.Rated:5.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Michael J. Covino","summary":"Another Horror Masterpiece","reviewText":"Created by the developers of the original Silent Hill, Siren is a survival horror game that many fans of the genre have been waiting for. With Resident Evil looking more and more like an action game, and with Silent Hill suffering from a new staff that wants to recreate the series entirely--gamers needed a game to bring us back to the roots and the very basic guidelines of survival horror. Siren not only satiates this need, it also introduces some unique features that have rarely been tried before, making it a traditional survival horror with a lot of experimental attributes, or vexations, depending on who you ask.The story is this game's biggest masterstroke, having many similarities with Silent Hill. Instead of an American New England Town being consumed by iniquity, in Siren it is a remote Japanese village, populated by a country people who adhere to a strange occult. Also much like Silent Hill, the game utilizes the sound of the old fire sirens used in the 'Second Red Scare', except in this game, the siren is not a mechanical devise, but an inhuman call from across a sea of blood, whom the villagers answer, and return anew, in another form cleansed of human stain, after receiving the blessings of their God. Typically a village nestled in the mountains, it is sucked into another dimension where the blood of the King of Gods flows, giving the inhabitants eternal life. Some meet the call willingly, while others resist it, wanting to remain human, and you play as the village renegades, or as the characters who are not true inhabitants of the village.Gameplay is somewhat lacking. Although you play as many different characters, with engaging storylines for each, you visit the same locations throughout the game numerous times, only as a different person with different objectives. Most objectives are simply to survive. Often characters have no weapons, and they must use the sightjack ability, which allows them to see through the eyes of any given enemy within the proximity, to help you determine where the enemy patrols and your best route to sneak around them. You can also divert the attention of enemies elsewhere by making sounds, setting off alarms and so forth. Sometimes characters find weapons, but these missions require a lot of sightjacking and sneaking around too, since the enemy often has weapons and will see you and shoot you before you even know you've been spotted.Missions require a lot of trial and error in order to complete, which makes this game an acquired taste. Furthermore, the game does not play in chronological order, which makes for a much distorted gaming experience. For example, you play future events before the past events have occurred, and sometimes find yourself playing characters that got killed. That's like starting a book in the middle, and reading the ending before you read the beginning. Another aggravating aspect to the game is that in order to advance and open up new levels, you must revert to levels you have already played, but attempt to do something differently. For instance, instead of finding a route of escape, you must locate a hidden item somewhere in the stage.Because of these hindrances, you will not understand the game's story the first time you beat it, and will be fairly confused. I would have abandoned this game entirely if it were not for the `Level Select' feature, which is automatically unlocked after so many missions have been completed. I have enjoyed this game thoroughly after having unlocked every stage, and have replayed it many times selecting the missions in chronological order. It truly has a wonderful, imaginative, creepy, and downright DISTURBING storyline.Cold blooded murder. Two suicides. Being hunted by friends or relatives that are no longer human. Occultism. Children in peril. Human sacrifice. Separate plains of existences. Alien Gods.Horror enthusiasts will love this stuff. The IGN website provides a great picture walkthrough for this game that will help you through the really tough missions.Graphics are moderate. They used the faces of real actors and superimposed them on the pixilated bodies. The movie scenes looked like those real old hand-drawn cartoons where all the images are jumpy and jerk around a lot. I liked it personally. It gave the game an antique feeling, like I was watching an old reel of film. The actual gameplay world is not like this, and is realistic enough. It looks better than the first Silent Hill game, but probably not as good as Silent Hill 2.I can only hope Siren 2 comes to the United States.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2005"}

This has to be the most hyped game this year, heck in the history of video games, and boy, does this game live up to the hype.  The Story line goes like this, after the events of Luigi's Mansion(another great Mario game) Mario goes on a well deserved vacation with peach and the Toads.  When he arrives he almost crashes.  They land in this goop.  They se a sihhloette(how ever you spell that) of Mario.  Mario goes to court and is convicted(the video is really funny) and Mario is sentenced to jail.  The people say that he must clean up the mess to be able to leave the island.  But cleaning isn't all you do.  You use FLUDD, the water pack, to bash enemies away.  You have awesome jumps, icluding side jumps, double jumps, and more.  The game is long(I still havent beat it and I'm a pretty good gamer.  It will take you about 100 hours(seriously) to collect all the shine sprites.  The game is also really challenging.  That's not all.There are many awesome levels.  Each level has 8 episodes.  They each have another shine sprite.  And Yoshi returns,(though I haven't made it to him yet.  He can eat fruit and spit out the juice to kill enemies.  You know the water Pack FLUDD.  He isn't just a water pack, he's a robot and can talk.  There are four nozzles.  You star out with the first two(hover and squirt)  I haven't made it to the other nozzles yet.  FLUDD makes the game really fun.  And oh yeah, to get into levels you have to take these portels that are shaped like an M. The main place where you teleport to the levels is Delfino Square.  The game is really complex and fun.  The bosses are extremely fun to try to beat.  They are challenging, but not unfair, like other games.  With all of Mario's moves, it makes it all the funner.  The first bosses are sludge monsters.  They are easy, but as the game progresses you meat togher, more complex bosses.The controlls are wonderful.  They are very similar to Luigi's Mansion.  R button is to squirt Water X is to switch nozzles.  Y is to switch to the Mario cam. A is to jump, C stick, to change view, and the controll stick is to controll Mario of course.  The camera isn't as bad as people ay it is.  The camera isn't the greatest in the world but it cuts the mustard.  The enemies are very cute.  Most of them are new to the MArio universe, like sludge blobs, electric koopas, etc.  There are also new allies.  The fat piantas, and the cute turtle like Nokis.  You can also talk to Toads and the princess for hints.  You can also spray and clean off allies.  And just like Luigi's Mansio, almost everythings interactive.  You can touch anything, talk to anyone.The cute colorful graphics are beautiful.  The tectures aren't as good as in Luigi's Mansion, but I love the color.  Hey, Mario's known for color.  Some people give Mario a hard time by saying the graphics are immature, they are beautiful.  Mario Sunshine's visuals are pure eye candy.  The visuals are extra great on cut scenes.  So I hope you liked my review.  Mario Sunshine is a beautiful, fun, challenging adventure.  It will take a GIANT amount of time to collect all of the Shine Sprites.  This game easily can beat any game on the Xbox or PS2.  I can't wait to play after I finish this review.  So if you have a Gamecube, there's no reason not to order this game now.  Shigeru Miyamato is genuis, MArio Sunshie's a masterpiece!  BUY THIS GAME NOW, YOU WON'T REGRET IT AT ALL!!!!!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2002"}

It also brings back memories when my friends and i were excited when we had this game on the nintendo. Which is very weird now that we stayed up all night playing it trying to get further. But i even thought the graphics were good back then when i played it, well i was not that old either. It was in the late 90s when it came out. Anyways it has good graphics for the snes and a good story. The story is like the older zelda games, do this first, beat it, then you get this.....Yes but it never gets old. As you beat the first part which is the castle, you have to find the villige elder and then he tells you to collect each of the four pendents as you go on, after you collect all of them, you can recieve the mighty MASTER SWORD!!! whoooo! now lets get some hearts. Soon you will be able to get to places that you havent been able to access before because each castle you beat, you get a new weapon or tool to use to beat the next part. One of those wonderful tools is the magic mirror that trasports you from the light world that you are at to the dark world. Which is pretty much the same as the light world but evil has taken over and it looks all destroyed and forsaken. Now this is where you free the princesses and retrieve the crystals. As soon as you get all of them you can battle gannon which is the hardest part and battle of the game then you will rescue the last but not least loved zelda. That is pretty much the story line with the main parts and battles. Each castle has a different boss in each world and it gets harder. Remember to go back and forth between both worlds to collect and get items you couldent recieve before. Very good but VERY hard game. I would get it considering that it is the only zelda game on the snes, which makes me wonder why? All other nintendo's have a sequal to each zelda becides this. It would have been a great game though. Hell, the gamecube even has five zelda games. So be happy with this one because it is a great classic and the last zelda that has a (top view) feature unstead of in third person that you will find in the newer ones. Very hard but very good game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2009"}

I had a Genesis growing up (in fact, I still do up in the attic somewhere) and I have a lot of great memories of playing some of the games on this disc.Although they do feel dated now, and aren't nearly as fun as they used to be, this is to be expected. And I'm sure most of the people buying this game are doing so for largely nostalgic purposes, such as myself.The one thing that REALLY frustrates me is the game selection on these. I have to imagine on a BluRay disc they could fit about as many 16-bit games as they wanted to, and yet they don't include every Sega produced game for the system. Everyone has their favorites, and for many people perhaps this disc contains all of them. For me, I am VERY saddened by the loss of Sword of Vermillion (a great old RPG that WAS on the PS2 Sega collection but was left off of this one) and the Toe Jam & Earl games.What makes it even WORSE, is that even though they left off these games which to me are essential Genesis games, they include absolute crap like Flicky, Fatal Labyrinth, and Bonanza Bros.

This isn't a game of stealth or strategy. You see, you shoot, you move on.There is a plot here - but it's really best to ignore it. You, a young teen guy, are battling either ice monsters or other clans of pirates. Sometimes you fight both simultaneously. Missions in essence tell you - \"go here, kill everything\".Part of the fun is that you get to fight both on foot and inside a mech, hopping in and out whenever the whim takes you. This gives you a nice variety of weapons to choose from. Now, I have to comment that for a space-age distant planet colony, these weapons seem pretty modern times. You would think they would have progressed to laser cannons and plasma rifles as their sole weapons by now. I do like the grapple hook, though. It gave a fun, Zelda-like aspect to many of the levels.To add to the arcadey feel, your health naturally depletes over time and the only way to stay alive is to collect replenishing energy. Silly? Perhaps. But no more silly than most other arcade games and the reasons they give for you to collect objects.What's really impressive here is the way that large enemies seem \"massive\". You really get the sense that these are giant, ponderous beasts with weight and heft. The designers did a good job with enemy design and boss battles. From the small, intricate flying beasties to the larger main enemies, each creature is enjoyable to fight.  Speaking of Zelda, you even get Goron-like rolling rock monsters.But, to diverge into the storyline for a brief moment, isn't it a bit troubling that man-kind has decided to land on a super-snowy (i.e. not ideal) planet - and when it found indigenous life there - decided that the appropriate action was therefore to wipe it all out? Surely if we're going to be on a hostile-environment planet anyway, we could find one without current inhabitants ...I also wish they had in-home multiplayer. Playing online on XBox Live is all fine and good, but with the relatively short built in missions, I'd really like to play co-op with a friend against them, and crank it up to super hard. That would be a ton of fun. I love playing this type of game multiplayer co-op, and for them to not even have that as an option seems a great shame.So a nice start - but I'd like to see a Lost Planet 2 with a better plotline, better weapons, and co-op play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2007"}

Soatthiamroong","summary":"One serious flaw bashes this game down to 3 stars *** Please Read before Playing ***","reviewText":"The core gameplay doesn't change much and there's nothing wrong with it. They've added some new moves and mini-games. That's a nice touch. Multi-player froze my console once, so I didn't get my hands on it much.The controls can be clunky and annoying, especially the target locking. You'll mess up quite a lot of your quick or stealth kills because of it. You might feel like you're getting old and clumsy along with Ezio. For me, that strangely adds the feeling to the game, though it gets me upset sometimes.However, one SERIOUS flaw that bashes this game down to 3 stars is that there's a loop hole which makes you stuck and can't progress pass the Memory Sequence 3 - Guild Contracts mission in a single player mode.In this Memory Sequence, the game will force you to send one assassin on a mission as a part of a tutorial. If you play only the main story missions up to this point, there's no problem. You'll have a Level-11 assassin to send on a contract mission (the pigeon coup thing, as in AC: Brotherhood) as required.BUT, as I had spent 12+ hours before this mission to open the map, set up shops, fight for territories, and order my assassins around, that made the level of my assassins go up to Level 12. The Guild Contracts mission didn't acknowledge my assassins since they were one level too high. (Yeah, sorry, your men are too strong. They'll fail the mission.) And once you interact with a Pigeon Coup, the game doesn't let you back out until you finish this tutorial.That means, if you don't have an EXACT Level-11 assassin, you'll get stuck in an infinite loop, AKA Limbo.I tried look up a solution on the internet. Sadly, none of them worked for me.Quitting to-and-fro Animus Island didn't do anything.I couldn't recruit any new low-level assassin since I had captured all the Templar Dens and did the Den Defense mini-games to a high level already.I had waited for the Templar to re-capture the Dens, but no luck either.* EDIT * The assassin recruiting chance never occurred again.Finally, after hours of trials and errors, I had to give up, throw away my 12-hour work, and start over a new game.Dear Ubisoft,WHAT KIND OF AN OPEN-WORLD GAME DOESN'T LET YOU DO THINGS AT YOUR OWN PACE !?!?!?I like to do side quests first, until my characters are quite loaded, then I do story missions. Is that too much to ask from a sand-box game? NO !!!And I know it's not any harder to make the game check for A RANGE of levels instead of an EXACT specific level.I normally get very (un)lucky with discovering bugs, glitches, and loop holes so often in games. I jumped through collisions (invisible walls) many times in the past Assassin's Creeds. Didn't bother me one bit. I know that a high degree of freedom comes with bugs and glitches.But this one game punishes you with Limbo for getting too far ahead before the game let you. What the hell !?!?Dear Ubisoft,This is the nastiest mistake since your infamous online-authenticity-checking system. PLEASE FIRE THE PROGRAMMER(s) RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.In conclusion:Revelations offers some new good stuff (I like Den Defense a lot, actually). But with a serious flaw like this, it deserves only 3 stars.I know that if you're already an AC fan, you'll buy it anyway. So be warned and hope you have a better luck with it than me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000084318","reviewerName":"The Duck of Indeed","summary":"Don't Avoid Because of the Graphics","reviewText":"\"Wind Waker\" is a good game, but it has some differences from other \"Zelda\" games that I slightly dislike, so let's get that out of the way.  For one thing, the game has bright cartoony graphics, which are fine, but I never liked them myself.  It's too cartoony for my tastes.  Also, instead of Hyrule Field or whatever other land-based world the other games have, this game takes place on various islands in a huge ocean.  I found the ocean to be a bit boring, and it can take a long time to get places before you can warp.But anyway, let's get to the real review.  The game starts off on Link's home of Outset Island, where a huge bird accidentally drops a pirate woman named Tetra onto the island and then takes Link's sister, Aryll, instead.  Link decides to leave his home and find his sister, and the adventure begins.  Little does Link know that a much greater adventure awaits him, involving the pirates, a talking boat named the King of Red Lions, and a secret beneath the ocean....  The game is named after the baton Link gets fairly early on, used for changing the direction of the wind, changing from day to night, and other things.Along with a pretty good story (better than other \"Zelda\" games, I think), the game is pretty fun.  There are seven dungeons, and some are pretty good, especially two later on where you have another character to help you through it, which doesn't seem to have been done in any other \"Zelda\" game I have.  And to make up for the boring ocean, there are a total of 49 islands, some more interesting than others, to explore.  Some of these islands have puzzles of their own to solve, and there are many things to collect.  Not just heart pieces, but many sea charts, some for finding treasure and some for other purposes, such as allowing you to find and board the mysterious ghost ship.  In fact, this game has a good amount of things to keep you busy.I thought a couple other things were worth mentioning before I wrap things up.  For one thing, once you get a color camera, you can bring photos of characters, enemies, animals, etc. to a certain man for figurines.  There are a whole bunch of figurines you can collect, and each comes with the name of the person, animal, whatever, plus a short description.  It can be fun trying to get all of them.  Also, you can use the Tingle Tuner in the game and connect a Game Boy Advance to the GameCube for a few extras.  Nothing that exciting, but you may as well check it out if you are able.So I may have a few silly issues with the game, but it is still a great game that is a lot of fun, with good dungeons, a good story, and a lot of extras.  It's nice to have a game that will keep me busy for more than a couple weeks.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-22-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00DC7G2W8","reviewerName":"J. Van Wagenen","summary":"A mostly positive, slightly disappointed review from a long-time MK fan","reviewText":"There is a lot of new stuff - good and bad - Mario Kart 8 brings to the series. Having played every Mario Kart game since the SNES, I was really excited for this one. And I'm still mostly still thrilled about it, though I'm disappointed they decided to make some very bad decisions that took away what would have otherwise been a perfect game.What I love:[+] Graphics. FINALLY we get some HD Mario Kart action! It was always so hard playing the AAA first-party titles on the Wii, since they decided against going with the coming HD era. MK Wii was a lot of fun and a great game, but looked terrible on my 55\" HDTV. Mario Kart 8 on the other hand looks absolutely gorgeous.[+] The audio. I love all the music, especially the title screen theme which pulls inspiration from the original Super Mario Kart theme, which has a great nostalgia factor to it. All the music tracks and sound effects sound great, especially in 5.1 surround, and helps you become very immersed in the game.[+] Online. Much improved since Mario Kart Wii, probably one of the most fun parts of the game. However, Nintendo still has a long way to go to catch up to the standard online functionality of any modern Xbox or PlayStation game.[+] New items. I like the new boomerang, and I *love* the Super Horn (can destroy blue shells or any other projectile item). That said, I *hate* the coins. I like them as a gameplay mechanic, and as something you can pick up directly from the course, but not as an item box item. Half the time when you're in first place you'll just get coins, rather than at least a green shell or something that can defend you against attacks.[+] Tracks. They of course did an awesome job at creating new tracks as well as adapting the retro tracks for MK8. You have a lot of variety, from underwater, to space, to the Sugar Rush track from Wreck-it Ralph (okay, it's not officially from there but it's close enough). And I appreciate that in standard Mario Kart fashion, they included several shortcuts across the maps to mix it up a bit.[+] The highlight reel. It's always fun to take a look at the \"highlights\" of the race and play back in slow motion the point where you destroyed your friend with a red shell. And the fact that you can save 6 of your favorites to go back to at any time is also pretty cool.[+] Collectible stamps. Adds another layer of replayability to collect all 90 stamps in the game. These can be used in your optional Miiverse posts. But for OCD people like me who just like to 100% the game, they present an extra challenge (requires beating the GPs with each character and beating the staff ghosts on all Time Trial courses).What I don't like:[-] Default option after the race ends. Instead of mashing A at the end of the race like you're used to, you have to train yourself to take a chill pill and wait for the post-race menu to come up, press down first, then A. Because the default option is to go to the highlight reel instead of starting the next race. A very small nitpick, but still something that slightly bothers me.[-] No overall screen to view game progress. If you've ever played Super Mario 3D World, you'll know what I'm talking about because that game did it better than any other game I've seen before. They had a menu in there that listed out the status of *everything* in the game that you've done, so you have a one-stop place to see how far you are to 100%ing the game. Even MK Wii had a little Driver License menu that showed all your cups beaten, which characters/tracks you use the most, and other various statistics. There is nothing of the sort in MK8 unfortunately. They need to just add a single screen that shows your cup progress, character unlock progress, vehicles/tires/parachutes unlocked progress, stamps collected, staff ghosts beaten, and general offline/online gameplay stats.[-] No post-GP award ceremony. Even though it was only like 15 seconds long and most of the time you skipped it, it was still always fun to see the results of your grand prix in an interesting way. These have been around in every other MK game. In MK8, instead of an award ceremony, it just plays back a few clips of you driving around the courses and shows you your trophy. Boring. It almost makes it feel pointless to spend four races competing but then not get too see the top three winners being rewarded accordingly. Instead it's just: Race over, here's a rotating trophy, back to main menu now.[-] Missing characters. I like that they have 30 characters now, which is more than any other MK game. But they shouldn't have done that at the expense of so many other awesome characters that were previously playable. Because in MK8, FIVE of them are baby characters, and SEVEN of them are the various Bowser Castle bosses (like Iggy, Wendy, etc). And then out of nowhere they also added \"Pink Gold Peach\" who is basically a Pink version of Metal Mario? No idea where that came from. So we have 3 Peach characters (normal, baby, pink gold). And I appreciate the sheer number of characters, but there are so many better ones they could have brought back from previous games, such as: Birdo, Dry Bones, Dry Bowser, Diddy Kong, Funky Kong, King Boo, Paratroopa, Petey Piranha, etc.[-] BATTLE MODE! This is really the big one, the only negative that is really worth deducting a full star for. Battle mode, which was probably my favorite mode in the past, is now useless. Rather than epic arena maps we're used to, like Skyscraper, Big Donut, etc., you can only do battle mode on the normal race tracks. Translation: Completely un-fun. You drive around in circles around the track, take forever to find someone, and when you finally do, they're driving the opposite direction so you have half a second to react. Then you wait again for someone else. You simply can't have a decent battle on a track designed for racing. They are too big, too narrow, and too linear. Please bring back arena maps, Nintendo! I will happily purchase a $10 DLC pack to add these back!Conclusion:I love MK8, easily a must-buy game if you have a Wii U. But why oh why did they have to ruin battle mode? Luckily, I haven't lost all hope yet, since just about everything in my cons list could potentially be fixed through downloadable updates. But will it ever happen? Guess we'll just keep our fingers crossed...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2014"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J6DC","description":"","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"Castlevania, welcome to the 21st century","reviewText":"I grew up with the old NES and SNES titles, and the last Playstation title I played was Symphony of the Night. This game rolls them all up and smokes them. The graphics are obscenely rich, the combat is intense, and the voice-acting is superb. Robert Carlyle and Patrick Stewart bring just the right amount of gentlemanly angst to the game. It's fantastic.The storyline is very neat. There's a subtext of powers - both holy and unholy - granted to soldiers of the Church that came before Gabriel. In great Castlevania fanfare, Gebriel gathers relics that boost his powers as he learns new moves and acquires subweapons. The subweapons are a bit of a departure as Gabriel can switch between any of 4. The amount of each subweapon Gabriel can carry can be increased by finding the right items, although they're still quite limited. You'll find that you run out of them quickly, and aside from the silver daggers most of them aren't really worth being used whenever they can actually render an effect on an enemy.One of the best parts of the game is the challenges. A lot of the early challenges are really easy, like killing a certain number of a certain type of monster in a stage. But a lot of the later ones - especially the defeating the titans within the time limit - require thought and skill. I'm a completionist, and you get an achievement for each chapter for making it through all the stages, clearing each stage's challenge, and then a difficulty achievement. This makes the achievements stack up at regular intervals, unlike most other games where you can get all but the highest difficulty achievement on the first playthrough then need to make another one just to get that one last bit of gamer score. The challenges give you a constant goal to work toward.The difficulties in this one aren't that bad, either. Paladin difficulty is locked until you beat every stage on Knight, so I played through my first time on that setting. If a stage was too hard, I switched down to Warrior, doing it over again immediately on Knight so I wasn't bored with a full playthrough later. When you open Paladin, it doesn't reset the game so you can you can just bump the difficulty and play through any stage you want with all your abilities in tact. I started from the beginning and ran through in a single sitting in about 3 1/2 hours. By the time I got to the final boss I was on fire and beat him in about 5 seconds flat (spoiler: it's really easy once you realize that your power meters charge up constantly during the fight... just switch back and forth between the two ultimate powers as they each run out, letting the other one recharge... this pummels the boss in a hurry, even on Paladin, and then you just run through his rings when he drops for the final strike... piece of cake). It was a very satisfying achievement to earn, especially for a completionist like myself.The only thing that's disappointing is the DLC. The interludes are fly-by stills rather than full animations like the original game, leaving a bitter taste of rushed-to-market cheaping-out. Also, I don't recall there being much - if any - voice acting in the final DLC. It was just one long battle that was pretty much anticlimactic.Overall, this is a great game. It's a dark, modern take on Castlevania that takes full advantage of the power of current gaming platforms. I'm really looking forward to the sequel.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2012"}

This game is a mixture of Uncharted, Asuras Wrath(timing), and god of war with the upgrades and combos. Controls are very easy to get used. Great storyline!! Only thing that really annoyed me is ending, which is great, however, you need to play the DLC to find out some important things! this game is 12 chapters long which is about 15 hours. There are two dlc's which are one chapter each.  you have to play the first dlc to understand the ending of the main game .

{"product_name":"B002I0J6DC","description":"","reviewerName":"The Bigmac","summary":"One of the best PS3 games out there. (Wish it had more vampires thou).","reviewText":"This game was absolutely amazing to play. It took me more than 20 hours to beat which is a rare thing nowadays since most games these days can be beat in under 8 hours.Graphics: The graphics in this game are simply gorgeous. A thing to behold. The level of detail in the scenery, backgrounds and character models is exquisite. Almost hypnotic.Sound: The sound effects are awesome and the surround sound in your home theater will definitely use those to enhance the game experience but something that really stands out in this game is the score. It's simply beautiful. Reminded me a lot of the score in The Lord of the Rings movies. The voice acting includes talents like Patrick Stewart and Robert Carlyle and it was definitely Pitch Perfect. Some of the cut scenes are so gorgeous and perfectly acted you find yourself wishing somebody would make this into a full length feature movie.Gameplay and Story: The combat in the game is a blast. It's fun to land combos on your enemies and the platforming and climbing is also a lot of fun. However, one of my only gripes with the game is that you only spend 1 third of the game fighting vampires (Which was definitely my favorite part and the aspect of the game I was looking forward to the most when I picked it up) and the other 2 thirds of the game are spent in very bright and lush locales that are normally not part of Castlevania games. For instance, The fist third of the game pits you against Titans, which in order you bring down you must climb in a very specific way, reminiscent of games like Shadow of the Colossus, which I'm sure some people found fun to play but to me was almost like a chore I had to go through in order to get to the vampire part. The Titan sections are also filled with a bit of frustration and repetition since they're very unforgiving and at the very first mistake you make, you'll be knocked off the Titan's back and forced to start over.Other parts of the game have you fighting against werewolves which was definitely fun, and other unlikely creatures like living scarecrows and mischievous Chupacabras for instance.  It was OK, but definitely not as fun as the vampire parts. In my opinion, roaming the corridors of a dark and mysterious castle searching for succubus, vampires and creatures of the Night is infinitely more fun and engaging that fighting scarecrows or titans in bright daylight or chasing Chupacabras cross country.But I'm definitely nitpicking here, since even with those sections, the game is way better than many five star games that are released nowadays, and that are only 5 or 6 hours long. The way I see it, I got to fight vampires for 6 or 7 hours in the vampire section of the game, which had it been released as a standalone game, in on itself would have been enough for me to rate this game 5 stars. All the rest was a bonus.The awesome gameplay, power upgrades, incredible graphics and production values of the game along with one of the most awesome endings I have ever seen in a videogame, more than make up for any dull sections. I can not talk about the ending without spoiling the story, but I'll just say that once you see it, all the daylight fighting, Titan climbing and cross country adventuring will kind of make sense and the stage will be set for the sequel which after the mindblowing twist that the ending of this game provided, has to be the game sequel I'm definitely looking forward the most to be released since I have memory (And which by the way is already confirmed and in production).Some people will hate the ending since being this a reboot of the Castlevania series, it probably won't match with many aspects of traditional Castlevania cannon but I'll just say if this is a reboot it's probably the most awesome reboot of a game series I have ever witnessed.Bottom line, this is one of the best games of this generation and it definitely deserves to be tried by both newcomers and veterans of the Castlevania series. 5 stars all the way.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2010"}

It is a very cool feature to be able to use the plasmids etc to fight and make your way thru the game. Even the camera concept was clever. I hacked nearly everything and used all of the plasmids one time or another just because it was cool experimenting with different ways of battling something.I spent at least 25 hours playing it -- I could not wait to sit down each night and play.

One the aiming method is extremely difficult and frustrating.  It takes lots of practice and even then you will still miss a lot.  GTA 3 has brought back the old style of Metal Gear Solid one where you can't really see what your aiming at.  Now hopefully they will take a page out of Konami's book and put in first person aiming for all weapons in the next installment.  The other problem I have with this game is that you can survive harowing car crashes, bloody fist fights, gun shot wounds, and explosions but your guy can't swim.  Quite possibly the dumbest part of the game can be when your trying to get in a boat and you fall in the water and bam your dead.  Give me a break.  In a game where you can pick up prostitutes and then rob them after some business you'd think you would know how to at least doggy paddle.

When you see the monster cockroaches, they will make your skin crawl! Can we say RPG of the year?I do like the VATS targeting system which allows you target specific parts of your enemy  and take it out and the resulting cutscene that appaers as you perform the move.As I saw mentioned elsewhere, I do like the fact that as you play, you start to feel a bit attached to some of the characters.  Early on, My bully needed help for his mom being attacked by roaches and depending on your moral compass, you can tell him to buzz off or do it, either way you won't be disappointed on how the game reacts to your decision.In another section, someone wanted to me to do something that would have the end result of destroying an entire community so that his company could 'gentrify' the area.  I went to those in charge and told them what's going on...unfortunatley the end result made that person's child an orphan and made me sad, part of it had to do with the fact that it was a murder in cold blood and I made a hot headed choice because that character was so helpful early on...and now you don't have them anymore and it kind of makes you feel that everything good in life that happened since you woke up that morning to see all that good brutally taken from you break you  peice by peice inside.I also (dis)liked that there are people in this game that will try to hustle you, play you and just out and out lie...and this is just the first town wait til you get to the 2nd one!now mind you, for every deed that you do, good or bad you get \"Karma\" points so play wisely....LOL.And this is diferent than Fable II...in that game, I don't feel that same level of attachment for my characters like I do here, as a matter of fact, sometimes I feel more like being obnoxious with some fo them just to see what happens.The quest system is about the same as Oblivion and similar to that game, you have to pick your battles.I don't have that many complaints except  to say that I wish there was a little more scrpiting for the AI at some story points because it seems like if you do something to finish it, it's kind of done and there should be more...And maybe I have gotten spoiled by GoW and GTA IV, but now I feel that games featuring combat shooting systems should have some kind of cover system in it....heh!I haven't progressed too far, and maybe it does further down the line, but from what I have seen and what most of us have seen in sci fi movies like this, I kind of wish that the wilderness would get 'more dangerous' after sunset. You know...for a real challenge if you want to get from point a to point b, once the sunsets the monsters are more powerful or their numbers are greater.But really my complaint list is very short.The sounds are cool especially on a great surround system especially metal on metal door openings which can be grating on the nerves but fits right in this game.So far I would say that I wish I had more hands so I could give it 4 thumbs up! 2 will be suffice so, get this game and enjoy it...if you are going to be too distracted with GoW2 or COD 5, get this game and let it set for a bit because once you play, you will be sucked in!PS Look for the 2 headed cow early on....lol","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2008"}
{"product_name":"B004NRN5EO","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"Andrew \"Andrew\"","summary":"Different from what I expected","reviewText":"I just got this game recently, a year after release, and despite all the reviews, videos and discussions I was surprised at the basic play mechanics of this game.  I am going about this review from a casual gamer point of view; I usually prefer quick pick up and play games, mainly sports games.What I was surprised about is how different the actual mechanics are from what I anticipated based on other reviews/videos, here's a quick summary of how this works after around 6 hours of playing (I'm only at the Undead Parrish).What this game comes down to is knowing that even though there are no designated levels, the journey between each bonfire acts as a level.  The game is open-environment, but through trial and error you'll quickly see that there is a \"suggested\" route (easier route) between each bonfire.  The bonfire is the check-point/save area.  What I was confused about based on the reviews was the item use, the most important being the healing flasks.  These healing drinks are not items you pick up on the battlefield, rather they are replenished to 5 every time you visit a bonfire (although it's possible to get more at specific bonfires through humanity, but that's not important for this review).  So basically the entire game as I'm playing through this is you start at a bonfire with full life and set number of flasks and you try to go to the next bonfire without dying (easier said than done).  So what usually happens is you grind the areas around the starting bonfire for souls (the EXP and monetary units in this game) by defeating the enemies that spawn every-time you rest at any bonfire.  When you feel you've gotten to a significantly powerful level, you will try to go all the way to the next bonfire.The positives of this game:- Despite not being pick up and play, this game is simply great fun.  The desire to reach the next bonfire will keep you entranced.- The controls are fluid and movement of the character has weight.  The rolling and dodging will not be as easy as pure action games, but it still puts you the gamer in full control.- The atmosphere is unforgettable.  The AI enemies who spot you will chase you till one of you is dead.  The larger knights that chase you gives off a \"thump thump\" stride until they start running and all you hear is a metallic engine right behind your caboose.- You always start with healing flasks so it's fair in that respect.- Enemies drop random goods and there's tons of secrets to find.The negatives:- The length of the routes between the bonfires, I anticipate, will only get longer, thereby requiring more memorization of the map (which the game does not supply for realism's sake, which I'm okay with)- The game does not reward full exploration, in this game the dead ends are literal.  Make one wrong turn and you'll often run into an enemy that it not meant to be defeated the first time, and exists only to tell you that the next time you reach the fork you should choose the other path.- With a lengthier slog between each bonfire, there are more forks in the road and more possible deaths, and therefore more restarts, so it's repetitive.All that being said, this game is repetitive, challenging and full of trial and error.  However, don't be fooled into thinking that the repetition is for naught. This game encourages patience and pacing, and even if you die any items you found still remain in your inventory.I'm happy I picked up this game and encourage others to experience this game as well, and at it's current price point there's no reason otherwise.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2012"}

Plenty to do.Sailing and high seas combat was awesome, I loved it!  Fighting a galleon while avoiding giant waves while fighting a cannon hurling fortress was Epic! Hey Bethesda, put some sailing in Elder Scrolls! And any future RPG should take note of how well it worked in this game.It is open world sand box. Very little loading, free roam exploration.It is a pirate game, with an assassin twist.The cons are that the graphics, while good, are not the best, and the combat is fairly repetitive. Also at some point, you leave the pirate flashback and travel into the future where you walk around an office. Who was like, &#34; hey, we have a great action game here, let's clog up the story and gameplay with the player walking around an office! How fun!&#34; Seriously, who thought that office work was more fun than swashbuckling on the high seas?However, like any sandbox game, if you bring your imagination, and can easily get lost on side missions you will have a blast.The storyline is ok, in my opinion it was unnecessarily fragmented.Multiplayer was different, with some unique game modes....they may be the norm for A. Creed games, dunno.Overall, I am very happy with this game, Ubi did a great job.Also, unlike EA's Battlefield 4, this game has very few bugs and crashes, and is playable!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2013"}

Its now available for $15 on Amazon which makes it a buy for anyone on the fence. This is a low budget but fun game. Its a game similar to X-men wolverine but lacks the finesse and polish of that game. The graphics are kinda old; circa 2002-2003 meaning they bought rights to an old engine to crank out a game quick.The combat doesn't have much flair except grab, punch. You can block with your shield but the best moves involve throwing the shield with RT or more precisely with LT. Typically, all you need to do is this - just spam RT or LT and avoid enemies even coming close to you. With this technique I've moved on to mission 4 without more than 3-4 enemies touching me. Most get dispatched quite easily from afar.Also, there are platform jumping elements based on quick button presses for perfect timing. And there are lots of goodies to collect from reels to statuettes to diaries to oddly - secret documents just casually thrown about every level.

Both are independent games, but when they're linked between two Game Boy Color consoles via the separately sold Game Link cable, players can share items, uncover story elements, and unlock hidden areas in each game.InOracle of Seasons, players help Link embark on a quest to recover the Essences of Nature. To do so, he must first find the Rod of Seasons, a magical item that lets Link transform the landscape into the season of his choice, helping him overcome obstacles and solve puzzles. Ricky the kangaroo, Moosh the winged bear, and Dimitri the dodongo accompany Link on this adventure.Using the Harp of Ages, Link must travel through time and space to save Nayru, the eponymous prophet inOracle of Ages, who's been kidnapped by the evil sorceress Veran. By learning new melodies to play on the harp, players will travel to the past and affect changes in the present to solve the game's varied puzzles.","reviewerName":"J. Sherman \"The Critic\"","summary":"Spring Cleaning","reviewText":"The following is in reference to the downloadable version of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons available from Nintendo's eShop for the 3DS system.Though I've yet to finish A Link to the Past for the GBA, I bought this and Oracle of Ages when they were on sale.  Now that I've finished Oracle of Seasons yesterday, the timing for this review couldn't be better.Released in 2001 by Nintendo, in association with Capcom, Oracle of Seasons offers the classic top-down action and puzzle-solving (more of the former, at least) that we've come to expect from the Zelda series.  Not much in the way of a plot, but the game's more straightforward that way (which happens to be right up my alley).  You're still fighting baddies and avoiding traps while hoarding items and upgrades, the most vital of which is the Rod of Seasons wielding the power to manipulate the environment to access new areas.  Spring brings flowers that you cut down to find items or use as a springboard.  Lakes dry up and Vines grow in the summertime to help you climb up cliffs.  Autumn leaves fall and cover up potholes.  The winter dries up trees, creates snowy hills and freezes lakes and rivers.  Another advantage to the fluctuating climate is that you can plant special seeds in the ground now so they can grow and bear some tasty fruit later.I can't say as much for the game's Magic Ring system.  Though an interesting concept on paper, one can survive most of the game without ever wearing a ring.  The only other drawback is that, as with most nonlinear titles, it can take so long to figure out the next step, that you'll probably stop caring by the time you reach Point B from Point A.Regardless, the whole experience was enough of a challenge without working your last nerve (much).  And it doesn't have to end here.  Though you can't actually link the Oracle games, an added password system allows the player to unlock extras from one game in the other, no matter which you complete first.  The replay value this feature provides, however, remains to be seen.This game is rated E for Everyone and features mild violence.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2013"}

They are all mainly arcade titles that you'll play for a few hours at a stretch and will most likely end up collecting dust after a week or two.  I did this with Child of Eden and I'm doing it with this game.  I may or may not finish either game and it doesn't really matter because of the arcadey nature of Kinect games.  But enough commentary, this game is fun for half hour stretches; any more and your arms will grow heavy.  You are essentially a puppeteer and the Gunstringer is your marionette.  Your left arm controls his movement as if he's hanging from strings, and your right arm is the gun.

The environmental have at minimum trebled in size, and the fine detail quality is undiminished. The views in the distance are gorgeous and disturbing for their realism. The views of the city and the atmospheric effects are dazzling, and the sheer size of the landscape you are able to interact with is also impressive.Sound: I dial the music to 20-30%, as any louder and it starts to drown out sounds of actual fighting. A great score, with good fade-in and fade-out, without leaving you with combat music for five minutes after the last enemy dies.Gameplay: Better AI, though still rather predictable. New tactics that you have to employ to defeat the groups sent against you. Grabbing a good piece of cover and blasting away, charging out to grab ammo and health doesn't fly anymore. The enemy uses better skills to dig you out if you try. Nice puzzles, if some are a little... odd (When you start hunting for equipment caches, you'll know what I mean. Hint: You'll have to ignore the voice in your head that says \"Dropping a grenade and then standing atop it is generally considered bad practice.\" at one point.)Story/Dialog: Prepare for flashbacks to Episode V of Star Wars. The vortigaunts make a major addition to the character cast, and their dialog is amusing and entertaining. Also, dialog is gaged on certain situations. Screw up a puzzle, and a vort or Alex will berate you for your recklessness, or compliment you for your intelligence and skill for great shooting, assisting them in combat, or solving a hard puzzle)All that said, if your not a fan of TF2 or Portal, wait for just Episode 2.

{"product_name":"B001D7T2VM","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A mix of Zelda and Metroid leads to repetitive boring segments","reviewText":"The Good: Zelda style puzzles are fun to solve, looks great, decent story, fluid combatThe Bad: Zelda puzzles are too frequent, story is hard to follow, could have looked better, gets redundant after about three hoursNorse mythology. That's what drew me to Darksiders, but don't just jump into this thinking it's a God of War clone. In fact its a mix of Zelda exploration and puzzle solving, and combat similar to God of War, but not as good or as epic. The story goes a little something along the lines of you playing as one of the four horsemen, War, who is chosen by the Council to find these broken seals and kill whoever did it to bring back Balance because the bad guys want all the realms aligned and made into one. The story is stretched thing between the long winded levels, and it never picks up until the last hour, but by then you have forgotten what has happened because there is little story between levels. It almost feels as if the story was an afterthought and Vigil just concentrated on the puzzles and combat.That being said there is a lot of puzzle solving in this game; almost more so than any other I have played. The game takes a lot of ideas from other games such as God of War, Zelda, and even Portal and puts it to good use. While the game isn't 100% original it does have is originality in certain areas. While starting with the combat its pretty simple. You start out with your Chaoseater sword which is mapped to the X button. Later on when you get the scythe you can map that and any other secondary weapon to Y, and your tools to RT. Combat moves can be purchased by using blue souls gained from killing enemies. There are power moves, and multiple combos you can pull off and its all fluid and fun to use so there's no problem there.You have a yellow Wrath meter which is War's \"special powers\", then you have have health shields which are bars of health. Some times when you weaken an enemy you can execute a kill move by pressing B (God of War anyone?), but no QTE (quick time events) are displayed. Instead you just watch War butcher the enemy. I love QTE's and would rather participate in the killing than just watching, but some people may prefer this. You can also ride your horse, Ruin, through the last 3/4 of the game and swinging your blade while on him kill demolish enemies.Now combat is neat and fluid I just wish there were QTE events and a more fixed cinematic camera, but after explaining the puzzle solving you'll see why it's a user controller camera. The puzzles are so frequent and so complicated that is drove me nuts. It was just puzzle, after puzzle, after puzzle and never ending. While this doesn't ruin the game it just feels more and more like Zelda with every hour that passes. You have free roaming world that are broken down into sections that you can warp to. You have to find tools such as a grappling hook, Mask of Shadows (to see hidden objects), and a portal gun (yeah ripped straight from Portal, but its a gauntlet instead of a gun), as well as a glaive (Dark Sector maybe?). As you discover each tool you use them to solve puzzles accordingly. The portal gauntlet is probably the most unique. There are orange circles plates that you can attack portals to, and if any Portal fans are reading this you know what happens. However, there are a few unique touches such as in the Black Throne area (mostly puzzles and hardly any combat) where you guide a beam from across a level though different room and solving those puzzles to allow the beam through more rooms. Yeah its a bit in depth and complicated, and don't fret because most puzzles are pretty easy to solve, but there were the few brain scratchers and resulted to a video walkthrough.A lot of the puzzles are pretty unique, but there are a few things thrown into the game that will surprise you such as the ride on the dragon, and using heavy guns that enemies drop. There is even a pistol that you can use in the game, but it kind of useless except for the boss in The Ashlands level, but other than that the pistol was pretty useless. There are just a lot of unique puzzles in the game, and they are pretty fun, but the fact that there are so many make the game redundant, and that's why it didn't score as high as I wanted it to be. The combat is pretty repetitive and there's nothing outrageous about the gore level, it's actually pretty mild; its nothing close to the gore in God of War III. The kill animations are pretty repetitive since there is only once per enemy, and even the enemies are recycled. While there may be about 6 or so different enemy types; they are just recycled with different \"costumes\" and are more powerful as you progress through the game.The boss are pretty epic, but they aren't too hard to beat. They repeat the same pattern over and over, and even the last boss is a pushover after you learn the strategy. The graphics are actually pretty nice. The character details are excellent, but the environments tend to be lacking. There is a lot of aliasing (jaggies) and I know the game could just look a whole lot better. This is also a game for people who like collecting since there is hidden crap all over the game, but I tend to not go searching for this stuff, since I'm not good at it, but its there for Zelda fanatics to find.Overall the game is worth a purchase, but people who want just the action should steer away since this game is very puzzle heavy, as in like Zelda type puzzles. The game gets very redundant after awhile, and only the hardcore will continue playing, but Zelda fans, and puzzle fans should check this out. You anywhere from 10-20 hours of gameplay depending on if you're a completionist or not. There's lots to love in this package, but a bit more flare would have been nice. Bottom line: This is an adventure game for men, not elves.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

There are a few main story missions where you have to stealth or eavesdrop that are a bit tedious, but that does not break the game. GTA V is small compared to this world. The map is great, it is fun and time well invested for entertainment. Pirates theme is a plus. This game is a masterpiece and a new classic. Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2014"}

Players can earn up to 20 weapons (including online and offline) with up to four levels of upgrades for most weapons, plus new high-tech gadgets to help them through their journey.After word spreads of Ratchet and Clank's recent conquest inRatchet & Clank: Going Commando, Clank finds himself recognized as an interstellar robot of mystery and intrigue after starring in his own television series, Secret Agent Clank. While Ratchet is dismayed by his new sidekick status, the feelings are put aside when the twosome is called together by the Galactic President to bring peace to the universe. They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise. This includes Helga, the robotic seductress; Big Al, a techno-geek with the ability to encrypt technology systems; and Skidd McMarxx, a former hoverboarding champ and pro slacker turned spy. Together with the Q-Force, Ratchet and Clank set off on another hilarious interstellar romp to uncover the schemes of the sinister Dr. Nefarious and keep the galaxy safe for organic life.The Starship Phoenix, headquarters for the Q-Force, is the flagship in the fight against Dr. Nefarious and serves as a key information hub. The Starship is also where players can expect to receive new missions and training, and purchase armor and weapons. In addition, players will gain access to new vehicles, like the Turbo Slider or Hovership, to compete in races and combat enemies in intense battlefield missions. Refined intuitive enemy artificial intelligence means non-playable characters behave more intelligently by gathering information about their environments and forthcoming attacks, ultimately providing the player with more challenging gameplay.The multiplayer gameplay featured inRatchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenalis naturally suited for both the offline and online universe because it includes the variety of weapons, gadgets, vehicles and gameplay made famous throughout the Ratchet & Clank franchise. For those who want to experience the split screen multiplayer capabilities, up to four players can play offline, while the multiplayer online mode accommodates up to eight players over a broadband connection. In addition, six new levels are introduced for online play, featuring several elements that encourage team-based activities in modes such as capturing an enemy's base. For example, destructible environment obstacles in battlefield environments create strategic gameplay decisions and general mayhem. Commandeering multiple vehicles further encourages strategic co-op gameplay by allowing players to work together as one person navigates the vehicle while the other works its weapon's arsenal.In order to promote community gameplay, voice communication is supported online via the USB headset (for PlayStation2), allowing players to communicate with fellow team members during online games, either in-game or in the main lobby. The lobby area features an online friends list, allowing players to be matched up based on their gameplay statistics and will offer the ability to select from a variety of player skins.","reviewerName":"Cumulonimbus Harpe \"samsmylife\"","summary":"Sounds Pretty Cool","reviewText":"Well the Ratchet & Clank series is the best.

Peach finally gets her very own game, and this time it's Mario that's in distress.Near the Mushroom Kingdom is the Vibe Island, which holds the Vibe Scepter.  Bowswer gets a hold of this scepter and manages to take the mushroom kingdom hostage.  The drawback, however, is that Peach is no where to be found as it turns out she was on a stroll at the time.  Mario, Luigi and several residents of the Mushroom Kingdom make fantastic hostages, though.  Playing as Peach, and using her talking umbrella, Perry, you'll go through a fantastic adventure to save your friends.Super Princess Peach has everything you could hope for in a platformer.  She can run and jump on enemies.  Just as well, she can use Perry for a number of tasks.  He can be used as a weapon, or to glide over distances.  Perry can also be a boat, a submarine, and many other things.  You can purchase other abilities and attributes for Perry at the Item Shop inbetween levels.Peach also has a set of her own abilities.  Her emotions.  You can use these emotions via the touch screen.  She has four different emotions.  Joy, Rage, Gloom and Calm.  Joy lets her float through the air, Rage causes her to erupt in flames and makes her heavy, Gloom causes her to cry and run fast, while Calm heals her.Her emotions (also known as vibe powers) are helpful for getting her through the games levels.  You'll come across puzzles as you trek through these levels causing you to use these emotions sooner or later.  It might take a moment, but you'll recognize when you need to use these emotions.  You'll have to destroy platforms, make plants grow and more.Each level also has a boss at the end of it.  If you can't figure out what to do the game will give you some hints.  These boss battles aren't particularly hard, though, and shouldn't take too much of the veteran gamer's time.This is exactly where Super Princess Peach falls short.  The difficulty.  It's not a hard game.  This may not seem like much, but compared to earlier Mario games, this is a downer.  Most Super Mario games are hard.  A good challenge.  Super Princess Peach is not.  For one, she's got a lot of health.  When she takes damage she only loses half a heart.  As the game goes on she'll get more.  Not only that, but you can just as easily use Calm to restore her health.  Health restoring items are also pretty abundant.  If you're an experienced gamer with 2D platforming, this game is not going to challenge you at all.  It's the biggest problem with Super Princess Peach.  All the Mario games were a good challenge the first time through, Super Princess Peach is not, and it's disappointing.At least there's a good amount of collecting to be done.  These levels are huge.  It isn't just a straight-forward path.  There are hidden paths and side paths.  There's music tests to be found, puzzle pieces, mini games, and three toads in each level (which you'll have to find sooner or later).  You'll find yourself backtracking a lot.  So it isn't your typical platformer.It's also nice that after defeating Bowser, there's more to do.  More items show up in previous levels, and more levels are added.  So there is a good dose of replay value.  It also ensures you'll spend more time with the game than you previously thought.Super Princess Peach is a beautiful game.  The sprites are colorful and detailed, and the backgrounds are a nice treat.  It's just an all around good looking game.  The music can sometimes drag, but it is, for the most part, not a terrible soundtrack.Super Princess Peach is a good game.  I'd recommend it to any Mario fan or 2D Platform lover.  You will not find anything challenging in the game, but it's still a lot of fun to play.  I just wish Nintendo would put as much effort into this game as they did their Mario games.The Good+Play through the entire game as Peach+Neat Gameplay+Big levels+Colorful graphics+Lots of collectingThe Bad-The game feels short, despite how much collecting is to be done-It just isn't a challenge","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2006"}

According to my DS I logged 58 hours and 30 minutes into this game. I definitely consider it worth the money!I thought the graphics, sound, and story were excellent. I love the turn based battle system and did not find the menu hard to navigate. I am a relative \"latcomer\" to the RPG genre. I don't play consoles (my kids do---but I prefer the DS) so I never played a FF or DQ or other popular RPG. I got very attached to some characters (for some reason I was VERY attached to the merchant guy Torneko). I loved the ending. I have not yet played the 6th chapter so I can't speak to it but i generally find that these \"extra\" chapters are not something I usually enjoy. I am satisfied and happy to have beaten the game.I thougtht this game had an excellent save system. Your characters (some of them) can learn spells like Evac and Zoom. Evac can be used in most dungeons to get you out of there right away and zoom takes you to any place you visited before. As a newcomer to the RPG genre I did not have any problems completing this Quest. I did have to pay attention to what I was doing and I did use a guide to assist me--but I found that, as good as the guide was, I liked choosing my own team and equipping them the way I wanted to in the boss battles so most of the time what I had was very different than what the guide had. Mostly the guide was useful for the dungeon's so I didn't get lost.I found the learning curve acceptable. I was able to beat all bosses on the first try BUT I spent a lot of time leveling up. I prefer to have fun using strategy in the battles and not have to keep reviving fallen team members. I have to admit that I spent probably 6-7 hours before the final sets of boss battles going after those liquid metal slimes and king slimes----I leveled my hero up to 38 before I knew it so the final battles were not bad. My team was all at level 38 or above for the final battle.If you've read my past reviews you know I write from a 40 something mom's perspective. I really loved The World Ends with You (hence my interest in RPG) and I would say this one rates up there as well---it does not have as original a story and there weren't any surprises for me along the way so it was predictable but the fact you first play each chapter as someone new is very cool and keeps it from getting stale. I will say I had a much harder time leveling up Maya and Meena than anyone else in thier chapter. Don't know why (magic users maybe?)I can highly recommend this title. I think anyone from about age 10 or up would enjoy it as long as they understand that it is easier if you level up..I like that repetition so relish these types of games. While I do not think anyone needs to level up as much as I did (you can get through the game without it) this does make the game more forgiving and lets you have a couple of lapses in judgement (I used Thwack on a boss...what was I thinking!). If you like turn based RPG I think this one deserves to be picked up!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2009"}

The story takes place several years after the original Neverwinter Nights, and reintroduces popular characters and NPCs in a new storyline with new challenges.","reviewerName":"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","summary":"Could really have been better","reviewText":"As someone that loved the old infinity engine CRPGs (Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment) and quite liked the original Neverwinter Nights despite its issues, I had pretty high hopes for this game. In fact I got it pretty much on the day it was released. You can probably tell by the date of this review that it rather failed to arrest my attention. NWN 2 is a game that, by all rights, should have been great. Unfortunately it suffers from some very serious, unavoidable, basic flaws that totally cripple the fun factor.As one can expect, the game engine and graphics are new and improved. You can certainly tell by how much longer it takes to load areas and how big a drag on system resources this game becomes. Even current systems at the time of this writing lag at some points in the game, and if your machine is borderline you can expect major issues even if you have everything turned down to minimum. In fact, NWN 2 is more taxing on your PC than a lot of games that look a whole lot better, and on that note, it actually does NOT look a whole lot better than the old NWN. Character models are especially bad, and before you say that's just a game engine limitation, check out The Witcher sometime (it uses the same one). I don't know how Obsidian could have neglected character appearance when it's probably the most critical visual factor in a game like this, but they did. Sound and effects are fortunately a lot better, and this makes it somewhat tolerable in the multimedia department.The gameplay is sort of a mishmash between Baldur's Gate and NWN. You have more control over companions and can do some things like determine how they level up or control them directly in combat if you wish. Unfortunately, you probably will HAVE to take direct control, because the AI is absolutely atrocious. You thought the pathfinding in Baldur's Gate was bad? It looks positively brilliant compared to this. NWN2 is a new low: characters getting stuck behind each other or on empty terrain for no reason, running right into a room filled with traps, not attacking enemies directly in front of them, spellcasters choosing to melee instead of casting, healers not healing party members that are on the verge of death... the list goes on and on. Fortunately, there's some free downloadable hacks that go quite a way's towards fixing the AI, and if you want to progress through the game at anything approaching a reasonable pace these are absolutely mandatory. On an additional note, you can't multiclass any of your companions in the campaign- all you can do is assign points and feats, which is a shame. Your main character can pick up to 4 total classes, though the level cap of 20 limits you somewhat limited in terms of viability.The NWN 2 campaign has an overhead map that may bring back memories of Baldur's Gate. However, the campaign more or less shoehorns you into going into certain places in a certain order, and isn't a whole lot less linear than the old NWN. There's some halfhearted attempts at side quests, including some companion quests and a phase where you get to manage your own castle, but it's nothing like Baldur's Gate's extensive character development and exploration. If you've played BG1/2 you'll end up sorely disappointed- for a while it looks like NWN 2 is headed in the same direction, and then it all just sort of stops or gets dumbed down to boredom. It's an improvement over NWN in this regard, but it has a long, long way to go to get to the level of even the original Baldur's Gate. As far as the campaign story goes, it's pretty run-of-the-mill. No real surprises, not particularly imaginative; in short, a whole lot like the lackluster original NWN campaign. I've yet to try out the expansions for this game, and it'll probably be some time before I do on account of how little I enjoyed this campaign. Even on a loot note, there's not a whole lot to be had. I started noticing a lot of duplicate items about halfway through, and after checking the total lists with the toolset I was appalled by how few items there are in the game (not to mention how dumb most look). Most of them aren't even provided with any interesting background, just generic stats.There's a few additional and new features that have potential. The game uses the D&D; 3.5 rules and is somewhat more streamlined than the original. It still takes a bit of slot juggling to figure out what stacks with what, but a lot of the weirder things have been simplified or removed. There are new races, including some that are more powerful than the standard ones and thus incur a level penalty (not a good thing, considering there's only 20 levels). There's a new base class in the campaign- the warlock- and a decent collection of prestige classes. Unfortunately, due to the cap and the fact that you can't multiclass your companions, you probably won't get to experience most of the latter unless you either cheat or keep replaying the campaign (which, as noted above, is not exactly great fun). There's also some new item creation feats and skills, though in practice I found them to be too difficult to keep track of and not a whole lot of use anyway. There's also attempts at replay value in the campaign using the new influence system, but most of these come very late in the game and don't have a very serious impact on what actually happens anyway. There's also not a whole lot of motivation for doing what few optional quests there are, since most are quite boring and- as with the original NWN- you'll hit the cap before you finish either way.As for character customization, you can alter appearance, name, skills, feats, and class. In general you really want to stick with one 'type' of class- e.g. if you choose to be a spellcaster, you should stick with that and related prestige classes. Trying to get your character to do everything makes you pretty weak all around since this isn't an epic campaign. Then again, if you don't really care about having a powerful main character, do whatever. The game isn't particularly hard and your companions can probably take up the slack. As with NWN, you can use skills in some dialogue choices and world actions, though aside from bluff/intimidate these are pretty darn rare. In particular skills like listen, survival, and intimidate are so rarely used they might as well have just taken them out. Some reviewers have said that the game favors melee classes, but this is definitely not true once you get out of the noob stage. In fact I would say spellcasters are favored in the latter two thirds of the game on account of how many huge packs of weak monsters you encounter (nothing like AOE to clean that up right quick). You can rest almost anywhere and it only takes a few seconds, which makes memorized spell limits a non-issue unless you get into a really drawn-out fight (not common). That aside, seeing spells go off is one of the only real highlights of the game's combat system: weapon based attacks are so boring you don't even watch after a while.I do believe NWN 2 has potential, and the expansions may manifest that. So could player made content, since the toolset allows you to change practically anything. However, the out-of-box NWN 2 campaign is barely an improvement over the NWN1 original campaign (that one fortunately got better with expansions, but the original was a bore) and really didn't hold my attention. It looks rushed, unfinished in graphic and quest design, and has tons of new angles that could have been really cool if they were actually done right. The simple, sad fact is that there's a lot of better RPGs out there- and have been since NWN 2's release, which is why it took me so long to get through this game. In that light, I really can't recommend this title.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2009"}

Abraham \"Abe\"","summary":"This One Is Going To Be Speical.......","reviewText":"Opening Statement.\"This One Is Going To Be Special\" These are the words that you hear at the opening intro to the game. You can hear them from NFL legend John  Madden. Now this game has to be looked at on a few diffrent levels. So let's jump right into it and tell you what the pros and cons of this game is.Gameplay..I've noticed that a lot of the gameplay is exactly like the Madden games of the past years. Nothing really knew was added gameplay wise with the exception of the pro-tak feature which is kinda cool. Now I also have the same old Cornerbacks glithcing the the ball for the itnerception which will make anyone mad. Another thing that I have noticed that when a running back gets bound up in a group of five or six defensive players he can sometimes break loose and keep going. However I rarley see running backs like Marion Barber, Michael Turner, or Biran Westrook break out of these but the medeoker second string running backs like Jerious Norwood or Rashard Mendenhall break out of them that just puzzles me. Another thing that kinda makes me frustrated is the fact that when your playing and one of your defneisve players is about to sack the quaterback and you go to switch to that player you switch to some saftey which in fact he dives instead of the guy you want to. When the saftey falls down and the quaterback gets the pass out there is usually ends up with six points for the offense very very frustrating. And last but certainly not least the fact that a lot of Running backs that are faster like Brian Westbrook usually get caught by a middle linebacker or sometimes a Defensive tackle That makes no sense at all. Other then these issues the game plays smoothly with no problems. A little difficult to get all the buttons down quickly but after that you get the feel and it becomes easier. I give this catagory a 3.4/5Graphics...Now when you sit down and pop this sucker in and start playing it immedietly you look at the screen and can mistake it for a real life football game. And I agree with that. The feild looks fantastic and the shots of the players look pretty good as well, however, some of the coaches don't look a thing like they should. For example head coach of the Atlanta Falcons Mike Smith they make him look very very overweight makes no sense. Now I ahven't seen all the caoches but the ones I have look decent. Another thing I don't get is when playing the game on the feild the players look real good. Like Matt Ryan when you see him walking to the line he looks like Matt Ryan, however again when he is on the sideline and he takes off his helmet he dosen't look a thing like Matt Ryan, he look like someone out of the stands. Not a good job in my opinion. But the overall graphics of the game are pretty cool, the way the feild and statiums look to the outside elements when it rains and snows they did a decent job. I give this catagory a 3.8/5..Sounds/Audio..The sounds of the game are pretty good minor problems with this department. The tackles sound good when they make catches then get slammed to the gound it sounds pretty good. There are however times when the sounds are delayed but that has happened for the last three years so I guess they still didn't pick up on that. Tom Hammond and Chri Collensworth are back again this year with soem good audio. I think they do a pretty good job, they usually don't fall behind what's going on unless you are one of those people who just keep tapping A to keep the game moving. I give this catagory a 4.8/5Storyline...Well the storyline is the same just pick a team and go to the Superbowl nothing really you can say is bad about that. They've added a few cool things to it this year. A real program called the Extra Point with Alex Finnagin and Fran Charles is pretty cool. They are real people in it no video game characters which is a plus. They go over games ov the past and whats coming up next. One small minor detail about it sometimes when they are doing their program they will talk about a player on the Eagles but make him play for the faloncs like for instance. \"The Falcons are doing good this year. Tony Romo has passed for over 2,000 yards already.\" Soemthing liek that is what I mean. But hardly somethign to hold it against to. If you are a trader good luck because this year it is really hard to make a trade to a team. They expect it to be a top notch player for someone off their team. Adds to the fun I guess, makes it more real. I give this catagory a 4.9/5Final Thought...Being a huge fan of the 2K series I was pretty much forced to play Madden as that was the only football game out there to play, unless you picked up one of the no name brand games. This game is the next installment in Madden games so if you're a football fan you are going to have to pick this up. The game still lacks in areas which I have metioned. These are the things that have to be fixed. Overall I don't think the game is all to bad, I have been playing it since it came out and yea the little querks make me mad but hey it's Madden. The game is decent looks good and plays alright. With the new feature everything you see on Sunday it's cool to see things on the screen that you would see on Football Sunday. That game isn't bad it is a good pick up for any football fan. Like Madden Said \"This One Is Going TO Be Speicial\" Which it is on some accounts adiing new and improved gameplay and such. My final rating on Madden 2010 is a 3.8/5.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2009"}

I quickly became very addicted and played every night for 6 months.  Unfortunately, I hit the wall at level 70.  This is a great game, especially in the beginning.  Numerous quests, beautifully rendered graphics, awesome monsters to fight, and other \"real\" people to share the gaming experience with.  Things do get old after a while though.  This is especially true at high levels, when the only options left are reputation grinding, raiding, and crafting.  I found crafting to be fun but a huge money sink.  Raiding involves a time commitment that I am unable to give due to \"real\" life obligations.  Reputation grinding gets old after awhile as well.  Try killing the same group of ogres 1000 times in order to get the reputation needed for a nice helm and you understand where I am coming from.  One nice thing about level 70 is the flying mount in Outland.  This opens up an entirely new area of exploration.  Just be careful where you fly, as I discovered one time while exploring near a horde outpost.Overall, World of Warcraft is a great game but it does get old after awhile.  If you are a busy person in real life like me, you will never have time to see the end-game stuff due to the sheer time commitment needed.  The trip to 70 is fun though, more so the first time than the third however.  After trying other MMO's, I found WoW to be the best for gameplay, graphics, and entertainment value.

{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"Adron Gardner","summary":"Fun and still controls like mashed potatoes but at least it's ugly.","reviewText":"I'm 20 hours in so, full disclosure, this is more about impressions than a full review.  I'm not including a single spoiler for the story.Good:For the most part, this is essentially what Grand Theft Auto 4 should have been.  You can actually forget that game ever existed.  In GTA V, the stories are A LOT better.  The world is colorful and the missions, vehicles and terrain are exponentially more varied.  I liked Niko, yet GTA IV was a massive exercise in monotony from start to finish - as long as you consider Gay Tony it's own game, which I do.  TLatD was OK, but not very absorbing.It's fun and it's huge.  I think, in fairness though, while you're going to get some Los Santos deja Vu from San Andreas, it feels a lot more like the LA Noir map with more color.  The desert adds a huge chunk to the size - artificially so - but man, there's a lot to see and a lot to blow up.It starts much quicker.  Yeah, suck it up, you will still be doing a lot of vehicle recovery quests early on - stuff like the wrecker repo Franklin mission feel pretty flimsy - but Rockstar tries hard to keep you busy with different things and they mostly succeed.COLOR. COLOR.  COLOR.  No more freaking gray and dark gray everything like GTA 3 and GTA 4.  This is a solid return to the Vice City glitz days and San Andreas warm sunsets.The Soundtrack is massive, bubbly and totally fitting.  There are times it feels like you are playing the movie DRIVE with music just as good.Controversy? Sure the characters and some of the situations are deplorable, but what did you expect in a game series called Grand Theft Auto?  There's nothing Rockstar can ever do to shock me.  I will always just see GTA as a bigger version of Dope Wars with cars.  Is it sexist?  Oh yeah - GTA always has been about the bros. But I think the larger point people are missing in the sexist argument isn't just how women are portrayed in these games - the real point is Rockstar is missing a huge storytelling opportunity by NOT including a playable female main character.  Franklin, Michael and Trevor are all people we've seen before in other games and countless movies.  A woman shouldn't be a gimmick. Entertain this:  An Uma Thurman type character from Kill Bill?  La Femme Nikita? Linda Hamilton from T2?  Ok, I'm off that soapbox.Bad:The controls still suck.  I don't understand Rockstar.  Most of their games have the same problems - they control like crap. Even on PC there is always a discernible lag from when you move the stick or press a button to what happens on screen in the past GTA games and LA Noire.  After $250 million dollars spent on this game alone, you would think they could make a fluid and responsive character for you to control.  Just use free aim.  There's no getting around it, aiming is slow, but the lock on system is beyond awful.  You have four guys shooting at you?  Tough luck, because auto lock may select a wall or doorway to shoot at.  If this was Gears of War or Uncharted, you'd never hear the end of it.  In short, I don't give it a free pass for the open world.  The fact is, GTA V has the worst shooting/aiming controls of any game I've played in recent memory.Heists can be really exciting, but they can also be boring and linear.  The \"planning\" isn't really all that elaborate.  You have a few values that you can choose from, but it doesn't really allow you a whole lot of creativity.  This isn't PADAY type stuff.The low frame rate is a war crime.  There are many sequences in GTA V where the game BARELY chugs along to something playable. It's playable, but it ain't pretty.  Even with the problems I have with the game, I'll buy it again on PC just to play it at a tolerable frame rate.Lastly, after you put the time in, it becomes apparent, that though the game may look big, after 15 hours of missions and driving around, you can't shake the feeling that Los Santos is often an empty place. A smaller map with more people and more cars would be a step up.  I liked Vice City.  The map wasn't huge, but it was well used.Out of all the things you can say about open world games, in GTA V, I think the best improvements Rockstar can shoot for is trade surface area for population and make their games more responsive.** Glitches **- Cars disappear.  You can buy a garage, you can pay for the car on your phone but it may not be around for more than a mission or two.  I lost $400,000 on tuned cars that never returned to my garage after story missions.- Vehicles easily get stuck and void the mission you are on- Police stars are really inconsistent.  I've ran over people. Shot cars and stolen several rides with no alert.  On the other hand, I've stolen one car on an empty street and half the city is after me.-Car spawning lacks variety.  If you see one Coquette, there's usually three more behind it.  Pass one Jaguar look-alike sedan, and then pass another 40.  I've gone several blocks with almost every car the same with different color, with only an SUV here or there to mix it up.  You'll get tired of Mitsubishi Eclipse and Dodge Charge clones pretty fast.- I have the disc version and the texture loading is pretty awful in some places.SO FAR:It's good. It's colorful. It is exactly what you expect - for better or worse.  But the controls are TERRIBLE.  And if there's more than a few things on screen, the graphics alternate from clay fighter to jaggy soup. If you just upgraded from a PS2, I'm sure this is gangbusters, but compared to ANYTHING else out there, GTA V looks pretty messy and it plays that way too.  Seriously, unless you have to play it now - which you really don't if you've ever played any other GTA game - sit tight and wait for the PC or inevitable PS4 port.  The controls will surely still be crap, but if it runs closer to 60fps, you will get a far more enjoyable  game.  GTA V is often a mess on many fronts, though it is certainly better than GTA IV in that it's no where near as boring.  Sure the city is great, but it would be a lot more fun if the controls weren't like digging toothpicks out of taffy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2013"}

This title however takes the cake in terms of graphics, story and gameplay. It's just overall a superior gaming experience.When I first got the game, I found the whole switching between characters to be confusing, and a little pointless, however as I got further into the game I began to appreciate it, and in fact loved it! I also loved the fact that missions were not just your standard smash and grab mission, but instead were detailed heists, that had multiple ways of pulling it off(Also adding to the replay value).The area of Los Santos is huge, and comprises several locals and towns. From the towering glass spires of the city, to the woodsy backwoods, to the scorching desert. You will find a lot here! This is obviously the largest of the GTA game worlds, and is fun to explore. In this installment, you can even explore underwater. You will never have a dull moment.Plus, you also get access to Grand Theft Auto Online, which is a nice feature, and is included free with the game, but is nowhere near as cool as Rockstar tends to make it sound.Now, the downside! Normally, I would let my kid play a game with an M rating, as a lot of kids these days are mature, however when it comes to GTA5? No way! This has got to be the most adult game in the franchise. In past games, when you picked up a street walker, the car would bounce around. This one? Well, you can see into the car, but not really see anything! However there is sound effects!Overall, if you're an adult, and love GTA games, this is something you need to check out.

However, since humorous games are such a rare thing and rarely ever done well, I wanted to try out Deadpool. And honestly, I had faith in High Moon Studios. I'm glad to say, though, that my faith wasn't misplaced. Deadpool is hilariously raunchy and downright fun.Graphically speaking, the game looks pretty good. Granted, it surely won't win any awards for its visuals, but it's a pleasant enough looking game overall. I like how you can see Deadpool's mouth animating under his mask, which is a nice touch. It's running on the Unreal Engine 3, so it looks similar to the Cybertron games made by High Moon.As for voice acting and the overall production values, Deadpool nails it. This game is hilarious and has a lot of nice little touches.The story, however, is the star of the show; it's just a really funny game that reminds me somewhat of The Mask. This game has a lot of potty language and humor, but it totally nails it. Sure, it's a bit immature, but that's what's so fun about it. It's goofy and doesn't take itself seriously at all.The gameplay is serviceable. While it's certainly not the most polished and refined action game that would rank up there with the smooth action of a Bayonetta or Ninja Gaiden, both the melee and gun combat work well enough and can be seamlessly combined to make for a fun gameplay experience. The best thing here is the variety in the gameplay. There are bits of the game where you're jumping around like in platforming games, playing in what resembles NES Zelda, etc.Deadpool is rarity. It's not often that we get games this absurd. I honestly prefer Deadpool to both of the Cybertron games, which I also really enjoy.

{"product_name":"B00BGA9X9W","description":"","reviewerName":"crank","summary":"Near Perfection. Rubber on sticks is terrible though.","reviewText":"Note: Some DS4s appear to have sticking R1 buttons. This issue is solved easily by carefully popping of the R1 button and applying some kind of lubricant fit for plastic or just cleaning off the factory material that is impeding the R1. It is a very simple fix luckily. The main fix that is perma is the rubber, which doesn't seem to be very resistant at all to slightly acidic hands. It will come off if you are one of these people. My whole left stick is bare at this point. But Sony will give you a new one so I won't dock any stars as long as they fix it within a couple months.There are not may contenders up there for best controller. Many people seem to like a wide variety of them. From Sega to Nintendo to the 360 we all have our favorites. PS has had a decent controller and I have used it for many years. The main problem was ergonomics. It sucked to really just hold. Well, they have come far with this one.The Dualshock 4 is a masterpiece of design with few caveats. IMO it will take some time getting used to those sticks. I hope games calibrate well with regards to the sticks' dead space as they need to be responsive with only so much movement. As I am playing atm on PC with the DS4, FF14 has a lot of dead space and it can get annoying but still works fine. I expect games for the PS4 and later on PC to be much better balanced. From what I play the sticks are loosening up nicely and should feel really nice in a couple of days.That is about all I can nitpick on. The materials for this controller are top notch. The frame and fit to hand are near perfect. The pointer fingers were seemingly kind of made to rest on the trigger if need be but gripping it with two fingers on top to a side is still pretty comfy. R1 and L1 take some getting used to but are pretty damn nice coming from the earlier pads. The face buttons feel better than ever, smooth and solid and a notch closer together which is very useful. No analogue there means less input lag.The Dpad is the best I have personally used. I'm not a huge hardcore fighter guy but I play some here and there and do a bit of 2D stuff and it works great. The triggers of course are massively improved and really nail that 'trigger but still a button' feel.The LED light on the top of the controller is downcast and should not affect too many TVs at all. I play in the dark and never notice it. The handles are now actually fit your pinky fingers which is nice! Finally! This thing really just slides into your fingers. But it has been so long for some of us that it still feels awkward. In no way does this mean you won't make the leap though. You will.The touchscreen works very well in Killzone and the Rumble can get obnoxious on some guns when charging them. In a good way mostly. Every part of the controller feels like it was carefully looked over. It's just fun to hold this thing. It feels like a modern controller near to perfection.All in all the ONLY thing I can even think about criticizing is the sticks which are just going to take some getting used to. With more playtime they become looser and easier to nudge small distances. This controller is marvelous. Grippy, responsive, and totally comfortable in the hands. People will simply never go back to the DS3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}

In the old games, nintendo tried to make the gameplay good. But, here all they care about is gimmicks like the steering wheel and miis. In the older mario karts the person who was the best driver would win. But here, the person who gets the best items wins. It's all based on luck. There is this item that is a blue koopa shell with wings. It goes after the player in first and blows them up. in double dash, you rarely get hit by it. In the wii version, you get hit by the blue shell all the time and its very annoying. The whole game is just lazy. Half the courses are copies of the old games. The controls on the wii wheel are horrible because you can't do the mini turbos like before. And even worse, on the new wiis you can't plug and gamecube controller into them. Also when you buy ANY kind of wii it does NOT come with a gamecube controller. That's really stupid because the older ones have support for them. I recommend to just sell that Wii, and buy a Super Nintendo, a Nintendo 64, or a GameCube.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2013"}

Needless to say, I was aware of the Prince of Persia series, I just never had any interest in it beyond being dragged along to the movie that came out last year (decent movie, not amazing, though).  Now, as I play through, I can honestly say it's by far one of the most entertaining games I've played.First off, I'm a huge God of War fan and personally enjoy the third person fixed camera game.  Forgotten Sands is, of course, that kind of game, albeit with -most of the time- control of the camera.  There's classic PoP platforming, something that I'd always heard was amazing and can say that it is quite that - being able to traverse things in such a manner is definitely amazing.  The voice acting is topnotch, albeit not as \"real\" as Red Dead Redemption, but much more realistic than Kratos' angry shouting.  The story is pretty standard action/adventure stuff (two brothers release an army of undead and have to clean up the mess they started; cliche stuff really).  The game play is extremely rewarding.  The graphics?  Honestly, this looks like it sits somewhere between the PS2 and PS3, and that probably will be most people's greatest annoyance with Forgotten Sands.  This far into the PS3 (or Xbox 360, respectively) polished graphics are standard, and unfortunately except for the gorgeous CGI-created opening sequence Forgotten Sands looks outdated.  Graphics here are like those of DC Universe Online; decent, but not amazing by any means.  Still, the storyline and gameplay makes up for places where this game falls short, and there isn't much to dislike other than its inferior graphics engine.In the end, Prince of Persia-Forgotten Sands is one of the most fun and entertaining action/adventures titles you could pick up for either console.  I'd go so far as to say if it wasn't for the lack of graphical details it'd be a perfect aa game.  Overall, being in Persia ain't so bad.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2011"}

Those who side with good will get to follow Frodo's journey through Middle-Earth, playing in battles inspired by both the books and the movies. Or join evil to find out what may have happened if Frodo had failed to destroy the One Ring, as you fight your way with Sauron back across the map in an attempt to destroy Rivendell, the Shire, and all that is good in the world.You can play as a warrior, scout, mage or archer.View larger.The online multiplayer mode allows for massive battles with up to 16 of your friends.View larger.Building off the model Pandemic used with Star Wars: Battlefront, Lord of the Rings: Conquest provides you with a first and/or third person shooter style of game that not only lets you command strategy, but also lets you control the players in the center of the action. Participate in the Battle of Isengard as an Ent or fight Saruman at Orthanc as Gandalf himself. Take on the Nazgul as Aragorn while still protecting Frodo, or battle at Pelennor as a Rohirrim cavalry soldier. And that is just for the good guys!In Conquest you will have to play many different characters in order to win. And it isn't always such a balanced match, as you will find yourself destroying towering siege engines and taking on hulking oliphaunts with your companions. You can choose to play all the heroes you love, or fight as a Nazgul tasked with killing Frodo and stretch your powerful wings as the Balrog himself in your battle for Moria.Pick Your Own Style of PlayIn the game, you'll be able to play as one of four different character classes. Choose the melee-based Warrior or Scout for up-close action, or pick the Archer or Mage to perform devastating ranged attacks. There is also talk of a 'special' class called the Guardian to give gamers a third choice. But don't worry about getting locked in, as you can actually change which character class you're playing on the fly, in the middle of the game's various objective-based missions.Each class of characters has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as unique special abilities. Playable units range from grunt soldiers, which are the weakest, to captains, which are the strongest AI units in the game other than the heroes. You also get to order in air strikes using either eagles or fellbeasts. Even better, players will be able to mount the occasional horse, unless they've chosen evil, in which case they will have to master the skill of riding a fearsome warg.Multiple Modes for Endless FunAs in Battlefront, Lord of the Rings: Conquest has enormous competitive multiplayer modes, including Conquest, Capture the Flag, and Hero Deathmatch. In addition to these classics, Conquest adds a Ring Bearer mode, in which one player tries to stay alive as Frodo against a host of ringwraiths, and Stronghold in which you fight on various maps in a Risk-style battle for territories. Fortunately, you won't be limited to roaming around with only your teammates, however, as battles occur in large scale with non-player combatants joining in the fray.Conquest allows online play with up to 16 players for massive battles with all your friends, or in two-player cooperative mode. Players can also play locally with up to four players competitively, or two-player co-op on a split screen. When in the game itself, fans will get the thrill of hearing Howard Shore's score for the films accompanying the action, and both good and evil campaigns are narrated by Hugo Weaving, who played Elrond in the movies.You can choose to play either good or evil, each with different endings.","reviewerName":"Matthew Kunka","summary":"Pretty Surprisingly Awesome","reviewText":"I rented this game because the other game I wanted was out of stock, and I had very low expectations.

{"product_name":"B00005YVTW","description":"You are the vampire Kain, the most evil figure ever to appear in a video game. Cloaked in stealth, you will move unseen through crowds, travel stories above the peasant herds on which you feed--leaping from rooftop to rooftop--and use mind control to overcome vampire-proof inventions. The combat choreography unfolds with dancelike precision as Kain engages armies of demons and humans alike. The comprehensive menu of unstoppable attacks, nimble combos, and special moves are designed to appeal to even the most jaded of fighting-game fans. The world that Kain moves through is a lushly detailed gothic environment that is not only gorgeous to the eye, but also alive with the soon-to-be-dead. The AI behavioral response makes peasants and enemies variously flee, take up arms, or remain unaware as Kain moves through crowds or charges, sword raised, into open areas.","reviewerName":"Bee","summary":"The Legacy beats on","reviewText":"Graphics:  4/5 Though not up to the quality of Soul Reaver 2, it still has its nice touches.  From bugs flying around the light posts, to spider webs along the wall underground.  The city in which you explore is quite detailed, but the people don't look too wonderful.  There are also glitches at times, where the screen seems to almost get shaky.  Though not a major problem it can get a bit annoying.Sound:  4/5 Again not on par with Soul Reaver 2 where it felt like the world was alive around you, it is still pretty good.  I like the fact that you can stand near two people talking and listen to their conversation, from a bartender talking to a customer, to a woman getting on her man's case for getting drunk, it's really quite amusing.  The water sound effects are adequate, and most seem to be just fine, they don't really stand out as great, but it's not really a bother either.Control:  3.5/5  This area is well below Soul Reaver 2's fluid and precise control.  The controls seem less responsive than when you controlled Raziel in SR2.  Pushing back will make Kain walk backwards, when you would just have him turn around and go that direction.  You have to push to either side to have him rotate that direction, which I find annoying.  I wish they would have made Kain much more responsive, and able to turn around on a dime.  He's a vampire he's suppose to be agile, but he doesn't control as such.  This control scheme can become tiresome when trying to climb a ladder, which you can easily just walk right by when you meant to climb up it.  So you try and rotate Kain to face directly at the stairs then you have a better chance of making a successful climb.  Yeah it's pretty annoying.Difficulty:  5/5  This is the most combat oriented of the LOK series.  While in the Soul Reaver games you really didn't need to fight, unless you were low on energy, in BO2, you will be attacked quite often by thugs, guards, maybe even other vampires and running away usually isn't an option since you will probably be in a confined area, and because of the less than desirable controls it isn't always easy to get away.  In BO2, a heavy emphasis is placed on blocking and attacking after you have successfully blocked an oncoming attack.  You can lock onto an enemy, ala Zelda: OoT, and Soul Reaver 2.  There are also two settings to blocking, \"Assisted Blocking\" in which you hold down the L1 button and Kain will block the attackers multiple attacks.  And another setting in which you have to tap L1 for each of the attacks.  And even when you are doing well at blocking there are some attacks that cannot be blocked.  You can also quickly move around your enemy and try and attack them from behind, though it usually doesn't work out the way you want it to.  You will find yourself dying multiple times and returning to the last checkpoint that you crossed until you get better at fighting.  Boss fighting is in a word HARD!  Even just the first boss will probably wax you about 5 or more times before you figure out what to do.Story:  5/5 This is for me and many others the selling point of the Legacy of Kain games.  The story is so rich and compelling.  This one revolves around Kain as it did in the original Blood Omen.  In this one he has been asleep, kept alive by other vampires for 200 years after he was defeated by a mysterious figure called the Seriphan Lord.  Kain was nursed back to help by a vampire woman named Uma.  She and other vampires see Kain as their last hope to defeat the Seriphan, a ruthless sect bent on destroying all the vampires.  Kain was defeated by this Seriphan Lord and his sword, the Soul Reaver, was taken from him.  Now Kain is back and he is looking forward to punishing the Seriphan Lord for what he did to him.  But first he needs to grow strong again, and gain his powers back.  The only power he starts off with is Mist, the ability to turn himself into mist and sneak up on enemies.Overall 4/5 While I and many other LOK fans will probably enjoy this game, I am not sure if it's for those who don't know the series and aren't drawn in by the story it spins.  The control, the difficulty, and glitchyness will probably turn those off that aren't diehard fans of the series.  They may just see a difficult, hard to control game with good voice acting.  I would suggest to those that haven't played any games in this series, or have only played the Soul Reaver games to rent it.  I am afraid that you may be disappointed if you spend your money on buying it.  Though it's a good game, I just don't see it as having a broad appeal to many beyond loyals to the series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2002"}
{"product_name":"B000LSJKAM","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"A Mediocre Party","reviewText":"Ever since Mario Party debuted on the Nintendo 64, we've been receiving a new game in the series on a yearly basis.  The last few Mario Party games have all been tiring.  Almost rehashes.  However, with the Wii, Mario Party has a chance to be a lot of fun again thanks to the Wii-Remote.  Unfortunately, it isn't all its cracked up to be.  The Wii-Remote controls work, but they feel like a last minute tack on, and ultimately some of the mini-games just aren't all that fun.  Finally, there are other video games chock full of mini-games that make much better use of the Wii-Remote than Mario Party 8.The formula for Mario Party really hasn't changed at all over the years.  You and your friends (or the computer) will roll the die, move around the board at the end of each round of rolls you'll be thrown into a mini-game.The mini-games are pretty short.  Most of them being around 30 seconds long.  Some of them are quite fun and make good use of the wii remote, such as the game where you have to shake up a soda can, or wipe off the chomp.  However, there are not a lot of these kinds of mini-games.  Most other mini-games don't make as big of an impression with the wii-remote, as most of them consist of you holding the wii remote like a basic gamepad and then tilting it left or right.  Take for example, the game where you race on water skis.  You don't actually do anything outside of tilting the wii remote left and right to jump ramps.  It is in moments like these where the wii remote controls just feel tacked on.  And unfortunately, this comes up in quite a few mini games.  There are also a lot of mini games that simply have you tilting the Wii-Remote forward and backward.  Again, the controls feel tacked on in instances like this.The biggest slap in the face, however, is that there are a myriad of mini-games that don't use the wii-remotes motion sensor controls at all and you'll hold it like a gamepad, and play with it like it's a gamepad using the D-Pad to move your character and all.  It's also to no credit that these games aren't really all that fun.To the game's credit, though, when they do make good use of the wii-remote and its motion sensor controls, they really do a bang up job.  Such as the mini-game where everyone shoots at the screen while one person dodges.  It's just unfortunate that there aren't a lot of mini-games that do so, and instead make you either play the traditional way or just simply tilt the wii remote.  There are some fun games here, but the game is populated by more games that really aren't a lot of fun.As usual, Mario Party games are no fun by yourself.  They need to be played with friends and family.  Like previous installments, multi-player can be a lot of fun--provided you get a good mini-game.  Some of the games are free-for-all but there are also some games where you'll be by yourself against three players, or working together with one other player.  Mostly, though, they're free for alls, and playing with a friend is nice just so that you can see who's better.  Multi-player has always been a strong aspect of Mario Party and it's no different in number 8.  However, much like previous installments, the game is entirely left up to chance.  One moment you're in first place, and after the very next roll you're in last.  It's annoying sometimes because you really don't have any control.  It's all a game based on luck.  This is both a good and bad thing. Good because it makes the outcome unpredictable, and once more anyone can play this without any prior experience.  It's bad, however, because for some who like to add a little strategy to their gaming, you just can't do it here.Perhaps the biggest problem facing Mario Party 8 is that it doesn't really present a whole lot of new stuff that wasn't in Mario Party 7.  With the game making use of the Wii-Remote, one would expect the experience to be quite different.  Instead it's more of the same thing.  Especially because there are other games on the Wii that are filled with mini-games that make far better use of the remote (Rayman Raving Rabbids comes to mind).  In Mario Party 8 the wii remote controls either feel tacked on or you don't really use them.  It's also hard to get past the fact that the mini-games aren't very inventive because of this.  Certainly water-skiing is fun, but when you're just tilting left and right throughout the whole thing?  You might as well have just put this on the Gamecube and let me tilt the analog stick left and right.Graphically, it's no surprise that Mario Party 8 isn't the best looking game out there.  Mario Party games usually aren't.  At least it runs smoothly.  There's no slow down or frame rate issues.  It really doesn't look any different than any of the Mario Party games on the Gamecube however, and those who have a widescreen television will be disappointed to know that the game won't take up the whole screen, and instead will give you a boarder.  Luckily, graphics don't make the game.  Mario Party doesn't look bad, it just looks dated.Mario Party 8 had so much potential.  If they'd done more intuitive things with the Wii Remote, this may have been worth a buy.  There are other mini-game collections out there that utilize the wii remote much better than this.  There will be plenty of gamers out there that will be able to get past the big flaws and just have fun with it, but if you're one who's been playing Mario Party since the beginning, you can't help but admit a change is in order.  Unfortunately Mario Party 8 doesn't do much for you.Pros:+When the Wii Controls are good, the games are actually quite fun+Simplistic gameplay; anyone could pick this up and play it with no problems+There are over 60 mini-games to playCons:-There are far too many mini-games where the wii controls feel tacked on, and these games are pretty boring to play-There are far too many mini-games that don't make use of the motion sensor controls at all-There are not a lot of very inventive mini-games-In short, the game doesn't do much to stand out above previous Mario Party installments.  You'd think with the Wii Remote, Mario Party 8 would be something new to experience, but instead it ends up not being that much of a step higher than Mario Party 7","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2007"}

However things go south with the appearance of a giant creature called Sin.  When he wakes up he is in a new world where he joins the party of the young summoner Yuna, daughter of the last summoner to defeat Sin who with his father Jecht.  There they will go on a journey of discovery, danger, deception, and perhaps hope for a better future.X-2 is two years later, Yuna is a sphere hunter looking for recordings of the past.  but a mysterious sphere found by her cousin Riku showing someone who looks like Tidus has her hoping that he may still be out there, and with new abilites and friends she goes on a new journey to discover the truth.I am only a little into the first game, and I am going to be putting aside Dark Souls 2 for this title for a while.  The graphics are crisp, the opening movie is amazing (was amazing on the ps2 - this puts it into a whole new level and i can not wait for the Yuna scene and the lake scene).  The soundtrack is great.  Also you can play the international version which has the dark Aeons, new enemies for the US, and the new sphere grid to customize your characters in whole new ways.  Also the artbook gives you the developer art that was used in the development of this game.

{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"Blood in the Water?  I'd hold off if I were you","reviewText":"PLEASE NOTE: I am not a Sony or Nintendo &#34;fanboy&#34;. I have first hand experience with the console. Also, I think the Xbox One has serious potential and the problems it will most likely stabilize with in the first year, but do not recommend picking one up on launch.We finally have all three major console players in the game, with Valve&#8217;s Steam Box hoping to edge its way into the fight for your hard-earned entertainment dollar. Of the three main offerings, the Xbox One has been the last to launch and is the most expensive with $499, whereas the PS4 is $399 and the Wii U is $299.To say the Xbox One has had a rough PR road to hoe is putting it lightly. Like Microsoft&#8217;s flagship product, Windows 8 with its tabet approach, abolition of the start menu, and closed Windows store, the Xbox One was meant to be a radical reinvention of the Xbox brand, with most of the changes being controversial, to say the least. Initially, Microsoft designed the Xbox One to always be online. If disconnected from the Internet, the system would need to connect at least once very 24 hours, or the system would be unable to play any games. All games were tied to an Xbox Live account and console, effectively destroying the used video game market in regards to Xbox titles. Lastly, the system originally mandated that you use a Kinect motion camera in order to operate the system.These &#8216;features&#8217; were met with such severe consumer backlash to the point that Microsoft reversed these requirements/policies. Still, these proposed policies greatly damaged the public&#8217;s perception of the system.Kotaku (among others) have also reported that they have heard from industry sources that Microsoft has been hard pressed getting the operating system and core applications ready for the November 22 launch. Kotaku&#8217;s sources have also suggested that Xbox One&#8217;s developer kits are &#8220;buggy&#8221;. According to Pete Dodd, a blogger who is apparently well-connected and treated as an authoritative source, post this: &#8220;&#8220;So if you are playing by yourself and just playing the game online it should be fine. But if you&#8217;re in a party, people get dropped. Voice chat cuts in and out. Certain app combinations make the machine crash completely.&#8221; Apparently there are SIGNIFICANT issues with the Network infrastructure and Xbox Live, and, in the words of Kotaku, these systems will be coming in &#8220;hot&#8221;.So what do you get for your $500 dollars besides the console? An external power brick, a chat headset and controller, a 6 foot HDMI cable, and a Kinect sensor. When you power up the system, there will be a mandatory, day one update (so you better have Internet connection available). The UI is based off Windows 8's approach, so depending on how you feel about Windows 8's UI will determine your opinion of the Xbox One.The Xbox One is marketed as being the central entertainment device in your living room, which is why the gaming industry and pundits mocked Microsoft during their press conference - the focus was largely on everything else the system did and not the games. The system is able to input and output HDMI audio and video, with the intention of being able to operate your entire entertainment setup using only your voice.In comparison to the Wii U and PS4, the Xbox One is massive. The system weights eight lbs, is 13.5 inches wide by 10.4 inches deep by 3.2 inches tall, with numerous vents on top arnd around the sides (which it was designed for nearly always being on). Like the PS4, the Xbox One is not backwards compatible. As with most new systems, the launch titles, while marginally better looking than their PS3 and Xbox 360 counterparts, haven&#8217;t hit their stride in showing what the respective systems can do.IMPORTANT: Xbox One only connects via HDMI cable; you cannot connect the console to a standard definition TVWhile there are several excellent features, most are tied to the subscription based Xbox Live Gold account which is sixty dollars a year. . The following features require the subscription in addition to the monthly fees you already have to pay for several of these services: Netflix, Skype, Hulu Plus, Game DVR, the Web Browser (of all things), and the NFL Application.The primary selling point is Kinect, where you can engage in all your Star Trek fantasies by talking to your TV and game console and them actually responding to your voice commands. But if we learn from history, it&#8217;s that technology doesn&#8217;t only work flawlessly, and often times Kinect will not respond correctly. Like Bill Gates getting a BSOD during the reveal of Windows &#8216;98, Kinect, while fancy, still has some significant reliability issues.Although the system&#8217;s capabilities are impressive on paper (TV, web browsing, video streaming, and a UI that supports voice and motion control), the higher retail cost and continuing subscription fees are significant drawbacks in these economically challenging times. Hardware launches are never easy, and it may be better to just let the dust settle and wait six months to a year for Microsoft to work all the kinks out.While on paper the Xbox One may be a powerhouse of a system, Microsoft botched the initial reveal so badly that I recommend waiting, especially given all the rumours floating around. Obviously you cannot take every rumour at face value, but when respectable, authoritative sources are reporting sharks in the water, you may want to start looking for fins.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

Still, that doesn't honestly mean there are still great games available for you to play with the Nintendo DS. With so many people going to music games like Rock Band, Dance Dance Revolution and Michael Jackson: The Experience, the rhythm of the beat os more important than ever. But that can also be more of a exact challenge. It is also with the best and more percise gamer in mind as well. Well, if you really are into music and rhythm games, there is onw that goes beyond the challenge.Rhythm Heaven for the Nintendo DS is a very challenging and absolutely rough game, that tests you to the most accurate of rhythms to the max. The game features over 50 mini-games that test you to your best in knowing when the notes are going to come around. Graphically, the game is alright, but control is really the mixed bag in this rhythm game. You have to be 100% percise with accuracy for each mini-game. There really isn't as much of a field that makes it easy for beginners to play and learn to control with the stylus. Also At Times, you can easily get frustrated in maintaining the gameplay Although the controls are simple enough, the gameplay makes it harder for you to know how to master the game. Even if you are right on target with the rhythm, unfortunately you can easily lose and not unlock the next mini-game you can do well in. There is no one to play it with as well, just you all and all on your own. The game as is, definitely is one of teh hardest to play, and yet the most challenging to score.All in all, Rhythm Heaven is not for the beginners at heart. While it honestly does have clever games, it sadly though misses to the point on the fun. If you are looking for more of a challenge with dance and music games, than you should try Rhythm Heaven. But honestly, this isn't one of the must-have games for your Nintendo DS library at all. While it is fun, it could've been a bit easier to play with along the rhythms.Graphics: BSound: BControl: CFun & Enjoyment: B-Overall: C 1/2+","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2011"}
{"product_name":"B003O6HDHA","description":"","reviewerName":"David Rey \"dmajor\"","summary":"So far so good","reviewText":"UPDATE:  I played now a total of 7 or 8 hours and just wanted to mention that the freezing got worse for me with this game and one time it froze my ps3 and I had to restart the system.  Then it put me back about 10 minutes from where I was.  The freezes have gotten less frequent but sometimes the camera goes wonky.  I like the game but I really wish they would PATCH this game cause it's not running very well at all.  Oh and the monsters have gotten a LOT more interesting.  This definitely has somewhat of a SH2 feel.  And the puzzles are starting to get really hard even on normal.  I notice a lot of ppl looking for answers on line.  Again when I beat it, I'll update this review.***************************This is just a quick review of the game for those people who are on the fence about this one due to the varying reviews of this game.  Once I beat it I'll come back and give this a proper full review.First let me say I'm a die hard Silent Hill fan.  I have every single game that came out and yes I did like SH4 (the scariest to me) and Homecoming (come on! it was fun guys!).  The one I liked the least was Origins.Now about Downpour...I've played about 3-4 hours so far, I tend to play slower than most, and I finally made it actually into Silent Hill.  So far here are the pros and cons.Pros-+ Story is intriguing.  I'm already wondering where this is gonna go.+ Puzzles!  These are actually fun and tricky.+ Traditional SH sounds when you pick up items (brings back memories).+ Music is good! It's no Akira Yamaoka but it works well and actually makes Silent Hill feel refreshed.+ You can block when in battle (i don't remember having this option in the other games but i find it working well here)+ Some good scares so far and some heart pounding sections that work very well.+ Improved map/ inventory system but still feels traditional+ No hand holding.  They are not afraid to just let you look around and figure out what to do on your own.+ Options on what action to take in conversations with ppl.  I think this leads to different endings.+ It really manages to FEEL like you are going into Silent Hill, like how it did in SH1-3.Cons- Screen tearing and freezing (for like a second every now and then the game will freeze and then I'll hear a door slam, then it will continue.  Needs a patch cause it's a bit annoying but nothing that ruins that game.)- No notification on what type of item is there for you to pick up.  Ie.  It will just say \"pick up\" but you don't know if it's a note or a weapon or what type of weapon.  Sure you can just rotate the camera to see what it is or you can pick it up and discard it if you don't want it.  But it would have been easier if they just put \"pick up chair\" or \"pick up medkit\" or \"pick up knife\" etc.- Monsters are creepy, but they seem a bit generic. Not as original as past monsters but at least it isn't repetitive using nurses (at least not yet).Side note:I think some who are saying the combat is awful may be trying to play it differently that it is meant to be played.  When you block, you only  block one hit at a time, so you have to keep timing the block button to the hits of the monsters.  From what I can tell the monsters don't have an easy to follow pattern so it feels tense and hectic... and realistic.  I chose to run a few times, especially when I got surrounded and it really did feel scary.  I felt weak.  AND THAT IS THE POINT. You are weak and when you run, you can use R1 to look back (think Shattered Memories).  It just makes you not want to meet more monsters.  Which is exactly how i felt in SH2.I got this for $50 here and had it pre-ordered a year ago when this was first announced.  I'm very happy with it.  It sorta reminds me of Homecoming with the updated graphics but it feels like SH2 a little.Again, when I beat this I'll update the review.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2012"}

I donnot think this will be the game that will make users jump shift from COD to titanfall as this one is probably a every 2/ half years game release not a yearly release....It also waited months before/after COD release because I&#34;m sure they didn't want to go head to head with COD, smart for business maybe but titanfall was hyped up to be a big AAA game so I don't see why they didn't go for COD season release from Sept-December.

Not as much stuff as VF4:E But I like Tekken more than Virtua Fighter, and this also shoots the replay value way up.  I mean I got Wang lookin' like Pei Mei off of Kill bill, I got Ling lookin like Chun-Li off Street Fighter, and Beak lookin like #47 off Hitman.  I owe all these cool custimazations to gamefaqs.-Fast paced combat is back, something not present in Tekken 4-Awww, the wemon!

In this one, when you see Paul's movie, you'll be laughing calling him a idiot, but the funniest is either Law's or Asukas)-Starblade game to play while game is loading at beginging(Ahh reminices of the atari style game I played before Tekken 1 loaded.)-Devil Jin is one BAAAAAD Mo-Fo!  He easily put Jinpachi and Devil Kazuya to immediate shame.-The Devil within is a pretty fun mode(Altho it's LONG for a mini game)-Huge character selection(Newcomers express their entry, and old returners come back to bring the pain-JACK IS BACK!!  Man I missed him in the 4th one, he was replaced in that by Lee's crappy robot.-Tekken is still the king of fighters and this installment easily prooves itCons:-Stuff still looks fake when it breaks-Jinpachi is defnitley a canidate for one the cheapest boss fights in video game history.  I mean it's the same rutiene for almost every fight.  When I come close to wining, he shakes the ground, and I'm stalled, I can't do crap!  Hit, stall again, hit, stall again, fireball K.O.!{Not to mention he always ruins my time attack}  Man I haven't fought a boss this cheap or cheezy since Sho Khan, or M. Bison.  Note to Namco, don't put in a boss that make Dollar store brand look like the choice for rich fat Rockerfellers!-At times money take a while to accumilate-Seriously someone other than a Mishima or Kazama has to win this timeNeutral:-When will Paul get his time(He's my favorite character, and he is a super cheezy super scruby I take most of your life with one hit character, but if he's that good, he shoulda won by now.  I feel sorry for the guy)-Hehachi is dead.( I dunno if many people liked him or not; personaly, I hate the old rotten sack of goat crap, but it's kinda wierd without the old fart in a diaper.  SO R.I.P. Heihachi, or is it?)Well the pros definitly outweigh the cons.  Tekken 5 punches out all other fighters with this hard hitting installment.  This series, the Virtua fighter series, and the Dead or Alive seriies are definitly 2 games fighting for that throne, but I gotta say Tekken wins.  Virtua Fighter 4 Evo, put in the profiling and stuff, but there were no end FMVs, and such, and it didn't take alot to win.  But still an inovator, and a excellent game.  Dead or Alive is known for the wemon in their game, I'll admit that's the reason I got that game, but it's still a contender, despite it's a button masher.  This game requires knowledge, you can't win by button mashing, you gotta know moves, or you're gonna lose, unless you're a chump and put it on easy.  This game has wemon, but it ain't as flashy as DOA because this series atracted gamers by it's uniqe way of skills, but a little skin never can or will hurt.  I guess after the dissapointing Tekken 4, they knew if they screwed up like that again, the Tekken name wouldn't sell this product.  So now they got off their butts, got in gear, and gave the people what they wanted:  A revitalized frachise showing a promising future, and that's what this game is.  If you love Tekken or fighting games for that matter, get this game.  If you have a PS2 get this game!Peace","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2005"}

By the time you really get into a game, it dies on you with little or no warning. So I suggest getting the battery kit along with or soon after purchasing the psp slim. It's around 40 bucks but I think it's worth it. If you don't, you won't really be able to depend on your psp anywhere you don't have an outlet or a cigarette adapter. I actually found myself not even bothering to bring it some places cause I didn't want to mess with plugging it in somewhere. Besides the battery prob, you can't beat the psp in portable gaming. The DS may be a little more interactive but if your're looking for more adult games, better graphics and the familier feel of a joystick, than psp is the way to go. Let's hope the next gen psp has 2 joysticks so we can enjoy those shooters as much as we do on the TV consoles.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2008"}
{"product_name":"B004YVOCYG","description":"","reviewerName":"Scottypiper \"Scottypiper\"","summary":"Another great installment to the series","reviewText":"I have been a fan of Assassins creed since I played the original game. I have picked up every entry since. This entry concludes the Ezio and Altair characters and ends the series in this time period. The next entry, Assassins Creed 3, moves into America during the Revolutionary War.Story: The story in Revelations picks up again with Ezio travelling to the Borgia controller city of Constantinople. The original stronghold of the assassins, Masyaf, is now overrun with Borgia. They are seeking to gain entrance to a library locked by Altair. It requires 5 keys that Altair had Niccol&oacute; Polo hide in Constantinople. Meanwhile, Desmond Miles is in a coma following the events ending Brotherhood and trapped in safe mode in the Animus. He must get the rest of the information from Ezio and Altair in order to separate his mind from theirs and awake from his coma.Gameplay: Open world, Stealth. Gameplay is very similar to Brotherhood and Assassins Creed 2. Combat is improved with a few new weapons and bombs. Bomb crafting plays a big part with the ability to craft 3 types of bomb classes while tons of variations in ingredients, powder, effect, and shell type. You still climb and run around on rooftops and climb towers to viewpoints. There are tons of side quests that include collecting animus fragments, hidden pages, finding books, treasures, and many others. You still get to take over the economy by renovating shops and purchasing landmarks. As you progress through the main missions, you get to recruit more and more assassins as you were able to in Brotherhood. You can use these assassins to attack targets, fire arrow storms, and send them on missions to other cities to level up and gain experience by completing missions. The main missions in this game include finding the Masyaf library keys, training master assassins, taking down Borgia controller towers, and investigating the activities of the Byzantines. Completed missions and side quests are marked by sync percentage. Each mission has a side element that you must adhere to in order to get 100% sync. If not, you only get 50% sync. You can replay any mission from the DNA menu to try and increase your sync percentage on each mission. As in brotherhood, you can renovate buildings for the Thieves, Mercenaries, and Courtesans factions. Each one has a mission for you as well as challenges that unlock special weapons.Multiplayer: I did not play any of the multiplayer modes in this game so I can't review that portion.A side note in this game, you can return to Animus Island where Desmond is located at any time. As you collect the Animus fragments during gameplay, you can open up 5 story sequences for Desmond. They are very different than playing as Ezio. These missions are first person and you eventually get blocks that you create to move around. During these memory sequences, you hear Desmond talk about his life as you progress. These are all optional.Conclusion: This game did not disappoint in any aspect. It has new elements and it brings back all the old elements. I love the gameplay in Assassins Creed. The story has lot added to it at the end of the game. It does explain a little more but it still might be confusing. If you are a fan of the Assassins creed games, this entry doesn't disappoint.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2012"}

Give this title a chance.","reviewText":"I'm a huge Gears of War fan, so buying this was a no-brainer for me.  I cashed in some Microsoft Store gift cards to purchase this title, which explains why I'm not a verified customer.  My username is my Xbox live handle if you ever wanted to play! (JASEFAT)In short, I think this game is great.  The new developer decided to remove DBNO, grenade wall tagging, and beat downs - I think all of these were bad ideas.  But then they added a deep class system, two fun new game modes, and extremely well designed maps (despite there only being 4 out of the box).  There are special passages for tickers only.  On one map, a helicopter with mounted troika circles the action.  Even snipers have their own dens that provide great visibility in tight maps.  All great innovations.The class system requires teamwork to win, and I think that's a great idea.  A engineer repairing a fence while support lays down cover fire makes for some interesting dynamics.  The game now forces teamwork, and while this was a staple of the single player campaigns, this is the first time its being forced in multiplayer.  The days of wall bouncing with a shotgun are still an encouraged play style in team death match, but in other game modes might not work as well.It's still a great Gears game - just a different take on what we're used to.  The only thing I'm upset about, as a huge Gears fan, is that this title is going to polarize the community between Gears 3 and Judgment.  With some time and an open mind, however, I think people will come to realize that sometimes change is good.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2013"}

As these survivors' allies mysteriously fall victim to dementia, it becomes clear that protecting a young girl granting them a bizarre immunity may be their only hope for survival in a struggle that could have implications for all of humanity.GameplayAlthough designed to preserve the feel of the action of the original game, gameplay inExtractionis also quite unique. First, the player perspective has been changed from third, to first-person, placing all the action right in front of you. Also,Extractionis a 'rail shooter,' meaning a shooter game where most of the action engaged in and paths followed are programmed into the mission play, instead of the freeform wandering ability built into the considerably larger Next-Gen and PCDead Spacerelease. The combination of these two changes funnels the players focus onto the combat options available in the game. In dealing with the danger of the alien Necromorphs swarming the game space,Dead Space Extractionutilizes the precision of the Wii Remote in variety of ways. Weapons like the Plasma Cutter can dispatch these enemies from a distance by taking advantage of the remote's pointing targeting ability, while a quick wave can activate weapons like the Ripper, a guidable spinning saw blade. The Wii Remote is also handy for picking up items and hurling them at enemies using the power of Kinesis.Other gameplay changes include new play modes. The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn't become too easy. In addition,Extractionalso features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed. Taken together all these changes add up to more action, more fun and moreDead Spacefor players on the Wii.Key Game FeaturesAn All-New Prequel Exclusively for the WiiFollow the lives of several different Aegis VII colony members as they carve a bloody path to survival.Meet a new cast of characters, destroy fearsome new enemies, and wield brutal new weapons.Real TerrorStunning graphics, panic-inducing audio, and a frenetic first-person perspective thrust you headlong into the terror.Play through an engrossing, interactive horror movie experience that raises the bar for storytelling in video games.Intuitive ControlsStrategically dismember your enemies with pinpoint control using the Wii Remote.Wield a powerful arsenal of abilities and weapons to freeze enemies, manipulate gravity with telekinesis, solve puzzles, and fight off attacks from every direction in zero gravity.Co-Op GameplayTeam up with a friend to fight off the invasion on the USG Ishimura with jump-in cooperative play.Combine efforts on engineering puzzles or determine specific roles to create a unique experience with each play session.","reviewerName":"Carlos A. Ramos \"Voltaire Tempentry\"","summary":"Best Light Gun Game on Wii","reviewText":"Dead Space Extraction is a prequel to EA's 2008 Dead Space on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The prequel tells the story of what happened planet side on Aegis VII as well as early developments on the Ishumura. Extraction takes a somewhat different approach to the Dead Space formula, and while it still retains a bit of what made DS great (stasis, zero-G, strategic dismemberment), it plays like a different game. And thats not necessarily a bad thing.DS:E is very focused on the in-game story and plot. The developers (Viceral and Eurocom, the prior which is the developer of the original DS) have made that one of the top priorities. The story follows a small group of survivors as they try to escape the outbreak of dementia and eventually, necromorphs. The narrative is mostly well written, with interesting characters and decent and unexpected plot twists. the quality of the story is a very important part of the game, seeing as how the story itself is such a large part of the game. Its so well done in fact, that much of the game feels as though you are watching a movie, some cheesy one-liners included!Extraction plays like an on-rails shooter, with some tendencies that break the norm for the genre. The game is slow paced; it builds suspense and eventually plays on it. DS:E is like your The House of the Dead games only in the fact that you have little to no control of your movements and camera. You wont be shooting everything in sight for an entire level, extraction is much more sophisticated than that. The slow, suspenseful segways between waves of necromorphs helps make those encounters incredible intense.The graphics are some of the best I've ever seen on the Wii. The lighting is superb, character models are greatly detailed with believable expressions, and environments are sharp, clear, and look great. The zero-G sections (mainly towards the end of the game) are truly a sight. The frame-rate does take the occasional hiccup, and while its not exactly rare, it doesn't ruin the experience.One of the most disappointing aspects of the game is the bugs, or technical malfunctions. On more than one occasion i had to restart my Wii because the game had frozen during a load screen. On more than one occasion, the game failed to load correctly, and i was left half-way through a level with no was to proceed. Several times the voices and characters had become unsynchronized, and other times the voice would simply not play, leaving a character lip-syncing to an inaudible and non existing \"voice\".These mishaps are major skid marks on an otherwise remarkable polished game. DS:E is a fun, marvelous looking game that provides deep story information for those into Dead Space lore. Its a bit short like most light gun games (roughly 5-6 hours), but the game includes a bonus challenge mode which, along with the arcade style of light gun games, are sure to keep you coming back for more. Extraction is by far the best on-rails games I've played on the Wii.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0016C3260","description":"Valkyria Chronicles is set in a fictitious continent reminiscent of 1930s, Europe divided in two and ruled by the Empire and the Federation. The Empire has set its sights on invading a small neutral country called Gallia, which is situated in the middle of the two great empires. The game follows a hero named Welkin and his fellow soldiers of the Federation's 7th Platoon that are fighting against the Empire, who is intent on unifying the continent under its power. The Federation discovers that the Empire possesses a secret weapon, known as the &#xBF;Valkyria&#xBF;- an ancient race with special powers thought to exist only in legends. With this new discovery, the fate of the Federation&#xBF;s ability to win the war and a hope for a better future hangs in the balance.","summary":"You'd be dumb not to play this game.","reviewText":"Well not really, but its still an amazing game. Valkyria Chronicles is a PS3 exclusive RPG set in a fictional European country during World War II. RPG is loosely accurate actually; its more of a half RPG, half turn based military strategy game. Its quite unique, and with over 30 hours of single player content plus a few DLC packs, you'll get more than your money's worth for this title.Its an RPGYou control a character named Welkin Gunther (son of a famous deceased military general) who fights in the militia of a fictional neutral country. You command a small squad of militia up to about 10 persons on the battlefield. The story follows your militia squad and the troubles and triumphs of fighting in a war to defend your country. There are several thematic elements (love, racism, power, greed, death) but they aren't over done to be too obvious. And surprisingly there isn't too much dialogue. The voice acting is top notch, I was really impressed and immersed throughout the experience.Leveling your troop is done through traditional rpg style with a small twist. You fight battles which depending on how quickly you win them, nets you experience and cash. XP is used for leveling, cash is used mainly for purchasing upgraded weapons. Instead of leveling up individual characters, you level up a class. Each of your militia fighters are one of five classes:1. Scout2. Shocktrooper3. Lancer4. Engineer5. SniperYou don't have to worry about playing both your snipers in battles evenly so they keep the same level (if they were to become lop-sided the lower level char would be worthless in battle); instead, you level up the entire sniper class. What this allows you to do is focus on which people have the right potentials to get the job done, instead of trying to balance levels and experience. What are potentials? Each character has passive abilities that are gradually unlocked through playing missions. Abilities may range from being a City Kid to a Desert Allergy or Sniper Killer to Likes Men or Undodgeable Shot. The City Kid ability will grant the character a boost in defense when on paved roads whereas Desert Allergy will drop the character's defense in that environment. Each character has a number of positive and negative potentials. Picking the right people for each mission plays a role in your ability to win, and win quicklyIts a Turn Based Strategy, sort of...When in a battle: you select a character, move that character to a position, and perform one action. Actions are healing, firing a weapon or grenade, or repair (for Engineers). But instead of doing all this from a top down view, once you select a character to control you drop into 3rd person mode to move that character around in real time. Then once you are in the position you want (or your movement points are all used up) you can select your target to fire (you can actually do this in the reverse order: fire first then retreat). Once you select to fire you can't move in that mode. Enemies can't fire at you either. You can take all the time you want to in order to line up your headshot or mortar blast. Once you have taken your action you can move around some more or end your turn. When you are moving your character, enemies can fire at you but they cannot move. Also, only enemies with unlimited ammo can attack you - tanks' machine guns, scouts' and engineers' rifles, and shocktroopers' machine guns. Lancers and Snipers are zero threat during the movement phase.This unique movement style makes Valkyria Chronicles somewhat of a hybrid between real time strategy and turn based. On the one hand, you move your characters in real time. On the other, you can only move one character at a time and you move all your characters on your turn, then let the computer opponent have a turn. To make things more interesting (and different), you don't just move each character once. Each turn you get a set number of Command Points (CP). These points are used to select a character to act with. But you can chose to select the same character multiple times in one turn. This drastically changes the tactics available for a given mission. You can have a scout run to the other side of the map, you can have a sniper fire multiple shots, you can have a tank fire several mortar rounds to take out large packs of enemy soldiers. With a traditional turn based strategy, you only move each unit one time; with VK whatever strategy you want to try is yours. Plus unused points carry into the next round. You can chose not to use too many points one turn. Then use the overstock of points the next turn to enable your victory.Not enough for you? There are also command orders that you can issue to improve one or all units. These orders cost command points (usually 1 point for 1 unit or 2 points for all units) and they can be stacked. Orders are anything from Defense Up or Anti-tank Attack Up to Medic Evac and Sniper Support. Imagine beefing up a simple scout with increased defense and anti-tank attack. Then have it charge at tank and mess that sucka up!37 hours to beat the gameAnd I haven't started the downloadable content yet. The game is spectacular in almost every way. But no game is perfect and I have a few gripes. The game follows the formula of watch some dialogue, play a mission, watch some more dialogue. Both dialogue and missions are presented in one book that you are 'reading through' page by page. Each dialogue or mission is represented by an episode in this book. You cannot skip most episodes. They must be watched/played. There may be as many as 7 or 8 episodes between missions. Not so bad right? The story and voice acting is good so what's the problem? Everytime you select the next episode it asks you if you are sure that you want to play it. So follow me as we go from one mission to the next. We just beat a mission, yipee. New episode added, ok let's watch it. Yes, select the confirmation that we are sure. Great video, next episode pops up. We now select that new episode and another confirmation pops up that we have to select. And we do this 5 more times... You cannot queue up the episodes, you can't say yes play all the episodes until the next mission. You can't turn off the confirmation. Oh and you can't do hardly anything else in the game except play the next episode. Stop asking me if this is what I want to do! Of course I want to see the next episode. Its the only way to get to the next mission! Ugh, this annoys me.Next up, auto-save. Its no where to be found. Why would you make a game without auto-save? Is this 1989? Every other game does this so it can't be that hard to implement. This was definitely a highly missed feature that has no reason to be absent.Lastly, trophy support. I'm a trophy whore so I missed them badly in this game. Instead the game went with this weird medal system where they don't tell you what you did to earn the medals. I love trophies, I like being able to see the game accomplishments outside of the game. You don't go with trophy support at launch that's fine; add it later please. You don't go with trophy support at all that's fine; don't have a similar system that's far inferior - stupid medals.Overall, this game rocks. I clocked a lot of hours of gameplay on it and I'm going to keep going with the DLC. I really hope there is a sequel in a couple years with some of these issues cleaned up. Still, the gameplay is solid and unique; Valkyria Chronicles is a terrific title that I would recommend to any strategy fans.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2010"}

Now on to the gameplay, in most reviews everyone says &#34;Reptitive, omg so repetitive.&#34; While it is a bit repetitive, that can easily go away. I tried counting the executions you can do, and there are a total of about 100 different executions. 100!! If you are doing the same executions over and over, either you're lying or didn't upgrade a lot of your executions. Points can EASILY be earned to upgrade skills and executions.

And now that I'm thinkin about it, I'd say this new release is actually a touch better than that milestone classic. Bold words,I know, but give this game a chance and you'll understand where I'm coming from. SA2 is instantly accessible, and it stands as the perfect compliment to the more methodical Mario games already in your collection. Thisgame isn't about depth, it's about it's all about flash and energy, and I mean that in a good way. The game does have one big flaw:it's length. Experienced Sonicheads will blow through this short adventure in less than 3hrs. After you finish the game with Sonic, you can play through as one of his buds, but really it's the same game regardless of wh you are playing as.

I bought the game out of nostalgia and am pleased with the purchase. Some things have been streamlined, travel is a bit faster and *slightly* less tedious and there is a little bit of new stuff. Some of the new features are gimmicky, others are nice (like the use of the Wii U gamepad and motion controls for aiming). There isn't a ton of new material that I have gotten to yet, but the graphics have been polished up a bit and it plays every bit as smoothly, if not more so, than the original on Game Cube.If you liked Windwaker, you might want to consider getting the game.  If you loved Windwaker, you probably already own it or plan on it. If you didn't like Windwaker before, you will probably hate it just as much now if not more so because it is a remake and re-release.  It still has the same charming cartoon style with text-based story and no voice acting, just as before, which means most people will love it or hate it.10 years ago this would have been a 5-star game for me, but now I can only give it 4-stars because I really enjoy it but it doesn't offer so much new material that I can call it an exceptional gaming experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2013"}

I have a Wii and PS2 and have been waiting to get a newer system for a long time. I almost bought the 4gb Xbox 360 due to its affordable price. But ultimately PS3's exclusive titles eventually made me cave in, even if the console costs more than I wanted to spend. I can't comment on PS3's Blu-Ray capability or other media functions since I just use a DVD player for those. The 250gb Move bundle is a better deal, but I'm holding off on Move to see if the games are good or not. I already have a Wii for interactive games and to be honest when I play the more serious titles I would rather not be moving around.The only thing I would suggest being careful of is placing the PS3 in a small spaced entertainment unit. It feels a little warmer than I'd like so I'm going to get a small open table to place it on next to my TV. Also, the textured finish is only on the top and bottom of the unit, and I'm not sure why Sony wouldn't just place it all around...

{"product_name":"B00140P9G0","reviewerName":"sft","summary":"No cakewalk this one","reviewText":"This is one clever game. The concept is simple but brilliant: you're trapped in the labs of Aperture Science and you have to get out. To assist you you're given a portal gun. The gun opens doorways in almost any surface. Once you have full control of the gun you can create blue and amber portals. Step into the blue one and you emerge from the amber one, step into the amber one and you emerge from the blue one. By positioning the portals in certain ways you can step, jump,  or fall huge distances. You can also use them to redirect lasers and bullets, which you must do in order to stay alive. All through your efforts to escape you're teased and goaded by GLaDoS, the AI that runs the lab. As with all Valve games the writing is excellent, with GLaDoS delivering some perfectly-pitched lines (and a cute little song at the end). Each challenge is more difficult than the last but none is so frustrating as to annoy, and all are satisfying when solved. My only criticism is that the maps lack variety as you travel from one austere lab to another, or from one utility area to another (this appears to have been addressed in Portal 2, which offers a wider range of environments). All-in-all this is one of the most imaginative games I've ever encountered. Check out the Orange Box though, because this offers the excellent Half-Life 2 games and Portal as a bundle and is great value.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2011"}

I felt that the stand out feature of the game was the plot. Here, Lara Croft and her ship's crew are stranded on an island unable to escape and surrounded by madness... the question isn't whether or not she can survive, it's how much chaos and destruction will she cause in the process?Other than an overreliance on quicktime events, which are seemingly plaguing every major game these days, the only real drawback that I have is that the game basically feels like Uncharted, but instead of Nathan Drake and his one-liners, you play as Lara Croft. Undoubtebly, Tomb Raider was a major influence on the Uncharted franchise, given that they have essentially the same plot. However, it seemed a bit odd, that this updated version of Tomb Raider looks and plays so much like Uncharted, albeit with more blood. I'm a big Uncharted fan, so I didn't mind the similarities, but I don't really feel that this is a \"Tomb Raider\" game.In conclusion, if you are a fan of Uncharted, definately check it out, but if you are expecting old-school Tomb Raider action, where doing sideways backflips while simultaneously gunning down tigers was the norm, you will probably be disappointed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2013"}

Those 5 years seem to have been well spent. Between Legend, Anniversary and Underworld...they came out so close to each other that it was easy to tell there wasn't enough time for that polish.This new game is polished to an amazing degree. Even at 720p, this game is beautiful. Lara has never looked better (not even when Angelina took on the role). The environment is utterly amazing. When I had to cross a fallen tree like a balance beam and looked down, the vertigo effect was so convincing I kinda got woozy myself.That is also the most intense first 10 minutes I have ever had in a Tomb Raider game. Scratch that. That is the most intense first I have ever had in a game...including Mass Effect 2 where in it's first 10 minutes the Normandy was destroyed and Shepard went EV. I mean...that was freaking INTENSE! And it hasn't really let up since then.However...there is one problem. It only vaguely feels like a Tomb Raider game. You have the ledge grabs, the shimmies, the jumping and grabbing. But that's only a small part of a Tomb Raider game.The puzzles feel less like getting through ancient death traps and more like figuring out ways to escape a cult hideout and survive in the wilderness.The battle system is nice. It's always thrilling to keep getting headshots. But even that seems vastly different from every other Tomb Raider I've ever played. And as realistic as they've tried to make this game...these people are taking a lot of shots (that aren't headshots) before they finally drop. Unless they're all on PCP (which doesn't seem unlikely to be honest)...they should be dropping after far fewer shots.But that's all really nitpicking. Because maybe what Tomb Raider's been needing is a complete overhaul. It could be argued that Tomb Raider Legend was supposed to be that overhaul...and it was. But it was a more minor overhaul. It gave Lara a few new abililties and updated her movements from being a tank on a grid to something more fluid. But combat and over all gameplay seemed very much the same.Here, there's still a few things that say &#34;Tomb Raider.&#34; Not much, but they're there if you look for them. And this is probably the first time in the past several games where I picked it up and it didn't just feel like more of the same.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2013"}

This one is another great edition to the series. It does take a bit of time to install the first time you load the disc so be ready to wait at least 20 min for it to finish. Also, there is no manual, its on the disc itself. More and more games are doing this which I don't agree with. You pay $60 for the game I think a small booklet is ok to include. I know its the paper reduction thing but when you need to see the controller layout its easier to quick look at the manual. Just my feeling. There's also the UPlay account that you register for to get in game rewards.You have the choice to play alone offline or online in a multi-player spy vs merc.  I tend to play alone because those online rooms are way to rough, players hide right where you enter the game and kill you immediately, takes all the fun out of it. There's also different degrees of difficulty too in the one player game.I like all the different weapons and of course the night vision. There's plenty of gadgets also which are cool. Its a fun game with a story line too. The graphics keep getting better and better, they are amazing in this game. I can't wait for a PS4 version someday in the future when its released i'm sure it will be incredible. The surround sound is great, really makes a difference in game play. Stealth is one of the main things in this game so master it and you'll do well.Game play itself is easy, controls feel good and there are plenty of visuals to help you along your way. Most of the controls are laid out well. I tend to get confused when there are too many combo buttons to do something but happily on this game there aren't any. Shooting and aiming are easy and selecting weapons easy too. If you've played the other Splinter Cell games then it will all be familiar to you. If you haven't it will be easy to pick up fast.There's a lot of curse words and of course blood so be aware if buying for a kid.

I enjoyed the heck out of it, it is more of the stuff you like from the demo.The story isn't too bad, it has it's moment of campy-ness, but really it is just a vehicle to get you out of the door and into the action-packed fighting which is the best part.I thought that the lack of gore from fighting all robot enemies would bother me (I am a big action/horror/etc. fan) but it felt so good that I never felt shorted with the lack of gore. Very family friendly action and just flat out fun.The graphics are excellent for the fast paced future shooter, constantly running at a smooth framerate (I never noticed any stutter). Nothing really more to say, if you grab the demo on PS3/Xbox 360 you can tell in about 10 mins if this is your type of game or not... if the demo bores you, then skip it, because the full game is just a lot more well-executed content like the demo.If you dug the demo like me, then buy this, you'll enjoy it :)P.S.> This is a single player experience only, no multiplayer. The replay value would come from trying to get higher scores between levels and go for achievements or finding the little figurines through out the environment.P.P.S.> I bought the PS3 version, but the company that produced this has expertise on both platforms and this time didn't write for 1 then contract out the porting to another.

Controlling resources in the seas and mounting attacks from all directions are strategies that must be employed to achieve victory.Cooperative Mode Lets You Team Up with Your FriendsRed Alert 3 has a fully co-operative campaign mode where you and a friend can play together to achieve victory. This means that you have to develop a strategy together, as well as execute it in synch in order to win. If your friends aren't online, you can also choose one of several AI commanders as your teammate.Play Against Your Friends in MultiplayerWith the different units and play mechanics of each faction, you and your friends will have a great time playing against each other, perfecting different strategies to best suit the units you have and the maps you play on. And thanks to the balanced game play, no one will have an unfair advantage.For previous fans of Command and Conquer, Red Alert 3 will provide the same light-hearted game play, but with more units, more strategies, and more fun. Newcomers to the game will soon see what all the fuss and laughter is about.Minimum System RequirementsOperating SystemMicrosoft Windows XP / Vista (32-bit)CPUXP: 2.0 GHz (Intel Pentium 4; AMD Athlon 2000+; Multiple Cores) / Vista: 2.2 GHz (Intel Pentium 4/AMD Athlon 2200+/Multiple Cores)Memory512 MB for Windows XP; 1 GB for VistaHard Drive Space6 GB / 12GB for EA LinkDVD Drive8x SpeedGraphics HardwareNVIDIA GeForce 6800, ATI Radeon X1800 or higher end DirectX 9.0c compatible graphics cardSoundDirectX 9.0c compatible (Creative Sound Blaster Audigy cards require a Intel P4 2.6 GHz or similar under Vista, Yamaha Xwave-512 not supported)Online Multiplayer512Kbps or faster Internet connectionInputKeyboard, mouse","reviewerName":"C. Weaver","summary":"A Interesting New Set Up For A Good Game.....","reviewText":"I sort of like the new look of the Red Alert 3. It's a bit more cartoon like but the game play was great. I haven't run into any problems with the DRM problems yet but that's because I haven't had to redo an installation yet. (I usually don't redo systems unless I up grade or install a new OS which is coming up soon.) The game played great on my system. (P4 2.8 gig, Nividia Geforce 6200 512 Mg video, 4 gig RAM) and I see no problem with running it on a system slightly below mine. So that  should be no problem at all on an higher end system. As far as the story line goes, I really didn't expect the storyline to stay the same anyway. The only negative I can see is if one makes frequent changes to the system, then they could run into problems on the limited number of installations allowed. (BTW: I feel this really doesn't make sense to me to hit the person buying the game for what some other people are doing. Instead it seems required the original disk be in the drive sounds like a better way to protect the rights holder.) Overall, I like this game. Much better than \"downloading\" the games as in \"Ultimate Command & Conquer\" where you don't get a physical disk with the games on it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"Steven","summary":"The first XBox 360 game that truly blew me away.","reviewText":"It's rare these days for games to really blow me away. I've been playing games for years and in the last few years it seems that no matter which game I play, it seems as though I've been there - done that. In rare occasions games will break new ground, but more often then not it seems as though games use rehashed formulas that have been tried and true, albeit boring at times.Really, when it comes down to it Bioshock doesn't really break new ground per-se, it just does everything right. It features a rich story line, great play mechanics, amazing voice acting and mind-blowing graphics. Lets talk about each of these subjects.The Story LineI never like to give away too much in my reviews, so I'll just say what you probably already read about if you read anything about this game. The game starts out with you stranded in the middle of the Atlantic ocean. You don't know much of what happened, except that you were involved in a plane crash. You spot a lighthouse in the distance, next thing you know you're being sucked into the city of Rapture. At first sight it seems like Rapture is a great place to be. You hear stories of how the city doesn't let religion interfere with science and that the city of Rapture offers true freedom. You quickly realize Rapture isn't as perfect as it seems at first (go figure). You quickly learn of a man named Andrew Ryan, the main bad guy involved in the rise and fall of Rapture. Immediately you feel as though you must find out what exactly is going on here. The story sucks you in and doesn't let go, one of the reasons this game is so great. You will come across many diaries in the game that you must listen to, so you can fully understand the somewhat complex story line. Don't worry, each diary is spoken and can be listened to while you play.Gameplay MechanicsBioshock is an FPS, with a few RPG-ish elements. The game is based in the 1960s, so you wield weapons of that period. What's really cool is that you come across what's called Plasmids that alter your DNA and allow you to perform incredible feats such as throw fire, throw electricity, and throw just about any other object through telekinesis. There are quite a few plasmids available, the only trick is deciding which ones you want to keep. You only have a few slots for plasmids, so you must choose carefully. More slots will become available as you play.To obtain plasmids you must gather a substance called Adam. The way you obtain Adam is through little girls called little sisters, which harvest Adam from dead bodies. You have to defeat \"Big Daddies\" in order to get to the little sisters and harvest the Adam. Once you beat the big daddy you have a choice. You can free the little sister of her parasite and gain a little bit of Adam, or you can sacrifice her to gain the maximum amount of Adam. This decision can be tough. You are promised that if you free them you will be rewarded, however if you free them you only get 1/2 the Adam. Also, your decision will alter the storyline a bit. Also, you can purchase tonics with Adam. Tonics are passive in that they don't really give you any new attacks, instead they offer abilities such as walking faster, or taking less damage from attacks.One other cool feature is that you can hack machines such as cameras and vending machines. In order to hack a machine you have to beat a little fun mini-game, which will vary in difficulty depending on the machine you're hacking. Typically if you hack machines such as vending machines you will be offered more goods and lower prices. If you hack cameras and guns then they will turn on your enemies. There are many more gameplay elements, but I don't want to make this review much longer then it already is. Trust me, there is plenty here to have fun with.Graphics and SoundThe sound effects and voice acting in this game is way above average. Every line is spoken so convincingly that it really does help draw you into the game. The music in this game fits the theme perfectly.The graphics in this game are nothing short of amazing. In fact, these are some of the best graphics I've ever seen in my life - on any platform. The dynamic lighting is amazing, the fog effects are incredible, the water effects are some of the best I've ever seen. This is the first time I've been truly blown away by graphics on the XBox 360. I can't believe how amazing this game looks. Everyone was all excited about the graphics on Gears of War. I never really understood why. The visuals on GOW are good, but the color palate grew boring - everything seemed to be some sort of gray hue. Bioshock however has a very large color palate, from very dark and Doom-esque to very bright and vivid. The textures are very realistic. If Bioshock was a 10 for graphics, then Gears of War would be a 4 just because Bioshock is much more beautiful and very dynamic. The first time you see a spotlight shining along the wall you will know exactly what I'm talking about.Don't get me wrong, I'm not a graphics snob, but when graphics are this good it really does help draw you in. You always hear people say \"Graphics don't make the game\". Although there is truth to that, visuals like this really do make the game more immersive. It's like the difference between standard and HDTV... it's just better.To conclude I would like to say that this is a must own single player game. This game does just about everything right. Although each element in this game in itself isn't really ground-breaking, the way everything is tied together so perfectly is. I didn't explore everything in this review, that job is up to you. Go buy this game and find out what makes Bioshock such an epic experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2007"}

Many concepts, regarding gameplay, were brought into the limelight because of this game.The Story:-  The protagonist Desmond Miles is a being held prisoner by a genetic research company named Abstergo. He is forced to use an apparatus called the Animus, that makes him relive his ancestors' memories, in search of a Piece of Eden. His ancestor, Altaire, is a part of an assassin organization that kills people the master deems a massive threat to society (people likely to cause war, etc.). You find out that Abstergo is run by Templars who are the ultimate enemy of assassins. I'm not going to spoil anything else.- It is very well done and thought out. Takes a fictional depiction of events and people, and just makes it epic.Pros:- It's open-world and an extremely massive game spanning 3 ancient cities with RPG-like aspects (gaining new weapons and abilities as you progress in the game)- You get to learn a little about the future in between DNA Sequences (Chapters), providing more depth to the overall story.- There's a lot to do to help make your assassinations go smoother (Save citzens from corrupt soldiers/officers, pickpocket important letters, help fellow assassins out in a crisis of their own)- The gameplay which is basically an artsy hack 'n' slash (if caught by guards) or an artsy stealth game. The free-running around the city is fun and efficient.- The story and characters make for decent immersion.- Graphics are pretty nice, especially for this game being released 6 years ago.- Assassinations are fun and epic.Cons:- The worst amount of collectibles in any game I have ever played, they don't even offer anything to the story, they're just for achievements.- The voice acting is cringeworthy (detracts a little from the game)- The combat is groundbreaking and raises the standard on combat, but it is very repetitive with not much variety.- Such a massive game, it gets repetitive quickly.- Only fast travel between cities, not within the city. (Cities are massive and take a long time to travel through)Other:- I got 650G on one playthrough, most of the other achievements were collectibles.- No DLCBuy this game if:- You are interested in any of the other Assassin's Creed games because the story continues throughout each game in the series.- You like games with stealth and straightforward combat. (it's really fun)Don't buy this game if:- It's over $20-You hate traveling slowly.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2013"}

Vasiljevic \"Marko V.\"","summary":"A nice play but not even near legendary games","reviewText":"AFTER INSTALLATION OF BOTH DISCS CLICK DATA OPTION AND IMPORT ALL EXPANSIONS (QUESTS).I started to play Fallout 3 with some reserves since even Fallout 2 wasn't near the first part of the game.I was happy to see weird humor (Moira Brown's Wasteland Survival Guide Quests) in a game again and design that was true to Fallout world, just translated into 3D.Like it usually happens, the beginning of the game is real good in order to hook players. For me, game is not so good after and the end is bit anticlimactic.I disliked how combat is done: shoot from VAT or shoot like FPS, and that is it. I preferred old Fallout turn-based, more RPG-like type of combat.Game has lot of battles and lots of shooting so RPG feel has been kinda lost.For beginners and old fans: game is combat oriented more than previous ones. You HAVE to have high small guns statistics. Make sure that you have lot of points in big guns and energy weapons statistics later in the game. Ammo is scarce and you have to be proficient at at least small weapons and big guns both. You want to carry weapons for all kind of ammunition all the time. Have in mind that weapons and armor have condition statistic (low condition = low damage or damage resistance) and that you should be able to repair them to make them work good, so put some points in repair too...another lame thing, how can someone waste away laser gun by using it?Make sure your lockpick is 50. Hacking is also needed to be 50 before you get into Robco Facilities. When you buff all that, pay attention to medicine stat; for instance, stimpack can replenish 150 points when medicine stat is high.There is quasi bug in the game in some quests. For instance, you have to cure someone to get quest done and you have some stimpacks he asks you and nothing happens. Point is, you have to have five of them, no less, and nobody tells you that what you have is not enough. I collected medicine, rad x, rad away and so on before I read that I needed 5 packs...this was really lame...There are five expansions for game:Operation: Anchorage, which is a shooter and nice to be done first in order to get some cool equipment; The Pitt, which is survival horror like, with too much splatter; Broken Steel, shooter based quest, Point Lookout, a completely new big map and Mothership Zeta. I can only object that last one has lot of bugs and reports that stuff in game is done when it is not, while other things are Ok. Some quests, like MZ and BS need insane ammount of Stimpacks before you get in and lots of ammo. Point Lookout is difficult, but at least you can get fruit for free and use it to replenish energy.All in all, it seems to me that Fallout 3 was designed with idea to make another quasi shooter with great graphics to get younger audience hooked up and use good elements from original games. Transition to 3D world (graphics-wise) is successful, but there are MUCH better games out there, and this one is not even close to legendaries like Diablo, Deus Ex, Fallout 1, Arcanuum, Final Fantasy VII and so on...this game is overestimated, just like Uncharted 2.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2010"}

{"product_name":"PlayStation 3 40GB System","summary":"Pretty good right now, but should be great soon.","reviewText":"I very recently got my 40GB PS3 and immediately swapped in a 160gb HDD.Let's first talk about the improvements made to the new PS3. This 40gb version adds new blu-ray features, as well as a 65nm cpu, which runs cooler and theoretically will last longer. 40gb is obviously twice as large as the 20gb. Now for the bad, the really bad. PS2 Compatibility is completely gone. This is an extremely large issue for me. Why? Because it further limits the potential games you can play on this \"multi-media machine.\" Yes, it has blu-ray, but watching a regular DVD on my HD-TV via an upconverting player, I only can see a slight difference.Why did I give it 4 stars? The Good: Wifi, Blu-ray, superb graphics and an improving Playstation Network are all features of this bad boy. The hardware really has a ton of untapped potential, potential that will probably be fully used only after another 12-18 months. This is because the cpu inside, \"the cell processor\", is rather tricky to make games for, but extremely powerful at math, graphics  etc. I hopped into the PSN just hours after setting up my PS3 and bought Mortal Kombat II for $4.99, which was very cool. I'm very impressed by the built in OS, the hardware, the quality of the system and just about everything else. So what's the catch?There is unfortunately a really big downside, a total lack of games. What were the franchise games that built PS2? GTA, Gran Turismo, Tekken, Madden, Resident Evil and Final Fantasy. GTA IV just hit 3 days ago, Madden has been a bust and GT5 Prologue, as previously discussed, is a waste of time. This is the (only) arena where XBOX 360 has been stronger but it has been a big advantage for Microsoft. Buyers be warned, the newest XBOX 360's are still sporting 20% hardware failure rates.In conclusion, if you want a future proof (and extremely reliable) blu-ray/gamestation, I highly recommend this machine. However, if you need something you can plug in and play all the top titles on tomorrow, you'll be a bit disappointed. I still recommend buying this system because it has a brightening future. Metal Gear Solid 4, Final Fantasy and GT 5 are all coming out in less than a year, so try to hold on a little longer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2008"}

It is an experience wholly unlike any to come before it, and is certain to leave gamers talking and thinking about Vincent's tribulations long after the credits have rolled.","reviewerName":"The Matrix Fan \"Video Gamer since 1979.\"","summary":"If Jenga and Tetris shared a night of passion, this video game would be the fruit of their loins.","reviewText":"PROS:+ A humorous animated story balanced with addictive puzzle gameplay.+ Multiple endings based on user choices.+ Two-player Colosseum mode and Babel challenge stages increase replay value.+ On repeat playthroughs, you can skip levels with a Gold ranking.CONS:- Some puzzles can be very difficult, even in Easy mode.- Time limit gameplay can be frustrating for some players.PLOT:The story introduces us to Vincent Brooks, an average guy with an average job and no ambitions to better himself. He's been a faithful boyfriend to Katherine McBride for the last 5 years, but she's beginning to lose patience with Vincent. After a night of drinking, a mysterious woman named Catherine seduces Vincent and throws his world into chaos.Every night, Vincent dreams of climbing up dangerous towers of blocks and his skills are put to the test every time he closes his eyes. Strange deaths have been reported around the city and Vincent realizes that if he dies in his nightmares, he may not wake up at all...GAMEPLAY:There are 3 main areas of gameplay in Catherine:(1) The Nightmare stages - in his dreams, Vincent stands at the base of a block tower wearing only his boxers and holding a pillow. He is given one task: to reach the top alive. Blocks can be pushed or pulled, and Vincent has a number of different obstacles in his way...ice blocks, bomb blocks, trap blocks, and more. There are various powerups and Enigma coins scattered throughout each level.(2) The Landings - this is a resting place in between Nightmare stages. Vincent can talk to other sheep,  learn/teach climbing techniques, and use Enigma coins to buy powerups. He has to answer a question to advance to the next stage, which can affect the outcome of the game.(3) The Stray Sheep Bar - while he's awake, Vincent can interact with bar patrons, receive and send phone messages, play a mysterious video game called Rapunzel, and drink to his heart's content. Drinking to excess in the bar helps Vincent move faster in his nightmares...a useful survival skill!There's a lot to love in this game. There are separate types of animation for the gameplay and the cutscenes, and it kept me focused on the story as a whole. The music was excellent, ranging from synth-pop to classical. I also liked the multiple endings; I kept playing again and again to figure out how Vincent's life would turn out based on my decisions.Once the game is completed, it unlocks the option for 2 players to complete against each other in a race to the top on the stage of your choice.Finally, if you earn a gold ranking for a Nightmare stage, you can skip that stage on your next playthrough, which saves you time to complete the other endings.WHAT'S THIS I HEAR ABOUT RELATIONSHIP QUESTIONS IN THE GAME?Each question in the Nightmare stages is designed to make the player examine their relationship morals. Here are some of them:(1) Which is more \"cheating\" - an emotional tryst, or a physical fling?(2) Could you ever be paid enough to go nude in public?(3) Cosplay in the bedroom: Aye or Nay?(4) Could you show everything in your inbox to your lover?Your answers affect the end of the game, and if you're connection to the Playstation Network, you can see an average of how many people responded similar to you.TROPHIES:There are 50 trophies to earn in Catherine. You can earn trophies for watching each of the 8 endings, saving bar patrons from dying in their dreams, listening to trivia about alcohol, and more. Among the tougher trophies to earn are completing the Babel bonus stages, finishing all 64 levels of Rapunzel, and completing the entire game on Hard mode. Casual trophy hunters will earn roughly 9-15 in one playthrough, but for the trophy hounds, this game will challenge your puzzle solving skills.CONS:Atlus is a company known for their difficult games, and Catherine will challenge your patience just as much (if not more) than Demon's Souls did. You might be on a run, making a good pace, your score multiplier is maxed out, and right before you reach the top, you slip on an ice block and fall to your death. This game is all about patience and planning.The nice thing is, Catherine offers 4 difficulty modes. At the main screen, hover over the \"Golden Theater\" and hold down the Select button until you hear a chime. This will activate Very Easy mode. You can also change difficulties during the game if you're getting too frustrated.Since Catherine is a game with time limits, it can be very frustrating to gamers who like to take their time with puzzles. Each stage can be retried later on with infinite continues, which helps to ease the frustration.FINAL THOUGHTS:Catherine is one of the most unique games I have ever played. It's anime, it's about relationships, it's about responsibility, and it's a race to the top of a tower of blocks. It takes a little while to get used to the gameplay, but once you do, the next time you hear a church bell, don't be surprised if you find yourself thinking \"THE BELL! I'M ALMOST THERE!\"Recommended for purchase, and I would highly recommend it for a rental as well. If you want to get some extra goodies, check out the\"Love Is Over\" Deluxe Edition.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2011"}

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists. The only hope of the colonists seems to be a vault discovered in the side of a mountainside, rumored to contain alien technology and secrets about Pandora. Will this discovery be the colonist's salvation or their end?

McBeth \"PSN/XLive/Steam: DirkPittSpawn\"","summary":"Challenging and Tons of Gameplay","reviewText":"Overview:A 2 player one splitscreen or 4 player online FPS/RPG-sytle free-range shooter.The Particulars:The game is very similar to the Hellgate London-style of RPG/FPS. But that's just where it starts. The multitude of weapons makes it a lot of fun to scour the landscape for new weapons and upgrades. Hop in the vehicles to scour said landscape even further. The four characters each have their own specialties and on top of that, their own special ability. There are also tiers of different specialties that can be upgraded as you level up, allowing for you to unlock additional abilities in a particular tier.It is fun going through the different adventures and gathering loot. But the game's real strength lies in its ability to Coop online and splitscreen on the same system. The only thing you need to keep in mind is that the lower level individual should host, or else they will quickly become overwhelmed by higher level enemies.I'd recommend trying the game out. It starts out slow and easy and gives you instruction on how to use what you pick up as you go along. The art-style fits with the game and the humor is definitely a part of it, keeping it interesting as you perform quests and move through the Borderlands world.Replay:TONS. With four characters and the ability to play through the game with others you could go through the game several times with a variety of different experiences.Summary:I'd definitely recommend giving this game a go. It has a lot of different elements put together that make it something for everyone. The learning curve is small enough that I even had someone that doesn't even like playing FPS's playing this game Cooperatively.Edit: Forgot to include the Good/Bad/Ugly breakdown:Been playing it for a while, and the game is immensely fun with friends. However, if you're playing with joe randos, you could run into some problems.1) Ammo/Gun hogs. These individuals take all the good weapons. Weapons you could have used or sold for $$. First come, first served.2) Single-player, while \"ok\" isn't that great to go through on your own. This game is really focused on the team aspect and having the different characters to help you through \"Pandora.\" It can get boring real quick if you don't have some company.3) Split-Screen Experience. When playing offline with another, it feels like you're missing part of the action when the game goes to split-screen. The menus stay the same size, so you can't see the entire menu, but luckily they made it scrollable with one of the analog sticks.4) Loading / Transport. If playing with others, get ready to be yanked around. If someone initiates travel, chances are you're stuck going wherever they picked using the Fast Track. On the other hand if you try and initiate travel and someone is in a menu, it prevents it. In some instances this can be very annoying if they're doing it on purpose. Also, if someone takes one of the vehicles and races off, the good news is you can spawn in the gunner seat. Or if you're the 3rd or 4th wheel in the group you can spawn yourself another vehicle.5) Lag. While most of the games can be fairly reliable, there are some that will induce lag to the nth degree, making it near impossible to hit what you're aiming at. But you'll find yourself still taking massive amounts of damage.Does take a while to level-up, but I found on the 2nd playthrough the \"BadAzz\" enemies do help for Experience while adding that extra difficulty.The graphics do take a little to get used to, but you'll find yourself liking the art style more than likely. The humor is pretty funny as long as you pay attention and try to catch the little nuances that are thrown in as well.Hope that helps!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2009"}

I just finished playing through the first Splinter Cell, and it looked fantastic! Consider that this game was made almost 10 years ago. To my eyes the lighting effects have received a real boost, while the graphics look noticeably better than the old PS2 version I used to play. I'm not sure what some of the reviewers are talking about when they say this isn't in HD. It certainly is on my TV! Granted, the game is old and you can only do so much with visual remastering, so those who were expecting PS3 quality visuals have the bar set a bit too high. Thus far I have not noticed any visual glitches in these games, though some reviewers reported minor choppiness or frame rate issues. The only real downside I noticed, as mentioned by others, is that the cut scenes were not remastered. For me this isn't a major concern because the amazing gameplay is still intact, and that was the main point for me buying this trilogy. Don't really care for online play, so its absence isn't missed by me. Quality wise, I'd say this trilogy is right up there with the remastered ports of God of War I and II on PS3, both of which I also own.4.5 out of 5.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0010EI6T2","reviewerName":"paper tiger \"Adriel August\"","summary":"Very Disappointed","reviewText":"My hot girlfriend and I loved playing the co-op portion of the first Rainbow Six Vegas. We both were very excited to hear that a sequel would be coming out. We pre-ordered the game, picked it up and started playing it the day it came out. Much to our disappointment, the game lacked the intensity and fun of the original. The first Rainbow Six Vegas had many levels at night and in very cool scenes in Vegas. The second game was almost always during the day, and the maps of the levels kinda sucked. The scenes in this one were very boring and plain. The mapping reminded me of the original Rainbow Six or Rogue Spear games from ten years ago. Many of the levels were overly repetitive and there was much backtracking through levels we had already completed. Rainbow Six Vegas was fun and kept your interest no matter how hard or frustrating it was.The graphics are a little better, and the game play is about the same. Some little new improvements like your rank going up the further you get into the game and ordering other members to clear a room is pretty cool. Sound it good, but I heard tiny little clicks or pops from time to time. The game has its up sides; it is quite more real than the first one, but over-all, it really really lacked the fun and life that the first one achieved.Multiplayer online is pretty cool. I died within the first 30 seconds, but still pretty neat. The non-story, co-op terrorist hunts were pretty fun and somehow the graphics looked better in terrorist hunt than in the actual game.My biggest gripe is the game is really really short, and the ending sucks. My chick and I finished it in four days only playing a few hours a day.All in all, I was immensely disappointed, but it had its good parts. If I could do it all over again, I would just rent it from Blockbuster and save my sixty bucks.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2008"}

The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"Elliot","summary":"This was my first beer basically.","reviewText":"This was one of the first RPG I have ever played.  This game introduced many concepts to me on how gaming should be.  I read many reviews on how people hate characters or believe it's too linear from other FF titles.  I didn't understand those concepts or cared really back then.  This was my first beer or RPG.Pros1.  I really believe this story of all FF's I have played is the best.  The corruption of religion, the summonings are actually strong, and the protagonists and antagonists are actually interesting.2.  The graphics back then blew my mind away.  I was used to playing baseball games or playing twisted metal.  The only other title that could compete with graphics was MGS.Cons1.  I really didn't like 2 of characters on this game, and it was Wakka and Riku.  I just despised their personalitys, and how they could be so relaxed when at any time they could be blown to kingdom come from Sin.2.  I felt the story length compared to other RPG's I have played was kinda frail.  It only had a few sidequests for a few addional summons, ultra weapons, and of course Omega.  I felt it could have been expanded some.Overall this was a good beer to this day brings some good memories.

The gameplay is great, I personally think the addition of the charge-up meter for moves is great. Unlike what some reviewers might lead you to believe, you don't HAVE to charge-up to do a spin-move, juke, stiff arm, etc., it just raises the chance of the move being more successful.The game also comes with a nice football dictionary and guide in-game. The in-game handbook teaches football newbies the strength and weaknesses of all the formations, and explains all the complex football terms that you might PRETEND to know in front of your friends. This lets players who might not be experts of the game choose plays more successfully, especially on defense. In addition, for the first time I've ever seen in a football game, the game allows the defense to see what kind of formation the offense puts up before they choose their play. This is invaluable, because after all, that's how defense is played. And if you're too lazy to read the handbook or choose your plays, there's a (usually) very intelligent &quot;Coach's Pick&quot; that lets the computer suggest a play for you. Great stuff.However, the game itself does have some significant drawbacks. For one, the computer's clock management at the end of the first half is suspect. They simply do not run the two minute offense at the last two minutes of the half, and they don't run out the clock either. I've seen them run running plays with more than 60 yards to the end zone with :02 left in the half. And the &quot;Coach's Pick&quot; recommended that I go with a more standard defensive formation, as opposed to the more conventional prevent defense in that situation.I've also noticed that for some reason, short east-west passes are freakishly difficult to connect on. Not only is the quaterback's accuracy way off, but the reciever can't catch the ball!All in all, a great package. The presentation is great, the game is still fun, and most importantly, it's a great value.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2004"}

You basically point and hit a button to shoot cans, birds, and more out of the air.2.Find Mii-You look around a group of people to find a certain person in a certain amount of time.  My favorite game.3.Table Tennis-Like tennis, but it goes faster, and once you miss in single player, it's over.  In multiplay you play to 11 points.4.Pose Mii-The worst game, you twist the wiimote to fit a shadow in a bubble to pop it.  Younger kids mught like it.5.Laser Hockey-This is basically like an air hockey table.  You hit the puck back and forth to try to get it into the opposite player's hole.6.Billiards-The goal is to get the balls in the holes one at a time in numerical order.  First you get the 1 ball in, then the 2 ball, then the 3 ball, and so on.7.Fishing-You move the wiimote down to put it into water, and you pull it straight up when you get a bite.  The water is transparent, so you can see the fish.8.Charge-I call this game \"cow racing.\"  You have to get to the finish line in a set amount of time while knocking down as many scarecrows as you can.  In multiplayer mode, you just knock down scarecrows, you don't actually race.9.Tanks-You are a tank who can plant bombs or shoot bullets in an attempt to blow up the other tanks.  In multiplayer mode, you try to blow up more tanks than your partner on each level until you both die.  As opposed to other reviews there is a way to play this without nunchuks.
