{"product_name":"B0002CHJ3W","description":"Prince of Persia Warrior Within is a sword-slashing sequel to the hit game, Prince Of Persia: Sands Of Time. This time, our Prince is hunted by Dahaka, an immortal incarnation of Fate. The spirit seeks retirbution against the Prince, but he is wiser and deadlier than he was. To avoid his preordained death, he'll travel to the infernal core of mankind's worst fears.","reviewerName":"-- \"--\"","summary":"A Darker \"Prince,\" Not a Better \"Prince\"","reviewText":"\"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\" was a phenomenal game, and delivering a follow-up in just under a year is always a tricky proposition. However, that is exactly what developer Ubisoft Montreal did with \"The Warrior Within,\" a mostly worthy successor that unfortunately takes about as many steps forward as it takes backward.In a strange turn, \"Warrior Within\" trades in the storybook style of its predecessor for a hard-edged vibe, denoted by the series' switch from a \"Teen\" rated game in \"Sands of Time\" to its current \"Mature\" verdict. The prince continues his adventure as a darksome pirate, less boyish and more sinister, haunted by his past and the beast his actions unleashed. This beast, known as the Dahaka, pursues him relentlessly, it seems, giving him not a moment's rest. It devours everything in its wake, and the only way it can be stopped, the prince decides, is to find the mysterious Empress of Time... and kill her. It's an interesting switch in tone from the first game, but not an entirely successful one. The mood of \"Sands\" was considerably more original than what's offered up here, and the absence of Farah as a pivotal character is a sad loss to the franchise. Still, it suffices even if it's easy to mourn the alteration.Gameplay remains much the same, which is a great thing. The prince still has all the same nifty moves at his disposal (plus a few more), and is as nimble and easy to control as ever. In a curious plot hole, the character now lacks the dagger of time but can still rewind it provided he has enough sand in his possession - which is welcome, because this was the stand-out feature of the game's predecessor, and given the harder difficulty of this follow-up it's more useful than ever. Whether or not it makes logical sense from a story perspective is relatively moot. In any case, more time-shifting abilities crop up as the game proceeds, most of them aimed at helping the prince survive in battle.Speaking of battle, this is an area of \"Warrior Within\" that has seen much improvement, as combat was the weakest link in the \"Sands of Time\" chain. The new blood and dismemberment options still seem remarkably out of character, but the action itself is integrated much more skillfully into the gameplay - which is good, since combat plays a noticeably larger role this time around. The moves at the prince's disposal are much more effective than they were previously, allowing for more interesting combos and environmental attacks that sometimes prove necessary in surviving some rather challenging fights.Boss encounters are another new addition in \"Warrior Within,\" as there are several interspersed throughout. These are interesting in that while they are, for the most part, a welcome feature, the majority of combos are discouraged thanks to each boss's uncanny ability to block these kinds of attacks. Instead, defeating these nefarious characters basically involves lots and lots of rolling and flipping while occasionally coming in for a simple stab or slash, then repeating the process until they eventually die. These could have provided a great opportunity to rely on the game's new, more complex maneuvers, but instead they dissolve into a stick-and-move routine that's only so exciting.Perhaps the coolest addition to the game, however, is the Dahaka itself, which periodically pops up and forces the prince to flee for his life, usually over lots and lots of obstacles that get in his way. This provides a nice change of pace, adding loads of tension when it works at its best. Unfortunately, sometimes the camera's positioning during these sequences works against you, cropping out the dangers you're fleeing towards. Mostly, though, it's a rush of intense gameplay that shakes up the experience in a positive way.But despite the new and improved combat and the occasional Dahaka-haunted obstacle course, \"Warrior Within\" is a mere shadow of its predecessor's former glory, thanks in part to the shift in tone, but more importantly to its overall less impressive design. The hub system in the game artificially lengthens the experience, and not in a good way. Lots and lots of backtracking is required, and prepare to see the same environments over and over again during the course of the journey. What's more, sometimes it is extremely unclear what you are supposed to be doing, and where it needs to be done at, and given the massive environment, which you can roam almost freely, it can become rather mind-boggling and out and out aggravating. The first game just felt tighter, like a well-oiled machine. Not so with regards to the sequel.All in all, \"Warrior Within\" is certainly a very good game, but a disappointment as well. Hopefully a third installment will find a happy medium in terms of its tone, but more importantly add the much improved combat to a game that is less confounding and sharper in its design. In the end, though, \"Sands of Time\" is a tough act to follow, but, for the most part, its successor does its job admirably.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2005"}

Yet despite that I have a love for the Mario Kart series simply because it's always been just pure fun! This game is no different, and improves on the formula by including the long awaited online play, and best of all, there's no charge for it! (Pay attention Sony, Square and M$, free online!)The game play really hasn't changed all that much from the GBA edition, the player selects one of a handful of classic Mario characters and then chooses between two carts, then participates in a series of themed race tracks. The game has two modes, nitro, and retro. Retro collects a handful of fan favorites from previous games. Disappointingly a couple of them seem pretty similar to the new tracks, but there's still enough different to get excited about.I haven't really learned the tricks to this game yet, the ones you have to master if you want any hope of competing on even ground in 100cc and 150cc, like how Double Dash had the skid maneuver which allowed you to build blue flames that would boost your speed... 100cc and 150cc is where things get really hard, and mastery of this clever racer does take some doing. I haven't toyed with the online stuff yet, but it's there and it's free, and you can't beat that.The game does not appear to make much use of the touch screen that I have found yet but I think that's a good thing, as the second screen is somewhat of a distraction in this case. The game therefore plays almost identically to the SNES original.Graphically the game surpasses anything that I've seen on the DS so far, and is on par with the N64 edition. It's nice to the pixilazation the DS is notorious for brought to a minimum, it's barely noticeable. Best of all there are no framerate issues, and minimal clipping. Nintendo did a great job here.The music is kind of age old traditional midi, and not as good as the GCN edition, but its still one of the better sounding DS games.In all no DS owner should pass on this! Though not much has changed game play wise, and some of the tracks may be just rehash, its still one of the better installments of this series!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2005"}

The game has you, Indiana Jones playing through the 3 original movies of this series. You are accompanied along the way by some familiar faces. The game has loads of sidekicks, around 60 I believe. The game has 18 missions, 6 in each of the episodes, I have nearly beaten Episode 1. The game is fun and a break from most, however, the combat and simple puzzles quickly become repetitive. That's not to say it isn't fun, it's just the same thing over and over. The achievements are okay I have netted 110 in 1/3 of the game roughly so I expect to finish with around 350 or so. So if you love this series or the Lego series then you should probably rent this game, not a buy, but worth renting for a weekend. You can beat this game in around 10 hours if not less. So all in all, this one was okay for a rent, but not worth buying in my opinion.Overall 6.0-7.0","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2008"}

Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"Gameboy \"David\"","summary":"Pretty cool","reviewText":"I haven't really played this game all the way through..i'm only part way b/c I play a few minutes here and there.

Fortunately, Retro adds enough to make it something a bit more.The biggest innovation in the game is the choice between four Kong characters. In addition to Donkey himself, you get to choose from several \"buddies\", including Diddy, Dixie, or Cranky. Personally, I love the ability to select my character in a game and loved that the SNES games had a choice of two characters, so this was extremely fun for me. Moreover, each character feels very unique. Donkey is obviously the strongest and can use his ability to pull things (better than blowing!). Diddy has his little floating backpack. Dixie can helicopter with her hair. And Cranky uses his cane to bounce like a pogo stick. I particularly appreciated playing as Cranky because I'd recently placed the rereleased Duck Tales and was just wondering why more platforming games hadn't used Scrooge McDuck's pogo mechanic.That said, the characters do feel a bit unbalanced. As much as I loved playing as Cranky, Dixie is definitely the most useful. Beginners especially will find her ability to glide long distances to be invaluable. Still, I appreciate the choice. Mario games still don't provide nearly as many exciting playable characters.I also really like the Snowmads, the new animal Viking enemies. I always felt the Tikis in DKCR were a bit odd, not anthropomorphic enough to be satisfying enemies. By contrast, the Snowmads feel like real enemies and there's a good diversity of enemy types. There's something really fun about battling evil penguins, polar bears, and walruses. Of course, I'd prefer the Kremlings from the SNES games, but the Snowmads are the next best thing.The level design ranges from good to amazing. Generally, I'd describe it as more fluid than DKCR. There are more moving pieces to the stages and the environment is more interactive (think the Octopus stage in DKCR). I especially liked the musical levels, similar to those found in Rayman Legends but less \"on-the-rails.\" Finally, yes, we do see the return of the dreaded aquatic levels, but they're not quite as bad as I remember from the SNES days. It helps that you can wield Cranky's cane as a weapon underwater.On top of all that, the graphics are definitely a step up from DKCR, which was already a gorgeous game. Prepared to be wowed, especially during cutscenes.Unfortunately, the game isn't perfect. As much as I like the new features, I still can't help but feel the game doesn't go far enough. I remember Retro's developers saying they were excited about making DKC:TF because they could make Donkey Kong Country Returns better, including small things such as making the fur realistic. That sort of mentality pervades the game. It feels like this is the next level up rather than two or three levels up from DKCR. I'm not complaining, it's a fun game, but I do feel like there were some missed opportunities.The biggest feature I miss is animal buddies. Rambi makes a reappearance here, but we don't get any other animal buddies. That's a shame because animal buddies had always been a favorite. SNES' Donkey Kong Country 2 took the right approach in expanding the number and types of animals, which significantly increased the types of gaming possible within a single game. I'd almost have preferred this to more options with the Kongs because the animals just look awesome. Certainly not a deal-breaker, but I just don't see why Retro wouldn't have done this.I was surprised that DKC:TF doesn't include the superguide. In DKCR, if a player died a certain number of times, the game would provide an option to allow the computer to beat the level. This was a great way to allow inexperienced players to enjoy the game but also allow experienced players to challenge themselves. In DKC:TF, this is partly replaced by copious power-ups and the ability to buy lives at Funky's Shop (by the way, great to see him return!), but it's not quite the same. I worry as a result that this game will be less accessible to casual gamers, especially because some of the later stages are brutal.Finally, I'm not as enthusiastic about the soundtrack. This is SNES composer David Wise's return to the franchise, but oddly I felt the DKCR soundtrack was truer to the music of the original SNES games. The Donkey Kong music has always been simple yet catchy. I actually find the DKC:TF soundtrack a bit too rich for the franchise. It's not bad music, and in fact it's quite good in places, but doesn't feel like DK music.Overall, like its predecessor, this definitely pays tribute to the SNES Donkey Kong games whilst going further. There are some missed opportunities and I do wish it had pushed the boundaries a bit more, but it's great as it is. I'd easily give this 4.5 stars for probably the most fun I've had on my Wii U since Rayman Legends.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00DC7O77A","description":"","reviewerName":"Jack Treese \"Jack\"","summary":"A Barrel Blast to A Semblance of the Past","reviewText":"NOTE:  I originally wrote this review on Game Informer's website.It's no secret that the Donkey Kong Country series of games is one of the most beloved platforming franchises of all-time, leading back to the Super Nintendo days.  Many assumed DK's adventures would conclude after Rare went to Microsoft, but this wasn't the case thanks to Retro Studios, the developers of the acclaimed Metroid Prime series.  In 2010 Retro released the critically welcomed reboot known as Donkey Kong Country Returns, which featured some of the best, creative, and thoroughly difficult levels in platform gaming on the Wii.With Nintendo's Wii U, many wondered what Retro Studios' first game for the system would be.  Many speculated a new Metroid was upon us, so most of the internet seemed very surprised when Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze was announced during last year's E3 Direct broadcast instead.  After much skepticism and a three-month delay, Tropical Freeze has hit stores to critical acclaim.  And after spending hours traversing through its six worlds, I can safely say that critical buzz is totally called-for.The plot, like most of Nintendo's platformer outings, is very simple; after a crew of viking-themed enemies known as Snowmads make their way to DK Island and ruin Donkey Kong's birthday party, our hero and his crew--consisting of Diddy, Dixie and Cranky Kong--set out to make things right, across a diverse range of five other gorgeous islands.  These different islands pose threats to our crew in the form of walruses, owls, and even a monstrous polar bear.  Before going any further I should drive the point home that despite the kid-friendly looks and content, the levels are designed with the child-at-heart gamers that grew up with this classic franchise in mind.While the game boasts a mostly 2D presentation, don't let that throw you off.  Unlike previous Wii U 2D platformers (such as Mario's first outing on the console), these levels will leave you in awe of their lush environments.  Everything from background trees to glorious skylines are all catchy and appealing to the eyes in high-definition.  Retro Studios used their time wisely with this title, and it shows.  Even the fur on our starring Kongs look so realistic you'll want to pet them.Speaking of our stars, during the single-player campaign you'll obviously be spending most of your time playing as Donkey Kong himself, while the other Kongs can be found in the signature DK Barrels.  In some instances, you'll be able to choose which one spawns from the barrel by simply ground-pounding near it.  Each member of the Kong family offers something to help DK out.  Diddy Kong boasts a jetpack that can be used to float over a short distance.  Dixie Kong can use her hair to levitate higher briefly, which can help to get out-of-reach items or collectibles.  For his gameplay debut, Cranky Kong can use his cane like a pogo stick to bounce off of enemies or get through thorny spots, &agrave; la DuckTales.  When you've filled your Banana meter (which usually happens after getting 100 of them), DK and whomever he's with can use a Kong-POW attack, which turns all of the enemies into objects depending on who DK is with; Red balloons with Diddy, gold Hearts with Dixie, and Banana coins with Cranky.Series staples such as finding the K-O-N-G letters makes a comeback in this installment, and finding all of them will give every level good replay value for completionists.  In addition, players are tasked with finding puzzle pieces, which depending on the level there can be anywhere between five and nine of them to find.  During my initial playthrough, I haven't found every puzzle piece on a single level yet, so I've got a long way to go still.  During other levels, DK and his crew will find themselves using minecarts, rocket barrels and even Rambi to help finish levels.  Funky Kong makes a return in this game as well, offering goodies and 1-ups if you've got enough Banana coins to cover it.  Trust me, even the most proud of platforming experts will need to go to him at least once.All of this greatness comes down to one thing; the control scheme.  Or in this case, schemes.  The one thing I usually praise a Wii U game is also something I need to take to task with.  While there are an assortment of different control options--Wii remote, Wii remote with Nunchuck, Pro Controller, and GamePad--I would definitely avoid using the Wii remote options and stick with the other two.  However, even with these control schemes you'll be given a choice between two different configurations; either use the D-Pad or the Left stick.  Neither one is exactly easy to get used to, but at the same time I found myself going with the D-Pad configuration more only because I'm used to platforming with the D-Pad.  Why the team at Retro couldn't keep the button for both options the same but allow players to switch how they move around anytime is beyond me.  Other than that, the only time the GamePad's screen is fully utilized is for Off-TV Play.For those in doubt about the game's length considering there are only six worlds in the main game, fear not.  Every level has a lot to offer, see, and explore--they're literally bursting at their seams with content.  Especially if you missed puzzle pieces or KONG letters, you'll find yourself re-exploring levels often.  If you're skilled and crafty with your platforming, extra bonus levels will unlock in each world too.  With that said, be prepared to get frustrated here and there.Upon defeating the last boss and seeing the game's ending, the frustration and back-tracking is all the more worth it.  Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze is an absolutely engrossing and engaging platformer for Nintendo's Wii U, and anyone with the console is only missing out by avoiding this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2014"}

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Michael Anthony \"Hybridblues\"","summary":"Buy this Game You Will","reviewText":"I'm not going into detail about the story or characters but this in my opinion is my favorite Staw Wars game on the market.

This game rocks my scrap metal off!  Some have complained this game is a bit repetative and i suppose i can agree on that, but i can't seem to get enough of it.  Red Faction is all about blowing everything up and it does it in spades.  Missions are the typical lot, blow that building up, ambush that convoy, steal that vehicle, intercept that traitor, but its fun gang.  Part of the fun is finding out the most efficient and creative way to take a building down.  The missions play out like little mini games, one that is particularly satisfying is the demolition trials.  The object is to destroy a structure with specific equipment within the alotted time.  I played one where the object was to attach sticky bombs onto explosive barrels and drop them down a drainage tube till they landed next to the target building and kaboom!  I like these missions as they give me new tactics for taking out the enemy that i may not have even thought about on my own.  There are wide variety of vehicles ranging from fast light armored cars to heavy tanks with some serious firepower.  I love the robotic walkers you can pilot, they remind of the walker Ripley used in Alien.The graphics are fantastic and the Martian landscape is truly a sight to behold, it has a very Total Recall feel to it.  There is a lot of area to cover too.  There are six zones if i remember correctly that you are trying to liberate from the oppressive forces of the EDF (Earth Defense Force).  I like the addition of the scavengers that randomly appear here and there wielding their crude weapons, they have a Mad Max feel to them.  There a wide variety of weapons at your disposal but you can only carry 4 at a time, one being your trusty hammer.  I suppose it is a bit ridiculous that your hammer can bust through solid concrete walls in one hit, but i can overlook that, mainly because this a game and its just plain fun.  As you finish missions in each zone, morale raises and more and more miners will pick up arms and join you in your battle which is very helpful because this game can get tough without the help.  When they say Guerrilla, they weren't kidding, you really need to utilize hit and run tactics to be successful until you get better weapons and armor later in the game.  Overall im very impressed with this title, its a solid game that you can keep coming back to when you feel the need to blow some $h@t up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2009"}

If you haven't played the game you haven't seen the whole movie, when Niobie walks OUT of a room in the movie, she walks IN to the game.

Nevertheless, you really don't seem to see that based on the success of bowling or football, because they always seem to be challenging. However, golf is another story. While video games and golf really don't see each other eye to eye usually, but for Camelot and Nintendo, they definitely hit that nail on the head again. They did it before with Mario Golf and Mario Tennis for the Nintendo 64, now they give the old four scream out loud to the Nintendo Gamecube this time, extremely well and strong.Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour is a golf game that really sticks with the Mario Theme, even better than the Nintendo 64 version. The game fatures seven different kinds of courses, with different kinds of themes: two of them are traditional courses, and the others are Mario Themed. The courses look crisper and the graphics also fit very well with the elements from the golf club, with some courses including warp pipes, chain chomps, and a real feel of the music, some of it Mario related. The character lineup includes some of the characters from the Nintendo 64 version including Mario, Princess Toadstool a.k.a. Peach, Yoshi, Wario and Bowser. There also are a few new characters not featured on the N64 version that are here including the spooky Boo, Waluigi who was introduced in Mario Tennis for the Nintendo 64, Petey Piranha, Bowser Jr., and Shadow Mario from Super Mario Sunshine.

I wondered one thing: what in the world happened to this town? I've heard of style and I've heard to rockstaring a world, but this place was something else. It was like a nightmare had mixed with the show Oz and had spilled out on the screen, making a mixed bag of atmosphere and a world where squalor rules. In some parts I felt like I was walking into a world where the homless gathered around barrels and warmed themselves, hoping to keep the Boogeyman at bay. In other places I felt like a drug manufacturing facility owned the night, creating a horrific variation of the world where addiction and murder liked to vacation.In all of this, you play a person tasked with the job of hunting down killers. It isn't an easy job and it isn't a nice thing. You get your hands dirty and you see things that are really out of most people's elements as you crime through the sreets in search of the things going bump in the night. Unlike many games these monsters wear human faces and have base needs, but they are warped records and play on savage music in the middle of this strange wasteland.At times it seems like this place would drive your character to madness. Other times it all makes sense, with this world making both the victims, the killers, and the dogs of war that hunt them in their own homes.As far as the gameplay, it is also dirty. It is sometimes base and it is sometimes a bit unfriendly, but it is easy to learn and easy to keep going. Some people do not like the speed of it all, saying it is slow.

In the air, control your parachute to select a landing spot that brings you the greatest strategic advantage. Follow the green smoke to recommended landing areas where Allied forces will be waiting, or go it alone by landing on rooftops or balconies.

While Fable 3 doesn't exactly raise the bar as far as videogames go (and really isn't a whole lot different than it's predesessors) it tries some different ideas and IS a very fun game in it's own right.The story of Fable 3 casts you as a young Prince or Princess trying to overthrow your brother who's King. Your goal is to get as many followers behind you as possible, start a revolution, then make some heavy choices once you are monarch. The story plays out predictably but is funny and entertaining the entire way through. You'll meet a cast of different characters on your journey, all very well voice-acted including your main character. If I had a complaint it'd be that your main hero doesn't speak enough to really get a dramatic hold on his or her character(though to be fair you yourself are the one shaping their personality so I can understand the more blank slate approach). Also a lot of the more dramatic moments are played out in well-staged cutscenes, even in sub-quests (again my only complaint is that there weren't MORE of these to give dramatic weight to the story).The gameplay in Fable 3 will probably have people mixed. The controls are almost exactly like Fable two (i.e. one-button attacking) but throw in things like cinematic kill-moves to spice things up. The conversations you have with NPC's this time is more straight-forward but not as in-depth: you basically focus on one person at a time and are given three or four options (friendly, mean, rude, and an action of sorts). On one hand this makes conversations easier but the game doesn't allow you to choose specific gestures so you'll be dancing and playing patty-cake with people you just want to be nice to. One change I did like was that instead of a menu, when you push start you are transported to a sanctuary to choose clothes and items in a 3-D environment. It doesn't feel a lot different than sorting through 2-D menus but I personally prefered it.The gameplay changes a little once you become king or queen though not by much. You'll be forced to keep or reject promises you made to characters in the first part of the game. While this seems easy enough there are drastic consequences for each choice you make. It's an interesting system and sometimes makes you think. The only draw-back I had with this was that it seems your choices are mostly just based on money and not anything you did in the pre-revolution stage of the game.Obviously Fable 3 isn't perfect. There are some graphical bugs and the gameplay doesn't exactly compete with games like Mass Effect 2. However it IS very entertaining and worthwhile. If you like fantasy games and liked Fable 2 and are looking for a more polished experience, Fable 3 is a winner!(oh and definitely download the 'Traitor's Keep' expansion....after a terrible first DLC this is not only WORTH the money you put into it with new areas and weapons, the story's better than anything the core game had!)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2010"}

You get to name your town (an honor for a new resident) and choose one of four \"cozy\" houses for shelter.Your house is not free of charge; you need to pay for it with the town's currency (Bells) by means of work. You cannot avoid doing work (and wear work clothes) to pay off the mortgage.  This could get a little bit tiring at first since the method of paying is mostly doing repetitive errands.  Actually the purpose of these errands is not only to pay back, but also to learn more about the town, and its inhabitants.  You also get some rewards from the townspeople for doing them favors and you also get a few important tips along the way.  Rewards usually are in the way of furniture for your house; sometimes you can even get a totally playable original NES game (remember the 8-bit Nintendo console of the 80's?).Once you pay off for your house you are allowed to have bigger quarters and are free to make your daily activities as you wish.  Here is where the real fun begins.You also need to pay for your new, bigger house (a lot more expensive) but you can take all the time in the world for this.  Also, there are many new different daily activities apart from running errands to earn money.  Daily activities include fishing, collecting fossils, insects and paintings, planting flowers and fruits, writing letters, sending presents to your town neighbors, decorating your house, creating decoration patterns, playing games and many others.  Not all of these earn you money, money isn't the primary goal of the game, and many of the activities are simply aimed to entertain you and to get the creative side out of you.You can design colorful patterns and use them on your clothes, house, umbrellas, etc.  You may even start a fad with your chosen design.  You can also compose or modify the town's tune, which is played every hour.Decorating your house is a very important and entertaining activity as well.  The furniture choices and the methods of obtaining them are many.  The town's committee evaluates your decoration and awards points using a predefined system.  You are allowed to enter other houses to get decorating hints but you cannot take items from them.In terms of festivals I noticed that there's a New Years celebration, Groundhog Day, Thanksgiving and others.  As of this writing I'm looking forward for the New Year's festivities.The activities vary by day and are supposed to keep the game from being monotonous.  Impatient gamers will hate to wait 24 hours to get to new activities.  In my town, the store closes at 9pm and does not open up until 9am of the next day (in real time).  During the closed hours I cannot buy or sell anything and I'm limited to other activities.  Eating is not required for living although you can grab fruits and eat them at will.The game uses the Game Cube's (GC) internal clock to deliver the many different daily activities in real time.  It also keeps track of seasons, time, day and night.Nintendo has provided additional means of having fresh characters, activities, music, games, furniture, etc. with the e-cards. E-cards require a separate e-reader, a Game Boy Advance (GBA) and a link cable.  Many cards are currently available.  A tropical island is also accessible only for players who also own a GBA with a link cableYou can have up to four players living in town (there are only four empty houses available for sale in a town).  Only one player can play at a time though, the others need to wait for the current player to save and quit before getting their turn.  Players may leave items available for display, sale or for the taking to the other players or visitors (owners of other Game Cube's with Animal Crossing)In summary, the game provides for endless hours of entertainment and fun.  Reading is required but non-reading kids can still have fun if their parents supervise them.I only wished that this game had taken advantage of the Game Cube's broadband adapter and make it an online game such as The Sims's.  The only current way to interact with your friends (visit other towns) is to insert a memory card in a friend's console.  This is something that Nintendo should look for in the future to increase the interest for this game.  Graphics and music could also be better.Recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2002"}

I had just seen all the different episodes of what seemed like clones of the second game. So I don't even know how many games there are. But if I had to say one thing about this one game as a stand-alone product, I'd tell you that this is easily the best produced and directed game I've ever played. And here's why:It doesn't bother crossing genres. It's just Stealth-Action, plain and simple. What I find the most intriguing about the gameplay is how detailed and just realistic it is that your condition affects how you play. First of all, you are constantly on the hunt for food. Running or moving too much causes your hunger to rise, and often times you'll hear your stomach growling(it took me a few hours to realize what that noise was). Also, you'll need to collect items to basically stabilize your condition, be it stomach aches from rotten food, venom from a passing snake or scorpion, surgically removing bullets and patching up wounds. It really is rather complex, but it's still insanely easy to use.The story-oh, the story-plays out just like a James Bond movie, except that since you aren't watching some lame 60's film, your heart starts pounding and your adrenaline pumps and soon enough the story gears you to play more and more until you're addicted. The voice acting is rarely ever awkward(as it seems alot of import games are), because the script never fails to deliver a witty and direct dialogue, often alluding to James Bond or any of the film classics from the 60's(just save with Para-Medic). The characters are well developed as far as I can tell. You could have made a book about each of their backgrounds! I couldn't believe it, though, how it just sucked me in. And just about every other stealth action game I've played before had so little to do with the story. Mucho satisfaction!Finally, the general gameplay and combat was so-so. I wasn't expecting anything beyond walk around, point, and shoot. Though the awkward overhead view threw me for a loop at first, I got used to it quickly.Combat is pretty diverse, with dozens of types of machine guns(who knew they had so many in the '60s?) and loads of interesting support items. Of course variations of goggles and the fake cyanide pill is a must for every video game spy.All in all, I found myself blown away by how much work was put into this game. The characters, bosses, missions, and weapons combined made me anxious to keep playing. Also, extra minigames like Snake vs. Monkey made for a light-hearted tone, so that even my family could play. From the moment you put the disc in to the moment you finish the first mission and watch the introduction, you'll know what a REAL game is. The team that put this game together did a spectacular job and I applaud them for keeping it fun and interesting.So ditch Splinter Cell, nuke James Bond, and fuggedabout any other boring Spy Ops game on the market. Just buy Metal Gear Solid 3 and be satisfied for once!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2004"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"T. Soatthiamroong","summary":"3.5 star... a mixed bag of new found success and the persistent lost of the old legacies","reviewText":"FF XIII is by no means a bad game. However, it's not exactly an heir to the throne either. New good stuff were added, but the old legacies which helped FF series gripped the heart of their fans were still lost.Here we go...PROS:- Battle System is fun. It starts off slow and seems boring, even a bit clunky, at first. But you'll get more and more comfortable with the system as you proceed. It also gets deeper as you start facing tougher enemies.  You can't win the fight without strategic thinking and being quick on the execution. Many fights seem impossible, until you grasp the right strategy.Many complains about not being able to control all the team members. That doesn't bother me much since the AI is quite reliable, and the Active Time Battle in this one is quite a bit too rushing to put in commands for everyone anyway. Paradigm system works as effectively as the Gambit system in FF XII, and it's simpler to set up.- Item and skill upgrading systems are similar to that of FF X. They're not revolutionary, but not at all bad.- Art direction and graphics are, of course, impressive as ever. Soundtracks, though not imressive and not much of a romance in the melodies, get the job done.CONS:- The game forces you to endure an endless limbo of boredom during the first long hours, and that's critical. The game makes you switching back and forth between all the two-man teams of the 6 characters who got separated. I understand that it's a form of story telling. But 20-30 hours of very limited strategies and fighting hordes after hordes of weaklings seems like eternity. It picks up the pace greatly after the reunion of all characters. But for those with low tolerance, the first hours is more than enough to make them throw away the game.- Being unable to control other team members or removing of the MP system might get on your nerve at first, though not a big deal and you'll get over it eventually. But what really frustrated me is that the death of the team leader alone decides the fate of the whole team. It means, in the tough fights, your only option for the team leader is the characters with high strength, not the mages. And since tough fights do come along quite often later in the game, you'll find yourself using the same set of characters over and over. Trying new combinations might spoil the fun rather than improving it.- Story telling is less than impressive. It's not exactly sucky, but definitely not good. Character development hardly occurs. Though it's not as bad as FF XII, but you don't really care about the characters either.Now the unforgiveable part. The developers did quite a good job creating an interesting world. BUT, sadly, they took the lazy way out of a story telling hassle by putting them in the glossary and notes. I'm talking about the descriptions of the locales, background stories, and even many crucial points of the main story line that would help players to understand. It wouldn't be a big deal if this was a PS1 game, but it's not.Story telling and soundtrack of FF series have gone down the dangerous path since Hironobu Sakaguchi and Nobuo Uematsu left Square-Enix after FF X. The developers that took over the projects had done terrible jobs so far. And I'm certain that it's a fatal blow to the heart of FF fans....We dropped the controller when Aerith was stabbed in FF VII, from that moment on, revenge on Sephiroth was personal......We smiled with the two-generation romances of Rinoa and Squall and his father and her mother in FF VIII......We shed the tears with Yuna when Tidus faded away in FF X, and were happy to see their reunion in FF X-2 (even though FF X-2's gameplay sucked)All other FFs also had their moments of emotional grip. And those moments are what set FF apart from other JRPGs.But since FF XII, they focused too much on the gameplay. You could still go on for a 100 hours on quests and leveling up. I don't say that it's a bad thing to be creative on the gameplay. But those moments are no more. The stories and characters in FF XII and XIII are... bland. And spending 50-80 hours taking in a story of the boring or annoying characters is not a happy time for FF fans.If SE's teams won't develop their story telling skill to be at least on par with the old members who left for Mistwalker, this franchise might someday die a tragic death or transform into something entirely different, and lesser.- Dialogues in FF XIII are cheesy. Voice acting of Vanille is unbearable.IN CONCLUSION:3.5 stars from me. (I can't believe I give an FF less than 4 stars. Sad but true)FF XIII feels a lot similar to FF X. Better in the esthetic department (of course, it's a generation apart), different and fresh in the gameplay department, but a lot lesser in the story department.  The game itself is not a bad RPG, but considering all the series' landmarks that are lost, it's not a good FF.Die-hard fans, like me, might find it to be reasonably fun and a bit dissapointing at the same time. I got my money's worth nonetheless.But if I want my friends to love FF, I won't recommend this one as their first game in the series. At least not until the price dropped.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2010"}

There are almost no apps for it, almost no games for it. The games on release are shovelware or iPhone games like Dungeon Hunters.  The battery life is terrible , so bad that if you plan on taking it with you, it won't last long but 30 minutes before you see you need to plug it in.  Mine froze constantly. The commercials make it look like you can cross play games like , the big game Killzone ( commercial),,,,,nope, not even close, two completely sad games, Motorstorm RC, and Hustlekings which are abysmal.  Facebook app is useless. You can play psp games on it,,,but, what do you need the Vita for. It doesn't work out of the box , requiring an expensive memory card..( cost you and extra 4$ every time you download a game, to pay for the space on your memory card. 30$ for 8 g. Anyone who tells you it's the best thing since oxygen probably has a vested interest in the Vita or works for Sony. What's worse, is the two games I bought, Uncharted, and Unit 13, where so frustrating that we couldn't even play them, thoughtlessly released.Good luck!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2012"}
{"product_name":"B003O6EATE","description":"","reviewerName":"MisterMusicFan","summary":"A sleek, sexy handheld with loads of potential","reviewText":"Despite the fact that it&#8217;s been touted as a major commercial failure in recent months (primarily in comparison to its sole competitor, the Nintendo 3DS), my interest was sparked in the PlayStation Vita thanks to a little game called Gravity Rush, and it was enough to motivate me to dash out and purchase the commercially floundering handheld. I&#8217;m happy to say I&#8217;m thus far satisfied with the purchase; the Vita is above all else a seriously sexy system, with fantastic features and loads of potential. Although its current catalogue of software leaves much to be desired and there are a handful of frustrating drawbacks, this console offers great fun for the hardcore gamer on the go.The Vita is an impressively powerful system for a handheld, boasting a gorgeous 960x544 OLED multi-touch screen display; at a nicely-sized 5 inches (16:9) capable of 16 million colors, this screen offers some seriously vivid visuals. Although it&#8217;s not technically speaking HD, it almost (read: almost) rivals the iPhone&#8217;s retina display in terms of clarity and vividness-portable video gaming has never been clearer. Everything about the Vita screams high end technology in the palm of your hand; both the front and rear of the console are touch sensitive (both support multi-touch), there are built-in stereo speakers and a microphone (both of pretty solid quality, a big plus for online multiplayer), an A9 core CPU, built-in GPS, Wi-Fi and 3G support, Bluetooth wireless communications, a gyroscope motion sensor and more. Along the lines of tech specs and quantity of features, it has the 3DS beat tenfold.Although most handheld consoles are awkward in some sense to hold, the PlayStation Vita is beautiful to look at and shouldn&#8217;t cause much discomfort after several hours of playtime (although because it is a lengthy system, games that utilize both the face buttons and the touch screen-at the same time-can be frustrating and occasionally make for some hand soreness). The face buttons are small but responsive and tightly mounted. Similar to the 3DS, the use of the L and R buttons can be occasionally wonky in games that demand their frequent use; notably fighting games such as PlayStation All-Stars can feel frenetic in their rapid pace on this handheld.There are two models of the PlayStation Vita: Wi-Fi only and 3G-compatible, priced at $249 and $299, respectively. I own the Wi-Fi only model and in all honesty wouldn&#8217;t recommend the 3G capability; in an age where 4G is becoming the new standard and most people will already have online connectivity on the go through their smartphones and/or tablets, it&#8217;s a bit unrealistic to think most anyone would use this console to surf the web when they&#8217;re away from a Wi-Fi connection. Although I can&#8217;t speak to any of these factors from personal experience, I&#8217;ve come to learn that 3G Vita Internet connectivity not only drains the battery nearly twice as quickly but isn&#8217;t all that reliable depending on your location, meaning the reasonably tempting thought of online multiplayer matches while on a long car ride may in reality be plagued by some nasty lag. Additionally, the extra $50 for the console along with the monthly $14.99 payments to AT&T; really aren&#8217;t likely to be worth it in the long run for most gamers.One of the Vita&#8217;s most excellent assets is its comparatively strong battery life, something several other electronic devices nowadays fail to deliver. As where competitor Nintendo&#8217;s 3DS and Wii U GamePad are both bogged down by abysmal battery lives, you can expect to play your Vita for upwards of 5-6 hours before the battery completely depletes (depending of course on what you&#8217;re doing), which is very impressive for a handheld console with such high quality graphical capabilities. Like most smartphones, the Vita can quickly be put into standby mode (regardless of what you&#8217;re doing onscreen) by simply tapping the power button. This conserves battery even further, so if you only play in spurts throughout the day it can in fact be fairly easy for it to go strong until you&#8217;re back home.The console&#8217;s interface is clean and user-friendly but does have a few setbacks. Each application appears as a bubble icon which must be tapped to initiate an introductory screen; yet another &#8220;start&#8221; icon must be tapped a second time to actually open the app. Like Apple&#8217;s iOS, apps stay open until they are manually closed (their introductory screen&#8217;s page is swiped downward on the touchscreen); the only exception is games, only one of which can be open at a time. While the home screen looks nice and is easy to use, the fact that multiple taps and activations are required to open or close anything can make multitasking a bit frustrating over time, and it seems as though some of these applications overlap and didn&#8217;t need to be separate from one another (if you want to start a voice or text chat, view your friends list and check out your friends&#8217; trophies, you&#8217;ll have to open three separate applications. A single &#8220;Friends&#8221; app would&#8217;ve really sufficed).Another major success, however, is the console&#8217;s mostly seamless interactivity and connection between Vita and PS3. Although this occasionally depends upon different games&#8217; respective capabilities, many PS3 games (and soon to be PS4) are cross-compatible with the Vita, meaning you can start a game on your PS3 and finish it on the Vita or vice-versa. In addition to this, you can log into the exact same PlayStation Network account you use on your PS3 home console to pull up and utilize the same data and information, meaning essentially every digital purchase you make can be transferred/downloaded to your Vita for remote play, and you can also maintain your trophies, ranks and level-ups in fighting and various other games to ensure all your online multiplayer progress is sustained, regardless of which Sony device you&#8217;re accessing it from. This cross-connectivity is an incredibly useful feature for avid Sony users, and with the introduction of the PS4, Sony has confirmed that the Vita will have a connectivity to the home console not unlike Nintendo&#8217;s GamePad does to the Wii U.As many wonderful features as the Vita does offer, some clunky mistakes were made that may present more glaring issues for some more than others. As previously mentioned, the game&#8217;s highest end model is a whopping $300 (plus tax) if purchased brand new; this makes it in most cases the most expensive dedicated gaming console on the market right now (it is pricier than the Nintendo 3DS, Wii U, and even most models of the PS3 and Xbox 360), which is a bit ironic considering its status as a commercially floundering Sony handheld amidst a competitive generation shift. A price drop has been confirmed in the near future, but when exactly this will happen or how much it will drop by is unclear. As of now, the console is honestly overpriced given its stiff competition (in both the gaming and tablet/smartphone markets), so I&#8217;d recommend going used if possible (this drops the price by upwards of $60-80+).Arguably the Vita&#8217;s most obnoxious setback by far, however, is that this already high price is forcibly spiked even further by the fact that PlayStation Vita consoles do not come with any of their own storage space. What this means is that in order to download or play any games/applications on your Vita at all, you&#8217;ll need to purchase an SD card separately along with it (pathetically, ordinary Vitas don&#8217;t come prepackaged with one). Worsening this annoyance is the fact that you&#8217;ll have to purchase Sony&#8217;s Vita-specific micro SD card, because the console isn&#8217;t compatible with ordinary ones. The cheapest one is nearly $20, and even this will only net you a measly 4 GB (i.e., don&#8217;t plan on downloading more than two or three console games). The console honestly needs at least 14-16 GB for avid gamers, which will set you back yet another whopping $60 for the 16 GB Vita SD card. To put this into perspective, that would bring your total Vita purchase up to nearly $380 after tax. The fact that Sony decided against providing any memory in the console itself was ridiculous; the 3DS may not have much storage space, but at least you don&#8217;t have to pay extra for it right off the bat. While there are bundles and starter kits that do in fact come along with the card, you&#8217;ll have to be willing to throw down the extra cash (and/or be interested in the games they come with), and most of these only come with the very limiting 4 GB.Regardless of these assets and setbacks, the number one thing on the average gamer&#8217;s mind for a console are the games. As of right now, the Vita is plagued by a comparatively sparse software catalogue; while there are Uncharted and Assassin&#8217;s Creed for shooters, Rayman Origins for platforming and games like PlayStation All-Stars, Marvel VS. Capcom and Street Fighter X Tekken for brawlers, there still isn&#8217;t a great deal to choose from overall and chances are the catalogue of Vita exclusives will have to expand before it&#8217;ll be anywhere near a must-have. Gravity Rush and Persona 4 Golden present some of the more unique and enticing entries exclusive to the system, but the near future feels barren along the lines of new releases or IPs. I&#8217;d recommend looking into the catalogue of available games and what you&#8217;d realistically play before making the purchase.All in all, very much like the Wii U, the PlayStation Vita is a console brimming with features and potential, the latter of which has yet to be fully realized. This doesn&#8217;t stop it from being a beautiful system with loads of fun and sleek, addictive functionalities to offer, but it does prevent it from being the fantastic must-have it could be&#8230;at least for now. At this moment in time, it caters primarily to a niche audience willing to throw down a fairly hearty amount of cash for decent amounts of hardcore gaming and fun on the go. If Sony really wants to give it the edge up on the competition, expanding the catalogue of software and dropping the price should be the number one focus. If this is executed properly, the Vita could indeed fulfill Sony&#8217;s promise as the Vita being the perfect companion to its home console.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2013"}

{"product_name":"B003ZHMMEM","description":"","reviewerName":"Sarah","summary":"Awesome new take on a favorite classic!","reviewText":"I love Donkey Kong Country Returns! Its got the same classic fun with a twist. It can be difficult though, so I wouldnt recommend this for very young children but somewhere from 10 years on up. This game has nicely done graphics done in bright jungle colors and definitely more 3d than the originals. This is a lot of fun with two players or simply by yourself even. as far as content goes its a very clean game. All violence is cartoon nothing frightening for kids, and there is naturally no bad language. Its a lot like the originals in  the fact that its a side scrolling game but it makes it more interesting in the fact that often times it will switch to which there are two platforms on the screen, one in the back and one in the front that you go between thereby adding to the difficulty level. Overall I think in this game Donkey Kong lived up to its true glory once again! P.S. If you're interested in buying this, get it of amazon (especially if you can catch it on sale) because I was unable to find it cheaper anywhere else, partly because amazon does not charge tax or shipping to customers in Texas.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2011"}

As you might expect, due to contributions from key player in Half-Life 2, this game feels and plays just like HL2, which in my opinion was one of the greatest games ever created. The environments and maps are beautifully crafted. The voice acting is superb. The RPG elements of upgradeable skills and weapons are awesome. The freedom to approach the game and play it using your style of choice - amazing. All in all, this is definitely one of the most polished and most entertaining games I have played in a long time.The only complaint I have, which is very minor, is that the game wants you to play a certain style - stealth - but the AI is extremely difficult to predict. At times they can spot you from far away, but other times they walk 3 feet in front of you right past you and they don't see you.All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this game and highly recommend it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"HeavyMetalSushi","summary":"I LOVE IT!","reviewText":"I am so happy in my decision to purchase a PlayStation 4 at launch!  Sure, there was always that small chance I'd get a broken unit like some people sadly did, but I knew if that happened I could get it replaced so I wasn't extremely worried about it.  However, I have been playing my PlayStation 4 a lot since I got it at launch (5 days ago as of this review) and it has been working just fine.All around this system runs circles around the PlayStation 3.  I had a PlayStation 3 for years prior to this and it was a decent system, plenty of good games for it and good graphics for it's generation, but I was honestly frustrated with it a lot because of it's lagging and slow load times, and games often froze up on me...especially bigger ones like Fallout and Skyrim.  I have not experienced a single one of those problems with PlayStation 4 thus far.  It still takes a few minutes for game data to load and install & whatnot, but nowhere near as long as many games on the PlayStation 3 took.There is definitely better frame rate on games for the PS4, and there is definitely a noticeable difference in graphics & detail in many of the games.  Some of the best examples out of what I have played are Killzone Shadow Fall and Battlefield 4.  Even Knack is very clear and looks wonderful.  I downloaded the indie title Flower and its much smoother and noticeably prettier than it's PS3 version too.  Sadly I have not noticed too much of a difference in graphical quality on Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag as opposed to the PS3 version, but it's definitely smoother and runs a bit better.  I look forward to seeing future games on this console, they will no doubt look more and more amazing throughout the systems time span.As far as the home page layout & app services and navigating around, I have no qualms there either.  In fact, I find it much easier to navigate and not as confusing as I found the PS3's to be when I'd first gotten my hands on it.  It took me a moment to realize I had to move upwards to get to the store, profile, and settings icons & whatnot but aside from that I had no trouble.  I didn't need to even glance at the instructions.  My wife was happy with the set up too and created her account on hers.  We've thus far enjoyed playing Knack together, she really likes that one.All around though, this system has met my expectations and I am very happy with it.  In fact, I was so happy with it that I decided to be rid of the aggravations of my PS3 and sold it.  As far as I'm concerned, aside from some of my beloved old school systems to play around on once in a while, the PS4 is all I need.  And I'm not worried about games I'll miss on PS3, because any and all of the ones I enjoyed on PS3 I can download later via Gakai after it drops.If you're contemplating whether or not to get a PS4 or an Xbox One, I'd say go with your gut...I'm pretty equal opportunity geekery.  I actually plan to maybe purchase an Xbox One in time, after a price drop or 2 perhaps.  However, as my first one I recommend the PS4...solid games, quality system, quality media, and great system for the mere $400 you'll pay...as opposed to $500 for an Xbox One because they force you to buy the Kinect which isn't absolutely needed.  It might have been a fairer bet had they done what Sony did and made it an optional buy.  The choice is yours, but I stand firmly behind the PS4 right now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2013"}

I love the design of the system and just like other systems that hey have released this system can stand on its side or flat. The controller feels real good in the hands and the design is no different then the others but they did make a few changes. The touch pad is very responsive and yu have the share button to let you upload to facebook.The system is actually quiet and the graphics on the system is really amazing. I have played my system for many hours and can say that the system breaths real well. The controller on the other hand does not last long. I calculated around 8 hours of non-stop use. The system is great all around and i would love to see more for this system in the years to come.Also the PS Vita is a great accessory for this system as well. It can be used as another controller and able to stream and many other options. But keep in mind that the PS Vita can only be used with some games and can not be used on all of them.In the end i am glad for what they have done to the system and that the way they made the design of it is different then other systems out there.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2013"}

Maybe I'm just lucky, but I've had none of the launch issues yet. The graphics are clearly superior to the PS3 in every conceivable way. The user interface is not only much easier to navigate, but it also seamlessly transitions from one page to the next. However, every section can be accessed from the same page, rather than have to scroll through categories like you have to on the PS3. I also very much like the fact that you can simply scroll down on the main page to see what your friends are up to when they are logged onto PSN and you can share your activities as well. Another awesome addition is the ability to post screenshots and gameplay videos directly from the PS4 rather than need a program to do so. This is actually a very cool feature. So far, most of the public features can be tied to Facebook and/or Twitter, adding to the convenience of it all. The DS4 is also a definite upgrade from the DS3, but the specifics of that will be covered in a separate review.The PS4 itself is sleek looking. The product page picture is accurate, but when you actually have it sitting in front of you, it's even more impressive. It's both solidly built and attractive.Eject and power buttons on the console arent completely obvious, as they are touch vs actual buttons, and arent large enough to be very noticeable, but once you know where they are, you realize they are actually better that way as they are unobtrusive and unlikely to be accidentally pressed.So far, the only minor issue I've encountered is with the newest update, which I ended up needing to unplug and then replug it in order to get it to restart and accept the update. However, I had the same issue with my PS3, so it was clearly the update itself and not the system.Anyway, if you are a fan of the Playstation brand, you will definitely love the PS4. A definitely and obvious upgrade from the PS3, as well it should be.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S.

I've seen screenshots, first impressions, and previews. When it finally came somewhere around 2000 (hey ! You can't expect me to know all these things !), Sega has proven to RPG fans that it would become the future of RPG's. In Yu Suzuki's latest creation, you will play as main character, Ryo Hazuki in his quest for Revenge for the death of his father. Shenmue is an interactive game that keeps track of the times, changes, and events. For example: if Christmas was only weeks away, someone would be dressed as Santa Claus and some houses and stores would be covered up in Christmas decerations. Okay, that's enough. Now lets talk about how the game is like. First off, the graphics are flawlessly detailed. Some characters don't show much facial expressions, but most of the time, they'll make a slight twitch or an expression even. The sound is...uh...not bad. There's some catchy '80s style tunes (No ! We're not talking about Billy Idol or Aerosmith's music ! It's Sega's customizable '80s music) you'll hear when you go to a bar, somewhere around the outdoors, anywhere ! The voice acting is kinda horrible. Ryo's voice sounds great, but most of them are straight-up annoying ! The more I kept hearing Goro use his squeaky voice, I press the B-button to skip it so I can hear Ryo's. The gameplay and controls are cool. Controling the character isn't really that hard, if you have already played RPG's similar to Shenmue. Some people would complain how slow and unresponsive it is, but it's actually easy (that's what you get for playing to much corny adventure games, kid !). The best part of the gameplay are the QTE battles and the freestyle battles, where you can duke it out with neighborhood gangs and mad locals. The storyline is seamless...until Disc 3. The storyline on Disc's 1 and 2 have great stories, but Disc 3's story lags a bit. Most of the time, you have to race daily, everytime you got to work and after the race is done, you have to do some work as a forklifter. Wow...fun (sarcasm) ! There are times when you'll encounter a fight on Disc 3 (I love beating the tar out of the Mad Angels at the Yokosuka Harbor), which turns Disc 3 slightly exciting. And the most exciting part is, you get to play classic Sega arcade games like Hang On and Space Harrier (100 yen a game). So in the end, Shenmue turns out to be a perfect gaming experience for RPG fans. This game is so great, even some of those ignorant PS2 lovin' Dreamcast haters will give this pup a go. If you want to be taken back to the '80s again, Shenmue won't dissapoint.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2001"}

When you finally get there though it really picks up and is a very good game. It has some better gameplay than the first and more levels too. You have Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Aladdin \"again\", The Little Mermaid \"again\", Mulan, Tron, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Nightmare Before Christmas \"again\" and Hercules \"again\". All that is good but if they have a part 3 I hope they have more worlds that we haven't already seen already. I'd llike  to see these worlds if there's a part 3 Narnia, Pirates of the Carribean 2, The Jungle Book, Toon Town with Roger Rabbit, A Bugs Life, Toy Story, The Incredibles, The Black Cauldron, 20000 Leagues Under the Sea and Monsters Inc.The game starts out easier than it is when you get further in. For instance I'm on tow spots that I can't get beat now. There's annoying parts that can be hard to beat because you have to defeat a certain enemy before the time limit ends. So that's one of my only complaints. Other than that this game is a bit easier. I mean with some bosses in the first I couldn't get passed many of them without trying a few times. This time I have only lost on the time limit parts. The bosses are a lot easier.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2006"}

Two days later I went to return the unplayable-glitchy-pile-of-digital-crap that was Assassins Creed and needed something to get the bad taste out, so I bought this figuring there's nothing better right now.This game is absolute blast. I won't go into details - you can read them everywhere else. I'll just say that graphics are beautiful, story is engaging in an Indiana Jones type way, but the BEST PART: the enemies are SMART (I'm playing this on normal difficulty)! Yeah, I couldn't believe it either. Combat also requires thinking on your part - you will not be picking up 200 rounds of ammo of each dead enemy, so you actually have to think before you shoot. The cover system is also great. You can't just duck behind a stone, as the enemy will flank you immediately. You have to keep moving and constantly be aware of where your enemies are. Long story short - you can not advance in the game by just running down the middle in spraying hundreds of rounds of ammo - you will have to develop tactics.To keep the game from being repetitive, there's a very big platform and puzzle element (although puzzles have been kind of easy so far). But all of this works really well.In short, I would recommend this over any PS3 title that's out there right now.I","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2007"}

(reminds me of a Vegas casino in that regard). There are countless reviews here and elsewhere that rave about this game, and with good reason.  But so many reviews were up within days of Skyrim's release, and there is no way they could have made much of a dent in the game. So I wanted to give you a review after many hours of gameplay.If you played Oblivion, you have a rough idea of the gameplay.  It is swords, sorcery, or any combination to play in this fantasy world that is a cross between Game of Thrones and The Lord of the Rings. The developers have created a living, breathing world that makes the open world feel of the GTA games feel tight and restricted by comparison.  This world is huge, vast, and seemingly endless.  It is filled with animals, enemies, and flying dragons.  Some knock the graphics a bit, but I think they look pretty nice.  Yes, it is a console port, but most AAA games are now a days because that is where the market and the money is.To say this game is filled with content is to say a beach has a lot of sand.  Content is an understatement - I have no idea how they can pack so many different environments and unique dungeons into a single game.  It is a technological feat to be sure.  You can play this game easily without ever playing Obivion - there is no backstory you need to be familiar with.  The combat is fun and satisfying.  I prefer a sword and shield because the timing of blocking and sword strikes is quite satisfying.  You can walk into any of the major cities and pick up quest after quest.  There are different groups (Companions, Mages, etc.) who all have their own questlines.  I played one quest that became a murder mystery then turned into a completely different quest.  It was long, detailed, and fantastic - and it was just a side quest!You can play this game any way you want - you can wander and stumble into cool stuff, or follow the main quest.  I have invested maybe 90 minutes in the main quest, and the remaining hours of my total 70 hours (the game tracks your time in the game and displays it when you log in) is just playing all the random content and guild quests.  I had never played a game like this until I played Oblivion, which led me to this fine game. The combat is all first person (or you can play in third person if you prefer) but it is real time - no paused dice rolls like RPG's of the past.  Purists don't like that, but I am a FPS guy mainly so it works best for me.I figure there is at least another 50 hours of game play left for me, based on the areas of the world map in-game I haven't even explored yet.  If you have't picked this game up yet, I encourage you to so so.  You certainly get your money's worth.  $50 is movies and popcorn for two for 90 minutes.  Here it gets you 100 plus hours of entertainment.  I would also recommend the Skyrim Game Guide (sold here by Prima) to help you get the most out of the game.  There is  alot to know and many things about smithing and armor and enchanting I never would have figured out on my own.  A guide isn't a cheat, but it helps you get the most out of your game.  It's the same as a travel guide for a vacation destination - you don't want to miss the good stuff once you are there.Good luck and happy gaming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2012"}

I've been waiting. I got my DS in January of '05 and I got a \"First Hunt\" demo that came with it. I can say that I wasn't impressed simply because there was no depth, but I knew that the game certainly could be a great one. Metroid Prime for the Gamecube, to me, was not a very good game. Hard-to-use controls, single player only, a lot of backtracking... and so on. This game has backtracking, but it has easy controls and great multiplayer. Here is my review:PROs: Great singleplayer and multiplayer, best DS graphics ever, little lag suprisingly, cool characters, WiFi, stat counting... so on.CONs: Have to unlock the hunters ( not too hard, just play single player ) , occasional lag, grainy sound sometimes, repetitious adventure mode.Graphics: 10/10. Byfar the best graphics ever shoved into a DS game. They are unbelievable. It's pretty amazing that the whole game was packed into this, let alone the great looking graphics. Very, very nice.Sound: 9.5/10. Very good on surround sound. The only real problem for sound (for me) is that it's grainy; but it could be my DS. You hear footsteps, the creature's noises... everything works nicely.Control: 9/10. Good controls, but it could be some quick corpal tunnel syndrome. I play with the stylus and my hands kind of get cramped up using this tiny little DS. It's not too bad, but I sometimes have to take breaks.Fun: 9.5/10. Excellent WiFi, great graphics, and basically the Halo of handhelds, this game has everything any FPS fan would want. Even though the adventure mode is tedious, the multiplayer is great and anyone can hop in and have a great time with this game. Hell, if you have no one to play with, practice with bots. This game is the best on the DS, and I have no intentions of putting this game down any time soon; and I don't think you will either once you pick it up. Go buy MPH now. NOW NOW NOW!!Here are some hints on how to get through the game:If you're on a long fall to the ground, jump right before you're about to hit the ground; no health lost.To get all the hunters, play single player and get 22% through the game. ( I believe. ) You will have 50% of the Octaliths by this time as well.Special attacks:Samus: Guided missleKanden: Electric balls; dissorient enemyTrace: Invisability + SniperNoxus: FreezeSpire: Ball of fire grenade launcherWeavel: Grenade-Launcher like green bombSylux: Electrical weaponI.M.O, the best Hunters in order:1.)

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Another excellent, and exclusive, title for the DS","reviewText":"When Nintendo first unveiled the DS, Metroid Prime: Hunters was one of the first gmaes that were shown to the public.  Well, after some time in development, it's finally here, and much like many other Nintendo games that get delayed, it was worth the wait.  Once again playing as bounty hunter Samus Aran, Metroid Prime: Hunters shows just what the DS can do with the first person shooter.  Anyone familiar with the Metroid Prime games on the Gamecube will feel right at home here, despite the fact that there is no auto aiming feature, and the stylus and touch screen must be used to aim while using the directional pad to manuver yourself.  This allows for some very tight and precise controls, but beware that this will take some getting used to, and this will be a bit difficult to pick up at first.  However, after spending some time with it, you'll find some truly fantastic gameplay.  And this gameplay is truly something to behold thanks to the game's multiplayer capabilities.  Taking advantage of the DS' Wi-Fi capabilities, the game allows for tons of multiplayer options that really show off what the DS can do, and that in itself is a welcome feature.  The game looks slick enough for a DS title despite a few graphical glitches, and the overall feel of the game is pure Metroid all the way.  If there's any low points of Metroid Prime: Hunters, it's that the level design is a bit repetitive, but that's only a minor gripe.  All in all, Metroid Prime: Hunters is another excellent, first party title that solidifies the fact the DS is the best handheld system on the market right now, and hopefully more developers will take cues from this game when bringing first person shooters to the wonderous thing that is called the DS.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2007"}

Dean \"John\"","summary":"Good but can be a little frustrating for a 7 year old","reviewText":"My 7 year old loves animals so we thought this would be a fun game to get for our next Kinect game.Graphics are well done, the animation of the animals is quite good considering it's just a game.As others have mentioned, the flying narrator is annoying, and even my 7 year old after just about three or four minutes asked \"Will he ever go away?\"navigation for some of the selction screens is done by swiping a hand in either direction, like erasing a chalk board.  That moves the options to the next one.  Very intuitive for a grown up, not so much for a youngster.The games and tricks are pretty well done - the animals face when it does \"play dead\" is a riot.  But while the Kinect has done a great job for other games for sensing movement and such, it's not quite so accurate for this game.  \"Lay down\" has you crouch and pat the floor in front of you, and it seems the system has a real problem sensing this.  And throwing things, while the narrator keeps telling you to throw underhand because it works the best, my son found it works better (we really have found no \"best\" for this action yet) if he does more of a shovel pass type movement from his chest, and just pushes his hand forward.The animals come at you with various toys they want to play with, and you get the option of playing or telling them \"no\" and picking your own toy.The opening sequence is so cloyingly sweet that it's almost nauseating, the animals are just a bit too humanesque in their behavior.  But the kid loved it, and that's what it's all about after all...There are options for voice command for the tricks as well, which don't work THAT great, but seem to offer some better luck than some of the gestures.  But there are gestures that work fine, like hands to the sides, jumping, spinning, those are seen and acted on pretty much every time.Definitely has a novelty value here in our house, and my son will enjoy playing this for a while, so even with the shortcomings, it was a good pick.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2010"}

I played Forza 3 on the 360 and that was a much better game.  I had hoped this would outshine Forza because I sold my 360 and kept the PS3.  I was let down by this game for a few reasons.Good:Good graphics, cars and tracks.Lots of cars, decent amount of tracks.Dynamics of the cars seem right on.Bad:The music is horrible and you CANNOT play your own music, that sucks for a game that requires you to spend HOUR AFTER HOUR racing and listening to its soundtrack.  You are essentially stuck with a super DUPER weak soundtrack of unknown crappy songs.The customization is a HUGE let down.  Generic parts with no real brand names.  Some upgrades are pointless and offer non realistic gains.  Customizing the handling is also very lacking.Visuals while racing.  In Forza 3 you could spin the camera 360 degrees around at any point while driving and in the garage/paint/shop, you could look at your car every which way, in GT5, nothing! except front and interrior!  So weak!  You also cannot do a quarter of what Forza 3 can in terms of decals and shapes or pictures on your car.The feel of the game is just bland, from the way they present cars and the way it looks the same when you win license tests, it just sucks...after this long wait the game is a big let down for me.

Some people might be turned off by the fact that it is so easy, but that's what makes the game so great for me and other casual gamers. Even if you're not a huge Star Wars fan, this game is still a lot of fun. I even enjoyed watching the cut scenes because they're so funny. I ended up also buying the game on my PSP because I knew I'd be more motivated to play through and unlock everything in the game if I could play it on the go.If there was anything that I would complain about, it's the fact that the extras aren't all that exciting, at least not unless you're a hard-core Star Wars fan. I was thinking you would get to build all these vehicles with legos when you collected all the mini-kits, but all you get to do is look at the finished version of the vehicle outside the cantina, which acts as a hub to all the levels in the game. Once you pass all the levels, you're basically just collecting as many studs as you can to unlock all the characters and cheats.Fortunately, the levels are fun enough that I don't mind playing through many of them multiple times. As I said before, I bought the game on a second system, so I've played through many levels  4 or 5 times now and it's still a lot of fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2006"}
{"product_name":"B002I0F5M8","description":"","reviewerName":"DanD","summary":"A fantastic Batman experience.","reviewText":"I won't go so far as to say that ARKHAM ASYLUM was one of the greatest games of all time; I haven't played a whole lot of games, so I can't really make that judgment call.  I can say that it was one of the greatest games I've ever played, and was a breathtaking experience, the video game equivalent of a cinematic masterpiece.  Beautiful imagery, in-depth storyline, plenty of action and intrigue, and incredible acting.ARKHAM CITY ups the ante.  If anything, it's even more breathtaking.  Sure, a lot of the set-ups are clearly ripped from the previous game (the interior designs of a lot of places look almost identical), but that's really not an issue.  And yes, it has some of the same game-play problems (when fighting, you often lose track of your opponents); but again, big deal.  You can live with it.What CITY brings to the gaming experience is a fully-immersing superhero game.  You become Batman, as he glides through Arkham City, the new super-penitentiary for Gotham's worst criminals (and what a brilliant idea THAT was, giving the worst of the worst free reign over such a large chunk of territory).  There's something going down in Arkham, and Batman must figure out what it is.  It involves Hugo Strange...and an apparently-sick Joker...and the lives of a whole lot of people...CITY has quite a bit to offer.  Unlike with ASYLUM, here we have fully-fledged side missions; you can take them at your leisure (and they can be rather difficult).  You unlock more stuff by doing them, so I suggest you hop to it.  You can also play as Catwoman, again on side-missions (sort of like deleted scenes).  In many ways, she's more entertaining to control than the Bat, as she can crawl up buildings and across certain ceilings.  Along with these (and more) new features, CITY brings back many of the things we liked: the gadgets, the perfect voice cast (Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy, anyone?), the fast-paced swooping action, the blow-by-blow street fighting...I don't get excited about too many games.  ARKHAM CITY has me excited.  Simply put, it's fun to be the Batman.  Especially in a story as rich and layered as this one.  To me, the greatest games are all about the depth of the story; if I'm going to play for hours on end, I need something to keep me glued to my controller.  ARKHAM CITY has that something.  It's a breathtaking experience.  Yes, almost like your favorite movie--except this time, you're a part of it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2011"}

This bundle is worth it. You save 60 bucks easily. Bundle comes with a game and memory card along with the usual cords. The game doesnt come in a game case and the memory card isnt packaged like they are in retail stores. Thats one minor gripe. I played the Vita for a good two hours right out the box before charging. The color is nice. Its different and definitely stands out amongst the black ones. Its very sturdy and when using the touch screen, yours screen wont leave a smudge if you have fairly clean non greasy hands. Colors on the PSV are so bright, youll rarell notice any dust or finger prints on the screen unless you look for them specifically. Sound is good if youre wearing headphones. Thumbs often get in the way of the speakers which causes a distorted sound. Havent played AC3 that much but it seems ok.

Those may never be brought back due to everyone playing from their households now, but let me tell you, this MK is BEYOND anything I could have hoped for.  The line-up of characters is perfect, the attention to detail in the graphics is unreal as you can see in the stage backgrounds, Krypt, fatalities, etc.  And if you wanted brutal, this game is EASILY the most extreme and gory MK so far.  There is a TON of single player content to go through with story modes, challenge tower, regular old school fight ladder with specific endings for each character like the old days, etc etc etc.  The fighting engine is pretty fast paced and I'm working on getting used to that, it is definitely much deeper than old MK games with the power bar and options you have with that.  Literally every special move comes in two forms due to the power bar and they all affect the opponent differently so there is endless combo options.

The scenery is epic and the quests are enjoyable. The open-ended world with so many opportunities represents the greatest of what powerful computing systems can do. Unfortunately one must be careful with such complex machines; attempting to carelessly port a game from one system to another can lead to an unplayable game.Bethesda made various mistakes with the PlayStation 3 release of Skyrim. They didn't offer reviewers the chance to play it before release, and the reason why soon became apparent. The game featured frame rate dips, huge save files, interminable load times, and freezes that required reboots. Patches were slow and sometime made the issues worse. The company repeatedly blamed Sony for designing an inferior console, refusing to take responsibility for the issues and ignoring the fact that other companies have been quite successfully developing for the console.Downloadable content has yet to be released for the PS3 and Bethesda has delayed development thereof until they release the latest package. Still no timeline on when PS3 owners can expect new content.You would hope that after raking in so many millions of dollars, Bethesda would start to care a bit about their loyal fans on the PlayStation 3. Evidently nothing has changed. We will be the last in line for fixes and content additions. This makes my advice rather succinct.

Ps3","reviewText":"Treyarch took a great game like Spiderman 2 and made it even better with Spiderman 3.This game has a lot that spiderman 2 didn't like:1)Swimming Thats right you can swim in the lakes and rivers and also the sewers.2)Subways and Sewers in freeroam This is a major improvement over Spiderman 2 which didn't even have these in freeroam.This is part of the much bigger city that this game contains.3)Better Random Crimes There is more of a variety you still have muggings,gang fights,and road rage missions but there is more variety and even with the missions you have to chase cars you don't bang on the car anymore you punch the guys hanging out of the window then you either stop the car by opening the trunk and distroying or webbing up the engine or tearing the doors off.4)A bigger city overall Not only are the subways and sewers accesible but the city is far larger.Example Spiderman 2 had only 1 bridge Spiderman 3 has 6 however only 1 goes out to an island.Note:The ps2/wii has only 1 bridge but that version is very different from 360/ps3.5)Graphics Spiderman looks better then he ever has before when playing on next gen as do buildings and other surroundings.There is also a lot more traffic and more detail in the people.As good as the graphics looked on spiderman 2 they look antimated compared to these.Sp 3 graphics look much more relistic.6)Buildings are higher.The Empire State Building for example is higher then it is in Spidey 2.7)Some Buildings are enterable in freeroam once you beat the story.8)Skydiving There are several skydiving missions from several buildings one of which is the Empire State Building.These are fun and they show the beauty of the city when dropping from such high altitudes.Why you skydive there is an opera song with some unknown singer.It's appropiate for the skydive.The skydive missions are really pretty at night.9)Bomb Tours Some of the story missions have it were you have to dismantle bombs but you can also do it in freeroam if you want to.These are fun challenges.10)Gang fight challenges.At anytime when you get ready you can go clean up gangs and see how fast you can do it for rewards by pulling up the map and going to challenges.There are 3 gangs The Apokilipse,Candy Aresonic(Sexy Girl Gang)and The Dragontails(These are the toughest gang to fight.)There are 10 missions in all and the bosses you fight are Calos The Madbomber Lizard,Scorpion,Rhino,Kingpin and Kraven as well as the movie villins Sandman,Venom and New Goblin.You also have the gang bosses which there are 3.In freeroam there is so much to do like random crimes,daily bugle missions etc.At some point in the game you aquire the black suit which is great.It features some moves that do more damage and the swinging is faster as well as the jumping.You eventually lose the black suit toward the end of the story but once you finish the game you get to play all the way thru again in the black suit.You also still have the red suit.You switch between the 2 in the characters menu.You have a second save point once beating the game.Also the Ps3 version will let you dowload the New Goblin.It's only 5.99 but he is fun to play around with in free roam and he can go higher then spiderman.He can actually go way over the highest buildings.Spiderman 3 has also added photomissions some of which you will do in the Daily Bugle and Dewolfe missions but also in the Lizard 1 and one of the Candy Aresonic Missions.Bruce Campell is still doing the narration and training.Subway and Sewer LocationsThese are hard to find when you first buy this game because they are not on the map.However you learn were they are by looking at buildings on the map close to the location.First off The Conners Lab Sewer.This is the only sewer in freeroam but you can get to it from 2 locations.The first way is to go to the Garment District on the map.You will see a short fat building.There is a subway entrance behind it.Go down the subway and to the left.Take the stairs on the right down.Once in the train station turn right.Swing until you see a large hole in the wall on the Left side.Go in the hole and go all the way to the end and you see a manhole.You will be prompted to mash keys on your controller.Once you open it go down.You will see another hole go down it.Adjust your camera and run to the end of the platform.You can then jump off into the sewer and start swimming.If you swing or swim far enough you will come to the end and see 2 holes in the wall above.These lead to Conners Lab which you can enter.This sewer only features small waterfalls as opposed to the big sewer at Morningside Drive were the Lizard 2 and Conners 2 mission is which feature tha large waterfalls.Unfortuanly the Morningside Sewer is only available in storymode.Now from the Lincoln Subway the Conners sewer is on the Right side of the wall instead of the Left.The right side is where you'll find the hole in the wall at Lincoln but it goes to the same sewer.Grand Cental Station SubwayThis building is located between the Empire State Building and Christler Building and there is a tall building behind it.This is the only building that has a subway in it.The other subways are in the street.Look for the short wide building on the map with a tall one behind it.Grand Central is white.There is a door you enter.Go to every door till you find the one that opens.Garment District SubwayOn the map the short fat building.The subway is behind it.Lincoln SubwayOn the map you will see a short fat building behind Central City Park.Behind the building is the subway.Lennox SubwayBehind and to the West of the Thoubourough Bridge.If you can't find it go on the bridge and come back down it looking to the left.You will see a building meeting the end of the bridge.Look straight left and you will see the subway.Harlom SubwayYou will see these buildings with green roofs.In front of the first one there is a subway at the street intersection.City Hall SubwayYou will see a industrial park with buildings in the grass.On the left side out from the grass there is a subway.There are more but that's all I'll list.Once you know where to look on the map their easy to get to.If you can't find them you can always get to them from the Grand Central Station Subway.The subway itself is done well you can even enter the mens and womens restroom.Some of the womens restrooms have tokens in them.There are also tokens hidden in other parts of the subway.There are trains that run thru it as well as abandoned subways.Notes of interestThe balloon,hospital,saving men from falling and rescuing people from a sinking boat are not in this game.You also can't catch a helicopter to gt to Liberty Island like you could with Spidey 2.Once you beat the game twice you can't start another game unless you create a new profile.Once you start a new profile you can switch between your 2 profiles and play your saved black or red spidey or the new game on your other profile.There is no need to delete your saves.The Cineractives are cool and once you get the bosses health down you do a cinematic which makes it look like your really watching the movie.They can be stressful thou because if you don't nail them you have to start over and if your health is low it you will die and have to start the whole mission over.After beating the game go into the menu and the arenas section.There are several differnt locations you fight in.Something I'd like to see in the next game are the Morning Side sewer in freeroam where you can open the manhole.An even bigger city with Coney Island and also a way to get to Liberty Island and the other 2 in this game.Also I was hoping to play as Venom in this game but you don't get to play as him.I hope this will be corrected in Spiderman 4.I hope Sega will look at Spiderman 3 and do The Incredible Hulk game like this one.Imagine the Hulk being able to swim and go into subways and sewers.I recommend this game as well as Spiderman 2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2007"}

{"product_name":"B0050SWVIQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Core","summary":"DeadSpace 3 An a step up","reviewText":"If you played the previous dead space titles, you'll notice a trend in the right direction. The games evolve both in gameplay as well as story, and our characters growth.Dead space 3, as most will note is a little more action oriented than the first 2. Just a little. Our main character has been around the block a time or two and knows what he's doing. So it make sense.Anyways, this game was a blast to play, both in Solo as well as Co-op. The gameplay is very satisfying, and the pacing of the story/action is well done.The weapon system is wonderful. I have created a spike impaling gun, that is electrified, rapid fire.. it is low damage, carries like 2000+ rounds times 2, because the bottom weapon is the same as the top. The rate of fire has been increased by a bit as well, modded. So it CHEWS through enemies.. all the while stunning the poop (amazon automatically censors) outta of them. And this is so awesome!I have yet to test all the weapon combinations because... I've enjoyed what I made, immensely and it works for me.Be nice if their were some \"infinite air\" reward one could get for their suit, because the space exploration part, is freaking awesome. More so if you can actually fly around without worry.So is it a buy? From my perspective. YES! I regret nothing with this purchase, awesome freaking game. The team behind this game, did an excellent job. The UI is great.. everything is just well thought out and placed.The game has suspense, scares, and adventure and action.Only one time did I have issues in the game, and that was during this cliff climbing experience going up the side of a icy mountain. The game play here... well it wasn't that smooth, I don't know if it was a glitch or what..but things were not obvious at first on movement, and I got stuck on the side of some crack and couldn't jump across, so I ended up dying repeatedly in one spot.. And what it was, I believe was I moved up to far.. But the other 99% of the game? It was fun. And even this bit was fun once I got it down.One thing I have to say about the story is this, they do tend to kill off characters a lot more than I like.. and it seems its just for the sake of \"Theme\" rather than good story.But again, glad I made the purchase. Well worth the investment in the company via my purchase.I'm going to go off on a short tangent here about the weapons in the game. I am now playing through on \"hard difficulty\" The monsters are tougher, and more likely to do finishing moves on you quicker. But the thing is, the game requires a little more skill, my weapons still work good. I still have fun.Now in Halo4, which is a first person shooter not a third person, the weapons in Legendary suck.. they sound great. But they don't do the damage they should. And its a poopy experience! I've been a fan of the series since #1 and I keep expecting the game to evolve more than it has.. DeadSpace has pulled this perfectly. But the Halo series... no, it hasn't. The universe is awesome. The Spartans are supposed to be awesome, the weapons suck..Oh! one more thing. For the most part, Co-op in DSpace3, works flawlessly.  I have a 10mb down and 5mb up Internet connection though. Ping is solid at 35ms (not the best). So that could play a part. That connection sure does cost me. Wish I could get better, but is what it is. Works.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000KLNLV4","reviewerName":"Joey Pimkowski","summary":"Anyone Remember the Guyver? Anyone?","reviewText":"Well, this game basically rips off that old Mark Hamill movie I saw on sci fi channel when I was a kid. It also steals a bit from Resident Evil 4 and Gears of War. Undaunted by all this I rather enjoyed myself while I was playing this, after all, if you're gonna steal, steal from the best. Then again, the Guyver kinda sucks, but in a good way.You play as Hayden Tenno, a CIA assassin in a Russian country in complete devastation from biological weapons exposure. Hayden ends up all mutated and his arm is turned into a sharp batarang and you have to blast and boomerang your way to Meznor who's basically your typical lunatic plotting all sorts of nastiness. You got Russian clean up crews in yellow hazmat jumpsuits as well as those nasty resident evil zombies and creatures that look like imps from the computer game Doom all standing in your way.So, what are you gonna do about it? Why shoot everything in sight in all ways reminisent of Gears of War and cut people in half with a sharp frisbee, of course. Along the way you buy guns from the shopkeeper from Resident Evil 4 with a stupid russian accent. You also have to solve really basic puzzles with your batarang, such as setting it on fire and throwing it at black gunk blocking doors. Sounds cool, huh?Yeah, you know, it kinda is. Everything is pretty solid and the graphics are pretty. The Glaive (frisbee) is a cool weapon and you can dual wield it with a few of the guns including a sick one handed shotgun, but the problem is that three quarters of the way through, the whole thing gets really stale. The story seems to just flatline for a couple chapters and the environments develop too much sameness. Chapter seven is the biggest offender and that level seems to just really drag. It does pick back up for the finale and you develop some new abilities which spice things up but you aren't given a whole lot of time to play with them.Another complaint is that most of the boss battles are trial and error, making each new fight more of a fancy puzzle than an action packed all out battle royale. For me, the high point of a game like this should be giant crazy bosses that kick up the adrenaline and that's sadly not the case here.Basically, what you have here is a game that tries really hard to be alot of other games and when it tries something original, it basically falls flat. Not all is lost, however, because now is a perfect time to give this thing a try as you can buy this up for the price of a rental. Honestly, despite some serious issues with the middle section here, this game is decent and I can't say I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel take the concept to another level. So go ahead and pick it up, I got mine for three bucks and pick up the Guyver, if only to compare Hayden's armor at the end of the game to that movie.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2010"}

For this game pak to operate, you must have an N64 expansion pak(sold separately installed in Your N64).","reviewerName":"Sylph StarWind \"sylphstarwind35\"","summary":"Great Game","reviewText":"I really enjoyed this game. It's similar to Ocarina of Time in combat and style, for those of you who tried it. That is, it has action combat where you can use various items, techniques, and attacks. It's easy to learn how to fight.The story follows Link, or whatever you decide to call him, a boy who is looking for a lost friend. He was travelling through the woods when a skullkid (a child-like forest dwelling creature) with a magical mask and two fairies ambushes him and steals his horse and his ocarina. Link follows the skullkid into a cave where he is transformed into a deku scrub (a little wooden guy). The skullkid runs away and leaves one of his fairies behind. The fairy, in order to reunite with her brother, joins Link. The two continue through the cave and get to Clock Town, in the land of Termina. Clock Town has a problem, however: the scary-looking moon is falling on top of it. Link has three days to catch the skullkid, who is using the mask to bring down the moon, or the town is destroyed. It's kind of tough to manage your time sometimes, especially if you're new to Zelda games and you have no help. But you'll get used to it.The music is very nice. It matches the area and the situation, like music for battle, senimental moments, or in the desert or at sea. I wouldn't mind having the soundtrack. The sound effects are realistic and the voices are decent. The graphics are good for N64.A feature unique to this game is the use of special masks that give you certain abilities. A few examples are the bomb mask (blows up), the faerie mask (glows when fairies are around), and my favorite, the bunny mask, which makes you run faster and look adorable. There are a good number of masks to collect, and you get them through interesting quests. There are three major masks that don't just give you abilities, but transform your body. They are the deku scrub mask, the zora mask, and the goron mask. Each form has it's own powers and you'll need them in certain areas.This is one of my top ten favorite games. It is almost, though not quite, as good as Ocarina of Time, which is probably the best Zelda game ever. There are few, if any, problems. I definitely recommend it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2004"}
{"product_name":"B0009UBR3A","reviewerName":"eternal now \"roejoerrer\"","summary":"Final Gamecube Epic...Gamecube goes out with a bang of Glory","reviewText":"Lets face it, the current generation systems (meaning XBOX, Playstation 2 and the Nintendo Gamecube), are on their way out the door. Some, most notably the Gamecube have forefully jammed their foot in the door and are relenting to move. With the release of The Legend of Zelda: The Twilight Princess, Nintendo shows that they wanted Gamecube fans to have one last great game before the end comes, which it will. And a great game this is! The Twilight Princess was relased on both Gamecube and the Wii, and the graphics for the Gamecube version rival that of the Wii's!!! However, since the Wii is still in its trial phase, that doesn't really say all that much, just that the Gamecube version is no slouch at all! With THE best graphics to ever grace Nintendo's dying system, the Twilight Princess presents us with smooth looking and \"darker\" graphics. Those of you who have played The Wind Waker and hated the child like animation, fear not! The Twilight Princess' graphics are much more \"grown up\" looking and much darker, in both shading, look and feel. While the game still has the same problems that other games do on this system (notably the jagged edges that you will see once in a while in the graphics), the game looks stunningly beautiful and fresh. The controls are good ol' zelda controls, so there is nothing to complain about there.On to the game...The story like mirrors the Ocarina of Time, the Zelda game released for the Nintendo 64 (way back in the day). For those of you that have spent much blood, sweat and tears trudging through that challenge, your in for a treat! All of the temples, villages and even the great Hyrule Field make their appearance again, this time revamped in both graphics and challenge. For example, you go to the Gorgon mountain, Zora's temple and the forest temple, just like in Ocarina of Time. And you start off in the same viilage (in the same hut!) as you do in Ocarina of Time. Your horse is the same (Epona). But the graphics are much better looking! The sound  (especially if you are playing in surround sound  digital) is amazing! Everything from chains clanking against the ground, to echos sound true to life and awesome.The dungeons (in my opinion) are much more challenging in a puzzle aspect, however the bosses are somewhat simplistic. I suppose they made the battles easy because Zelda fans range anywhere from 10 years of age and up. Nevertheless, the boss battles are inventive and creative, many of them have left me in awe (wait till you fight the boss of the Gorgon Mine dungeon)!I am about halfway through Zora's temple (not even sure how far in the game that is), and I am still intrigued.Now, don't go thinking that Twilight Princess is an exact port of The Ocarina of Time. No, they have added enough new content to keep it fun and new. For example, following the story of the Twilight Princess, there are \"Twilight\" versions of the world, where you are transformed into a wolf and you have to complete certain missions before you can turn back into human form. And, you have a permanent sidekick named Midna, who is from the \"Twilight\" world and who aids you.I would have to say that sometimes the gameplay when you turn into a wolf seems a little contrived, as if they threw it in just so there would be variation. The wolf missions are all similar (i.e kill a bunch of insects and gather a life force of some sort), but they are fun in their own right. Heck, the graphics and the dungeon missions are worth this game alone!Overall, if you are a Zelda fan, or just a fan of great adventure games, and you own a Gamecube, pick this one up! Even if you don't own one, this game is worth picking up a Gamecube for. They are really cheap these days, and I would recommend you not go without this experience!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2007"}

Bradford \"scottfbradford\"","summary":"Best for kids","reviewText":"I've owned a Gameboy Advance, Advance SP, PSP, and now a DS Lite.  I'm an adult and I buy portable game devices to play while traveling.  I like the portablility of a game player as opposed to packing a heavy stack of books.On my last trip I played Clubhouse Games, Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow, Metroid Pinball, and Tiger Woods golf.  Castlevania and Metroid bored me, but I enjoyed golf and playing solitare and bowling in Clubhouse.  The touchpad was very useful for card games in general, but I don't think it improved the gameplay in golf.  I'm also concerned about its durability.  After only 2 weeks of light use and gentle play, my pad was already showing signs of scratching and wear.The form of the DS Lite is nice.  The screens are sharp and bright, the size and weight are good.  However, using the shoulder buttons was a bit awkward.  All of my previous portables lasted about 4-5 hours on a single charge.  The DS lasted a couple of hours longer, but still not long enough for a 13 hour flight.  However, I set the screen brightness to the second to lowest setting and not the lowest setting.  In darkness, the lowest setting is fine, but if any ambient light is present, the lowest setting is too dim in my opinion.  My DS would also not charge when using a 220 to 120 voltage adapter in China.  Thankfully the hotels we stayed in had 115 voltage outlets in the bathrooms.So how does the DS Lite compare to the PSP?  I like the clam shell case for the DS since it protects the screens when not in use.  The DS is also lighter, the battery lasts longer, and its cheaper.  The PSP has a bigger screen, built in web browser, can play movies on either memory cards or UMD discs, and can also play mp3 music files.  But the main decision should be based on the game libraries.  I personally don't care for either library very much.  The DS library has a lot of cartoonish, kiddie games, while the PSP has a lot of just plain mediocre games.  Ultimately I decided that I don't care for portable gaming.  The games flat out disappoint me as compared to my Xbox 360 and PS3 games.  When traveling, I get much more enjoyment out of reading good books and I don't have to worry about battery charging.  So the DS Lite is going to Ebay along with all my other portables.  I guess I'll just have to lug around a stack of books.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00000ID61","reviewerName":"Simon","summary":"The pinnacle of Star Fox","reviewText":"Even a decade down the line, this is a great game. The original Star Fox on SNES used a ground-breaking chip to create rudimentary 3D graphics. The N64 version took that and essentially upgraded it, giving the graphics an overhaul and tossing in a few new gameplay enhancements. This was one of the first games on the N64 to feature large amounts of speech, and also the first to use the rumble pak.You are Fox McCloud, leader of the Star Fox mercenary team. You blast through levels shooting up everything in sight, and blowing up massive bosses. The game uses a branching system, where out of the 15 possible levels you will explore a total of 7 in any given play-through. So each play-through is short, but there is replay value in going back and unlocking the alternate paths. And the action is so fast and intense that you'll be coming back multiple times anyway.There was never really a Star Fox game for Gamecube to top this one, so Star Fox 64 still remains a favourite. Proof that great gameplay can outlast aging graphics. A must-own for any N64 collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2007"}

Nightfire is a quality game that won't let fans down.In Nightfire you are 007 and you must stop the evil Drake and his Nightfire plan. There are 12 action packed levels combining combat, stealth, and gadgets. You meet up with beautiful villians and heros along your way to stop Drake.One player mode is pretty good in this game. The levels are pretty challenging. Some are harder than others, but it makes for good single player gameplay. The driving levels are really cool. Bonds Aston Martin Vanquish is an awesome car and they are some of the coolest levels. The single player levls are better than the ones EA made for &quot;The World is Not Enough&quot; and &quot;Agent Under Fire,&quot; but they still aren't as good as &quot;Goldeneyes&quot; were.Multiplayer is where this game really exceeds. It's not as good as &quot;Goldeneye&quot; but it's really why I love the game. There are different kinds of Multiplayer levels to choose from. Theres arena and team arena. King of the Hill and Team King of the Hill are also playable. There is Capture the Flags for the guys who love it.  There are 6 AI Bots you can add to the game for a total of up to 10 players in the matches.This is a great game. I don't know if it's as good as the new one because I haven't played it yet. It is however a great first person shooter game and is the second best game to Goldeneye in the Bond franchise.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000R0SR9E","description":"A supernatural horror action game with a story devised by the master mythmaker, novelist and filmmaker Clive Barker. Mingling the darkest elements of Barker's horror fiction and films, Jericho deals with the mysterious reappearance of a lost city in a remote desert. When a form of evil that goes right back to the dawn of days resurfaces from there, a Special Forces squad, trained in both conventional warfare and the arcane arts, is sent in. Their mission: hunt down and destroy the evil that lurks at the heart of the city before it destroys humanity.","reviewerName":"Gustavo \"VidGame Junkie\"","summary":"A Nice Little Thriller","reviewText":"Clive Barker is known as the man who created Hellraiser. For those of you who haven't seen it and have a weak stomach, don't watch it. What defines his work is the detail of gore. But now he has put this into an all out game? Interesting. The idea looked good, and I was looking for a horror to add to my library, so I bought it. It was a cheap price at a Gamestop, considering that it is an old game. Now, after having it for a few months, I shall take you through the highlights and the mud. For this game, you are lucky to see mud instead of blood-filled mud.Looks: The game itself is one of the best detailed games I have (though my library isn't large, take it for what it is). The textures look nice and the ememies, namely hellish, zombie-like crazy people, have a sickly shiny look to them, making them look all bloody and juicy. The areas look nice for a game set like this, meaning its looks fit the theme. So yes, there will be brown dungeon after brown dungeon, but what were you expecting? Strawberry fields??AI: Enemy AI is fitting, but your team AI are....plainly stupid. Being that this game is squad based, you have a squad. Sometimes, your team makes the decision to put themselves right in front of the suicide bomber. Smart. Plus, these guys hardly know how to aim; when it comes to the suicide bombers, who only die when you hit their glowing zits instead or just bombing them, the just load them with bullets, not getting anywhere. The team AI needs work, essentially.Gameplay: I'd like to consider this an arcade style game. Let me lay this down; there are sections to go through, litered with wave after wave of enemies. No puzzles, just kill a wave, move on, kill another wave, move on. And if you are annoyed by having to deal with an enemies twin, well expect there to be at least 100 look-alikes. If that doesn't bother you, which it realy shouldn't, then you will be alright. Then at the end of the section, you fight a boss. Win, off to the next part. From my earlier point of this game being squad based, you rarely use the tatical approach. You, essentially, just fire on the enemy; no need for cover, since there really isn't one. There is only one section where the tatical piece is really needed. Go figure, that section is a WWII style area. In the game, you have the ability to switch between teamates. If one dies, you warp to the next one. You can \"tag\" a fallen teamate to put them back into action. But, since the AI is stupid, they end up getting knocked out constantly, so half of the combat is tagging. If all of the team falls, game over.Horror: For the horror aspect, there are a few times when things jump out. There is one time where you get the idea that it is never a good idea to be right next to a suicide bomber (it equals instant death), then at one point it comes right out of a corner a few feet away. You're not scared because it popped out, but the ideology of how much of a problem the guy is. Other than that, the horror does lack, only putting sugar on top by adding nasty looking areas and enemies.Story: Loading screens do give bits of the story, and you have to pay attention to the cut scenes to get an idea of how th story is. If you don't catch that, you'll be lost. It is the fact of that the story is difficult to figure out that turns me off, even though I think it is well put together, yet a bit cliche (but what game isn't these days?). There are back stories in the extras bin if you are interested.Challenge: Unless your fingers and eyes get tired of having to shoot waves of baddies, there isn't much challenge starting off. But some of the extras force you to play the game at harder difficulties, even trying to avoid being knocked out completely. So the harder levels, and challenging yourself to not be knocked out while in battle adds more arcade bragging rights.Final Thoughts: This isn't the best game in the world, even entirely rated as a \"meh\" game. But for me (another reason why it is arcade like) I find myself playing it over many times, even though the game itself is lackng. That may just be me, I'm weird like that, but the replay value is nice. But for those who want a great game all around, look away.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005QDPZ","description":"Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron IIfeatures some of the  best graphics ever seen on a home console, and it is a proper, old-fashioned,Star Warsgame. If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies. The ships move with a fluidity and grace you wouldn't have thought  possible from such a tiny purple cube. The only flaw is that the missions are  needlessly short, but there's plenty of replayability, and by gosh there's those  graphics.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Patrick L. Randall","summary":"GameCube Launches in Style","reviewText":"Star Wars: Rogue Leader (Rogue Squadron 2) marks the first time that Nintendo has launched a new platform without its main launch title being from the Mario family of games.  While the initial set of launch games does keep the Mario series going with Luigi's Mansion, Rogue Leader is Nintendo's crown jewel for the GameCube and it plays like it.  Some Star Wars games have show the tendency to be very mediocre and disappointing (Rebel Assault II comes to mind), but I was pleasantly surprised with quality and replay value of the original Rogue Squadron for N64.  The challenge wasn't only in beating the game, it was in obtaining gold medals on each of the levels in the game.  The challenge of obtaining the medals (bronze, silver, and gold) drove me to keep playing each board even after defeating it.  It made me a more disciplined player and gave me a greater sense of satisfaction when I achieved the desired medal.  I eventually got all the gold medals around the time that talk of the sequel, Rogue Leader, was getting started up.  As soon as I got the GameCube for Christmas, I made sure Rogue Leader was the first game I bought.  What an amazing game!!!  The graphics are unparalleled on any game on any platform that I have seen (and this includes Playstation 2 and X-Box).  Unlike Rogue Squadron, which followed a storyline in a time period independent of the movies, Rogue Leader's storyline runs parallel to the original trilogy.  As a result, the gameplayer gets engage in battles above the original Death Star (including the spectacular trench run), Hoth, Bespin, Endor, and the second Death Star.  Additionally, the other boards focus on events hinted at in the movies or literature about that time period in the Star Wars Universe (Vengeance at Kothlis is one of my favorites of that bunch).  All told, there are 10 main levels, 1 Tatooine Training Mission level, and 5 bonus missions (which can only be unlocked using the points accrued by obtaining medals on each of the main levels and subsequent unlocked bonus levels).  It should be noted that two of the bonus levels are fascinating alternate reality scenarios where you get to fly Darth Vader's tie fighter and destroy rebel ships above the Death Star and then destroy there base on Yavin.  The final bonus level is the \"Endurance\" stage where you fight above the Death Star and have to destroy 99(!) waves of Imperial fighters.  There's a little trick to do so and once you figure it out, the only challenge is just investing the time to defeat the board (it's taken me 4 hours, but a Gold Medal is all but assured if you defeat all the waves).  The Tatooine Training mission is not required for any of the regular or bonus mission goals (though completing it during 4 separate time periods is required for unlocking ACE mode), but it is a very good way to get familiarized with the game controls and the types of techniques you can and will need to use during the regular missions.  If I have any quibble with the game, and it's only a minor one, it's that Rogue Leader doesn't give you much (i.e. nothing at all) in terms of fanfare for achieving all the Gold Medals or all the ACE Medals.  At least the original Rogue Squadron gave you a little fireworks celebration.  But, I digress.  It's a tiny complaint that cannot even begin to detract from overall superior quality of this game.  Nintendo continues to get it right and continues to justify my support of them as the game system of choice.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2002"}

This game was one of the few I remember having long lines making that trip to the mall very intense, just hoping to get a chance at a game or two!Fast forward almost 20 years and you have this gem!  Ive been playing the demo on PS3 for about 2 weeks, just enjoying the two levels and 4 characters, since Xbox never got a demo it was my only choice.Finally today I got the 360 version and so far its amazing!  First let me start by saying the graphics are insane and beautiful, the colors just explode on the screen!  I saw a few reviews talking about bad graphics, and its a shame, cause on my 60\" Sony LED, its just incredible.So far this morning I played a bit of training, which is a great addition to the game, whether your a veteran MK player or just picking it up the first time.  The training includes a tutorial that covers basic moves and skills, Fatality Tutorial which as you'd guess helps you with performing fatalities...everything from the button combo and distance/location is covered here.  Finally a practice and tag team practice mode are included, both allow just that practice without getting into the actual challenges and/or tier fights.Challenge tower is quite impressive everything from the presentation the the actual 300 challenge tower is awesome.  It starts off with a pre selected character and fighter for you along with a challenge to complete...it starts off easy, tutorial style really...then well lets just say hopefully you were one of the kids in the arcade who kept his place at the controls.  Over all this mode seems like its gonna be a blast, and well quite challenging.I only messed around with the story mode for a few minutes, but it seems intriguing with lots of fighters this mode could take alot of your time!  The opening scene is really great!So far I'm very impressed, everything from sound, visuals, and gameplay are amazing!  If your a fan of the older, original games (MK-MKIII) you're in for a real treat.  The 2D plane is one thing I never realized how much I missed until playing this game for the first time (demo).  The stages also need to be mentioned, the backgrounds alone distract you enough to make you lose the round, I don't wanna ruin anything but there are a few creatures lurking that really catch the eye!Overall this game is a a must have for any MK fan, its a great game so far, and includes tons of features and game types to keep you going.

The story takes place during the considerable gap of time between the 2nd and 3rd seasons of the show.With the actors from the show voicing their characters and the music and script written by the guys who work on the real show, it should not have been too hard to please me with this game. And in that respect, the game fulfilled, but did not exceed, my expectations.While I enjoyed watching this extra \"day\", the gameplay left a lot to be desired. There was quite a bit of variety, which was nice, and you get to play as almost every character from the show. There were so many different types of missions that the standard \"get from point A to point B while shooting people\" missions only made up about 60% of the game. The rest of the game involved driving, computer hacking, interrogating, sniping, and such. This would be really cool if all these missions were actually fun. Pretty much any mission involving driving sucked, since the controls were incredibly sloppy. Interrogation was kind of fun the first time, but it didn't need to be done several times. There were three or four different computer hacking missions that got done over and over again, so that they weren't much fun by the end of the game. As for the rest of the game, I'd describe it as mediocre. There wasn't anything spectacular about the gameplay; there were too many missions where the environment was so dark that it was impossible to see where I was going; and there was no reason at all for there to be two missions that involved shooting down a helicopter.In addition, there were too many missions that were unnecessarily difficult, in my opinion. In one such mission, you are playing as Jack and you have to defend a girl who is defusing a bomb. There is basically an endless supply of terrorists who keep rushing out and start shooting at you, and if the girl takes any damage at all she starts whining and stops working. It wouldn't be nearly so annoying if it weren't for the fact that there doesn't seem to be any strategy whatsoever to beating the mission. I must have made a dozen attempts with varying degrees of success. I have no idea what I did differently when I finally beat it. Pretty much any mission that involves you protecting another person is extremely annoying, because that person will usually tend to stand out in the open taking damage instead of finding cover. And despite the fact that your partner is firing their weapon constantly, they never hit a single enemy, so you have to take everyone out yourself.In all, the game is worth playing through for the story if you're a fan of the show. Otherwise, you could find much better action games out there.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2006"}

For one, I got to keep my rings after playing the bonus levels, and Knuckles' gliding ability added an awesome new dimension to the game. My favorite level out of all of them had to be the Casino Level, hands-down.

I loved the first Spider-Man game. The graphics were crisp and detailed, the story was deep and involving, and the controls were precise and tight. Then Grand Theft Auto: Vice City came out, which completely re-wrote the video game genre. Games like True Crime and The Getaway were released that practically copied the GTA formula: Free roaming cities, mini-missions, mayhem and violence, etc. Add Spider-Man 2 to the list with mediocre results.I admit that I was initially excited when I heard that Spider-Man could now swing freely through the city and bust bad guys on the streets below. Though the former is exhilirating and excellently implemented, the latter is dull and repititious. Like GTA, there is a mini-map of the city in the upper right hand corner of the screen. Whenever there is trouble, a green icon will appear in the location where a crime is taking place. Unfortunately, there is a lack of variety in these missions. You will either have to prevent a robber from getting away, take an injured civilian to the hospital, catch a civilian from falling to his or her death, or save people from a sinking boat. After a few of these, you'll begin wishing that the game would just get on with the story. Solving these missions contribute to your \"Hero Points\" which allow you to purchase moves and combos from a Spidey Store. Since when did Spidey have to buy his own moves and combos? Strange...Unfortunately, due to the heavy reliance on memory and processing power to produce the massive scope of the game, the graphics are the first to suffer. In most instances, the game resembled a Playstation 1 game. Spidey generally looks good, but the other characters in the game look like spray-painted cardboard boxes. I would have preferred a much scaled-down city in order to boost the quality of the graphics because quite frankly, Spider-Man 2 is an ugly game.Fans of the first game will most likely be disappointed with the sequel. Though the ability to explore the city by swinging from building to building is a treat, the gameplay and graphics truly suffer. This one is definately a rental.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00004U5VK","description":"PlayStation2 owners with a passion forResident Evil's  genre-launching gameplay are in luck: Capcom delivers the same  world-famous gameplay style (sans zombies) in a beautiful action-adventure  set in a mystical medieval Japanese kingdom.Onimusha: Warlordsprobably won't win any awards for groundbreaking gameplay, but the  fast-paced action promises to overload the senses with more than enough  stimuli to notice.The experience is set in 16th-century Japan, a fantastical era in which  warlords clash for control of the country. As the samurai Samanosuke,  players volunteer to rescue the kidnapped princess Yuki. No surprise  that the ultimate goal (and the entire story line, for that matter)  falls by the wayside as hordes of demons converge on the player hour  after hour. The weapons system benefits from the flashy graphics--as  players discover and add gems to a gauntlet, weapon upgrades increase  firepower with increasingly dramatic effects.Graphically, the game is stunning. Carving through the levels--forests,  tunnels, and the requisite dark, dank castle environment--isn't  anything less than a spectacular experience, thanks much in part to the  game's unusually high production values. Character models are built  from up to 10,000 polygons each--high detail, even for a PS2 game.  Subtle environmental effects--the wind flowing through the trees, for  instance, ripples the fabric in characters' clothes--furthers the  game's realism. The game's backgrounds are painstakingly detailed and  nicely enhanced by dynamic lighting effects.The talent behind the aural effects is just as impressive. Japanese  actor Takeshi Kaneshiro lent his voice to the main character, and a  200-piece orchestra delivers a dramatic score.Call over any PS2 skeptics in your neighborhood, then load upOnimusha: Warlords.

At this new pricepoint, it's definitely worth picking up. Graphics are good as is the special effects. Controls might take some getting used to for some. It's pretty much a Resident Evil type of control except now you have swords instead of heavy guns. You have your choice of Japanese or English language with subtitles. The dubbing is actually pretty well done here. Doesn't seem like the typical bad martial arts dubbing. My one gripe for this game is the inability to skip past certain fmv scenes that you already viewed. It becomes kinda cumbersome if you repeatedly die at one point only to have to repeat certain scenes and puzzles again just to get back to the last puzzle you died on.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2002"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Enjoyable, yet flawed","reviewText":"A futuristic London beseiged by demonic forces?  Sounds like a fun environment to me, and that's the setting of Hellgate: London, the much anticipated action/RPG from EA and Flagship.  Loading up on loot and upgrading your character is the name of the game, with varying classes to choose from as well that determine what view you'll be playing from, including first and third person.  The action elements are outshined by the RPG elements with Hellgate: London, but make no mistake that the overall gameplay is no less addictive for it.  What really hurts Hellgate: London though is that the game shows off it's best stuff, and then doesn't so anything else to match or top it.  It won't be long until the various enemies start looking similar and the environments become nearly identical.  There are noticable technical glitches as well in an otherwise great looking game, which only looks better if you have a DirectX 10.  The game's story is also worth noting, as it tries to weave in some comical moments that don't really work too well, and all together doesn't really amount to a whole lot as well.  All in all, Hellgate: London is an enjoyable, yet flawed, spin on the Diablo formula that is definitely worth checking out to be sure, but until some patches are put out, the game is better left on the shelf.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2007"}

I have never played a street fighter before this, but it looked kind of interesting. Needless to say, I am hooked! It's a very addictive game, with lots of characters to choose from.First off, if you are looking for a good story, then this is not for you. Each character has their own little story played in the beginning of the game, but those stories are very vague and I am still not clear on the main purpose of the game. Here is what I got out of it: There is an evil corporation called S.I.N., run by this guy named Seth. The corporation is hosting some sort of fighting competition, and each character has their reasons to join and defeat Seth. Unless you play as Seth, in which case your \"goal\" is to defeat this one woman character (can't remember her name). Not sure how correct this interpretation is.But the story is not really the point of this game, the main point is to fight! What I liked about this game is that for me, a newcomer, it is really easy to pick up and play without much learning. There is a tutorial type thing in the game that teaches you the moves, but I didn't really find it necessary. But while it's easy to play, it's hard to master. You can't go into the hardest mode without some practice (at least I couldn't). Also learning all the special moves takes some time. I like that about this game, because it makes you want to keep coming back and playing more to get better.The pictures of the game don't really do the graphics justice. I love the graphics of this game. This is one of the only games I play on my 3DS with 3D on, because it adds a lot of depth to the game, with out causing my eyes to strain like some of the other 3D games. Also, I love how colorful the game is. Some people have complained about how the backgrounds don't move in this game, but in the end of the day you don't look at the backgrounds while you play, you look at the action. The game has two view to play it; you can choose to face the action from the front or from an angle. While viewing it from an angle is a nice perspective, I found viewing it from the front easier to work with.I really like this game, and I don't regret purchasing this at all!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2011"}
{"product_name":"B004FSE52C","description":"","reviewerName":"The Rev \"one chill guy\"","summary":"Pretty good story, unnecessary multiplayer","reviewText":"Well after finally getting my hands on this, I really enjoyed playing this. I enjoyed the story, I wanted to keep playing the game and coming back, even though I enjoyed the story I thought it was pretty predictable, once you got not too far into the game and saw the signs and noticed what was happening, I was able to pretty well predict the ending, though there was a twist it wasn't really any different from how I predicted it to end. I think I would've enjoyed the game a lot more if it wasn't for this. I also couldn't really understand why she didn't do anything to stop another character from doing what he/she did, Lara could've prevented something from happening in the story but she didn't do anything.One part of of the story that I did really like what watching Lara go from a somewhat innocent girl to a hardened survivor, she goes through a lot of pain mentally and physically, and as for the physical part, it was pretty brutal, but the one thing that I didn't like is how she's just an academic explorer, yet she has no problem w/ killing people. The characters in your crew were pretty good, a couple I liked, but the ones you see most often I thought were pretty cliche, the big tough but nice guy, the emotional at times black woman, etc.The adventure aspect is awesome, scaling walls, zipping down lines, and you definitely feel and hear every landing in your head, really like the immersion from that. The island is very well done as well, loved the setting of an island w/ old Japanese buildings, then seeing crashed WW2 ships on a beach. The combat was good and bad, guns I thought were a bit weak, especially the shotgun, I also found it a bit hard to quickly aim and place a good shot up close, but the dodge made the combat a lot more fun, after a while it became lethal and a big part of combat. You get the usual 4 weapons, each with its own usefulness of course. The quick time events were sometimes really annoying, but the rest were fine.Collecting salvage to upgrade guns as well as earning skill points added a lot to the game, made it pretty addictive to upgrade your weapons and get a new skill. Side mission tombs were also fun, I'm not a big puzzle person but I enjoyed a good amount of them, it was also nice that they weren't overly complicated yet hard enough to make you think for a bit. I also enjoyed how there were certain areas that you weren't able to get to until you got the right equipment later on in the game.Multiplayer was pretty unnecessary and bad, it was just people randomly jumping rolling around chaotically with no sense of direction or purpose, like the singleplayer I found the aiming to be annoying if not worse and didn't help there was no reticule while not aiming, the mp did carry over the adventure aspects from the singleplayer like zip lines and climbable walls but it only allowed people just to easily escape when you starting shooting them, you can set traps but they're pretty useless as like everyone else you probably won't sit there and wait for someone to get trapped, typical mp modes, the one new mode was Cry for Help, but it was pretty unbalanced towards one team, unlocks did add some incentive to keep playing but you just don't really want to keep coming back because of the gameplay.Overall, I recommend you play this game, good story, great character, great setting, upgrading weapons, getting new skills and finding salvage/collectibles is pretty addictive; and great graphics.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2013"}

With an all-new, deep story that approaches the familiar sights and sounds of the infamous Liberty City from a different perspective, an innovative control system and multiplayer options,Chinatown Warscaptures the tone and flavors of the long-runningGTAseries in unique ways that both longtime players and those coming to it for the first time will find hard to put down..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Grand Theft Auto:Chinatown WarsPlayers:Offline: 1; Online: 2Gameplay Modes:Single player; competitive &amp; coop multiplayer via Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.Kick some tail as Huang Lee.View larger.Use the DS stylus like never before.View larger.Reconquer Liberty via PDA.View larger.The Story: Left for Dead in the Worst Place in AmericaFollowing his father&rsquo;s murder, Huang Lee is given what seems a simple mission: to deliver an ancient sword to his Uncle Kenny to ensure his family retains control of the Triad gangs of Liberty City. Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars.

This silent hill certainly has raised the graphics bar considerably, but graphics don't make a silent hill game good.  This game was kind of hit and miss for me.  It started off good then started to taper off. I'd read the combat was better and i suppose i agree to some extent, but overall its still frustrating.  They have added a dodge feature, but the timing is really tricky and i found myself getting hit more than i dodged, which pissed me off...alot.  I like my silent hill games to be stressful to some extent, but not because the combat controls stink something awful.  The fog still looks fantastic, but i found myself missing the dark grey grainy look from the older games.  Most of the puzzles were very simple, but i came across one in attic of your parents house that is so fracking annoying i almost quit playing right there, i had to get online to find the solution.

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Neyen \"Neyen2000\"","summary":"Fun, but hard","reviewText":"This game has beautiful colors, and the story, is great, and is very fun.

Im serious this is an awesome game. It has a great roster with just about every popular hero and villian thats in the dc universe. They include Superman, Batman, Joker, Flash and Scorpion.....yeah thats right. The MK character makes an appearance as a dlc fighter (by the way he looks awesome).The plot is great. Its hard to explain without spoiling much. But in order to have a better understanding on whats going on you have to read the digital prequel comic thats still going on ($0.99 each) with issue #23 just coming out. So you will need to spend at least $24 (there will be at least one more issue) to know why did this happen.Going back to the dlc. We were given a season pass for $15/1200mps that comes with 4 new fighters (Lobo, Batgirl, Scorpion and General Zod) and a new skin pack (Flashpoint versions of Wonderwoman, Deathstroke and Aquaman) plus some free skins (dont need to buy the pass). Which is a great deal but there are countless of skin packs, all awesome that arent included. So you will to lay out more money then you were have every dlc. So either you pay a lot, are missing some or just the pass.The modes are incredible. There are so many that will last a while to beat so you get your money's worth. There is Storymode (simular to the one jn MKvsDC and MK), arcade tower (called classic mode), star labs (simular to challenge tower in MK) and of course online. So it might take a while for you to be 100% done.Overall its a great game that you need go buy.Pros:-Great cast of super heroes-Great plot-Many modes that will have you play the game for a whileCons:-Well need read the prequel comic to understand the plot more-So many dlc items outside of the season pass","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00004U5VF","description":"The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.--Jeff Gerstmann--Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

No.  But it is an unqualified success as a game.  It takes much of what preceded it in the Tekken series and elevates it with eye-popping graphics and hip new sound.Now let me speak to all those who are griping.  Here is a fact: This game is DEEP.  Not a little, a LOT.  If you're complaining because you can only pull off a simple move, then you simply haven't spent enough time on the game to learn to love the intricacy of it.  It saddens me to think that the potential of this game is so huge that most gamers will only scratch the surface before their simple minds get frustrated and they go back to Barney-o, excuse me... Mario and suck their thumbs.  Tekken demands a lot from the player, and if you aren't willing to excel, then go buy Fuzzy Bunnies 5 for N64.  Only gamers need apply.And anyone who recommends Soul Caliber or DOA2 over 3T, I will say this.  If you need cartoon T&amp;A to get you to play a fighting game, you are a sad and pathetic human being.  DOA2's engine is a decent foundation, but any credibility gets thrown right out the window with the constant jiggle factor thrown in so the pre-teens can dream about handling the merchandise.And as for Soul Calibur (a great game, no argument there) I will say this: Weapon-based fighters are inherently inferior.  Great, one person stands on one side of the room, the other person stands on the other, and you both pull off cheesy moves without ever getting into striking distance.  And inevitably in weapon-based fighters, both players have &quot;special moves&quot; (Soul Calibur is guilty of this) that all but cripple your opponent's life-bar.  If you want to fight, hand-to-hand combat is the only way to go.  If you want to flail around with a sword twice as big as your body (Toshinden anyone?) while remaining out of range of the other guy, why bother?  It turns into a game of keep-away, not a strike-counterstrike effort.Yes, Tekken takes much of its gameplay from its predecessors.  It's called &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot;  The move-base is expanded though, and it is possible to use multiple styles with the same person, which rewards the user that cares to explore those possibilities.  So, long story short, Tekken Tag is as good as you want to make it.  The best fighting games are like that, merely a vehicle through which the skilled gamer builds their craft.And if anyone needs a hint, the most important thing to remember about the Tekken series is that the game is all about opportunity.  Try the practice mode to see what I mean.  Tekken is all about that split-second pause that occurs when your opponent is recovering from an offensive strike that he/she initiated.  THAT is the time to strike.  If you're approaching it fists up and flailing, you're going about it all wrong.  You've got to pick your spots, and seizing that split-second moment of weakness is the key to victory.Class dismissed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2001"}

Go drinking: get a beer gut. Kill a helpless merchant: people get worried when you come around. Steal an item: your soul gets a little darker, and horns begin to come out of your head.Fable is an intricate story in a vast world, and is a wildly entertaining game. Since many reviews here laud the game's many great qualities, I just want to run down a few of the \"buyer beware\" cons:1) For being a main villain in an otherwise rich in-game universe, Jack of Blades is woefully underdeveloped.2) The melee system is intuitive but it's a little hard to hit the intended target when facing multiple enemies sometimes.3) The archery view is difficult to move in and out of on the fly.4) Hot-keying items can be a pain.5) ... so can switching between the dozens of spells.Though I have to say, these all pale in comparison to learning the ancient symbolic dance of the sages - which is the YMCA. It's this sense of humor that makes Fable fun over and over, from a door that requires you to be a \"mattress addict\" before it lets you get past (to get a pimp hat, no less) or an in-game storybook being read to children that has medieval gangstas and their posses in it. That, and a huge number of sidequests, ensure that this game will keep you occupied for a while.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2008"}

Well, let's just say it combines the awesomism of both Castlevanias 1 & 3! And since the Super Nintendo is one heck of a gaming machine, you can guess how this turns out.The classic whipping platforming action remains unharmed in this installment. In fact, it is massively improved! Along with the signature items (Cross, tomahawk, dagger, etc), you can now whip in multiple directions! Heck, you can whip it in literally ANY direction possible! Up, down, diagonal, and you can even wiggle it!Naturally, one would think that it would make the overall experience a cakewalk then, right? WRONG! The geniuses at Konami still managed to keep the difficulty leaning over to the hard side. There are still all kinds of enemies, each with their own unique patterns. The level design is magnificent like always (You know...With the exception of the 2nd game), and keeps things rather interesting. There will even be an area or two utilizing the Super NES's Mode 7 (fake 3D) visuals for backgrounds, as well as Dracula's castle rotating as you try to avoid falling into spike pits!On top of all this, the graphics couldn't be any better, and the soundtrack is just plain fabulous.

Two great periods of video games for the Sega franchise.First, the arcade stand-ups - their machines called out to be filled with quarters offering level after level of difficult challenges to overcome. When the 1980's were drawing to a close and people were ready to move beyond the limits of 8-bit Nintendo games, Sega introduced their 4th generation home video game console, the Sega Genesis.

If your earliest gaming console was a Sony Playstation, these games will look pre-historic to you. Most of the games have a faux background and the gameplay is centered in the middle of the screen in a 4:3 default format. The aspect ratio can be changed to letterbox (16:9) and there is even an option to smooth the graphics - but with games like these, smoothing actually takes away from the nostalgia.Options: I love the options this compilation offers! Not only can you set your own button layouts and turn on/off the rapid fire option, but you can save your progress on every single game! Games like Sonic the Hedgehog were very unforgiving and had no save points when they were first released...but with 3 save slots at your disposal, you can take your time to complete the games at your own pace.Gameplay: With 49 games to choose from, there are several genres at your fingertips:Want a platformer? Try Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle.Fancy a beat `em up? Altered Beast is calling you.Itching for an epic RPG? Try Phantasy Star III.How about a puzzle game? Stack up the Columns.Maybe an action game? Suit up with ESWAT.Side Scroller fan? Ecco the Dolphin needs your help.Hack & Slash, eh? Grab some grog and try out Golden Axe.Perhaps you prefer a shooter? Space Harrier is all about the bullets!You'd like a good old fashioned Run `n' Gun? Look no further than Vectorman 2.Whatever type of gameplay you like, it can be found in this collection.Extras: There are interviews with several Sega employees made specifically for this collection. You can tell each person put their heart & soul into their game of choice...it was a different time. Nowadays, people like Hideo Kojima have 200 people at their disposal, whereas most of these games were made by very small teams. There is a brief history and graphic artwork for each game, a nice piece of nostalgia.Trophies: The trophies for this game are a mixed bag. Some trophies are laughably easy (such as Ecco the Dolphin - this trophy is earned by simply talking to another dolphin!), while others like Dr. Robitnik's M.B.M. trophy (beat the game) are tooth-grindingly difficult. I thought the trophy for \"Final Oasis\" was a good example - the goal to free the water spirit took some time, but didn't require completing the entire game. I loved the trophy requiring every game to be played at least once.As far as negatives, there is only one that comes to mind, the exclusion of the \"lock-on\" gameplay for Sonic 3, Sonic 2, and the Blue Sphere levels. This allowed gamers to play as Knuckles instead of Sonic, which could not be done at the time due to software/hardware limitations.

{"product_name":"B00009WAUK","description":"You can almost hear the collective drooling of RPG and Game Boy fans worldwide. As the inaugural Nintendo/Square reunion title,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancehas a lot to live up to--and it does, spectacularly!The long heralded Final Fantasy series has enjoyed a number of spin-offs and sequels. Using the familiar character types and classes of the Final Fantasy series, but with a wholly original storyline,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancecreates an immersive world of strategic combat and conquest.Snow JobWhile most fantasy games favor romantic landscapes,Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceslyly starts out in a plain-vanilla suburb. Players assume the role of young Marche Radiuju in the humble burg of St. Ivalice.A snowball fight introduces the characters and sets the groundwork for future battles. After a brief (but chilly) skirmish, Marche heads home to visit his younger brother.Marche MadnessSoon after, Marche's friends drop by to show him an ancient book of mysterious origins. After failing to translate the text properly, Marche's friends leave for the evening. After a wistful slumber, Marche awakens and realizes he isn't in Ivalice anymore... or is he?Alone in a foreign land, Marche quickly comes under the care of a helpful creature known as a Moogle. It doesn't take much to convince Marche to adopt a lucrative career as a mercenary.Gangs of IvaliceA quick stop at the town inn introduces Marche to his new gang. A motley crew at best, your associates include low-level monks, mages, archers, and soldiers. The only hope you have of finding your way home is to turn your ragtag group of misfits into a finely tuned fighting force.Begin your tour of duty by chatting up the local barkeep. He'll clue you in to interesting news bits, rumors, and job opportunities. Due to your severe lack of experience, early quests are little more than errands.As you gain experience and reputation, your job options grow as well as the rewards. You can also send one of your crew members on side missions for extra swag. You cannot use these members in your regular quests until they return from their mission.Rules of EngagementWhether your quest is to fetch rare herbs or escort the local nobleman, you can always expect bad company. The battlefield is set up from an isometric 3D viewpoint, allowing clear view of every character in play.At the start of a match, you must choose which members of your gang you wish to take into battle with you. You have a clear view of the enemies before choosing, so try to match your lineup to your opposition.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceintroduces an innovative law system to the series. During every battle, an impartial judge decrees specific rules, such as banning poison attacks or physical attacks. The judges' unpredictability requires players to keep a well-rounded group of characters at all times.Technically, you can break the combat laws, but it is generally not recommended. Even if you win the battle, any of your characters who breaks a law is whisked away to prison. They can only be released after paying a hefty fine.Fantasy FightingThe battlefield is set up like a 3D chessboard, with elevations and terrain types. In each turn, a character can move a specific number of spaces and perform a single action, such as attack or using an item.Most strategy games employ either real-time or turn-based action.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceemploys a speed-based system that is somewhere in-between.Characters still take turns to move and perform actions, but these are based on each character's individual speed ratings. Nimble characters like rogues and ninjas are usually the first characters to go and can usually move farther than other characters. The downside is that faster characters typically lack strong armor and health stats.Subtle details such as terrain type and attack proximity can have a direct affect on your ability to hit an enemy. Attacking an enemy from behind or the side will yield much higher hit percentages than head-on attacks.Job FairWhat you do off the battlefield is arguably more important than what you do on it. Thanks to a stable economy, your characters can usually change job classes once they gain enough experience.Need a little more magic in your life? Try turning one of your grunts into a mage. There are more than 30 different job classes available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.Even in far-off fantasy lands, commercialism is a way of life. You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll end up spending your hard-earned greenbacks on shiny new stuff. Weapons and armor serve not only to boost your stats, but also grant special abilities to specific character types and species.While one sword might grant tremendous attack points, a seemingly lesser sword may give its wielder access to a special attack that can tip the scales in your favor. Thanks to the law system, one should never get too attached to a single piece of equipment.Face ValueGorgeous character illustrations and 2D sprites harken back to Square's 16-bit glory days. Each of the shops, inns, towns, and fields is superbly detailed, with subtle background animations.Final Fantasy Tactics Advancemaintains the series' stellar rep for technically and visually brilliant summon attacks.Uniquely,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancefeatures three separate display settings, depending on whether you're playing on the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, or the Game Boy Player. Each setting offers different levels of brightness, contrast, and saturation to appease even the most fickle of gamers.The only thing that can rival the on-screen wonders is the audio candy. It is no surprise why Square Enix's soundtracks are the most sought-after in the video game community.Lasting PowerNeedless to say, there are hours upon hours of gameplay packed into this tiny little cartridge. Square Enix has done a tremendous job in creating an easily accessible yet incredibly deep gameplay experience. Plug into one of the finest strategy RPG experiences ever created withFinal Fantasy Tactics Advance.","reviewerName":"The Gifted One","summary":"Disappointing coming from a great company like Square/Enix","reviewText":"Let me start off by saying that I've been a fan of the final fantsy series since FF5.  Each one has been different and had it's own good points and bad points.  As for FF Tactics Advanced, the bad far outweigh the good.  Let me tell you the good points first.1. It's on GBA, meaning it's portable and that you can play it anywhere at anytime.2. Player's are able to change jobs as in the original FF Tactics.3.  The graphics are pretty decent for a GBA game.Now for the bad1.  The Story - the story for FFTA has to be the most thoughtless and simple ones for any FF game to date.  Your character is warped into an alternate dimension where the Final Fantasy video game becomes real.  Your objective now is to find a way back home (how creative).  You join a clan of other characters and fight with other random clans throughout the game.  You advance the plot by completing various missions.  You eventually have to fight your friends from the real world who don't want to go home and convince them to go back with you.  You can basically know the whole lame story of this game before you even get halfway through the game.  I won't spoil the ending for those of you who haven't played the game (even though there's not much to spoil).2. Laws - On FFTA the game has a set number of laws in each location and a judge watching the battle to make sure no one breaks them.  At times you can cleverly use these laws to bind your enemies from doing certain things.  However, later on in the game the game starts placing 3 laws in effect all at once.  This slows down the battles greatly and sometimes the 3 laws could be barring you from healing, using magic, or even using the fight command itself!  Sometimes they even barred me from doing dmg to animals in a battle where I was fighting 5 animals.  These laws end up being more annoying than helpful especially if you're like me and want to build characters to their max lvs and stats.3.  Lack of Sidequests - This game has a huge lack of sidequests or other alternate things to do in the game.  You can accept extra missions from the Pubs but half of them don't even allow you to fight, but rather dispatch a clan member to complete the mission for a certain amount of time.  The extra missions where you can actually fight are often unrewarding and a waste of time.  This game lacks a Dungeon or bonus area where enemies are stronger than the final boss like in the other FF titles (ie. Deep Dungeon of FFT, Via Infinito of FFX-2, Research Cen. FF8, etc.)4. Sound - If you've played any FF titles before then I'm sure you know what I mean when I say that the music on this game is weak.  The tunes on the other games were so good that you would go to some areas just to hear the music and would later find yourself humming the tunes.  However, on this game that isn't the case.5. Difficulty - Square usually tries to balance the FF games.  Not make them to hard but then again not to easy either.  This one falls in the category with the &quot;kiddie game stigma&quot; that plagues Nintendo today.  The game is far too easy for anyone who's played and beaten the other FF titles.  They made this one in order to ensure that all 6-14yr olds would be able to beat this game.Overall I wouldn't recommend this game to a normal RPG fan.  Get this one ONLY if you feel the need to have every Final Fantasy game in your collection or if you're not bothered by the huge number of flaws in this game (I would have listed more if I had more space).","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2004"}

Perhaps it is the fact that Gears of War was so fantastic, but by the time I actually got my hands on Lost Planet, I was really disappointed with the gameplay.The graphics are great, as is the premise, but the sound effects lack the oomph provided in other combat games such as Rainbow Six and Gears of War.  For example, the guns sound hollow, small, and fake.The gameplay is the major weakness, I think.  The over the shoulder camera is pretty standard, but their implementation of it is cumbersome.  The way it is set up you will continue to look in one direction no matter which way you run, which works well for firing behind yourself as you run screaming from alien bugs, but it makes the game feel more like a rail shooter.Overall, it felt very distant and sanitized.  If you want a good combat game, play Gears of War.  That has a much more gritty feel to it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2007"}

{"product_name":"B004S5PBM0","description":"","reviewerName":"Chip L \"chip1978\"","summary":"Rockband meets guitar lessons","reviewText":"A quick disclosure: I've been playing guitar for over a decade and would describe myself as a mediocre player. With that in mind, this review is for the novice looking to break into playing guitar.I wanted to love this game. I really did. I loved Rockband and Guitar Hero; so I was thrilled to see a real, honest game that uses an actual guitar. To that end, it works surprisingly well. The cable translates any guitar's analog signal and converts it to a usb digital out and it is surprisingly accurate. Somehow it seems to even \"know\" the difference between the same note played on different strings - which impresses me.The problem I have is that the game starts playing notes. For example, one of the first songs is Queens of the Stoneage Go With the Flow; and perhaps only one of five notes is played. While I can understand this technique to break people into guitar, the downside is there's no pay off. In other words, you can't play the notes you've learned without a track and immediately recognize the song being played. It makes more sense to me (and a lot of other people who have learned guitar) to learn some chords (like Tom Petty says) and go from there into playing scales and lead solos.Chords ARE in the game, they're just buried later into the game. The biggest problem I've seen with new guitar players is they get frustrated when they don't feel like they're playing the actual songs they're trying to play.The mini games are odd. For example, there's a baseball minigame that \"teaches\" bending strings. The actual minigame doesn't seem to really help teach much of anything; and it seems more video-gamey than anything.If you think this type of program would help you play guitar, then go for it. Different people will learn guitar different ways, and it is such a rewarding hobby that I'd encourage people to get into it whichever way they can. Just keep in mind there are a LOT of good websites and youtube videos that can also help you learn to play guitar.This game comes with stickers to put on your frets to indicate fret numbers. Don't use them. Nearly every guitar already has dots to indicate fret numbers, and you don't want to mar a good guitar with stickers (unless that's your thing).This game will work on electric and acoustic-electric guitars. But it works best with electric. Playing an acoustic electric while hearing your notes on the game is a little distorting.Finally, it so happens a friend of mine picked up a new guitar and will be learning from scratch. I will update my review to let you know if this game helps him.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2011"}
{"product_name":"B003O6CB6S","description":"","reviewerName":"Thomas Riccardi","summary":"A great and fun to play game either on or offline","reviewText":"In the past few years the modern military FPS has been growing in popularity. And the two biggest contenders have been the Battlefield series and the Call of Duty series. Battlefield 4 was released in October and fans have been ranting and raving about it. Now Activision has answered with the latest entry called Call of Duty Ghosts. But will this next entry be a game worthy of your time or should you wait for it to disappear?The single player campaign is very unique instead of taking place in the past or present day it takes place in the near future. A group known as the federation has unified all of South America and is moving towards world domination. To make matters worse a team has taken over the Orbital Defense Initiative (or ODIN) Space station and has laid waste to the United States. With all the destruction the US tries to hold out against a vast superior force.What I love about the game is how the once beautiful lands of California are now turned into a war torn battlefield littered with wrecked buildings and a scarred landscape. You won&#8217;t be alone on your mission as this is the first Call of Duty to have a canine companion along for the ride. Riley is a German Shepard that can scout out targets, sneak around and even take down targets at your choosing.Multiplayer is where Call of Duty shines and there are new features that have been implemented in Ghosts. The first is the squad&#8217;s mode where you can compete against AI opponents and gain experience that can be used in other multiplayer modes. The various game modes rank from standard free for all and team death match to newer ones. Search and Rescue is similar to search and destroy where you have one life but your team can revive you. There is also a mode called Cranked which is a TDM variant when you kill someone you need to kill someone else in 30 seconds. Failing to do so means you explode but if you manage to get a kill the timer resets.I was hoping for a zombie mode in this game and got something much better called Extinction. This mode pits four players against an alien race that has taken over earth. With every kill you earn money that can be used for ammo, weapons and equipment. This mode is very team oriented as you will face waves of enemies trying to defend an objective. This can be played either solo or with other people online and is a great addition to this game.The only problem that I have with this game is running it on the PC that I have at home. I have a laptop (which is an alienware) and a desktop (an older machine that runs almost anything flawlessly). The load times on the desktop are outrageous while the laptop handles it with ease (as this is supposed to be for cutting edge PC&#8217;s). The system requirements are even outstanding as you have to have a 64 bit OS, 6 GB of ram and at least a 450 GT graphics card. These are some of the highest requirements I have seen for a PC game to date and the game will run on my desktop (but very slowly and I can run any game out there with zero issues).With a compelling single player campaign, tons of multiplayer modes and even the ability to customize your online avatar this is a no brainer. Run out and get this game today and experience the latest in the Call of Duty saga.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2013"}

{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"michael jordan \"sucks\"","summary":"Awesome, with a few minor issues!","reviewText":"Before I get a bunch of hate from people, please read my reviews on zombiu and super mario bros u. I preordered the wiiu from walmart, so needless to say, I got it the day it came out. Now, when I first put zombiu in, I immediately noticed that I had to update the system which took well over two hours of my game time. Then after that I thought I was ready to start and the system began to do another update for the game I was trying to play. This took about 10-15 minutes. Finally, I get a chance to play the game and I noticed that when the game was loading which is most of the time in zombiu, the wiiu sounded like it was tearing up the game because it was so loud. To me this is simply unacceptable considering that the wiiu is not much more advanced than the xbox 360 or even the ps3 for that matter, but yet it runs much worse than the two slim versions of the those consoles. How do I know, because I bought a brand new 360 slim for christmas this year and I bought the ps3 slim for christmas last year, right here on amazon.com. Unfortunately those aren't my only complaints so far. I also hate the way the system freezes up all the time and sometimes ruins game saves because of it. I also noticed that frequently the system will not turn off unless you unplug the power cord in the back. Really nintendo, you couldn't fix that problem before you sold your junk to the public. It's just a shame that I still own every nintendo console ever made and none have broke down on me yet and I really don't think this thing will make it two years at the rate it's going. With all that said, those issues are on the bottom of my list of concerns for nintendo and the wiiu. If anyone has a 3ds then you will probably agree with the next point I'm going to make. The eshop sucks just like the 3ds eshop sucks. You're probably thinking, but wait it just came out and I should give them more time to work on it. No, they had all this time while they were jacking around with the wii and they should've had this in mind a long time ago. Aside from the interface sucking so bad, it doesn't even compare to the suckiness of the games that are on the eshop. Trine 2, how old is that game? Then the rest of them should've been on the 3ds instead of the wiiu. In over two years, I found like 3 good eshop games that were worth the money on the 3ds, but the rest aren't even as good as free games on my phone. You want to play a demo of a game, well too bad because nintendo only has a handful up for download. I said all this because I don't think it's going to be any different for wiiu. Nintendo always claims that they're getting their stuff together, but I just simply don't believe them anymore. As for third party titles, I don't think there will be many after this year when the new ps4 and xbox come out. I made a comment in my zombiu review that all the reviewers and big game companies want nintendo to fail and I still think that's true, but now I'm starting to see why they want them to fail. If you really think about it, nintendo are a bunch of con men who get people to buy all their products based on gimmicks and a handful of games that they make. I really think that nintendo doesn't want very many third party titles because that's just more competition against their games. I could be wrong about this, but that's just how it seems to me. My last complaint is with the gamepad. The only innovative game that released for wiiu is zombiu and I just don't think that many companies are going to be able to innovate with it. I mean nintendo didn't even use it in an innovative way for the new mario game except for that stupid multiplayer thing that nobody wants to play. Not only that, but playing mario with the gamepad is horrible if you're looking at the tv and not the gamepad. After about 10 minutes I went back to the wiimote. Oh, and don't let me forget to mention that the gamepad rumble device is the worst I've ever seen before. Even the n64 had a better one. Whenever the gamepad rumbles, you can hear the motor running in it and it's so annoying and just seems so generic. With all that being said, if nintendo fixes these issues then I think they will be on top again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2013"}

Players use human armies and diplomacy, progress through development ages, enhance military and economic performance with improvements, and manage economics through resource gathering and trade.

Ostrowski \"bra1n1ac\"","summary":"Myths are coming to call...","reviewText":"And it never looked so good, or frankly, so accurate.  I've read a lot of those old myths.  Oddessy, the Illiad, the journeys of Odin, the legends of Osiris, Jason and the Argonauts and so forth, and as many big media productions (movies, video games, TV shows and so forth,) as have tried to get it right, this is the first one that actually does.  Now, I love this sort of thing, just BECAUSE the basic concepts are older than my whole family, but if you are easily bored by concepts or if you simply hate the idea of mythical Gods and monsters (why would you,) this game is probably not for you, because that's where most of its charm lies.  After all, its voices, gaming engine and level editor are far less substantial than, say, Warcraft 3, but if you want the Gods and Monsters, this is the place to go.  And as much as I loved the original legends, they were never brought to life for me like this.That having been said, let's get to the hard data...The graphics are excellent, but unfortunately, you only get to realize this in the cutscenes, because in mid-game, you zoom out on the characters, and unlike in Warcraft 3, you can't zoom in or look at things from the side.  Also, the voices in this game are slightly inferior to the Warcraft 3 ones, and the facial expressions exist almost not at all.The level editor of this game, though it exists, prohibits the gamer from doing a great many things that Warcraft 3's World Editor allows, such as setting up specific victory conditions and so forth.But this game has a few things that favor it over Warcraft.  The first is the more realistic character proportions, and the second is the fact that it's myth, darn it!  That's just awesome!Another thing this game has to speak for it is the fact that one can gather resources from a variety of sources instead of just one type of tree, one type of plant, etc...  This is a trait shared in Age of Empires.The storyline links together a number of famous myths using a much larger concept and a much larger threat than any of those myths involved originally.And lastly, although it takes the music of the game a while to loop, that music is repeated almost every level, so it might get annoying.Still, I've played it three times, just for the fun of it.  Clearly, they've gotta be doing something right.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"A Hot Whizzer Summer...","summary":"GTA 4 Really?","reviewText":"Before I start ranting, I just want to say that GTA4, as a game of its own, is actually quite good, but as a GTA game, it has shortcomings. So Let's kick this review off right.Graphics: GTA4 has rather well defined graphics. It is definitely much better from it's predecessors. Among many of the improvements graphically; people in the car actually move as they speak, blood stains actually appear on your car if you hit people, hitting newspaper stands actually cause newspapers to go flying everywhere, and some of the text on those flying newspapers is actually legible. So, suffice it to say, GTA is graphically a good game. Is it as good as all the other games out there, not really, but it is an open ended gameplay where you can go anywhere, and as far as that goes, it is pretty great.Glitches: The game has quite a few glitches, as most of them do, which cause random events from a car to start flying in circles to your legs falling through the floor. It is expected in most games of this style I suppose, but is worth mentioning that these are no fewer than any previous GTA Game.Setting: Taking place in a new liberty city similar to New York, the game offers little in the ways of variety. You go from tight closed off streets with big buildings to tight closed off streets with really big buildings. It is a bit claustrophobic, giving you very little room to just drive and speed up to top speed. San Andreas was expansive, giving you three cities completely different in appearance, numerous small towns, mountains, forests, and deserts. 4 gives you one city, nothing else.Car Gameplay: The cars in this game seem much more difficult to control, was this done for realism sake, I am not sure. However, sometimes, some cars have incredibly poor traction and put you into terrible accidents when you think you have plenty of time to stop. It is hard to tell which cars are better, as appearance doesn't always suggest driving style. A couple of added things kind of make the gameplay funner. Most park cars are locked now, so you actually break the window, unlock the car, then actually hotwire it, You can speed up hotwiring, but it usually doesn't take more than a couple seconds anyway. Also, you can receive damage, fly out the window shield, die in fatal accidents, drive drunk (which always gets a cop on your tail) and even have a car die and won't start up again. However, many of these events seem random, and you can ram a building at 50 miles an hour and recieve no damage, or hit a fence and 25 miles an hour, fly our your window shield, and have you car land on you. So that kind of sucks.Person Gameplay: On a surplus, you can now use cover and hide behind stuff, also peaking out from behind cover to shoot an opponent. You also have a new melee system, which includes kick, punch, and block combos. It isn't much better than the original system, but it does give you a bit more control over what you are doing to your opponent. However, once you get a couple guns, this becomes almost irrelevant anyway. Everything else is just about the same from previous games.Story: The story is OK. I can't say I feel too passionate about the protagonist, who just doesn't appeal to me as much as the GTA3 + characters, who were frequently hilarious and likable. Niko revenge story does not seem as passionate as GTA3, and that guy was a mute. He lacks the ambition of VC character, and SA did a better job of displaying that protagonists goals and ideals(protecting his home and family). Besides that, it seems less humorous and more serious of a story. It still has all the jokes from the previous GTAs, I can't really put my finger on it, but everything in this one just seems more serious. One reviewer believes that this is GTA with a conscious, which I kind of agree with, maybe groups put pressure on Rockstar to make them show the consequences of your actions, since it seems like you're constantly being reminded that killing, drunk driving, and prostitution are bad.The Extras: This is where I feel the game fell. Had this game been the direct sequel from GTA III, I probably would have been a lot easier on it, but VC and SA existed, and this game almost seems to have forgotten that fact. This game almost seems like a stripped version of it's predecessors. No gang wars, no gambling, no owning businesses, no car collections. Flying has almost been cut out of this game, although I can't imagine why, it was such a successful feature. Fighting on a flying plane, then para shooting out was the coolest thing ever, not to mention stealing a harrier jet from a battleship. The girlfriend thing from SA was added to, making normal friends too. This is worse, as you now have to maintain relationships with not only your gfs, but any friend you make as well. I also believe the \"sex scenes\" you get at the end of the date are toned down a bit. I dislike where Rockstar is going with this game, it almost as if they want to take the open part out of open game. They keep you caught up with their characters with frequent cellphone calls, rather than letting you initiate your own sidequests by setting in the right vehicle or shiny circle.Sum it Up: So in general, this game is a worthy sequel to GTA III... as long as you pretend SA and VC did not exist. It cuts out way too much content added in the last two (what do you call them, expansion packs?). Why they felt the need to cut so much? Or did they feel they had to to make room for more graphics? If so, I would pick side missions and content over graphics any day.One more beef that bugged me endlessly, they cut out hidden packages and replaced it with flying rats that you can shoot. That was a good idea, but the thing is, you don't get anything unless you shoot all 200, which gets you an achievement (big whoop) and a pop up for just about the only flying thing in the game (helicopter). I always depended on those items that pop up have 10, 30, 50 packages. Just knowing that if I got arrested or used up my ammo, that I always had a store at my place was great. This just bites, what horrible thing happened to Rockstar, whom created a nearly perfect game with San Andreas, feel they needed to take a chainsaw to the game and cut out all of its charm. Oh well, I hope that answers your questions and helps your decision in getting GTA 4.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"An incredibly stunning achievement","reviewText":"It's here, it's here, it's finally here.  Grand Theft Auto IV has finally arrived after what seems like eons of anticipation, and Rockstar's flagship franchise doesn't disappoint to say it lightly.  Putting you in the shoes of European illegal immigrant Niko Bellic, you are back in Liberty City, although this is a much different Liberty City than the one you remember.  This Liberty City is so incredibly detailed and constructed that you will often find yourself in complete awe.  Not since GTA III has an open world environment been so innovative in its scope, and never before has there ever been this kind of interaction.  At its core, the tried and true GTA gameplay remains, but there is so much more to do: ranging from dating (yes, dating!), surfing the in-game internet, seeing a comedy show, watching TV, and listening to the radio among other things.  Besides all that, there is a story here, and it is indeed one of the most engrossing and compelling stories you will ever find in a video game.  Niko is no ordinary crook like we've seen before, and ends up being one of the most fully realized video game protagonists in quite some time.  The rest of the residents of Liberty City are wonderfully designed as well, all helping Liberty City feel like a living, breathing place.  Gunplay elements have been much improved upon as well, as have the driving mechanics and overall controls.  Combined with a 16 player multiplayer mode, Grand Theft Auto IV is a glorious, instant classic that more than deserves your attention.  If there are any downsides to GTA IV, and this is just me being nitpicky for the sake of being nitpicky, is that there are a few graphical hiccups to be found now and then, but definitely nothing major or all that noticable.  Other than that, GTA IV is nearly perfect in every regard.  All in all, Grand Theft Auto IV is an incredibly stunning achievement of modern gaming that must be played to be believed.  Ranking as possibly one of the finest and most immersive video games to ever see the light of day, Grand Theft Auto IV is a masterpiece that should be checked out in the very least, even if you aren't a fan of the series.  Yes, it is that good, now go play it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2008"}

I didn't even take a break until now to write this review. That's how addicting it is. Insomniac Games deserves heaps of praise for what they've accomplished here. I wouldn't go as far as saying it's on the level of Pixar, but it's definitely the best looking animated game I've ever seen. The whole production is top notch and it's obvious Insomniac spared no expense and went all out. So much stuff is happening on screen at the same time: enemies, explosions, spaceships flying, other characters helping you fight, all beautifully animated and without any slowdown whatsoever. This game shows off the power of the PS3 and we're still early in it's life cycle.The diversity of gameplay is what keeps you interested over the long run. Even with graphics this pretty you still need a game to play. There are tons of weapons, gadgets, and devices to use and upgrade. It can be a little overwhelming at first for people not familiar with Ratchet and Clank games. Instead of just blasting though everything with one or two easy to use and powerful weapons, it's better to experiment with all of them. For example, I kind of ignored the Nano-Swarmers weapon when I first got it. But after using it for awhile it proved to be powerful and indispensable, especially toward the latter stages of the game when the enemies get tougher. As you use the weapons, they upgrade, so something fairly weak at first may become powerful later.The menu system is great and it's really easy to switch between weapons. It takes seconds to switch on the fly between multiple weapons. Elder Scrolls: Oblivion could have learned something from this game.Every level has it's own look and feel and there's always something different to do. There's flying with the robo-wings, shooting through tubes on the gyro-cycle, jumping around on grind rails, fighting in the arena, and more. Sometimes you play as Clank and his parts were creative and a nice change of pace.There are complaints that the game is little too easy. For veterans of the series, and newcomers who manage their weapons right, then yes it might be a little too easy. But the difficulty picks up toward the second half of the game and the \"easy\" factor didn't bother me because the game is so much fun to play. Also there's no way this game is too short. Considering everything this game has too offer, there's tons of game here. Also, the voice acting is good, there are some laugh out loud moments especially in the prison level.Ratchet and Clank: TOD is not to be missed. Thank god for Insomniac, along with Naughty Dog with their game Uncharted: Drakes Fortune. These two companies are carrying the PS3 on their backs with two outstanding games, and are paving the way for a bright future for the PS3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2008"}

This game in HD is just gorgeous. Hours into the story and I still find myself mesmerized at how perfect this game looks. The gameplay is off the hook. The sound, incredible. (7.1 surround? are you kidding me? This game has \"triple A title\" written all over it). The score and background music is just amazing. And the Ultimate Edition? Let's put it this way: Pandora's box is now the crown jewel of my vast videogame collection. 5 stars all the way. The first (and way overdue) entry of my favorite videogame franchise into the latest gaming generation surpassed all my expectations. Sony Santa Monica, you rock!Funny anecdote related to the limited edition: A very good friend of mine arrived from overseas Wednesday night.  He will be staying at my place for the duration of his Washington, DC vacation. As soon as we entered my gaming area, he glanced at the shelf that contains all my games and suddenly he turns around, and looks at me in a very serious demeanor and says: \"Dude, that can't.......Is that F..(insert expletive here  Pandora's box? Wait....mate, tell me that is NOT the limited edition of the last God of War\". By the look of his face you would think I had Michael Jackson's white glove on display in my shelf.

The game has a pretty good storyline too.  What makes DMC3 the best is that it's so damn perfect, you see..Devil May Cry was an awesome, fun filled action game with some challenge to itDevil May Cry 2 was just a complete failure and the Difficulty was a joke and could be beatin in 3 hours..Devil May Cry 3 makes up for what Devil May Cry 2 was and also suprasses DMC1!!!!  The game is just perfect..Devil May Cry 3 is the best in the series and I give my hands off to Capcom, you guys really know how to make video games.  Devil May Cry 3 shines on the controlls as there so tight and perfect to get use too.  The Visuals in this game truly shines and are jaw dropping good.  The lighting effects, enemies, everything, the games visuals are running 60 fr persecond and there is no choppyness to it!!!The games Combos and Skill use are so perfect that there is nothing to complain about, there easy to get use to and learn, and the 4 choices of styles are all awesome(I did the whole game on Gunslinger)and just doing the twosome time shows how powerful and fast Dante is.  The combos and Skills are amazingly good looking and unlike DMC2, there usefull..Buying Items is a pain as you have to replay alot of missions to get that blue orb or that Gun Upgrades but there well worth it even if it's inexpensive.  Other then the games menue options, it's good..Now...........The part everyone has bin overracting to....The games Difficulty.  Yes it is true the U.S normal version is the JP's Hard mode but Capcom was doing that to please the fans since they loathed DMC2's difficulty and if the games too hard for you DON'T PLAY IT!  I will say though that the game will probably beat the living crap out of you and finish you off even after you've got a big ass kicking...but the game will get more \"Easier\" as you keep trying and doging those enemies in that certain level, As IGN said \"the game will kick your...\"  And as for that Review on GAMESPOT.com about it getting a low score cause it was too hard for him......That's just sad....Also I want to mention that this game has AMAZING CUTSCENES, some of these cutscenes put Konamies games to shame, the game does have some cheesy dioloug but the game has over all kick .... Cutscenes...This game also has one of the best opening intro to a level I've ever seen(the first level with dante in his office)Now...Lets get down to it..The Good-Superb Visuals that really show what the PS2 is capable of-loads of gameplay and variety-should take atleast 15 to 18 hours on your first try in Normal mode-Best Action Game ever and one of the best ps2 games of this year-Lots of Weapon upgrades to buy and moves to manuever-Awesome Controlls make this another + game...-AMAZING CUTSCENES..Bad-The difficulty may turn some gamers off...I thought it was just as hard as JAK2..honestlySo overall if you loved DMC1, chances are you are gonna love DMC3 even more then DMC1, the game shines on everything, Visuals, controls, cutscenes, gameplay THE GAME IS JUST PERFECT!!  Capcom knows how to make games and this is one of em'...And for people who hate challenging games...Look elswere and play Mario Gulf, it's much easier trust me...When it all comes down to this....

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission. Train and equip your team to survive insurmountable odds.Explore the Galaxy- Scan planets to uncover unique secret missions in theMass Effectuniverse.Integration with OriginalMass Effect- Players of the firstMass Effectcan import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

As you progress, so do Shepard&rsquo;s abilities.Improved Dialogue Mechanic- Improved NPC conversation system where Commander Shepard can take matters into your own hands &ndash; interrupting or using force to get the answer required.","reviewerName":"Big Al \"Alan Rivire\"","summary":"Massive Fun 2","reviewText":"INTRODUCTIONMass Effect, by Electronic Arts (EA), sets the benchmark for third person role playing actions games. It is as close to a DVD movie as a video game can get, because, unlike most first person games, players can see and hear the player character as well as the non-player characters (NPCs).  This movie-like quality greatly enhances the compelling story, which is the hallmark of the Mass Effect Trilogy.THE PLOT**Spoiler Alert**This second episode of the Mass Effect Trilogy begins with the death (yes, DEATH) of Commander Shepard, in a fiery ambush of the Normandy, two years after he/she defeated the traitorous Saren Arterius in the battle of the Citadel.  But, thank the goddess, he/she is later resurrected in Project Lazarus by the Illusive Man, leader of Cerberus, a shadowy and ruthless \"human supremacist\" organization, for the sole purpose of sending the legendary commander to investigate a new cataclysmic event in the Galaxy - entire human colonies have been vanishing without a trace, leaving behind empty buildings. To confront the threat, Shepard travels across the Galaxy to recruit up to a dozen of the most dangerous characters to his/her elite team, at locations including Illium, an asari colony, and Omega, a lawless mining station built on a hollowed out asteroid in the Terminus Systems, for a mission from which every member of the team, including Commander Shepard, may never return.**End of  Possible Spoilers**THE CHARACTERSPlayers who had completed Mass Effect 1 (ME1) can import a Save Game from the list of Character Saves  into Mass Effect 2 (ME2).  During the file transfer, they have the option of changing the class of Commander Shepard, for example, from adept to vanguard, as well as his/her physical characteristics. This is possible in the storyline on account of Project Lazarus--a very clever way of putting Shepard on reset. If  Shepard was imported at a high level in ME1, players will be awarded with bonus squad points and research metals at the start.  (See my comment dated 2/3/10.) All the NPCs who were alive at the end of the ME1 are transferred. Furthermore, the story in ME2 unfolds in accordance with the decisions made by the players in ME1, for example, whether Shepard set the Rachni queen free in Noveria, whether he/she resolved the conflict with Wrex on Virmire peacefully, or whether he/she called in the human fleet to save the Council in the battle of the Citadel. The main storyline, however, remains unchanged.  For those who never play ME1, ME2 can be played stand-alone with new characters and certain pre-set assumptions on events in ME1. (See Update below) New characters in ME2 include Thane, a drell master assassin, Legion, a free-thinking geth, who is stalking Commander Shepard, and Subject Zero, a female human biotic gang and cult member, with head-to-toe tattoos. Other than the geth and the Reapers, new enemies emerge in ME2. They include the Collectors, a winged insect-like species who are suspected to be working for the Reapers, and Scions, which are grotesque experiments of the Reaper, as well as monstrous beings created by the Reapers out of other species they abducted.THE GAME/COMBAT SYSTEMThe Artificial Intelligence (AI) and combat system have been vastly improved in ME2.  Gone are those annoying texture pop-ups in ME1.  So are those long elevator rides--they are replaced with loading screens.  Battle scenes are more realistic: enemies are thrown against walls, limbs are blown off, and wounded fighters continue to fight by crawling on the ground.  Players can hit the enemies where they place the reticles, like in a shooter.  (This is not so in ME1, where hits are calculated based on the number of skill points assigned by the players to the characters.)  Players can now issue attack orders to Shepard's squad mates by using the directional-pad of the controller (of the Xbox 360), and manually prompt Commander Shepard to duck behind covers.  The limitless ammo is no more in ME2.  It is replaced with removable \"thermal clips\".  When a clip is spent, it must be ejected and replaced with a new one. Players are therefore advised to take note of the amount of thermo clips available during battles.  Instead of only four weapon types as in ME1, there are nineteen in ME2. One of my gripes with ME1 was the lack of heavy hand-held weapons.  In ME2, they are available to the soldier class player character (as well as Commander Shepard of all classes).  These heavy weapons knock down multiple enemies in one gigantic blast.  A sentinel class player character now dons an ablation tactical armor, which makes him/her very tough to kill.  An engineer class player character can launch a drone to aid him/her in battle.  An adept class player character can spawn micro-singularities around the enemies, annihilating them en masse. Tactical cloak, which renders a combatant invisible briefly, is available to an infiltrator class player character.  A vanguard class player character can dash around the battlefield with a new biotic power--the \"biotic charge\", which propels him/her forward at tremendous speed and force, to attack or evade the enemies.  There is no longer any class restriction in armor.  Medi-gel, used in the ME1 to regenerate health, is replaced with auto-regeneration, although the players still need it to cast the Unity reviving power.  (Note: auto-regeneration is also available in ME1, but only as an upgrade to the armors.)THE DIALOGUEThe dialogue wheel in ME1 is the most innovative dialogue system in all the games I have ever played.  When used probably, it delivers a continuous and seamless dialogue, and hence the movie-like quality of the game.  In ME2, the dialogue wheel is further improved.  A new \"interrupt\" system is introduced. When prompted by the players with the left or right trigger of the controller (of the Xbox 360), Commander Shepard can interrupt the dialogue with \"heroic\" or \"hostile\" action to get the answer he/she wants.  Furthermore, instead of the previous static camera position in ME1, the camera moves around during conversations in ME2, adding further cinematic effect to the game.THE CHOICESLike in ME1, choices made by the players influence the outcome of the game in ME2.  For example, in ME1, on the planet Virmire, Commander Shepard (and hence the players), was called upon to decide which of the two squad mates he/she would rescue; the one left behind was consumed in a subsequent nuclear blast.  In the same manner, decisions of the players in ME2 throughout the game may eventually lead to the annihilation of the entire ground team in the final mission, including Commander Shepard, or the survival of every team member, or something in between. Players with a \"dead\" Shepard will not be able to import him/her into ME3. The same thing is true with a \"dead\" teammate.  They can play ME3 with a generic Shepard, but not \"their\" Shepard.  Furthermore, with Shepard killed, players can't return to the game world after the final mission and continue to play, for example, to complete a side quest, or to explore a new locale.  They will have to start a new game or reload with a previous save-file and replay part of the game for a different outcome.  This gives incentive to players to make sound decisions throughout the game, before heading into the final mission.  (See my comment dated 4/23/10.)THE CERBERUS NETWORKThe Cerberus Network is a cleverly designed in-game portal through which players can access \"Downloadable Contents (DLCs)\" from EA.  Players activate this network with a one-time access code, which is included in every new game purchase.  Game renters and used game buyers will have to pay for the code.  This arrangement is apparently a ploy by EA to combat the rental and used game market, which has been undermining retail sales of new games.  Players who access the network will receive the first DLC pack on January 26, 2010, the date on which the game is released in North America.  This first DLC introduces Zaeed, a rough and tumble mercenary who will join Shepard's elite team.  A future DLC will introduce the Hammerhead, a hover tank to replace the much-maligned Mako in ME1.  (Note: There is no driveable vehicle in the core game.) In addition, new missions and in-game items will be released to gamers by EA through this network.CONCLUSIONME2 comes with 2 discs.  Players have to swap discs (twice per game) at some points. There are 90 voice actors playing 546 characters with over 30,000 lines of dialogue. New voice actors in ME2 include D.C. Douglas, Martin Sheen and Adam Baldwin.  In conclusion, ME2 is a role-playing game with the look and feel of a shooter.  It is a must-have game of the year.Update: A ME2 DLC called Genesis allows a new player to make major decisions in ME1 without having to play it.  Check it out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"Nathan T.","summary":"Massively Overrated Game With Countless Flaws. Flaw List and Game Tips!","reviewText":"I have to say this game is littered with countless amounts of flaws and cheap shots. Please read the bottom most conclusion for a summary of my complete thought on the game before assuming that I'm only here to bash the game. There's also game tips near the bottom to for all new beginners. So far I've played all of the main mission and have taken on 95% of the side mission.Flaws are not listed in any specific order:1. Copy and paste planets, terrains, and buildings. It is one of the most common, lowest, most pathetic thing in this whole game. You'll see it a lot plaguing most of your side missions. It gives the illusion of you being in another area but it is so common and to a high extent that it becomes way too obvious. Once you raid a few planets and do a few side missions, you've pretty much seen it all.2. Elevator rides. I know it's not a biggie but does the elevator rides have to be so darn long and slow? This is a very minor issue though unless you happen to need to go from one spot to another and it requires a use of an elevator with no teleportation device to alleviate the problem.3. Long scroll down when in sell or buy mode in shops. When you try to scroll down your list of things to buy or sell, it is extremely slow and you sort of have to wait around depending on the length of the list.4. Side quests are crappy, just to prolong game. They are also only fun the first time around, but many players would probably be reluctant in doing them for another playthrough. 95% or so of the game's positive side relies on its main missions.5. What's with the scanning of planets for minerals and certain objects and whatnot? That's just pathetic. Obviously desperate in increasing the play time for the game.6. Not much variety of enemies. Thresher maw is the only huge creature you encounter on a planet. I would like to know that there's more variety to encounter...at least some that will require more fun use of the Mako in order to defeat. Also variety in terms of creative character and creature design.7. Planetary environments are nicely made, but are very basic and have no creatures or other details that makes the planet completely different or unique from another. Once you've been to one planet, you've been to pretty much all of them.8. Minerals and rare metals you mine in each planet are always conveniently at the top and they all look like poop.9. Organization of items in your inventory and in the store is very bad. They are not organized in grade or names. Sometimes they are slightly, but not really. This is bad when you're trying to determine and compare on what to sell etc.10. The use of the D pad is very inefficient and clunky.11. Dialogue renegade choices usually makes the player seem like a jerk than a cool bad a**.12. Dialogue is also weak. When the game gives you choices to pick a variety of dialogues, you would think that one dialogue option will give you a completely different speech and reaction, however, this is not so many times. Another pathetic illusion that the game created in order to make you feel like you have any sort of option.13. Storyline is weak and completely overrated. Nothing special, nothing revolutionary to the gaming industry.14. Game usually gets easy halfway through assuming you have some sort of common sense when it comes to gaming.15. The landing and departing scenes of your Normandy and Mako is another example of copy and pasting in this game. At least change it and have a bigger variety of scenes? Cheap shots!16. The Mako, your infantry fighting and exploring vehicle that you use when on planet surfaces, is used to the bare minimum. The game needs to have better use of the Mako, maybe in some sort of minigame or Mako only mission. Most of the time you just use it for transportation, that's it. Maybe they can increase the variety of huge monsters that you have to use the Mako in order to destroy.17. Character design including monster creation is very uncreative. There's nothing cool or magical or awesome about the monsters or aliens....-----I just feel this game lacks major in creativity.If you're going to portray a game that deals with outworldly, futuristic, spacey kind of environments, you need to make sure that the creators think completely out of the box when designing it.This game thinks inside the box way too much.Think about the creation of the characters that you see?1. Hanars look like man-of-war jellyfish2. In our current reality, having two to four legs is common. Things that come in two is common. This game is plagued with things like that. I'm tired of seeing worms, two to four legged creatures, animals or creatures that resemble what we already have on Earth.The alien species and monsters are very uncreative not to mention there's only a handful. Also, even though there's a bunch of different species you have to deal with, they all act pretty much the same. It's like they look different, but under the skin they're just like a normal human. Of course there's an exception here or there.GAME TIPS:1. Most items in shops can be found randomly during missions, exceptions being upgrades to medigel and grenades and certain items. Best weapons are spectre weapons so save up your money until you have 1 million which shouldn't take too long. This will unlock Rich achievement and will unlock the weapons as well. You can get Spectre grade weapons in the C Sec officer on citadel and Normany seller. So don't buy items in the store unless you really need it or you have tons of cash later on after getting that achievement.2. Best license to get is Serrice, Kessa Fabrication, and Geth Armory. Serrice for bioamps and such, Kessa for Colossus armor, Geth for Geth armor.3. Best armor for all class is Colossus armor. Best armor for Geth aka Wrex is Battlemaster or something from the Geth Armory.4. The highest grade for any item you'll buy or find is X. You'll start seeing X grade items after you reach level 50.5. Side missions are good for leveling up and preparing yourself for the main missions. You also find more items in side missions (either for selling or using).6. Investing on intimidate or charm is good for the storyline and opens up extra dialogue, but from my personal experience, I would put them in a more useful spot instead. I just don't find them very great....however you should consider it for a first time playthrough to increase your experience with the game.7. One of the best ammo upgrades is Shredder or Tungsten rounds. Also combining ones that reduce cooltime for weapons and another one that increase weapon damage but also increase cooltime is a good idea, however, you won't find them until later levels.8. Best armor upgrades IMO is those that deal with recovery of shield and addition to hardening. I like them better than those that increase health because later on most likely a player will have much more shields than health. Once an enemy gets over your shield, that's not good.9. Usually when you first play a new game, you would like to pump more points into barrier and damage reducing talents. It's great if you want them to deal more damage, but it's useless if they don't survive long enough to do it, so basically the longer they live the more damage they do.10. Check out Mass Effect on Wiki for maps and guides.11. Never kill stuff in your Mako, you only get 1/3rd the experience, you can use it to weaken a tough opponent, but always do the finishing move with your team outside of the Mako.12. Saving before certain shop keepers and checking them out and reloading your game if you don't find anything good is a nice idea if you want to find a specific item that you know they should be carrying. Doesn't always pay off, but sometimes it does, especially with the one on the Normandy.IN CONCLUSION:Even though this game has a lot of flaws and just plain out low cheap shot styles of level design, it is still fun. On Peak 15 on Noveria, it feels very much like Dead Space; suspenseful with things popping out of nowhere. However, like I said, most of the action that you'll want will probably be found doing the main mission.Is this game worth it? For the price it is now, definitely. It is actually a pretty decent game. You can finish the game very quickly by doing mostly the main missions. If you choose to do the side missions as well, it will usually take you around 20-25 hours give or take.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2010"}

After recieving it for christmas '05, I knew why I was right. Unlike other handhelds (PSP, GBASP,GBA...) the DS did something special. First off, it has wireless gameplay and games that use WIFI (connects to other players around the world) including the built in game Picto Chat ( wireless chatroom). The wireless download play has another advantage in that at stores like Game Crazy, you can download FREE demos of DS titles! It also has TWO screens! Way cool, huh? And get this, one is a touch screen! Talk about milestone from the original Game Boy. And my personal favorite, an emmbeded microphone! This all makes AWESOME games like Mario Kart DS (wifi), Nintendogs (microphone), and Brain Age (touch screen) VERY interactive. Besides all that, it still plays GBA games and has back-lit screens.The only problems I have are that sometimes I wish the screen could be brighter and it sometimes feels bulky.I also recently sent it to Nintendo for it to be repaired (wasn't and couldn't be calibrated correctly) but it was easy and free. This is an update. I got a BRAND NEW DS for free from Nintendo, and there were no hassles. But now I would recommend the DS Lite, for the brighter screen and slim design are very useful. My brother and sister got a DS for Christmas this year and single card multiplayer is very addictive.So anyway, overall I recommend this to gamers and non-gamers.

I got it around Christmas with Super Mario 64 DS and was astonished at the graphics but mostly the gameplay!  The memory and graphics exceed that of the Nintendo 64 while the PSP is only about the GameBoy Advance!  The games are very cheap($30), the system itself is cheap($150) while PSP reaches prices exceeding 200 dollars.  The PSP has to use memory cards while the DS saves all the game information onto the game itself.  The DS uses two screens, a regular screen and a touch screen.  There are some games that use only the Touch screen(for controls).  You can only play about 8-10 hours before your battery is in red(10% power) and then you have to charge with the AC adapter for four hours(for max power) but you can play while it's charging!  I have done some calculations about the DS.  If you play 2 hours everyday on the DS, it will take 5.5 years for the battery to start losing its juice(Meaning the 70%power is max, and then eventually it goes down to nothing) but you can just buy a new one and put it in(not sure of price).  The DS features wireless gameplay that can stretch up to 60 feet.  But they are making wi-fi capabilities so that you can hook up to wi-fi station and play people across the world!  If someone doesn't have the game that you have and it has multi-player.  No problem, do DS download play where you send them the versus and play the entire multi-player!

You can unlock souvenirs and extra bonuses by playing a lot.  For example, poke at a broken pipe to fix it, poke letters on the screen to spell a word, slide the stylus on a hand to make someone wave good-bye to another, rub a magic lamp to make something come out, poke at Wario's gloves to punch a certain number of times.Polarium: A puzzle game where you try to flip tiles(Black to white and white to black) so that horizontal rows of tiles are the same color( Rows can be different colors) using only one line.  Or you can take on Challenge mode!Yoshi Touch and Go:  Direct Baby Mario down to the ground dodging enemies and collecting coins( The more coins the better the yoshi.).  Once above the ground, he falls and a yoshi will catch him( depending on how many points will decide your color, the better the color, the more eggs he can hold and the faster he'll be.).  You need to guide Baby Mario to safety(It's never-ending) with the help of Yoshi.

I recently picked up a PS3, and one of the first games I bought was \"Dead Space\" as a PS3 Greatest Hits title, and it's great fun. Lots of monsters to kill, lots of weapons to kill them with, some not-too-taxing \"puzzles\" to solve, and a fairly coherent storyline.One thing about corridor shooters that I always found frustrating was getting lost on the current level. Most of the games after Doom had a \"map\" feature that helped, but you could still end up going in circles shifting between the map and game views.\"Dead Space\" has a map screen, but it also has a very neat feature called \"Deck Navigation\". On the PS3 gamepad, when you click and hold the right stick down, a \"holographic route\" (green line) will appear for a few seconds to guide you on your way. While not perfect, this feature really helped me get through the game. For those with a better sense of direction, the Map Screen may be sufficient.Once you make it through the game the first time, it allows you to save all the upgraded weapons and armor you earned on the first go, making the replay value more attractive.One final note - if you do get stuck, check out the \"Dead Space\" walkthroughs by Major Slack on YouTube.

{"product_name":"B0001VGFK2","reviewerName":"sporkdude \"sporkdude\"","summary":"Too Gimmicky and Frustrating for the GTA Label.","reviewText":"To tell you where I'm coming from, I'll should just say this - GTA 3 is the greatest console game ever - when I first got on a Friday afternoon, I didn't do anything until I completed it Sunday night.  I even liked GTA Vice City, and I completed in a more casual manner, in a matter of a few weeks.  Needless to say that I was looking forward to this game.  I even finished about two thirds of the before I had to abandon it as unplayable and frustrating.First, the pros.  This has got to be the most impressive game engine ever.  The immensity of this game is huge.  It's more like three games combined into one.  There are three distinct cities (an LA, San Francisco, and a Las Vegas clone).  By far the most expansive game to hit the consoles, ever.  It's at least twice as big as Liberty City in GTA 3, but without any of the loading time when traversing the terrain.  All the cities capture the unique feel of the city in terms of atmosphere and geography.  Just amazing.  In fact, that warm glowing feeling I got when I first played the original GTA 3 returned when I played the San Francisco cloned city.The number of missions is impressive as well.  It takes about 90 missions to complete the whole storyline.  It's a great value.Also worth nothing is the radio.  It's got all the rap and rock associated with GTA type destruction from the early nineties.  Some include, N.W.A, Easy E, Ice Cube, Public Enemy, Guns N' Roses, Rage Against the Machine, along with some older music, CCR, Skynard, and some R & B like Boys 2 Men and En Vouge.  A huge lineup full of famous songs.There are other improvements as well.  The motorbikes are more controllable, and the AI of your friends is designed so they don't jump into gunfire or do something else that is incredibly stupid like they did in Vice City.So what's wrong?  It all sounds great, right?  Nope.  Rockstar paid scant attention to gameplay.  Sure, when you have over 100 missions total, not everyone can be a winner, but when you're struggling because one out of every 10 missions are long, tedious, or annoying, it just generates a huge headache.  A good rule of thumb would be is that 10% of the missions will take about 60% of your time.First off, many missions are multi-part, where if you fail in one part, you got to do the beginning all over again.  Now this would be cool if the missions didn't consist of long drives or other such banalities or if this was 1985 and it was the NES, but it's not, and it's unacceptable.  They tried to fix this with an option to skip a drive, but it only works in rare instances, and it requires you to drive back after you failed a mission, meaning that you're still driving the same distance.  In other words, out of the 61 missions I passed, I was able to use it once.Secondly, there are gimmicks instead of gameplay.  What I mean is that they decided to throw everything at you, despite the fact that most of it is unwanted, unneeded, and unintuitive.  Now you can swim, cycle, workout, get a girlfriend (no joke), use a camera, etc.  Okay, some of these are optional, but many of them are forced upon you in order to advance, and those are annoying and are part of the majority of missions I struggled with.  I was waiting for other useless missions like selling girl scout cookies or more idiotic things like that.For example, there is a mission that requires twenty minutes of driving before you can use a camera.  The mission and camera are not very well programmed, and the drive is way too long, so it took me about two hours to complete one of the simplest missions of all.  I was fuming after this.Now the worst thing are the flying levels.  I really have no idea what they were thinking here.  The planes are insanely sensitive and uncontrollable.  I invested over 30 hours into the game, got two-thirds the way through the game, only to hit the 62nd mission.  Now all I had to was pass a few flying lessons.  For two hours, I tried to circle an airfield and land - that's' it, and that's only one of the lessons I had to do.  I just couldn't do it, and this was one of the first lessons too, which meant that the other ones are probably harder.  I just gave up.  My time, like yours, is just too valuable battling bad gameplay.  This is really frustrating because I have never abandoned a game when I was so far into it.  I completed the other GTAs with no cheats or guides, and I've been playing games for 18 years, so it's not like I'm a newbie.No matter how good a game's engine, graphics, voice acting, or music is, gameplay is still king, and Rockstar failed miserably.  Sure this will sell 5 million or so copies, but Rockstar pretty much is slowing killing a great franchise.Pros:Huge game with tons of missionsSan Fierro (San Francisco clone) felt just rightGreat graphicsBest gaming engine ever madeImproved AI, controls for bikeUnbelievable musical selectionCons:Flying is beyond terrible - I cannot stress this enoughRepeat the same things in multiple part missions over and over again.Too many unintuitive gimmicks.Cannot skip most missions, so if you're stuck, you're stuckUseless driving.Hours to complete (if you can) - 50 hoursDifficulty level: Medium/HighFrustration level: Very high","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2004"}

It doesn't get simpler than that.  Luckily, the game provides a lot of variety despite the simple mechanics.  Enjoyable as a one-player game, the game is twice as fun with a second player.  The multi-player mini-games are also enjoyable, but the true strength of the game lies in re-playing and trying to beat your high scores.  The higher your scores, the more cash you earn.  The more cash you earn, the more weapon upgrades you can buy.  The better your weapons, the easier it is to get higher scores.  It works really well.GRAPHICS: This game looks good, but there are better looking games on the Wii.  Some character models are rougher looking than others and some textures feel really low res.  There are times where the dialogue and mouth movements on characters aren't synched up very well, but that's really minor.  There are some frame rate issues at times, but overall the game looks great and none of the issues I mentioned get in the way of me enjoying the game.LEVELS: The levels consist of seven extremely campy and cheesy Grindhouse movie themed missions.  Seven levels doesn't sound like a lot, but there's a lot here.  When you're done with the regular mode, you can turn on \"Extra Mutants\" or move on to \"Director's Cut\" which is basically expanded levels with increased difficulty.  Or you can turn on \"Dual Weild\" and \"Director's Cut\" at the same time.  I've already played many levels at least a half dozen times and it is likely they will be played several more times each.PRESENTATION: A lot of thought has gone into the presentation of this game.  While the game is horror themed, the primary focus of the dialogue is generally funny.  The music is amazing.  The menu presentations are phenomenally well thought out.  The whole game oozes seventies style and spoofs many horror movie and Blaxploitation themes, for good or for bad.  This game wallows in the cliches that have persisted in low-budget Hollywood films for decades.  It is also probably the most vulgar game on the market that I can think of.  One character, an obvious Samuel L. Jackson knockoff, uses the f-bomb like a comma.  Talking like that would get you kicked out of even the toughest biker bar.  The game developers even realize this and make fun of the excessive swearing.  Oh, and something disturbing happens at the end of the last level which is so vile and disgusting I'm still kind of shocked.  I honestly think the game should have been rated AO (Adults Only) instead of M (Mature).This is probably one of the better game purchases I've made.  There are a lot of light-gun style games on the Wii, but this one plays better than all the rest.  The most comparable competing titles in terms of quality would probably be Link's Crossbow Training, Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles, or House of the Dead: 2 & 3.  The only serious drawback to this game is the absurd amount of profanity and over the top vulgarity.  SEGA went a little too far at times, especially near the end of the game.  Way too far....I highly recommend Overkill as a purchase or a rental to open-minded and tolerant adults looking for a thoroughly enjoyable multi-player co-op game.  I generally oppose censorship in nearly all of its forms, but I also believe that there is something to be said about exercising self-restraint.  If you are easily offended or even moderately offended by profanity and crude humor I have to recommend staying away from this game because it frequently crosses the line of good taste.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2009"}

Your radio man  became a midnight snack for the T.rex, so it's up to you and your two remaining teammates to explore a  dino-infested research station, rescue the scientist, call for a helicopter retrieval, and escape with your lives.  Along the way you'll uncover the grizzly remains of those who got in the dinosaurs' way, and you'll unravel  the mystery of how a top-secret energy research project turned into a Jurassic nightmare.And about those dinosaurs: they're all over the island. One instant you'll be walking along a second-story  balcony, admiring the view, the next instant you'll be dodging a T.rex as it smashes its huge maw through  the concrete walls.

(and producer of the next 2)It came out at the peak of survival horror popularity but was more than just a clone of Resident Evil. Obviously if you're searching for this game 10 years later you must know something about it and the genre. This is probably a must buy if you like these types of games. I would say get Resident Evil 1,2,3 and Silent Hill first, however.Dino Crisis featured full 3D background, not prerendered ones like Resident Evil. It was much more advanced. You have a limited inventory but have different types of healing items and ammunition for each gun.And of course no zombies here...oh no, Dinos! Much faster than those old creepy zombies. The game environments were excellent and the music really added to the atmosphere. It's definitely in the \"style\" of a late 90s Resident Evil game, which is a good thing.Some came with a Resident Evil 3 Demo, which was cool, and Resident Evil 3 of course came with a Dino Crisis Demo.

As heroes, they explore familiar battlefields, discover new lands, and take on epic quests and challenges in Blizzard's massively multiplayer online role-playing game. Blizzard has taken care to make the game accessible and fun both for hard-core 60-hour-a-week players and for more casual adventurers.","reviewerName":"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","summary":"Solid, intriguing MMORPG experience","reviewText":"World of Warcraft is a work in progress, and it generally works. Those familiar with general principles of engineering design know that true innovation is risky and likely to fail on the first try. There's no question that Blizzard knows this as well, and as such World of Warcraft does very little to change the tried-and-true MMORPG conventions. That said, it does do many things better than much of the competition.The gameplay mechanics are pretty standard. You can choose from various classes, pick basic traits such as gender, race, and appearance, and use a variety of class/race-specific equipment and skills. You can choose professions that let you gather or create various items. You gain experience by doing quests, defeating enemies, and exploring areas. Along the way you interact with NPCs and other players, with whom you can pick up quests or trade items. Nothing too surprising in any of this, unless you've never touched an RPG in your life.It's the implementation of these aspects of the game that stand out. For example, trade is conducted both directly or through auction houses where you can put items up for sale to other players. This makes it unnecessary to actually physically meet in order to do business. An e-mail system lets you send messages, items, and money to other players (or even your other characters). Quests are given by level, and sometimes send you to instanced dungeons that require serious teamwork to get through. The number of items available, especially set items that provide extra benefits if you equip multiple pieces of the set, make for an endless number of options for outfitting your characters.The gameplay in general is well balanced, both for PVE (player vs environment) and PVP (player vs player). Quest chains are generally well done, and the level of difficulty generally fits with your current level. Skill balance is also generally decent, and there's no one class that really stands out as 'best.' If you like to do things alone, it's entirely possible to reach the maximum level that way. If you like doing everything with friends, that also works.The game's graphics are also decent. I've seen better, but I've also seen worse. The game generally performs well on my somewhat average machine, and it actually doesn't require high-speed internet to work (though it is still recommendable).Now, please note the number of times the word 'generally' appears in the last few paragraphs. There are numerous exceptions to all of those statements, though not enough to form a majority in any particular area. Blizzard is always fixing, tweaking, nerfing, and otherwise modifying the game, so issues vanish and new issues arise with every patch. Some changes are necessary, but some I've seen are highly questionable. I will concede that this may be a matter of personal opinion, but I haven't yet met a person that was happy with ALL of them.There is another major problem with World of Warcraft, and it is significant enough that it warrants a deduction in rating despite the game's many strengths. This is the game support and downtime. I've found the in-game tech support to be inept, wishy-washy, and overall a big waste of time. Most of your queries will be met by an automated response, and the proposed solutions almost never work. Granted, it must be a nightmare trying to troubleshoot a game as complicated as this, but they could at least say 'I don't know' instead of wasting your time doing something that clearly isn't going to fix the problem. I'm not sure if this is the result of a typical 'we never make mistakes, so the game has no bugs and it must be your machine' complex, or if it's just a way of giving Blizzard's QA personnel something to spin their wheels on. Either way, it needs serious improvement.The servers are often congested, regularly offline, and generally unreliable. As a matter of fact, the whole darn thing is down right now, which is why I'm writing this review instead of playing. People get booted off for no good reason all the time- I don't think I've ever seen a long instance run in which nobody was booted. Though the game is pretty stable, occasionally I'll see a fatal exception in something or another, or just a crash to desktop. Together with other sundry bugs and glitches in quests and the game environment, this can result in a rather frustrating experience. If you want to see just how frustrating it can get, take a look at the community site's tech board sometime.So you might ask, despite all this why am I willing to pay my $15 a month to play? Well, the game itself is just that good- there's so many things to do, see, and (of course) kill that you'll be hard pressed to experience the half of it in a year of play. Particularly if you have friends that want to play with you, it really doesn't get old. The addition of new content is also reason to keep coming back, and in that regard Blizzard has done a fine job. If you have a great deal of time to waste, or don't significantly value your social life, then World of Warcraft comes with my highest recommendations.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2006"}

Unlike with the other demos, XBOX had several games you could try.  I tried DOA3, and I was amazed:1. The options are amazing!  There must be 3 or 4 dozen moves to try, and I still haven't figured them all out yet.  To begin with, there are over 12 characters to choose from, ranging from fighting styles of former wrestlers to ninjas.  The envirements to chose from are incredible!  Half the fun of the game is looking for secrets in the 2 dozen levels.  You can either do story mode (my least favorite part), versus mode (fight each other 2-4 player), team battle, survival mode (my persounal favorite), tag battle, and movies.  In the versus mode, 2 to 4 people can fight tag team against each other.  It's a real blast.  My persounal favorite in this game (besides multiplayer), is survival mode.  Beating as many openants as u can.  Each oponnant gets harder until you're literally fighting for your life.  A great game in terms of options, you'll spend hours upon hours fighting DOA3 style.2. The gameplay in this game is awsome!  It never gets to easy, and I still can't beat the computer on the setting  &gt;very hard&lt; after a 100 hours of gameplay; it's mouth watering!  The moves are fun and graceful, and the overall gameplay in just about everything (survival mode, story, team battle) is good enough to keep u entertained.  The gameplay, I'm very happy to say, does not fail here.3. The graphics: what really made this game!  Every single fighting arena is huge, beautiful, and has the best graphics I've ever seen.  When your fighting in a snow covered forrest, your feet leave footprints, and being knocked into a tree causes snow to fall from it in clumps.  In an aquarium setting, whales and dolphins actually glide by you while fighting.  In hill top setting, you can knock off the oppenant for dozens of stories onto lower hill tops.  Water in this game looks like real water, and the crispness of everything is just amazing!  The people look so real you'll grimace when they get hit (well, maybe not quite that much).  No gore, but it seriously looks like a real fight is going on.Overall, you should get this game.  Especially counsidering the price drop recently.

I've played every one released since it's initial one on PSOne.  This game is NOT Resident Evil.  Sure, it bears the name and it's made by the name company, but the similarities pretty much end there.  The game actually has a good premise.  The idea is there to make it a good game.  However, it feels like Capcom wanted a filler to make a few bucks and prep for the release of RE6.  It seems like Capcom took their worst designers, threw them into a room and directed them to make this game.  I don't even know where to start.  The graphics are just ok...passable at best.  The controls are decent, but you'll find them unresponsive at inopportune times (having to time a button to dodge a boss's attack - NOPE.)  There is no inventory system as in past RE games.  You are allowed 2 guns, a few grenades, a health and anti-viral spray.  Nothing more.  Herbs are used for health, but are used the instant you pick them up (are we back in 1998 or something?).  Saving is done by automatic checkpoints, which can be far and few between.  This is highly frustrating, since you will find yourself playing areas over because of a cheap death.  Not that the game is overly difficult - it's more aggravating than anything.  Your AI controlled teammates are complete and utter morons.  They tend to walk right in your line of fire more times than not, they don't kill ANYTHING and they require you to constantly \"heal\" them.  Unless you have friends to take control of a teammate, it's you against everyone.  Your \"team\" is useless.  The campaign can be beaten in about 6-7 hours if you stay at it and can cope with the frustration.  Voice acting is, well, odd.  Apparently, Umbrella only hires outside of the US when it comes to their security team.  The story sort of follows the events during the initial T-Virus outbreak, but there is little substance.PROS:- Controls are ok- You get to kill zombies- It's Resident Evil - sort ofCONS:- AI is absolutely terrible- The story is lacking, even though it's basically mapped out by previous RE installments- It's relatively short- It's Resident Evil - sort ofThe bottome line is, if you're a hardcore Resident Evil fan you may derive some enjoyment out of this title.  If you've never played RE, don't play this one first, as it will turn you off of a fantastic franchise.  It's not the worst game I've ever played, but it's certainly a disappointment.  Perhaps it's because I had high hopes for it.  Perhaps it's because I was jones-ing for a RE game to play.  Whatever the reason, I now have buyers remorse.

There by far the best for any football game.  The gameplay has been improved slightly.  The defense controls a little different do to the hit stick but the offense is pretty much the same.  The franchise mode has everything it did last year but with the Tony Bruno radio show which is a little lame because he doesn't even talk about your team.  You also recieve emails which is ok, but my favorite is the newpaper because it says what's going on with the NFL and your team and the newspaper clippings in the game are from real life newspapers.  There's real time weather now meaning that it can start raining and stop at anytime during the game which is very cool.  There's also one new mini game whcih isn't all that exciteing.  But what it all comes down to is this is still a great madden game but it could of used some more improvements.  If you have 50 bucks to buy this I suggest you save another 10 to get the collectors edition which has a quite of few more features.  Otherwise if you didn't like last year's madden you should go try ESPN NFL 2K5 for 20 bucks.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00020V4N0","reviewerName":"W. C. Bryant","summary":"Not a review, just a summary of new features.","reviewText":"As I said in the title, this is not a review. I just want to save like-minded people some time, and summarize what makes 2005 different from the 2004 title. While this isn't platform specific, the biggest upgrade this year is for the Xbox, as EA and Microsoft have finally settled, and online play has finally arrived via XBLive. I'd like to not assign stars at all, but Amazon doesn't allow for pre-release non-reviews. So I'm assigning 5 stars based on Madden 2004, and the promise of the following new features. It is not meant to be commentary about the 2005 title.I've done this for NCAA 2005 as well, but decided to adapt it for Madden as well. Everything in here is Madden-specific.GENERAL GAMEPLAY IMPROVEMENTS:- The hit stick: The Hit Stick is a brand-new control innovation whereby players can attempt to lay a big hit on their opponent by flicking the right stick. They are risky, as a mis-timed hit can be devastating to your defense, but it can all pay off with a huge hit and a fumble or dropped pass.- Reworked DB play/pass defense: Rebuilt from the ground up, with a focus on man-to-man coverage. Good DBs will now blanket their receivers better than ever before, and \"shut down\" corners will now play as such.- All alternate team jerseys are now available.- Updated player models for more intense realism.- Reworked stadiums, fans, and environmental graphics.- New running animations. \"Over 1000 new animations added.\"FRANCHISE MODE IMPROVEMENTS:- Restricted Free Agents - Allow your young guys to test Restricted Free Agency.- Preseason Position Battles - Let two players who are similar in talent battle it out for the starting job.- Player Personalities - Players react to everything that happens to them and if things get really bad for them, they demand a trade. If you're not throwing the ball to your star receiver, you'll hear about it.- Franchise Tags - Tag players who refuse to re-sign with your team.- New Realistic Off-season Free Agency - Players no longer only care about money. They now look at your team, the players you have, your team prestige and lots of other factors.- Weekly Game-plan - Your coordinators provide you with a game-plan each week that contains keys to stop your upcoming opponents.- NFL Icons - They've acknowledged the stars in the NFL and they become Icons in your Franchise. These players influence free agents and affect morale if something happens to them.- Practice in Franchise - You can now practice with your current franchise team.- Improved Team Management - Teams intelligently manage their rosters now. They cut dead weight and sign regular season free agents.- Name Team Captains - You can now name your team captains every year in Franchise.- Rivalries - Rivalries are a new addition to Franchise this year.- Team Prestige - A new aspect of Franchise is prestige. Turn a perennial loser around to become a true powerhouse.- In-Season Player Progression - Players now progress based on how well they're doing during the season. Breakout players are rewarded for their performance.- Improved Draft - A ticker, announcer and trading during the draft highlight our draft improvements.- Change Player Positions - You can change the positions of players in Franchise every season now.- Storyline Central is a new addition to Franchise Mode this year that focuses on every story that is at the forefront in the NFL. The stories around your team now impact your team. If the rookie RB is pushing the veteran for playing time but not getting it, his morale will drop and it will affect his performance. You hear about the stories three different ways.1) Newspaper. Every team in Franchise has a newspaper from their local city that discusses only the stories that pertain to that team. We also feature USA Today, which is the franchise's national newspaper. In USA Today, the most important stories from the entire NFL appear.2) EA Sports Radio. They've added sports talk radio to Franchise, where host Tony Bruno breaks down the week's biggest stories. Each week's show includes call-ins, coach and player interviews, trivia questions and from time to time, Tony will rant about important issues in the NFL.3) Email. Every week on your PDA, you'll receive emails about everything going on with your team. You will receive emails from players, coaches, general managers, the PR department, etc.- Create-a-fan: Create your own dedicated crazy fans. To be included during game-time celebratory animations.ONLINE PLAY IMPROVEMENTS:- Opponent scouting: They've added a new scouting report that allows you to check any player's (online) tendencies. You can look at their favorite playbook and formation, as well as look at how much they no-huddle, call hot routes, and audible. It's meant to try and cut down on the number of games wasted to opposition that cheats or otherwise plays in a manner you're not interested in.- Quick tournaments: 4 or 8 player tournaments built right into the online system.- Even team mode: An option that will allow an even playing field, regardless of the 'real world' strengths and weaknesses of two programs/teams.- Improved leaderboards.- \"Rushing Attack\" mini-game, as defined above.- EA Messenger: Track dozens of friends online.That's all I've come across so far, but it's a factual aggregation of information, all directly from the source. Either Electronic Arts, and/or Phil Frazier the line producer via an interview on EASports, much of the info is paraphrased or even partially or wholly quoted. None of this comes through third parties, or speculation. Given that, this looks to be one of the biggest leaps forward this franchise has enjoyed in some time. Particularly for Xbox fans as they finally get online play, but really for everyone. But enough, I now return you to your regularly scheduled, \"tHiS gAMe iz dA bOMb!\" 'reviews'.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2004"}
{"product_name":"B001383L36","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Three Great Games for One Great Price","reviewText":"The Metal Gear Solid Essential Collection is just that... essential.  Coming just in time for the release of Metal Gear Solid 4, the purpose of this is to let those who want to absorb the story of the saga do so to refresh their minds for the concluding events of Metal Gear Solid 4.The Metal Gear Solid saga centers primarily on an operative named Solid Snake.  The first game chronicles his mission through Shadow Moses Island where he has to stop his former unit Fox-Hound from launching a Nuclear Weapon: Metal Gear.  As he undergoes the mission, he discovers many revelations about himself and what the meaning of his very life could be.Metal Gear Solid 2 picks up the story two years later in which Snake and friend Otacon form a non-profit organization known as Philanthropy.  They're mission is to get photographic evidence that the military is developing a new type of Metal Gear.  Unfortunately the Tanker Mission doesn't go as planned.  Two years later, a Plant is built where the Tanker went down and players were treated to one of Metal Gear Solid 2's most controversial plot twists, they discovered they would not be playing the rest of the game as Solid Snake and they'd be playing as an operative named Raiden.  Like Snake, Raiden's mission unravels many revelations about him.  The second installment, in particular, showers some of the best plot twists in the series.Metal Gear Solid 3, on the other hand, takes the series back to the very beginning where you control an operative named Naked Snake, who will eventually go on to be known through the series as Big Boss.  During his mission he is sent to save an Operative named Sokolov before Colonial Volgin can get to him.  Much like Metal Gear Solid 2, the game is divided into two parts, and the first part is a failure only for the second part to be one of redemption.The Metal Gear Solid franchise is famous for its storyline of Solid Snake and other characters.  The essential collection gives anyone a chance to relive the story with each episode back to back to back.  Every story is told through amazing cutscenes with great voice acting.  While some of the story sequences can get a little long (especially in Metal Gear Solid 2) they're filled with great direction and a lot of story to absorb.  And you'll want to absorb as much as you can, because Metal Gear Solid 4 will reference all three games.The gameplay has also been very memorable, evolving throughout the series.  Along those lines, each game never makes you go about each situation the same way.  There are numerous ways to approach each situation, and with several difficulty levels (coupled with a few other extras in the second and third games) each game demands replay.  Even better is that for Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3 we got the Substance and Subsistence variants respectively.If there was anything wrong with this collection, it would be that Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence doesn't include the second disc.  While it's true, Metal Gear Online is taken down for Subsistence, the second disc did include the original Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake.  These are two games that can really help add to the Metal Gear saga.  It's a small price, but for those who didn't own the original Subsistence and wanted to play the original two games, just know you won't get them with this collection.  However, this probably won't be seen as a big loss anyway.  The story of Metal Gear Solid can be well understood without the two original games.If you don't own the Metal Gear Solid games and you'd like to know the story, this is a good investment.  The fact that you'll get Substance and Subsistence rather than just the original Sons of Liberty and Snake Eater make this a very good deal indeed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0022TNO7S","description":"","reviewerName":"D. Allen","summary":"Played it but I felt some parts were rough.","reviewText":"Max Payne 3 is pretty cool. The game is played like any other third person shooter with the added ability to use \"bullet time\" which causes time to match a bullet's speed and you can take the time to aim and take out a large group of people.I would say the story of this game is pretty awesome. Max Payne is hired out as a bodyguard for a upper class, super rich / elite group of people. Eventually the main girl you're protecting, Fabiana gets kidnapped and the game plays around this as you reveal a large story.With that said, not much can be discussed about the story without spoiling. The game is story heavy so while the game spans 13 chapters, once you play it, very little reason to go back and replay it as there aren't choices in the game.The story itself is presented rather uniquely. Max is stuck in grief over the loss of his daughter and wife years ago. So as redemption, he sees that protecting Fabiana is like redeeming himself of saving his wife and child. With that said, the story is presented rather uniquely as you see many times the game plays side panels and many flashes of word. I think this is a big fault of the game as well. Many times I get motion sickness from viewing so many scrolling and flashing of the screen. Sometimes the game even flashes text that the person is saying across the screen like it's a keyword to remember. This is rather annoying as it flashes and and all that. It in many cases lose focus of the story as the flashes sort of blinds you but I suppose on the flip side this is how the developers wanted to present their story of Max since he's an alcoholic and his life is rather chaotic and drifting between sanity.As far as the game play, it's awesome. You use real guns against people. There's no aliens or anything of the like. The gun play is rather realistic and as you go into bullet time, you can easily pick off large groups of people. However, there are several annoying things which I'll list out:1) You can carry three weapons. Two pistols/machine guns which you can also combo to dual wield. You get a rifle as well. Now here's the annoying bit number one for me when you're playing a chapter, sometimes it goes into cutscenes which then goes into a shootout. Now this is fine but the rifle that you were holding earlier is switched out to a pistol so you have to reselect the rifle from the radial menu. This might seem minor but in some cases you might be low on pistol ammo, or a rifle might be better. It's minor but it's still a rather annoying thing to have to do.2) Next issue follows the first problem. In many cases in a chapters there are cutscenes. Now in the level you might collect various weapons or items which of course you'd expect to use. Now given the story it makes sense that sometimes you would switch to a different weapon, but in the case of this game, many times between cutscenes you change to a completely different set of weapons or pistols. In some cases I'm carrying a six shooter then the next I'm carrying a desert eagle without any reason or clue from the cut scene that he changed weapons. Overall rather annoying.3) Next issue has to do with enemies. The game seems to glorify headshots and headshots only. What I mean is that in later levels, many time you can be shooting an enemy and he'll stand back up. Now this is expected because enemies are wearing bullet proof vests. Max isn't wearing one and the game is sort of distracting that you shoot someone seemingly 10 times and they're still back up for no reason. Many times the hit detection seems to be off that you shoot someone in bullet time in the head and for no reason they get back up afterwards and then you have to waste a lot of ammunition. In many cases I have to replay a part of the game so many times because enemies keep getting back up and it's rather annoying that bullet proof vests are protecting people this much.4) The bullet damage is inconsistent with point three. For example, these people wearing the bullet proof vest, remember how I said it takes multiple shots to put one down? Now in some parts of the game, it appears that you can hit someone anywhere, in the foot, chest, or anywhere and they'll die from it. For example, in one level a car was coming at me. So the game goes into super slow motion and I remember shooting him in the shoulders and he died. Now if the game was playing normally, the soldier would have barely been hurt. Other examples of this is how the game heals. You heal by taking painkillers. You can manually do this when you're hurt or you can wait for the game to automatically do it for you. When you're badly hurt, and you have more painkillers, the game goes into super slow motion allowing you to take the enemy out and apply the painkiller to continue the game which in normal cases would kill you. Now here's the issue, you can shoot them anywhere and they'll die! This is loony as many times in the game I shoot someone twice in the chest, they go down, and I think, \"Okay they're down\" then they get back up, shoot me, and I go into super slow motion only to hit them in the pinky finger and they die. This gets me rather upset many times.5) Next issue with the game is the pain killer. Now this is fine. You nearly die, you go into slow motion, kill and you use one pain killer. Of course this sounds easy but sometimes the game just goes into this slow motion, you wait 1 minutes for it to complete, then you get a game over. I found the reason why is that your gun is pointed to the floor so you aim at the person but you're shooting at the floor. This is extremely annoying and many times I might have 5 pain killers on me, get into this super slow motion, aim at the person, shoot at the floor, wait for the game over screen.Overall there are many issues with this game. I would say it's just short of being perfect but I had enjoyed the Max Payne story so much that I'm rating this game a four star because it's just awesome. From start to finish the game is brutal and nonstop. You feel great getting back at the evil doers of this game but with some of the problems I had with the game, I really can't see myself playing it again. However I would recommend this game to anyone out there wanting something to play. The game isn't a replay unless you like the story, but the story is simply awesome enough to see.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2012"}

I've gotten far but still fall short no matter what I do.The game casts you as a hot shot young doctor in a fast paced hospital environment.

The play is addicting & easy to learn but difficult to master.Despite my shortcomings at this game it is one that I heartily recommend to most players.

After booting up the game, I walked down the hallway and got spotted by a guard. As he shouted, \"WHO'S THAT?\" the controller jumped in my hand - and I knew this was a smart purchase. As the guards shot at me, I felt the feedback of the bullets, just as I had 10 years ago on my Sony Playstation.I picked out another old school Playstation game,Tenchu: Stealth Assassins. From Ayame's blades to Rikimaru's sword, each sword swipe and jump had excellent feedback.Okay, so my Playstation games worked out. But what about my Playstation 2 library?I popped inGod of War, knowing I had to feel the swing of the Blades of Chaos. The controller vibrations felt a little lighter here, but the vibrations still occurred at the appropriate times.Then I choseIncredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction. Who better to test a vibration controller than the Sultan of Smash? All the power jumps and smashes had the vibrations intact, but they still felt a little on the light side.All right, so far I was two for two with my Playstation and Playstation 2 test subjects. But what about my Playstation 3 games? Could I possibly hit a trifecta?I put inUncharted: Drake's Fortuneand I decided to jump right into a heated firefight. The controller gave me feedback while shooting weapons and getting hit by enemy fire, but I knew my purchase was justified when Drake was near death: I FELT THE DUALSHOCK 3 PULSING IN SYNCH WITH DRAKE'S HEARTBEAT. It's one thing to hear that noise and know he's near death, it's quite another to feel the pulse in my own hands.Okay, so the feedback on the older games was there, but a little lighter than I remember. The reason? Well, when I decided to go wireless on my Playstation 2 system, I bought a Logitec Dualshock controller. It turns out, that controller takes two \"AA\" batteries, and the vibration motors inside the controller handles are slightly larger than the ones in the Dualshock 3. That's where I felt the difference.The Dualshock 3 vibrations may be slightly less than the Logitec controller, but it doesn't require the purchase of batteries.The Dualshock 3 may be slightly heavier than the SixAxis, but it doesn't take up any extra space at all.Sure, the price is about $15 more than the SixAxis, but it's a worthy upgrade for the Playstation 3 gamer who kicks it old school as well as new school. The only other drawback is the lack of an additional USB cable - but we can use the one that came with the system itself.So what's the final verdict?Order it, plug it in, charge it up, and get ready for the inevitable downloads from the Playstation Store to make the older PS3 games Dualshock 3 compatible.I wouldn't recommend a feedback peripheral without providing my own feedback...Enjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2008"}

Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"Grand Theft Auto Returns (Thankfully) to its Roots","reviewText":"It's been interesting browsing through the lower-rated reviews and seeing what people have to say.  Some of them raise some pretty decent points and I can't deny them - you can't enter most stores, there isn't a fancy casino, there aren't as many side-games, etc.But I want to ask the real question - does anyone really care?  Did you LIKE sitting at a slot machine in San Andreas?  I probably spent all of 5 minutes in that casino - outside of the relevant missions - in the HOURS that I played that game.  And did you like having to go to restaurants to eat?  Was that really &#34;fun&#34;?NO!!  It was drivel!  It was time-consuming, it made you lose your focus, and bored most of us to tears.  And thanks to the new &#34;stock market&#34; mechanic, we don't need to waste time in a casino trying to make a few quick bucks...  We have to look forward people.  This isn't San Andreas.  For the most part, it's better.I've thoroughly enjoyed GTA V.  I actually thought the story was one of the better ones in recent times.  I thought the tension between the three main characters made for some pretty unique events.  Towards the end when (spoiler alert) you start getting hints that characters may be forced to kill other characters, I actually found myself quite riveted to the story.  Sure some of the missions themselves were a bit odd - the billionaire car-collector guy seemed pretty pointless.  The warring military/government factions actually confused me somewhat, but they seemed to confuse the main characters as well, so perhaps that was the point!  The heists were pretty neat and I wish there were more of them.  We'll probably get them in the form of costly DLC...But what I've enjoyed most about GTA V was the fact that it left behind a lot of the nonsense from GTA IV.  No more mandatory &#34;man-dates&#34;, no more dragging around cousins and friends and acquaintances just so you can buy guns or hitch a helicopter ride from time-to-time.  We also have our BLESSED garages back, and even some storage buildings added with the sole intent of storing our favorite cars.  Thanks for that, Rockstar.  I love the large map again with the differing geographic and cultural areas.  I truly enjoy the &#34;random encounters&#34; where you're given the option to mingle unexpectedly with a random event taking place.  They're repetitive after a short while, but there's a pretty wide variety of them scattered about.In fact, the &#34;new&#34; things added to the GTA franchise are pretty significant.  The custom car shops have much more variety than what we saw in San Andreas.  The in-game internet has a wealth of additional content, including the abiliy to purchase almost every vehicle in the game.  Just CANNOT find that wanna-be Corvette?  Screw it - buy one on the interwebs!  And of course, the whole &#34;three characters = thrice the fun&#34; is such an interesting change from the way GTA has always been.  The only frustration I encounter is when you switch to Trevor only to find that he's wandered to the top of a mountain and is wearing a sun dress...  Suddenly I'm forced to hike a mile to the nearest road and on top of that, I need to change clothes again...There are certainly some annoyances in GTA V - for one, the police seem the hardest ever to avoid.  Most of the time I hit a three-star wanted level, I end up walking out of a hospital.  The AI is pretty relentless.  Once I managed to escape line-of-sight and hide in a train tunnel.  Somehow the AI managed to &#34;see&#34; me through what I can only presume was grating in the street above, and suddenly a calvary of FIB trucks came screaming down the train tracks.  Police are spawned ad-nauseum, creating a &#34;no-win&#34; scenario for the player.  Your best bet is to go off-road where the AI has a hard time with path-creation, and knock out police helicopters as quickly as possible.  In short, it's not a lot of fun.  I would have loved to see a Skyrim-like &#34;witness&#34; mechanic, where if you take out everyone who saw you do what you did, you can get away with it.Another irritation I found was in the dialogue between Franklin (a young, black man living in a gang-ridden part of town at the start of the story) and one of his friends, Lamar.  The two interact several times throughout the story, and their dialogue is annoyingly ridden with the &#34;N&#34; word.  Now, I'm certainly not a fan of political correctness, but after a while, I simply got tired of hearing it.  And since you're forced to listen to the two ramble on to each other as you drive from point-to-point in these missions, I often found myself muting the TV.  Let me clear - I wasn't offended - I was simply annoyed.  Some of the sentences were literally scripted as &#34;No my 'N' you're not living like a 'N' in the hood, my 'N'...&#34;  Who wrote that crap??Lastly, we're still stuck with a lot of collection requirements to hit 100%.  Whether it's alien ship parts or &#34;written letters&#34; or stunt jumps or what not, it's always something.  But don't forget, you San Andreas lovers, that SA was rife with that as well.  Remember the horseshoes we had to hunt down?  And the gang-tags we had to spray paint over...?  I still remember sitting with the official Game Guide and a pencil for HOURS while playing that game...  Not a lot of fun then, either.Oh, and online... ...sucks.  But online always sucks.  I don't know why the market keeps pushing us to play with each other.  I play video games to escape the tedium that is OTHER PEOPLE...  I played online for about 10 minutes.  I did the first mission which made no sense, and in the process apparently P'd off the other guy it paired me with, so as soon as the mission was over he killed me and stole the car I had been using.  Shortly afterwards I managed to get another car and - upon happening to see the same player - I mercilessly chased him down and ran him over.  I laughed maniaclly until the cops appeared out of nowhere (apparently not pleased at the other handful of pedestrians I took with him) and made quick work of my unleveled, unarmed-and-armored character.  Having died twice in just a few minutes, I left online mode and haven't returned since.  Personally I think the whole point of GTA is to CAUSE crimes, not be a victim of them.  So to me, a slew of online players trying to cause crime on one another just doesn't fit the description of &#34;entertaining&#34; in my book.Anyways, what I think you need to take from all of this is that GTA went back to what made GTA so great in the first place.  GTA IV tried to be serious - your character wanted to get away from a life of crime...  ...in a game called &#34;Grand Theft Auto.&#34;  GTA V gives us a Trevor - a deranged psycopath who sees the glass not as half-full or half-empty, but as something that yearns to be shattered.  GTA V adds back some of the mayhem, the larger-than-life crimes with just enough sillyness to make us smile about it in the end.I think there's a great game here.  Sure some people will yearn for more, but I've thoroughly enjoyed most of my time in the game.  Oh and the graphics are amazing.  I realize developers will get a better grasp of the Xbox One soon enough, but GTA V on the 360 looks as good as Dead Rising does on the Xbox One.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00009WAUO","description":"Players can add cool new features with the Card e-Reader or link up with friends for multiplayer adventures with the original Mario Bros. game.","reviewerName":"Lestor neeker Wong","summary":"Do not underestimate the powers of a fat plumber.","reviewText":"A fat plumber called Mario was quite the icon during my childhood days. In those days, you weren't cool unless you played a Super Mario Bros. game or two. Super Mario Bros. 3 was one such games, and it was no doubt one of the most popular games in Nintendo's 100-odd-years history.Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3 is almost an exact replica of that game. Porting the game over to the GBA, Nintendo has made some minor changes to the it, but the large part of it remains essentially the same old of old. Which makes it a rather nostalgic run down the memory lane for gamers from the 80s' era, who are still gaming. Like me.For the uninformed, the mission of Mario and Co. is simple. You will need to save a Princess (duh!), and to do that, you will need to battle through different levels in nine worlds. Going through all the worlds painstakingly is not compulsory though, if you happen to be strategic with some items you collect along the way, but the more accomplished Mario fans will tell you there's more fun in doing it \"the right way\".Of course, doing it that way means a very long, and sometimes tough journey. You get upgrades when the game progresses, allowing you to change into various costumes. One of these is a raccoon suit that allows you to sweep your enemies with your tail, and to fly up to the sky. Pretty nifty, if you ask me. Other costumes lets you split fire, swim faster in water and throw hammers, etc. All of these give you some advantage in certain situations, but knowing when, and how to use them effectively is a different story.Graphics wise, the colors look every bit as vibrant as they were, but the pictures are a little short when compared to modern standards. This has always been a problem with porting classic games onto the GBA. Still, I'm not a fussy person. Graphics have never been an issue for me when it comes to games, or I'd have bought an XBox.The audios in this game are ok, although the music sounds like it has been remixed. Some of the in-game comments are a little corny, for example, when Mario gets a costume upgrade, he yells out: \"That's what I needed!\". This gets old after, like, two minutes. The special effect audios are as good as ever, so you get the classic \"ting\" sound when you latch onto coins, and the robotic tunnel-climbing sound when you get into one of those secret tubes, which is cool.The changes in this version of Super Mario Bros. 3 now allow you to save your change. A welcomed move, surely, but the game is so easy, you probably won't need the feature if you intend to go through it speedily with the magic whistles. Oh, did I say magic whistles? Ok, I shall shut up. Other additions include five advance medallions per level, and a chance to take on the classic Mario Bros. game. If you're just buying this game for Super Mario Bros/ 3, you may conveniently ignore all these.In conclusion, Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3 is a classic revisited. It's an adventure with the qualities to impress fans, whether young or old, and will no doubt add hours of fun for you on the GBA. This is a game truly worthy of the Super Mario Bros. franchise.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000Z9A95M","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"One of the best games I've ever played, and it's fun for all ages!","reviewText":"For the last couple of months, I've been playing Okami with my daughter, little by little until we finally completed it just a few hours ago. She's only 4, but was drawn into the world and story right from the beginning. Not a day's went by where some kind kind of reference to the game wasn't made, and she's even added pictures to her coloring books that feature dogs just so they match scenes in the game. My point in saying all of this is that even though this is a story-driven game, it's easy to see that this game can be enjoyed by people of all ages, and this is the kind of game I would've adored when I was younger too. While I feel bad for not giving Okami a shot when I had a ps2, I'm glad it was one of the first games I bought when I purchased a Wii early this year.Okami's story is a long one, but the main point to it is that you play as the sun god Amaterasu, a white wolf who needs to purify Japan from many curses and monsters that have started to take over. You were once much stronger- a white wolf named Shiranui, but died in a battle with a powerful 8 headed dragon named Orochi. Since you've been reincarnated, you need to restore your powers which consist of 13 magical brush techniques from the other gods. Amaterasu has a brush at her disposal that controls certain elements and can do other things like sprout trees, slow time, walk up walls and more. Along with her is the wandering artist Issun, who wants to be in on the brush techniques too. He serves as Amaterasu's speaker (think of him as a much less annoying version of Navi from Ocarina of Time) and is helpful in many situations as well. At first the main objective is to get the brush techniques and defeat Orochi, but things get even more serious later on.When it comes down to it, Okami is a spruced up version of any Zelda game. It has the same tone as your standard Zelda game- lighthearted but it can be dark when it needs to be. The big difference for me is that Okami is much more interesting. We actually learn the backstory to characters and plot points instead of it just being another 'oh, this is the bad guy, can you go stop him and get the same weapons in the same temples that you always do? Thanks!'. I was genuinely interested in the story here, and learning more about all the characters. What exactly is the deal with Waka and why is he following Amaterasu? Is Susano really the hero that he tries to convince everyone he is? Will Issun ever get anywhere with that 'busty babe' Rao? Amaterasu, while she can't talk, is full of character too, often yawning and laying down when a demon is threatening her. It's charming and I was in love with this character the first time it happened. Getting to roam around the world as a wolf instead of a human is great as well. The world of Okami is a relatively small one when you look at everything, but there's still a lot to do. Rather than getting experience or collecting souls/energy from enemies like a lot of games these days do, the only way to level up Amaterasu's stats is through Praise. Earning Praise is a fun thing to do in Okami, be it from simply feeding animals, completing a task for someone, blooming a giant clover or...oh you can do tons of things to get Praise.The art direction in Okami is flawless, and I highly recommend getting the art book for it as well. Enemy designs are unique and varied. There are no enemies that are simply older ones but with different colors here. You'll face imps, tengus, mirrors, sea monsters, crabs that can fuse to create a shark, ogres, flying koi, foxes with masks, and that's just a portion of the regular enemies. The bosses here are some of the best looking I've -ever- seen in a game. It's just a shame that fighting them was either too easy or very boring. That's one of my few complaints with the game that keeps it from being 5 stars.The other complaints I have mostly have to do with the controls. If you have an older ps3 that can play ps2 games, I recommend getting Okami for that instead of the Wii version. It's not that the motion controls are bad, but they could definitely be better. Amaterasu has three weapon types she can attack with: reflectors, beads and swords. The beads are the easiest to fight with, since you can just swing the Wii remote all over the place and connect. But the sword requires you to hold the controller up, then move it down to swing after its been charged. I couldn't get this to work most of the time, and was stuck doing 2-3 hits instead of big combos like I wanted to. The reflector has to be swung in a certain rhythm, and takes practice. Would it have been that hard to make it a simple button press like on the ps2 version? Drawing certain things with the brush was a pain too. Can ANYONE get a 100% success rate when drawing the lightning bolt? The game shows you what to draw- a straight zig zag like a regular bolt of lightning. Well, to get it to work, you have to curve part of it, and even when you pull it off, it's not a very accurate attack most of the time. Aside from these, I wish the game had real voices instead of Animal Crossing gibberish, though I kind of liked it since it kept the tone of the game just right. But part of me feels it'd be more emotionally compelling with real voices. Some of the cutscenes get tiresome too, especially when characters state the obvious, after you just told them what the problem is. I wanted to skip a lot of these, but held on in case I missed something important. Finally, the credits and epilogue are missing in this version. Why???While it might seem like there are a lot of problems with the game, Okami has gorgeous art direction, a nearly flawless soundtrack (the only track I can't stand is the mini-game music), fun characters, a cool story, incredible enemy design, and is very fun to play. There were days when my daughter and I would just run around getting Praise or messing with animals, making them freak out just by making it rain. The game is never too difficult, and it's pretty hard to die even once. With how cheap it is now, I suggest just buying it and giving it a shot if you like adventure games, or if you're looking for something for your kids to play if they like story-driven games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2011"}

This may be the fastest paced game I have ever played. There are several cool maps, unique weapons, and tons of action. The single player mission isn't very hard. It seems to me that this was made just to teach how to play, but it was still very fun. The last match is incredibly tough. You also have instant action which places you on one of the maps against 4 or 5 computer players. It is fun, but not very hard.

I was taken back by the view of one of Halo's giant lakes from one of the alien buildings, truly stunning graphics. However, Halo is not perfect. There are problems with the 3D sound on my computer, sometimes the dialog fades in and out.I was tempted to give this game 3 stars, until I got to the part where I could drive the tank. Now that is fun! Finally, in a game where you have a few weapon choices and those few carry a paltry amount of ammo (The human assault rifle is the worst, it holds about 30 seconds worth of ammo, the alien &quot;needler&quot; takes about an entire clip to kill one enemy), I got to use something that had some real teeth. I was laughing out loud when I fired off that cannon into a group of baddies on a bridge and they literally flew into the air screaming, now that's firepower.Also, the frag grenades are great, especially indoors they pack a decent punch. Another star can be added due to the game's vehicles. The tank is the best but I also enjoyed driving the ATV and the alien flyers. The sniper rifle is always fun to use and is the most effective hand-held weapon in the game.Alot of people complain about the lack of the cooperative multiplayer option in this version.

{"product_name":"B000035Y6N","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"A SNES classic and a RPG masterpiece","reviewText":"Near the end of the SNES' cycle, Square released 2 games: Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI. Talk about being on a roll. Both are considered classics of not only RPG's but games in general as they're usually in the Top 10 of all time lists. What makes these 2 games stand out is that one was heavy on story but not so much on graphics while the other had a marginally interesting story but great graphics(for its time). This review is for Chrono Trigger(obviously).Story: Crono attends the Millenial Fair in Leene Square(1000 AD) and bumps into Marle. Both of them have fun while Crono's friend Lucca is preparing her latest invention. They discover it's a Star Trek style transporter. Crono tries and so far so good until Marle does and she disappears. Eventually through some time hopping they find out a beast known as Lavos brought destruction on the land in the year 1999. So Crono, Marle, Lucca and a number of friends have to save the world from its future destruction.Graphics: Back in the SNES days, these were cool. Unlike the sprite-y FF overhead graphics, these were quite detailed. Nowadays of course they're pitiful but we still love Tetris right? The world graphics look definately ugly, especially the characters. Also improved is the battle graphics, no longer do people make just one sword move, now they swipe, do a double slash, or do a special move.Sound/Music: Yasunori Mitsuda supplied the music and of course it's just as good as any soundtrack. Lively themes and great pieces are throughout the game. One thing you might find is that it's not immediately catchy but you end up loving the track as you're listening, then hum it later.Gameplay: It's like Attack/Magic/Item except Magic is part of a big group called Tech. Only 2 characters are not given a basic elemental(Crono has lightning, Lucca has fire etc) so someone like Marle can cast Ice style magic on her opponents. Also there's things called Tech attacks. One example is Crono's Cyclone where he can spin around which'll also nail any surrounding enemies. But then you can do a Double Tech so the same Cyclone but couple it with Lucca's fire will create Fire Whirl and there's many more such as coupling 2 Cure's to create a big refresher spell. There's even Triple Techs, highly damaging attacks.Unlike Final Fantasy's much-maligned random encounters, Trigger's enemies appear on screen and you can even slink by and avoid some fights although sometimes they're mandatory. One thing that helps with the game depending on how you go about it is the game never gets way too easy that you breeze through it. But then again it's not frustrating as hell. Usually the difference between a successful battle and being owned is a couple levels and some strategy. But the enemies/bosses are still gonna put up a fight.The only real place to play the game is to spend heavy money on Ebay or a luck out on a bargain bin or to buy the Chronicles release, or as a last resort using Roms and emulators. Either way, don't miss out on this awesome game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2006"}

Raillard","summary":"Like a kid in a candy store...","reviewText":"Crackdown is a euphoric, addictive rush that, unfortunately, doesn't last as long as you wish.  The premise is a Grand Theft Auto-style game set in the near future.  The originality of this game is what sets it apart from, and makes it in many ways better than, most GTA games and GTA clones.  This game is essentially a super-hero game, with the player controlling a genetically-enhanced crime fighter.  Remember how in GTA you would die the instant you touched water, or if you fell from a height of over 3 feet?  Well in Crackdown, you can jump OVER buildings, lift buses to hurl them anywhere you want, and you get better at everything simply by using your skill.  Remember the original Matrix movie?  This is what it feels like.  The more you shoot, the better shot you become, same with driving.Simply leveling up (a typical RPG element) works wonders in this game, meaning that simply jumping around the city beating up gang members is a blast.The GOOD: Non-linear missions.  No more fed-ex quests or escorting missions.  You are tasked to take out major crime bosses.  You can bump them off in any order you wish, and your actions have logical repercussions: take out the Russian mafia's gun supplier, and the grunts on the streets will have less lethal ordinance.  Awesome, addictive superhero play- jumping around a city has never been this much fun.  The graphics, reminiscent of \"A Scanner Darkly\" are awesome.  Just plain fun action all around.The BAD: Way too short.  Once you kill off all of the gangs... there's nothing to do.  You can run around the city, but with no baddies to fight, it gets old quick, since your character is all leveled-out by then.Bottom Line: Original, addictive and a blast to play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00020LZAM","description":"Jak 3concludes the Jak and Daxter trilogy with a truly plot-driven adventure game filled with friendship, betrayal, death, and a long-awaited understanding of the Precursor civilization that has, until now, remained a mystery.One year has passed since Jak and Daxter saved Haven City from Kor and the attacking Metal Heads, yet Haven City is still immersed in deadly chaos as three groups fight for control of the streets. The people of Haven City have grown to distrust Jak's dark powers, and as rumors boil of Jak's ties with Krew and Kor, the city blames Jak for its current woeful circumstances. When the palace is destroyed by a surprise Metal Head attack, even Ashelin cannot protect Jak as the High Council's power broker, Count Veger, forces Jak into banishment to the desolate Wasteland. Jak is flown to the harsh island and dumped. With Daxter and Pecker bravely by his side, the three begin their next adventure where the battle for the city has just begun.Five times the size of Haven City, the Wasteland is a desert environment with multiple areas including mines and a volcano. Given the enormity and variance in terrain, vehicles play a large role as off-road transportation is introduced, fueled by a true-to-life physics engine. With a rugged new look and suited with armor, Jak is also equipped with an arsenal of new weapons with upgradeable mods that enable players to increase their firepower and enjoy the freedom to strategize and activate their arsenal at any time.As Jak has been exposed to Light Eco, players can now experience Jak's magnificent transformation to Light Jak. With a glowing electric blue aura and a massive wing span, Light Jak introduces new move sets, including the ability to glide great distances, emit an energy to block enemy attack, and power up at anytime, all of which provide the player with a sense of being invincible. Dark Jak also returns with more capabilities, forcing Jak to find a balance between light and dark.Additionally, game developer Naughty Dog continues to push the genre forward with the introduction of new technology. For the first time in the franchise, enemies feature realistic ragdoll physics, which will allow gamers to witness a unique death for each enemy that is killed. Naughty Dog has also implemented independent cloth movement technology and enhanced the enemy artificial intelligence (AI) with wall climbing and smart formation capabilities.","reviewerName":"Veil_Lord","summary":"Worse Story Than Jak 2 But Better Game Play (Mostly)","reviewText":"If you've played games like Red Faction Guerrilla or Saint's Row 2 or Saint's Row The Third, you can picture this as the Pong of those style. It's an early attempt at a not quite linear game with lots of people and traffic on the street. It sort of works.You're exiled and have to survive the desert and then save the world. Still, the cut scenes are nice and they tossed in a little eye candy at times. The gameplay can sometimes be a bit tedious when you're driving in the cars.  They often tend not to control especially well, compared to flying vehicles, but the game is pretty good about checkpoints so even that's not extremely painful.However, the game has some significant problems. Aiming seems better than Jak 2, but still Jak often cannot lock onto the target you want to shoot making things much more frustrating than they need to be and wasting ammo. On the plus side I suppose, the enemies have equally bad targeting so at least that feels a little more fair. They've mostly fixed the problems where you'd be about to complete an objective and some random driver, literally driving in circles decides to plow into you and end it.  Civilians tend to get out of your way.Large portions of the game feel more like mini-game time trials (some literally are) than a cohesive game, but overall it's fun. You'll be set up to fail in a few of them, until you learn the patterns, but it's much kinder to you than the last game and you likely won't be wanting to put your controller through your screen.I mostly liked it and while it was easier it was also more fun and I could see myself playing it again. The only thing that tended to annoy me was the driving missions.  Not a bad game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2013"}

I'm HOOKED to the series. When this title was announced I was a bit dismayed to find out it continued the adventures of Ezio Auditore da Firenze. I personally felt that his story arc was over and done with, and that UBI should have moved to the next of Miles' assassin's ancestors.  I can understand why UBI would be quick to cash in on Ezio Auditore: he is an incredibly sympathetic character (compared to Altar Ibn La'Ahad,  a mangy dog would come off as more sympathetic) and the Italy of the Medicis proved to be an incredibly fun setting for a game.It just seemed to me that aside from the DLC which I have yet to play, the story of Ezio was over. So this title felt like shameless cashing in, I felt like it would be fluff.I then read that the greater story arc set in present day, detailing the struggle between the Assassin's and the Templars is somewhat progressed in this game,and there seems to be a twist at the end, so, begrudgingly, I bit and bought this game. So far, I am incredibly let down.Now, this game is the most polished of all Assassin's Creed. The gameplay has finally hit its stride. The swordfighting, I feel, has finally answered the various claims that it was dull and repetitious. By including a variety of enemies as well as new weapons, and the ability to call upon your underlings, not to mention that enemies now will not (always) wait around until you dispatch one of their own to take a hack at you, UBI has effectively replicated swashbuckling in all its glory, I feel. There's a lot less of the old \"jump exactly the opposite direction I intended Altar/Ezio to jump\" that plagued the first two titles. UBI also added a feature to allow you to hotkey any four weapons/actions to the dpad, which I thought added more guesswork to your preference, but it also adds the element of 'on-the-fly' that Assassin's Creed 2 sometimes lacked.  I do take issue with the horses in this game though. They kinda gallop at a lumbering pace. It could be said that it's because you're within Roma...well, what about on the outskirts? I dunno. One of my favorite things to do in the first two games was ride around, and get a sense of speed. Small issue, to be sure.The graphics are as lush as Assassin's Creed II. I can't fault it for being exactly the same as before, seeing as how Assassin's Creed II was a very beautiful game, and still quite recent.The soundtrack of the game is essentially the same, although I will say: there's a feature in the game that allows you to burn down watch towers to reclaim control of Roma in sections; whenever this happen, a dark, sinister theme would play. First few times it played, it was pretty cool. After the 5th or 6th time, it got old. Don't know why. The voice acting in this game is pretty uneven, in comparison to Assassin's Creed II. In ACII, the voice acting within the Animus was I would say top notch, if a bit comical at first. Outside the animus it was horrifyingly bad.  This time around, the voice acting within the animus is some of the worst I've seen this gen, whereas the voice acting for the present day Assassin's was better, I feel.As I've mentioned, this game introduces some new features, which I feel add to the gameplay in very refreshing ways. For one thing, you embark on rebuilding Roma, and reclaim it from the Borgia. You do this by capturing towers (sort of like the view points in the first two games), which normally entails killing a squad commander and then setting the tower on fire. Aside from the dark theme issue I already mentioned, this was probably my favorite addition to the gameplay.  As you recapture more and more sections of Roma, you are able to renovate quite a number of things in the city: You can renovate shops, such as blacksmiths, art vendors and tailors, just like in ACII. You can also renovate doctor stands this time around, as well as  well as stables, where you would be able to pick up a horse, and banks, where you can pick up your future deposits. You are also able to renovate entrances  to the underground catacombs, which are then used as 'fast-travel' hubs in the city, derelict buildings which you can use as headquarters for either of your three allied factions (courtesans, thieves and mercenaries),  and historical points of interest, such as the acueduct and the Colosseum.  All these renovations of course bolster your money-generating capacity; the more you renovate, the more you earn. This was done to bolster what was considered as a flimsy economy in ACII.  All it really does in my opinion is prolong the inevitable: that given enough grind, Ezio will have enough florins  to fund a crusade or cure the bubonic plague. I've yet to renovate absolutely everything, but I have not found myself in need of picking pockets.Another addition is the introduction of your assassin brethren. This is a great addition, but it gets old fast, and it actually becomes a crutch that the game, I feel, abuses.  You rescue rebellious romans from the clutches of Borgia's men, and induct them as acolytes of the Assassin's. These newbs you can level up two ways: by either calling them into battle, where they will aid you with their great, or lacking, prowess. You can also simply grind assassin contracts.  This is the safest way to level your assassins, and it's a great way to come by loads of cash, and special items. You simply select a mission, select up to five assassini to send, and voila, just wait until they report back to you (sort of like jobs in Final Fantasy Tactics) The more assassins you send on an assignment, the less exp each one gets. After some exp, they will go up a rank, up to the 10th rank, where they go through the rituals of becoming actual assassins. When you have enough assassins, at least six, you can call an 'arrow storm':  your assassins will dispatch every enemy in the vicinity with unseen crossbows. This is pretty cool, although it feels cheap, but the cooldown is a lengthy one, so that offsets the 'awesome cheapness'  effect.  Otherwise, you can call upon your assassins three times consecutively, in groups of two. Your assassins level pretty fast and once they reach the level cap, they're pretty much indestructable, as long as you make sure you don't send them on suicide missions (and the mission will tell you the probability of success before starting, so it's a sure thing). You can recruit as many as 12 assassins, so once you get closer to that maximum, the whole recruiting  new assassins is another grind. And, again, it's a great source of money and special items. These special items you can use to either sell them or as requirements for 'shop quests'- the vendors will often require special items to unlock certain special items, armor and weapons.  This was also a welcome and refreshing addition, albeit, a bit difficult to complete thus far.The biggest draw I would say is the multiplayer. There are no words to describe how FUN the MP is. I would say the experience is comparable to when Modern Warfare came out. It just blows you out of the water. I played one mode so far, Wanted. You basically have to find and execute your target, and you rack up points for the finesse with which you accomplish this.  Of course, the twist is, you are also the hunted. I had my concerns of how a game where everyone is trying to stab everyone else in the back would work. The answer is, beautifully. You basically have to become an expert in subterfuge, and learn how to blend in,  and not act erratically so as not to stand out. This is harder than it sounds. It's incredibly addicting, and nerve wracking. I would say the MP is the games shiniest prospect.Which brings me to why  I'm not giving this game full marks.  First off, the story, so far, is INCREDIBLY weak. Aside fromt he political intrigue and tidbits of what seems like true speculative Renaissance history, the story itself lacks SO MUCH of what the first two games had, that I feel I'm basically plodding through  to the end, so I can call it good and wait for ACIII. You attempt to retake Roma from the Borgia and his demented children. Ok. Um. And what does this mean for the greater arc of the game? With such a huge revelation at the end of ACII, why is this even relevant? Well, the game takes the time to explain why they are revisiting Ezio's past, but the reasons are so flimsy, it just screams ka-ching.  So you go around eliminating personages of some importance to the Pope, and you uncover yet another plot of intrigue. It just doesn't feel cohesive though. Another set of missions have you working for Leonardo DaVinci, who asks you to destroy his inventions, comissioned by the Pope under pain of death; these missions, I feel, made at least some sense of WHY you were doing what you were doing. There was also a subplot of a secret sect, the Followers of Romulus, who don wolf-skins and live as wolves ( a far cry of the Cynics?  I don't think UBI would have made that allusion intentionally) which feels, in all earnest, a bit disjointed from the rest of the storyline.Finally, my biggest issue with the game is the mission mechanics. First off, this game is a direct continuation of ACII, and I would dare say it would be extremely difficult for a newcomer to simply pick up and play ACBR without any issues.  The gameplay, and controls, are largely the same, and that's good, I feel.  They did however set to make more varied missions, as this was one of the bigger complaints of AC and in a lesser way, of ACII. The result however, is a string of escort missions, of missions with obscure directives (Such as, kill the guards up ahead, but don't stray too far, but don't let the guards get too close, but don't let anyone see you kill the guards...in fact, just use your assassins, but again, don't get too close....) or missions with exacting auto-fails (you were seen? Fail. You stumbled? Fail. You fought? Fail) In the beginning, the game gives you a bonus (full synchronization) if you fulfill the mission within certain parameters, but later in the game, you fail a mission for reasons which oftentimes remained a mistery: I've had to fail missions repeatedly to find out WHY I was failing in the first place. Basically, the game does a lousy job of telling you what to do.  And this is a departure, for the worse in my opinion, of the formula of the first two games. The first two games would allow you to accomplish missions in whichever way, some of which were incredibly graceless and brutish.  This time around, you are left to divinate the ONE way to complete a mission.I really hope that ACIII, whenever it comes out, does not take the exact same approach.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J82G","description":"","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Weak Single Player, Okay MP","reviewText":"Battlefield follows a very Call of Duty pattern, swapping between Russian and American forces as various groups of soldiers attempt to avert a terrorist nuclear strike.The story is weak, which was a significant let down for me. The main villian has so little involvement, that when you finally see him, you expect him to offer you a grande no whip cappucino rather than be a threat. And theres no motivation thats every explored, so the whole story links together on the thought that some guy somewhere woke up one day and decided that it was a fine day to orchestrate a nuclear event.If you like looking down gunsights, you're already willing to buy this just for the new multiplayer experience, and thats fine. But for a fan of Spec Ops: the Line, which really tries to make the experience more emotional and visceral, you'll be grossly disappointed. You feel as connected to the characters in this as you would to sock puppets. Theres lots of POV moments that're entertaining and even startling, but even when &#34;you&#34; are being executed, you don't feel any regret or remorse or loss. Thats pretty sad considering. Even the emotional scenes aren't very emotional since there's no real connection to the other characters, and you're swapped back and forth between them like so many shoes you can't ever develop that connection.Gameplay is decent, with some critical flaws. Some cover is destructible and impressively so, and so is made of Indestructanium, particularly railings and some windows. Grenades can't be thrown back, and some gameplay is hammered into you so hard that you will die a fwe times the first time you switch just from switching from soldier mode to tank mode.Multiplayer is a bit unforgiving, but can be broken into. Even running up against people with hours of experience on you you should be able to fumble your way to level 2 within one or two games, and from there its more learning the layout and cover.Overall, an okay rent, but so lacking in story and emotion despite their attempts to make it emotional that I just couldn't get it. I kept waiting for the story to cream together but it just sort of slides apart near the end.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2014"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J9M0","description":"","reviewerName":"Corey Turner \"The Musician\"","summary":"When Life Gives You Lemons","reviewText":"Portal 2 is a puzzle based game borrowing elements from first person shooters and incorporates an engrossing plot split into two modes (campaign and co-op). Produced by Valve Portal 2 is the successor to the well received original that appeared on 2007's Valve compilation `The Orange Box'. Portal 2 involves a test subject (Chell) in a futuristic `testing' facility trying to once again escape. Your character never speaks and it's made pretty clear within the first few minutes that is intentional, and makes for some clever humor. The story still develops nicely as characters will continue speaking to you .  Portal 2 has the natural gift to make the entire run through either mode hilarious, just when you think you've figured all that's to be said you find a new style of humor!How much time has passed between the original and the current events isn't exact, but it's clearly a distant future. Test rooms resent the sterile white coats as green fixtures of mold begin to stain. The floors pucker marks have filled in with dirt, mechanics tweaking unable to correct their course. Graphically one could say Portal 2 portrays what it`s trying to depict. The palette for the lighting is believable, very believable. Speaking of believability, Portal 2 expands the world of Aperture Science (the facility) in such a way you'd feel it's from a bizarre mirrored world. Aperture Science has gifted you with one of their safer and more effective devices, the portal gun! With this device your concept of reality might shift a bit.The portal gun, also known as the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, is the main focus for solving puzzles, it can fire two separate portals (colored rims indicate which is which), simply walking through one instantly brings you to the others location. Simple enough...right? You can traverse the facility with a sense of ease when comparing the stories of other test subjects with ill suited gear, as you've even got an impact lessening pair of boots for those tricky high up drops (Portal one players `long fall boots' serve the same function as the advanced knee replacement). The game is a full of puzzles and after all just shooting portals to get from point A to point B wouldn't be very challenging. So if the first chambers seem a bit easy, no worries they serve as tutorials. Also not all surfaces are capable of opening a portal, this is where you have to improvise. You will need to understand how to use the most of what you're given, whether that be to combine the effects of newly added gels (enabling sprint, jumps, make portal ready surfaces), reflect lasers or toggle button between portals. Also note, turrets sound nice, but they are ferociously deceptive.Portal 2 is the game gamers deserve, a witty funny interesting atmospheric world ready for co-op or immersible solo runs. It can even restore a youthful aspect of interaction, figuring what goes where or how to chain together something silly, but most importantly something fun.  Mechanized as the games universe may be it truly pushes  fourth the notion you went down the rabbit hole and have become part of it all. At times the game even takes on atmospheric and audible cues that resemble 2007's \"Bioshock\", thus making one forget its link to the `Half-Life Universe'.Portal 2 keeps renewing itself from becoming stale as did `Half-Life 2' by simply knowing moderation. Portal 2 breaks up the puzzle solving with the occasional advent leading into deeper older parts of the facility. Half-Life 2 did the reverse and added puzzles once in a while to keep players from dealing with fatigue due to shooting things constantly. Both titles come from the again have the same lineage involving Valve but two different blood lines, the concept of Portal dates back to 2005 with the title `Narbacluar Drop', which was said to of impressed Valve enough to hire the creators.The multiplayer is a worthy addition, and may show who is the problem solver out of your group. Neat little interactions are possible between players, and a separate story makes up for campaign completion blues. Each player takes on the role of a robot (which is said to also help players get around the idea or `respawning') P-body and ATLAST.  They will eventually obtain, rather early on I might add, the ability to fire two portals each. Instead of each having blue and orange portals one player will have orange and red while the other has blue and dark blue. Players can also mark objects for their partner to find, very useful. Oddly enough the robots in this game all have unique character blends, if you play the game you will understand more on as to why due to the concept of `personality cores'.The audio is dynamic and interesting, though often times minimalistic and driven by ambiance. The voice overs are incredible! The first character you meet (Wheatley) is an absolute riot, from his failed attempts at problem solving to his constant phobias. By dynamics I don't just mean alterations in volume, I mean things you do affect the music being played. Variations on themes can occur upon doing specific tasks, you can tell when one of these segments occur if you ever stop and listen to the change. Whether you run through propulsion gel or launch off a `faith plate' you may hear additional glitch electronics.Portal 2 can vary in length depending on how long it takes you to complete puzzles in general. What some might find easy you may not vice-versa. None the less it is enjoyable and endurable so long as you have an open mind and `think with portals'. Portal 2 easily gets a five star rating from me, but it may not be for everyone. This game might better suit a rental for those looking to play some quick co-op as the communities initial boom might subside. The single player is great but again might better suit a rental as some might feel knowing how puzzles work wont be too fun a second time through. If you're like me and like puzzles and exploration, enjoy reliving a scene, and occasionally like to play with a friend then it's settled, Portal 2 is for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2011"}

Said alien escapes, and there follows much running and screaming in steam filled corridors.  However, this game sets itself apart from its long lineage with a truly immersive survival-horror experience.  Depending on how you look at it this game is best played on your own with the lights off and the sound up.  For better or for worse this game scared my panties off.You can play as three different species, each with its own weapons and characteristics and all with an intertwining plot.  Choose the alien, and you'll be running up vertical surfaces and biting people in the face.  With the predator you'll get to play with lots of shiny gadgets like heat-vision (yeah, like in the movies) and various stabby/choppy weapons for taking off heads (literally).  And, as the poor weedy human marine, its back to 3d shooter basics with pistol, shotgun, fast-but-weak machine guns and lots of sweat.Its the marine single player game that really shines, as you creep around lots of 'abandoned' military installations, movement tracker bleeping.  If you've watched the movies you'll know its only ever a matter of time before something with big teeth and an attitude problem jumps out of the ceiling at you, and man, does this game deliver.  Expect to jump frequently, firing blindly into the darkness at the very scarily accurate alien hordes.  Sometimes there will be as many as six or seven of the critters bearing down on you, and the crisp graphics really excel in bringing the movies to life.As far as the Alien and Predator games go the tension is somewhat diminished since, after all, you're the monster now.  Its initially very amusing to watch the AI controlled civilians quake and scream at your approach, and there's lots to be said for the Alien's acrobatic talents...you can leap huge distances, and explore airducts and sewer systems with ease.However, you'll probably find that sooner or later the Alien and Predator missions get fairly samey.  Still, there's lots of great graphical effects on show, with great smoke and lighting throughout all the missions.  Again, the sound is excellent, with distant screams and scuttling behind walls bringing everything to terrifying life.The online multiplayer game is also very well balanced, and features a nice variety of playing levels and game modes, with more downloadable from the official site.  In the long term this is where the game stands out, since beyond the marine missions the single player is really a one-off affair.Overall this is a good solid game, with some stand out moments in the single player, and lasting appeal in the multiplayer.  It is both violent and gory, so the sqeamish should probably shop elsewhere, and for obvious reasons if you didn't like the films this is probably a poor choice.  But, for both film and horror shooter fans alike Alien vs Predator 2 is a game to sink all four sets of teeth into.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2003"}

I absolutely loved Gears 1-3.  The story, action, graphics - everything was fantastic.  So, when I heard that a fourth installment in the series was coming, I was pretty excited about it.  I picked it up the day it was released and started playing.  Well, about 5 or so hours later, the credits were rolling.  Really?  I felt very cheated for having paid $60.00 for what should've been DLC for about $19.99.  The story is kind of lame, the chacters are not very well developed, the action is underwhelming...there is just nothing special about the game at all.  The campaign is very choppy and segmented.  You earn \"stars\" that serve as nothing more than a way to unlock another small portion of the game.  After that, they are pointless.  The game looks great and the controls are what you'd expect from a GOW game.  The voice acting is good.  I guess there just isn't really much I can say about this game other than it is more of an \"add-on\" package to the original series that serves as a mini prequel to the first Gears game.  If you pay $60, $50, $40 or even $30 for this game, you'll end up feeling ripped off.  Not that it's a terrible game.  It's just that it doesn't have much substance and it's very short.  And if you're like me, and hold the GOW series in high regard, you'll find yourself rather disappointed with this game.  Taking into consideration how high the bar was set from the first three installments, this one fails.  GOW: Judgement couldn't carry any of the first 3 GOW games' jocks.  If you really love the series and must have this game, wait until the price point is around $20.00.  Perhaps then you won't feel so cheated.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXNHO","description":"","reviewerName":"Jack Pacini \"MasterMage\"","summary":"From an Xbox user since 2007","reviewText":"I thought I would write up this review and cover some of the things I feel others have left out of their reviews of the PS3.First thing, PS Home. It's a full-on virtual world for you and your friends to mingle, play FREE games within PS Home, customize your house (which if I had this nice of an apartment with this awesome of a view in real life I would be one very happy camper), customize your avatar (which is 100x more realistic than your cartoony Xbox avatar), among other cool things I'm sure, all for FREE. My only complaint with PS Home is the pricing of some of the avatar and apartment extras, but this is a complaint on Xbox too. I mean this is digital clothes and furniture we are talking about here, not physical! I shouldn't have to pay a real dollar for a digital shirt for my digital avatar. I guess they have to make money on something though.Second, PS+. Sure you can play online with your friends free (which is a major plus for PS3). So why pay for PS+? I'll tell you why. The wealth of freebies! Already in my 30 day PS+ trial I have downloaded; 3 PSone games (Syphon Filter 1-3), 4 Minis (sort of like small XBLA games), also both PSone games & Minis can be played on PS3 and PSP. Saving the best for last, Back to the Future: The Game Episodes 1-5 (which is a PS3 exclusive, and was a big disappointment for me when it came out and I didn't have a PS3 yet, as I am a huge BTTF fan). All for FREE! What I'm not 100% sure about is whether you can still play these games if you cancel the PS+ subscription, but if Sony keeps it coming with the freebies, it more than justifies the cost of PS+.Third, DC Universe Online. It's FREE! Free to download & free to play! I'm currently downloading it, clocking in at around 15GB, and with my slowish DSL it is gonna take about 5 forevers, but I have no doubt it will be worth the wait time. I will say this though, I'm not 100% sure if it currently being free for me is due to the PS+ subscription or not, but if you need PS+ to play it, it's still cheaper than most pay-to-play MMOs.When you buy a new PS3 these days, you are given just a wealth of extras. I am highly impressed! I haven't even hardly cracked into the Uncharted series, which is the reason I bought a PS3 in the first place. Sony has won me over, and while Xbox Live has impressed me over the years, PS+ definitely gives you more bang for your buck.Will I get rid of my 360 now? Not a chance! Most multiplats work/look better on 360. Besides, I have WAAAY too many 360 games that I love. I have always been a multi-console kind of guy anyway, and now my current generation family is complete, and this newest family member brought gifts with it! Hooray! My PS3 looks quite dashing next to my Xbox 360 & Wii...So in closing if you don't have a PS3 yet. What are you waiting for? Go for it! You will not be disappointed!EDIT: The freebies from PS+ do expire with your PS+ service, but you can play them as long as you are a PS+ subscriber. They also renew when you renew, so if you let your PS+ membership run out, you can always get your games back once you sign back up. Now going on 2 months of PS+ service I have well over 20 games from the service that didn't cost me an extra penny, so $50 a year is well worth it in my opinion. PS+ is also shaping up to be a way better value to me than XBL Gold, I have never received any free games from Xbox in my 5 years of being a XBL Gold subscriber.As for DC Universe Online, it's free-to-play whether you have PS+ or not, so it's a decent alternative to all the pay-to-play MMOs out there. Sure WoW might be a tad more fun, but seriously who wants to pay $10 a month just to play 1 game. Unless you have unlimited time to play games you are simply wasting money with pay-to-play games.So there you have it. You are getting a lot of bang for your buck with PS3, so what are you waiting for? I noticed the price on this bundle is going up, which means they probably aren't making this particular bundle anymore. Although I'm sure there is another similar bundle out there.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2012"}

To advance the story, you get quests from characters, complete them, and get rewarded.  The quests range from driving to the gas station, filling some gas cans, and bringing them back, to heading into a dangerous area and exterminating the zombies, to locating missing survivors.  As you kill zombies and complete quests, you gain XP.  When you get enough points, you go up in level and are awarded more HP and 1 Skill Point.  Each character has 3 skill trees and you use your Skill Points to unlock new abilities and stat bonuses.Story:  7/10On a resort, you wake up after a drunken night of partying to find out that the zombie apocalypse happened.  For some reason, you are immune to the virus, so a simple zombie bite won't kill you.  This makes you incredibly valuable to the bands of survivors and they'll reward you if you help them.  You and the other survivors band together to battle the hordes of undead and get off the island.World:  8/10The world is pretty huge.  Luckily, Dead Island has sprinting, vehicles, and fast travel, where you can teleport from safe house to safe house.  There are packs of zombies every 50 meters or so and there's loot everywhere.  The loot also replenishes itself over time.  So, if you go to an area, loot 10 boxes worth of stuff, and come back later, you can do it again.  The pacing of the game feels a lot like Borderlands.  Fight, Loot, Fight, Loot, Fight, Loot, repeat.  It does get a little tedious towards the end because there isn't much variation with the enemies and the enemies level up with you.  When you are level 17, every enemy and weapon in the world is close to level 17.Combat:  7/10Dead Island has interesting combat.  Every zombie in the game is dangerous.  This isn't the type of game where you can mow down 50 zombies without getting a scratch.  For the first 60% of the game, you're going to be armed with a melee weapon like a cleaver, hammer, machete, axe, oar...  And you're going to swing it a lot.  It starts to feel like you're smashing open 10,000 zombie pi&ntilde;atas.Both you and the zombies have a health bar and a stamina bar.  If anyone's health reaches zero, they're dead.  When you die, you lose 10% of your cash and respawn about 10 seconds later in the same area.  If a human or zombie's stamina reaches zero, they cannot attack and if they are hit, they get knocked to the ground.  Running, Jumping, Kicking, attacking all reduce your stamina.  And swinging heavy objects like a sledgehammer reduce your stamina more.  If you don't do anything that requires stamina (running, jumping, attacking) it will quickly refill after a few seconds.  (Kind of like the Shields in Halo)The stamina bar really forces players to make meaningful decisions.  If you're wounded and five zombies come running at you, you may want to run.  But if you use up all of your stamina running, and the zombies catch you, you won't be able to fight them off.  If you can't get to safety, your best bet is to find a defensible position like a doorway or hallway and fight them off.The weapons you find have 4 stats.  Damage, Force, Handling, and Durability.Damage:  How much damage it does to the enemy's healthForce:  This is how much damage it does to the enemy's stamina and weapons with a lot of force will cripple or dismember enemy limbs.  An axe can lop off an arm, and a hammer can break bones.  A zombie with two broken arms can't swipe at you, but it can still bite at very close range.Handling:  The easier a weapon is to handle, the less stamina it takes to wield it.  So you can slash with a knife about 40 times, but you can only swing a giant hammer about 6 times before you tire out.Durablity:  This defines how many times you can use the weapon before it breaks.  Each hit drains some of the weapon's condition and when it's low, the weapon becomes less effective.The world is full of weapons and like other action RPG's some are much more powerful than others.  Every weapon can be upgraded 4 times, giving stat boosts.Dead Island also features a crafting system where you can modify your weapons.  Attach a battery to a blade and it can shock enemies.  Wrap barbed wire around a baseball bat and you'll cause bleeding damage.  The world is full of items and they're pretty easy to get.  The amount of items in your inventory is capped.  (So, you can't carry 5000 batteries)  You can only carry a few of each item, so if you do use duct tape, wires, a battery, and lighter fluid and use them to modify a weapon, you'll have to explore to find more.There is no blocking in the game.  You can only leap to the side to evade.  If a zombie charges you, you can also try to kick it to knock it off balance, then deliver a deadly blow with one of your weapons.You can carry 8 weapons at a time, and select them by holding RB and using the analog stick to highlight one of them.There are also firearms in the game.  Pistols, Shotguns, Machine Guns, Grenades, Molotov Cocktails...  But these are rare and ammo is scarce.Co-op:  9/10The Co-op is seamless!  If another player is playing their game and they are about the same level as you around the same area, you can see them in your game.  With the push of a button, you can link up and play Cooperatively.  Up to 4 players can join.This is a pretty hard game, but when another player joins, the zombies don't get any tougher.  So, playing with friends... or strangers... makes the game much easier.  You can also trade items with other players, too.You can drop out at any time as well and go back to your single player game without losing anything.If you just want to play by yourself, you can set the Game Mode to Private in your Options Screen.Loot:  8/10The game world is full of loot!  Instead of treasure chests, there are crates and luggage all over the place.  You'll find cash, crafting items, and the occasional weapon.  All of these things are useful.  And you can sell them back to vendors for extra cash.Your cash in the game is used to buy items and weapons.  It's mainly used to upkeep, modify, and improve your weapons.Level Up:  6/10When you level up in the game, you get more Health and you get a Skill Point.  There are 4 Playable Characters each with their own set of three unique Skill Trees.  Most of the skills are damage boosts or damage type increases, but they're all helpful.  You might unlock a stomp attack, +10% stamina, +2% critical strike with sharp weapons, etc.Graphics:  7/10There are loads of zombies on a tropical island.  The game doesn't look bad, but it doesn't look quite right.  The scenery and characters look a bit rubbery.Sound:  6/10The voice acting is average.  The sound effects are pretty good.  The music is a bit depressing, but sets up the gloomy atmosphere.Replay Value:  6/10It takes about 25-60 hours to finish this game, depending on how many side quests you do and how much you explore.  After you finish the story, you can start over with the same character and keep your stats, or you can play as one of the other three characters.  They are all a bit similar because you can only do so much with \"survivor with hammer\" rather than fighter, mage, rogue, ranger, cleric, etc...  And after smacking zombies in the face with hammers for 50 hours, you feel done.Maturity:  Very MThis is a gory violent game with adult themes and a dark story.Overall:  7.5/10If you want the gameplay of a typical medieval RPG, but with zombies, and the kill, loot, kill, loot, pacing of Borderlands, then this is your game.  The combat is interesting, the loot tables are rewarding, and the skill trees are meaningful.  The main problem is:You can only hit zombies in the face with a hammer for so many hours before it starts to feel repetitive.  This is a good game, but it lacks the variety of a medieval RPG with different character types, deep lore, and a menagerie of monsters.Buy it if you like the idea of a Borderlands with predominantly melee weapons.Buy it if you can't get enough of hitting zombies in the face with hammers.Buy it if you like seamless Co-op play.Rent it if you have about 30-50 hours.Avoid it if you like variety or high fantasy in your RPG's.Avoid it if you don't like dark games.Avoid it if you don't like games where the world levels up with you.If you enjoyed this game, you'll like Borderlands; there's much more variety and loads of guns.  If you want to kill zombies with friends, Left 4 Dead 2 or Dead Space 2 are good.  If you want to slay things with swords in an open ended world, be sure to check out Oblivion, Skyrim, or Dragon's Dogma.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2012"}

If not, you might want to give it a try.  \"Kirby\" games may look simple and cutesy (and they are), but at the same time, they are a lot of fun.  The main character, Kirby, can inhale his enemies and eat them for copy abilities.  There are many different abilities, such as sword Kirby, wing Kirby, and fighter Kirby.  This is one thing that makes the games fun.  There is a wide variety of things Kirby can do, depending on what ability he has.Story-wise, Kirby and his friends are helping Magolor fix his damaged ship, which lost five pieces and 120 energy spheres.  You find pieces of the ship when you beat boss battles, and you find energy spheres scattered throughout the levels.  Collecting energy spheres opens doors on the ship.  These doors lead to copy abilities, mini games, and challenges where you try and get as many points using a certain ability as you can while reaching the goal on time.  It is fairly easy to collect all of the energy spheres, but they can take a bit of thinking in order to get them.The series hasn't changed much since the older games.  A lot of abilities from the old games return in this game, and a lot of enemies return, as well.  Like always, the game is a side-scroller and is played with the control pad.  Unlike other games, it can be played cooperatively with others, and other players can play as King Dedede, Meta Knight, and Waddle Dee.\"Kirby\" games aren't for everyone, but if you don't mind a game that is cute and simple, but a lot of fun, then you may want to check this game out.  Keep in mind that it is not very long, and it is pretty easy.  I beat it in just under two weeks.  While \"Kirby\" games are simple, though, they do sometimes have a twist at the end....

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. Get ready to jump out of your couch cushions!--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessGreat cooperative modePlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multi-player options","reviewerName":"J. Gardner","summary":"Great graphics but lousy gameplay.","reviewText":"The graphics for Doom are the best anywhere right now (assuming you have the flashlight turned on so you can see them).  Most of the time the game is pitch black so you demons can jump out at you.  Initially the demons were frightening, then the simple A.I. became boring, then it became anoying.  The enemy is very predictable except for some of the scripted events.The flashlight was annoying because it could not be used along with weapons.  You have to lower your weapon everytime you use it. (Mods are available to fix this, but the game seems to be centered on leaving you in almost pitch black to make it frightening. Without the default flashlight set up the suprises are minimal.)I quickly found the gameplay becoming boring because it is very similar to the original Doom.  Personally I prefer more tactics in my gameplay.  Halo 2 and Half-Live 2 look better, but I look forward to the Doom engine being used on future games with better gameplay and A.I.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2004"}

The game world is so lively and inviting, and there is a ridiculous amount of fun stuff to do (with or without a purpose).  It's hard to put down, whether I'm doing important story-advancing stuff, searching for secrets, or just screwing around.Initially I was turned off by the $50 price tag for a re-release.

{"product_name":"B001CWXAP2","description":"","reviewerName":"General Pete","summary":"More like work then fun","reviewText":"First off I have to apologize I generally don't play MMORPG so that part of my final impression is my fault and I will cop to them upfront.  Also the review will be comparatively brief I was really enthusiastic about this game when it first game out but after closing my account and trying to articulate feelings I find I cannot summon any feelings at all regarding this game positive or negative ever had a feeling of one big \"meh?\" sort of like that.The positives that I will mention has to be the characterization particularly that of M1 4X, the voice acting and the population of the server which tended to be infinitely more polite then a similar group on WOW server.I should have listened to others from the forums and played an Imperial Character and if you are looking on getting started in the game I would advise you to go that way the storyline is generally more interesting I don't know about you good people but I would rather play a \"bad\" character who uses more benevolent means to achieve his ends then some stupid goody two shoes who \"had\" to be good all the time which is what I got playing a Republic character to 40.  Also playing an Imperial character the population on the server is going to be higher giving you more ability to participate in Flashpoints and Group quest actions.  As a Republic trooper I stood around for two hours at a time trying to get one of the other 30 people on Couresent to go on a two man quest with me.The last two things that I will mention are just misconceptions that I had going into the game that colored it for me1.  It never broke the established pattern of MMORGs which is go here and kill and kill X amount of Y sometimes there is a variation like get the data pack or flip the switch.  Given my experience with WOW all those years ago I wasn't really expecting anything different but I had hopes of some variation2.  Now you're going to laugh at me but one of the determining factors of me buying this game was with the knowledge that there would be Space Combat.  At worst I was expecting some setup similar to Starwars Battlefront 2 I knew it was to much hope for something real fun like X-Wing vs Tie Fighter.  Basically there is no Space Combat it might as well be a pinball game.Overall-So what you have hear is a very basic WOW clone it wasn't my thing but I can't make a determination on your opinions.  The story is decent enough and the companions at their best are fun just remember that once you hit max level there isn't really anything to do.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2012"}

It has not let me down.  I'm a fan of 3rd person (or over-the-shoulder) action games like this one and it offers a lot of variety.  You get weapons, cool upgrades to those weapons, enjoyable quests and side quests, amazing environments, and even good dialogue (which includes a lot of swearing!).  The game play itself is adaptive in the sense that if you play through an area one way and die somewhere along the route, then replay it a bit differently, you'll find things that played one way prior have changed a bit.  For instance, take too long killing a baddie and he might call out 4 more to help him shoot you dead, but if you kill him quickly enough no additional enemies show up.  I'd recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of the originals, anyone who enjoyed the Uncharted games, or anyone who liked the Batman: Arkham series.  The play is very similar.The controls are easy to learn.The game is LENGTHY!  I really feel like I got my money out of this game.It's not too hard, but not terribly easy either and if you find yourself stuck somewhere Lara herself often helps out.There are a multitude of ways to kill the bad guys and that's a big perk when it comes to variety in game play.It does have a few small things wrong with movement like if you hit a sloped or slanted wall just right you sometimes slide all the way down in a peculiar stance or sometimes you see that classic character/object \"meld\" where your hand or knee or face merges with the object in front or behind or beside you.  There are also moments where the camera angle is wonky where you might find your view totally obstructed by a leaf on a tree or something of that nature however this is easily remedied by moving just a big and adjusting the camera angle.  These minor issues were few and far between for me and they don't bring my overall love of this game down any.If you were to ask me if you should buy it, I'd say yes.

Ubi Soft's Beyond Good and Evil is one of those rare games that does so many things right it's hard to imagine why more people aren't playing it.The main character, Jade, is a freelance reporter on a planet named Hyllis. It's a bit of an odd world, with unusual life forms such as talking pigs, cat people, and walrus like men. Hyllis is under attack by an alien race called the DomZ. The para-military units known as the Alpha Sections are defending Hyllis from the attacking aliens. But all is not what it seems. People are disappering from Hyllis. And the Alpha Sections are suspected of collaborating with the DomZ. Jade, our heroine, is recruited by the underground IRIS Network to uncover the conspiracy.The games graphics are outstanding. Hyllis is a huge, living breathing world complete with wild life, oceans, and even a moon. Water effects are rendered extrememly well, especially since Hyllis is mostly a water world. The game is also presented in widescreen through it's entirety. This makes it possible for seemless transitions from the action to cutscenes. This is really a nice looking game in all areas.Alot of people have mischaracterized this game as a \"platformer\". This game is actually an adventure with quite a bit of stealth elements included. Some of the stealth elements are very reminscent of games such as Metal Gear Solid, Tenchu and Splinter Cell. The action varys quite a bit from stealth to martial arts action. There's even a mini-game thrown in for good measure. Though stealth plays a big part of this game, it doesn't seem tedious. There is also a unique power up system. Throughout Hyllis there are vending machines where you purchase meal packs called K-Bups and Starkos. Other items can also be purchased from these machines. One of the more interesting features is that throughout the game you get updates in the form of Emails from the IRIS Network, and you can subscribe to publications that can be emailed to you.The controls take some getting used to. The learning curve is about thirty minutes. But once the controls are down the game flows very nicely.Unfortunatley there's not alot of replay value here. Once you complete the game there's not much reason to go back and play it again. That's the one criticism you can lay on it.This game is great buy for the new reduced price. In an age where the gaming world is flooded with sequel after sequel, it's great to see a new origial game that really gives you something different for your time and money.

Created by award-winning producer Koji Igarashi and the creative team behind the critically acclaimed Castlevania - Aria of Sorrow","reviewerName":"Christopher Barrett \"Evil Corgi\"","summary":"This made a long time Castlevania fan very happy!","reviewText":"I remember playing the original Castlevania when I was younger (around age 10 or 11), and I always remember how punishingly difficult the game seemed.  Years later I played the game on an emulator and was surprised that it was still pretty punishingly difficult.  But the old Castlevania games (1 - 4) really upped the challenge with ledges and pits that if you fell off you died.  Occasionally there would be a touch enemy or tough boss, but really the pain was in timing jumps and such.  Especially with flying Medusa heads coming at you!So the latest Castlevania games have a different style of play and difficulty.  Instead of the finite lives and continues (as in 1, 3, and 4), the games have a save feature.  You grow your character by gathering experience slaying demons.  Since there are very few 'bottomless pits' to die in (or none at all!), the challenge is focused on battling demons and bosses.So the challenge is not as high as previous games, but not as frustrating as those earlier versions.Now onto this game!  I played this for the first time recently, after completing Order of Ecclesia, and after playing a bit of Portrait of Ruin.  I didn't play the previous Game Boy Advance titles.  But comparing this to the other 2-d Castlevania titles, I would place this in the top three.I still rate Symphony of the Night and Order of Ecclesia higher, but Dawn of Sorrow could make a case for being ranked in the top, though the amazing glyph system of Ecclesia pretty much locks it in at #1 in my opinion.In this version you have a very good story, with some interesting characters.  The story continues from the previous game (which I didn't play), but they do a pretty good job of summing up the events of the previous game.Most of the game is spent trying to just 'beat the game'.  As opposed to Ecclesia with all of the various side quests, most of the time in this game will be spent advancing farther into Dracula's Castle while backtracking to gather the occasional item that was previously unattainable without a new ability.  You might also backtrack to fight demons to gain souls.And that takes me to the point here.  If I hadn't played Ecclesia first, I would have been very pleased with the soul gathering aspect.  You gather souls to learn abilities, the more of each soul, the higher the level of the ability.  You can also use souls to upgrade weapons in town.  Though the upgrades are basically the next stronger item, which is usually available for purchase at the weapon shop next door, though at a steep price.  Some of the abilities take MP, like bone toss or using Lightning, and others are static abilities.  It's pretty fun to customize Soma, and you eventually find an item to allow you to set his abilities and equipment into two slots and quick change them with the X button.  But again, Ecclesia's glyph system was near flawless, so I can't really say I love the soul system.  (You can read my Ecclesia review for more info).The challenge is decent, though not as tough as Ecclesia.  The reason is that most boss battles are pretty easy to figure out.  And often the boss will hesitate and allow you to just start ripping multiple hits on them.  Later bosses get more challenging of course, but the early bosses in Ecclesia were as tough as some of the middle bosses in this game.  I remember dying three times fighting Malphas (bird lady), twice fighting Dario, and once fighting Balore (big fist guy early on).  But that's nothing compared to dying 10 times trying to figure out the first boss in Ecclesia!Pros:+ Very large area to explore.+ Wide variety of weapons and armor.+ Great music and sound effects.+ Decent challenge.+ Very good DS graphics.Cons:- Soul system good, but not perfect.- 99% of the game is in one of two areas, no wilderness areas (like Ecclesia).- Only two quick set options for abilities (could have used a third).- Not a lot of hidden items/chests.- Having to use the stylus to 'seal' boss monsters.  It's pretty lame...The reason I compare this to Ecclesia is because many other players might be looking to buy one of these two games, since they are both on the DS, and both very well made.  I recommend playing through this one first, just because going back to this game after Ecclesia is bittersweet.

I've always loved the movie action hero or video game hero who has the witty humor and smart mouth when faced with danger and Nathan Drake has become part of that iconic group reaching in heights of the likes of Indiana Jones,  other than Metal Gear Solid 4 this was one of the few games that finally pushed me into getting my PS3 and as you play through the levels in a attempt to thwart the bad guys Drake does it with style.  The other thing you got to love about the games are the great characters in it like Victor Solomon Drakes best friend and partner with his daring adventures,  Elena Fisher a young female reporter who can hold her own in a dire situation and is Drake's love even though both try an deny this,  Chloe Frazer another female adventurer from Drakes past as well as romantic connection between them both in the past,  Harry Flynn a rogue who has a past with Drake and Chloe but only has his own interest at heart,  and the bad guy of the game Zoran Lazarevic  who is the one person Drake most stop at all cost.  As you play the game in go against or ally with these people in the game, and the way the makers of the game and the script writer and voice actors put 110 percent in their characters and story is amazing and you'll see why this game is probably the top rated seller of last year without question.  So like many other reviewers have said if you bought the first game this sequel is a very must have and once you've played it I guarantee you'll be waiting for the third game like the rest of us too...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"An amazing game with blockbuster movie gameplay","reviewText":"The Good: Beautiful rich visuals, great soundtrack, superb dialog, story, and voice acting, punchy gun play, astounding level design, fun multi playerThe Bad: Some minor control issues, very difficult towards the endEver since the first God of War the action/adventure genre has been all about cinematic set pieces, pounding soundtracks, and adrenaline inducing combat, and Uncharted 2 pulls out all the stops. You play as Nathan Drake, once again, and this time you are trying to find the Cintamani Stone that Marco Polo died trying to find. Along the way you meet old friends, and make new enemies, but the story is as human and satisfying as ever, with amazing, snappy, and witty dialog and voice acting.The best part about Uncharted 2 are the cinematic set pieces. These completely 1-up the original game when it comes to this. The game starts out with Drake hanging from a train, but to add extra tension the train is slowly falling apart as you climb it. This method of getting your blood flowing is done through out the game, and really helps add to the excitement. The game is made like a Hollywood blockbuster movie with tons of explosions, and guns galore.The gun play is also a step up from the last game along with a more balanced and better scaled difficulty. Before the game was a pain from the start, but now the game slowly gets harder. With a ton of weapons at your disposal, and with each packing a good punch mowing down baddies has never been so fun. Along with the gun play are on rail shooting sections that are pulse increasing mayhem, and a ton of fun, but Uncharted isn't just about the action.The adventure part is well implemented and just as exciting thanks to clever level design, and the puzzles are a little easier to figure out this time around. You really feel like you can do the impossible thanks to the game making you feel like a tiny person in a small world scaling mountains, giant temples, and this is also in part with the camera angles. Naughty Dog learned what worked in the first game, and built tenfold on top of it, and it does show really well.While the controls and animations feel smoother the game does have its issues still. Despite the difficulty being scaled better the game get's overly difficult and unbalanced towards the end of the game. The engine just isn't built for a ton of super tough enemies at once. Dying over and over again just isn't fun, and this really detracts from the excitement of the story. There are some minor control issues that carried over such as Nate moving to cover when you direct him the wrong way if the camera is turned just the right way. He'll get stuck on small ledges and this could lead to frustrating cheap deaths, but other than that the game is fine. The game seems to balance gun play and adventuring a little better now as well which makes the pacing spot on.You can still collect treasures, and unlock new bonuses, and the multi player is pretty fun, but it's no Modern Warfare in terms of depth and strategy. If you love cinematics and story at its finest picking up Uncharted 2, with its beautiful visuals, will keep you pleased.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Wii, like all the previous releases in theSuper Mario Bros.franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiis held sideways, allowing for easy, classic inputs using the D-pad to direct playable characters, the 1 button to jump and 2 button to spit out projectiles like snowballs and fireballs.

The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"Morley Dotes \"morleydotes\"","summary":"Great Mario fun with a twist!","reviewText":"The other reviewers have already mentioned the game itself, I would like to comment on the game-PLAY. When you play 4 players, it can become very difficult to get through some of the levels, especially when you have to get through gears or falling things....and that part could get frustrating. I don't know that this was fully thought for some levels, as it will become apparent, and you may have to compensate for this by letting a couple of characters die and getting through with one or two. I don't mind it, but it should be noted. I do like the game play, it really is a lot of fun (for the most part) with more than one player playing. The graphics are fine and the new features are fun. It's nice to be able to freeze characters, and having 4 yoshi's running around at the same time makes for a very interesting time. One nice thing is that younger children can play also, and when they run out of lives the game will still continue and will automatically continue and bring everyone back. We have a lot of fun together and my son learns a little patience and my daughter learns perseverence....and my wife and I learn how to referee better. LOL. I would also note that Amazon offers this for much less than some of the local stores around me....so, order now, and start charging your controllers.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2009"}

[A FUN GAME]","reviewerName":"M \"Delicious Strawberry\"","summary":"nothing new here","reviewText":"This is not a bad game, per se, but after five Megaman titles with pretty much the same plotline and gameplay, this game doesn't really offer anything new. The new features included - two upgrades to Megaman, 'Jet' and 'Power' - do not really add anything because Megaman is limited in what he can do when he is in Jet or Power mode. Some of the stages have an alternate route which leads to a letter - there's four of them all together which spell out BEAT - but this is optional and doesn't really add much to the gameplay. The best Megaman games in this series were II to IV.MM6 was the last MM NES game, and this title, while might be fun to play, just isn't that interesting, especially after playing the other five titles. Some people feel this title is repetitive, and I definitely agree with them. Still, it's not a terrible game or anything, and is better suited for a die-hard Megaman completist rather than the casual player.This game would have been better if it didn't follow the SAME ENDING/PLOT TWIST that happened in MM4 and 5. I mean, seriously. After the twist revealed in MM4 and 5, and seeing the intro in MM6, it wasn't hard to guess what would really happen at the ending.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2010"}

Great workout in this since you can choose what level you want when you get setup and each day you never know what exercises you'll get.  The ducking/weaving combos can be a little finicky sometimes as the movements aren't always picked up even when you do them, but the workout is really quality.  I always feel like I managed to get a solid routine in even if I only played for fifteen minutes.The tutorials are easy, if not always about proper form.  It took me a few weeks to really start getting those uppercuts and hooks timed right along with the proper form, but that didn't take away from the overall fun of the game.  Great for anyone who's looking for a change from the normal Active/Wii Fit workout.

{"product_name":"B0086V5V9A","description":"","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"A Return to Form","reviewText":"Stealth games are kind of like puzzles.  The developers give you all sorts of tools and places you in areas where your main goal is usually to not be seen.  You have to use whatever tools you have available to you, as well as skill and, let's be honest, sometimes luck to maneuver your way to your objective.  When games get it right, the player feels empowered.  When games get it wrong...well, you get games like Splinter Cell: Conviction, a game I tried to play and like but ultimately never finished.  So, I approached Blacklist with some hesitation.  For me the sweet spot of Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, a game I gave 5 stars to here on Amazon.Blacklist looks to invoke the earlier games, including Chaos Theory, while at the same time making the game less punishing as the earlier games were.  In essence, it's a combination of what made the earlier games so revelatory and the parts that didn't stink in Conviction.  Missions score you based on three play styles: Ghost for non-lethal stealth, Panther for lethal stealth and Assault for throwing caution to the wind.  Instead of earlier games that blatantly punished you for not being 100% stealthy or for games like Conviction where it was all out warfare, it felt, this game tries to please everyone at once and offer more options for how to tackle missions.  And unlike most games that try to be everything to everyone (*cough* Resident Evil 6), it doesn't fail.  It actually is fun.This must be the era of changing well-known and liked leads.  We have Kojima telling fans that David Hayter is no more and we have Ubisoft replacing Michael Ironside with Eric Johnson for the voice of Fisher.  The story, meanwhile, is serviceable but I'm having a hard time remembering much about it.  The gameplay is what drew me in and is what kept me playing.  Once you're done with the single player, there's the extensive multiplayer.  Finally a return of Spies Vs. Mercs, which was my favorite from the earlier games.  Here, refined and expanded; it's the reason I will keep coming back to the game.Overall, fans of the previous entries will find lots to love here; and people who, like me, were turned off by Conviction will have a reason to come back.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0086V5V9A","description":"","reviewerName":"The Shadow Warrior","summary":"A lot of new features make this game very amusing to play!","reviewText":"When I was first introduced to the Splinter Cell series, I started off with Double Agent, and then transitioned onto Conviction, then entered the 4th Echelon with Blacklist.The story is very engaging and since I am part Persian, I could understand certain phrases when the enemy AI or any AI was talking. I found that to be very cool. Now on with the review.If the first thing you are planning to see is a main menu, tough luck, there is none! The Paladin (HQ) is your walkable main menu. Complete with crew, facilities and the giant tablet where you can choose missions. That is also how you start your missions, co-op multiplayer and even Spies VS Mercs. At first I didn't really understand the point, but then I realized that the map showing all these points makes it seem that all these events are happening as if they are like normal missions, each being located anywhere. (Now if that confuses you, I just may be wording it wrong, trust me you will love how this game has implemented their mission and multiplayer layout)Each mission can be done in anyway possible, and you will get rewarded based on 3 styles: Ghost, Panther, and Assault. Ghost being non lethal stealth, Panther being lethal stealth, and Assault being guns blazing. Of course, Ghost gives more score, and Assault gives the least. I cannot stress how much the stealth gameplay will save you in the end. It was also fun to use the Execution system again.Also being introduced, is a new customization system which allows you to equip  better suits, gadgets, goggle colour, goggles, and etc.One of my favourite features would have to be the Local Co-op feature, nothing more fun than 2 people placed in a stealth environment trying to complete the objective. You can also play Online Co-Op as well.If you are into some aspects of Conviction, with a greater emphasis on stealth, this game is for you.

{"product_name":"PlayStation 3 40GB System","summary":"Breathtaking and Powerful Media Centre System","reviewText":"The console market was always about that one exclusive title that was a make or break deal for buying a console. Things have changed and these transformations are important. Brand names in technology used to mean quality but in today's world the same companies get their components from the same parts of the globe that are using the same factory workforces. It is not about components any longer, it is all about architecture, design and implementation.When games developers announced that the 360 was about to get games that were once exclusive to the PS2 console it seemed that the Playstation 3 would be a hard sell especially at its announced price. When Sony revealed delays that amounted to a year and dropped the new design of the controller many thought it would be the end of the PS3 with the sale of HD-DVD format through an early 360 release crushing Blu-ray out of the market. However it didn't happen like that and if anything the tables have turned dramatically. The 360 had two drawbacks. The first was that the hardware architecture was causing overheating problems and the second was that it didn't ship with a HD-DVD drive. That was all the news Sony needed to deliver on a solid gaming rig with Blu-ray... and then much more.It is hard to call the PS3 a games console. It is more like a media centre. In fact it is the media centre that Microsoft wanted us to have, so in many ways Bill Gates has been given a double whammy by Sony. If you want a games console with a highly sophisticated media centre, then the PS3 is the one to get. Let me explain how good it gets. I have a PC upstairs with a lot of DivX, Xvid, DVDs, MP3s, AVIs and WAVs I would like to play on my television. With the PS3, a wireless router and a little time to configure a setup with the free Tversity media server on my PC (you may have to search on the Internet for the right configuration but it goes like this - set PS3 to Wireless with automatic connection, write down the IP and DNS Servers, then change to manual and enter these in manually and disable UPnP. Port forward in the router with the new assigned IP (Ports: 80(TCP), 443(TCP),5223(TCP), 3478(UDP), 3479(UDP), 3658(UDP)). Also in router UPnP check disable. This solves any disconnection issues and your media centre is now up and running). You can watch or listen to virtually anything through this system. I was blown away by how good these files looked over the 54G wireless. It was like watching it on normal television and without any artefacts or frame skipping. The PS3 is also Internet ready with a browser and you can download and install software that runs on the internal hard drive. Then you have social features such as the PS3 community, chat (needs a bluetooth headset), friends and email. There is a way more under the bonnet than just a game's engine. Microsoft has been left standing by what should have been their thing.The controller is more robust than the PS2 controller and has lots of new features. The first is that it is wireless and charges directly from the system (no batteries). There is a new middle button that activates system functions. It comes with motion sensor `Sixaxis' and the L2, R2 buttons have a lovely downward curve feature. You can easily see if your controller needs recharging by the front flashing red lights and having lots of controllers is an effortless affair now. You can also run these wired through USB if you want.The graphics are up there with a high end PC. Playing GTA IV on this machine was a jaw-dropping on the sticky popcorn floor experience. You can download and watch/play trailers/demos from the Sony store. The quality is simply super. Let the best games speak for themselves.The PS3 menu and interface is a substantial improvement from the PS2. It is virtually a feature rich operating system. There are extensive settings for audio and display and networking. It can network with the PSP. You can download updates and patches online including upgrades for the BD player. It makes you feel like part of a PS3 community with a commanding media system in your hands. All of this even before you have started to play a game or watch a Blu-ray makes the PS3 worth it alone. That is why this is a knockout system. The PS3 has done away with the concept that one exclusive title is the make or break deal for buying a console. You buy the PS3 for the PS3. That says it all.Pros:Much more than just a games consoleFull blown media centreBlu-rayWireless everythingPlaystation community onlineUpdatesHundreds of games in developmentSome really good games already out (GTA IV, MGS4)Online manual is deepThe technology is outstandingCons:Not compatible with all PS2 gamesIt's big and heavyNetworking requires some tinkeringBook manual is lacking","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2008"}

Well, despite that extra year wait for so many gamers, they definitely have found some really great games that have made the system worth the effort like New Super Mario Brothers 2, and Mario Kart 7. Still, there have been those gamers whom have just wanted more. Well, that is shown again when word came out that Nintendo was making a more expansive Nintendo 3DS, they definitely also showed that bigger can also be better on a good system. Well, that was shown back when Nintendo made the Nintendo DSi XL back in 2010, yet with so many still awaiting, they found something better here.The Nintendo 3DS XL takes all of the elements that have been exciting from the Nintendo 3DS, and take it to a bigger level. What makes this better is the fact that the screen is larger, so you can definitely have a better view of the classic games that have drove the Nintendo 3DS like Mario Kart 7 and Super Mario 3D Land, and supsersize them to give it a better view of the graphics and gameplay. The games look amazing it on it, whether you're playing at home or on the road your favorite games and Nintendo DS classics, they really look amazing and deliver well. The graphics are great, but it also has a better battery life than any of the DS systems before it, including the original DS and the DS Lite. But it really is the fact now that you can also have more games on the SD Memory card to call your own, thanks to the expansive memory as your can now download more games from the Nintendo eShop like Art Style: Base 10, and classic NES titles like Donkey Kong and Excitebike, including games like New Super Mario Brothers 2 and upcoming titles soon like Crosswords XL, and Luigi's Mansion 2. It really holds up well, and shows a great price on fun. You definitely have all the features from the original Nintendo 3DS, at a less expensive price from when the original Nintendo 3DS came out.Nintendo has always known how to make the mark with games and systems since the 80's, and still shows no signs of stopping. If you have owned any of the original Nintendo DS systems, and are looking for something better, or if you are looking for a great game system on the go, the Nintendo 3DS XL is definitely worth its money. It has everything from the Nintendo 3DS before, and is better. I definitely recommend it a whole lot.Graphics: A-Sound: A-Control: AFun & Enjoyment: A-Nintendo DS Compatablity: B+Overall: A-","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00009WNZA","reviewerName":"Michael Brenyo","summary":"The Best Dollhouse Simulator Ever","reviewText":"I played the original Sims and was expecting more of the same.  Boy was I wrong.  The graphics have been completely overhauled and are a realy beauty to look at.  You also have a bunch of furniture and items to pick from, skills to learn, jobs to work at, and building options.  The building options alone are amazing.  You can do almost anything you want with your house.  The AI also acts in a realistic and satisfying way.  If your Sim is a neat freak, they will mostly tend to the house themselves.  If not, you should probably hire a maid.  The ability to marry and have children also adds to the game.The one thing I didn't like was the speed of the game.

The speed is there to encourage you to create a family line that goes down through the ages.  Personally, I found it to be a little bit too fast.

Melee in almost every way possible.The improvements over the previous Smash Brothers game are quite abundant.  There are now thirty five characters.  Fourteen of which must be unlocked first, either through several matches, classic mode or the games adventure mode.  There are also a plethora of new stages as well as a few classic ones thrown in from Super Smash Bros. Melee.  There are also new items and a whole new slew of extras to be found within this game.  Simply put, this game is huge and won't keep you busy for just weeks, but months on end.  Perhaps even years.There are two big single player modes to trump through.  First, there is classic mode which is not much different from the classic mode presented in Melee.  You'll fight battles either one on one, two on two, three on one or a giant version of a character.  There are also team battles and \"Metal Menaces\" to fight.  You'll also see the return of Master Hand and Crazy Hand.  Classic Mode can now be done with a friend instead of just by yourself as well.However, the real deal in single player is easily the Subspace Emissary.  Brawl's own adventure mode.  The adventure mode here actually includes a story.  The story is a little confusing at first.  Mainly because there's no voice acting or even written dialog between the characters.  You'll eventually grasp on to it, though, and even come to like it.  The story even comes off as somewhat epic.  The adventure mode here is much more fleshed out than in Melee.  You'll fight an abundance of characters and have an abundance of characters join your ranks.  You'll fight through chaotic boss fights and intricately designed levels.  And you don't even have to go through adventure mode alone.  A friend can fight alongside and many moments in the story call for more than one character to go through a certain level.  The other good thing about going through Adventure Mode is that it can be a different experience on a subsequent play.  Even better, however, is that the Adventure Mode is not that short.  It will easily take you anywhere from nine to ten hours to complete it the first time, and you'll end up having to play a second time just to snag all the trophies.Of course, the real treasure of any Smash Bros. game is the multiplayer aspect.  Brawl doesn't disappoint.  The matches are fierce and there are a ton of new things.  As in the previous games, players go to a level where they battle against either other players or the computer.  There are several new items added this time around.  There's the sticky bomb, which sticks to a character until it detonates.  There's the assist trophy which works a lot like the Pokeball and many more.  The most important new item, though, is easily the Final Smash.  The Final Smash is a devastating attack that usually serves as a one hit kill.  You'll probably want to check out every character's Final Smash skill at least once.  These aren't just the most powerful attacks in the game, they're some of the coolest looking as well.Super Smash Bros. Brawl also supports four different controller functions.  The Wii Remote by itself, the Wii Remote and Nunchuck, the Classic Controller and the Gamecube Controller.  All of these controls are decent, but the Gamecube controller is easily the best of the lot.  The controls are mapped out exactly like Super Smash Brothers Melee.  Anyone who played Melee to no end will easily find comfort in the controls here.  Regardless of what control function you use, the controls are tight and highly responsive.The best part about Brawl, however, may very well be all the extras.  You've got a series of trophies to collect and characters to unlock, but there's a lot more than just these things.  You can also unlock soundtrack selections and new stages as well.  In addition to all these things you can also save some matches and watch them again.  Brawl also gives you the option of creating your own levels and saving screenshots.  This is in addition to some of the things that returned from Melee such as Event Battles and the Homerun Contest.  There's so much to be explored within this game.  Brawl also goes online, and being able to fight people anywhere is amazing.Super Smash Bros. Brawl also looks and sounds incredible.  The graphics being the best the Wii has yet.  The stages themselves look absolutely incredible.  The backgrounds are highly detailed.  The music here is some of the best to grace the gaming world.  Nintendo got some of the most famous composers in the industry to contribute music and the soundtrack doesn't disappoint.Is Brawl perfect?  No.  While it's nice to go online you'll still have to deal with friend codes and there's no way to voice chat or communicate with the people you're playing against online.  When playing with friends, it'd be nice to be able to say something.  The game also suffers from some fairly long load times.  And while Adventure Mode is a treat, the last few hours of the run can become extremely repetitive.Despite all this, Super Smash Brawl is a must buy for Super Smash Brothers fans.  If you enjoyed Super Smash Brothers Melee and the original title that started it all, Super Smash Brothers Brawl is a real treat to own.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00AXI9WFS","description":"","reviewerName":"Thomas Riccardi","summary":"To infinity and beyond!","reviewText":"When you were growing up as a kid at some point you were playing with dolls or action figures. These toys took you to magical places as you played either alone or with your friends. Technology has taken this to a new level as you can buy figures and have them translate into video game characters. Disney has recently capitalized on this trend by releasing Disney Infinity but is this going to be something that the average gamer is going to want or is this going to be just for the kids?The core base set comes with three figurines of Mr. Incredible, Jack Sparrow and Sully from Monsters Inc. When you put any of these figures onto the base you can unlock the play set mode. The play set mode puts you right in the middle of your favorite movies ranging from Toy Story to the Lone Ranger. You will be the character you select on the screen but you can only be a character from that franchise (ex: Wreck it ralph cannot be in the Pirates of the Caribbean playset). When you play each of these levels you are awarded unlocks that you can use in Toy Box mode which is the heart of the game.Toy box mode can be summed up as a minecraft lite for kids. You are given access to easy to use tools to create your own world and your own games. You can do this with blocks one at a time or add in bigger elements (such as pirate ships). Once you're done creating the world you like you can share it with your friends by uploading it online. And it doesn't matter if you're a skilled builder or a novice because this was designed for kids and it is a simple and easy to use interface.The downside with this game is if you get hooked on the core set you will be spending more money on other playsets and power discs (that add new elements and items to the game). And the prices on these items are pretty steep (ranging from $12.99 for a figure and up to $35 for an additional playset). This will get really expensive really quick if you have to have all the playsets and characters to unlock all the content.All in all Disney Infinity is a neat concept and if you're a fan of the Disney cartoons this is something that kids and adults will love.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2013"}

{"product_name":"B007V9QKH0","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"High fantasy beat-em-up heaven","reviewText":"Before I ever even ripped the cellophane wrap off of the package, I knew I was going to love Dragon's Crown. After all, it was made by one of my favorite game developers, the illustrious Vanillaware. It's evidently set in the same universe asOdin Sphere, one of my all-time favorite video games (and Vanillaware's magnum opus, if you ask me), albeit much, much later in its chronology. It's a beat-em-up with RPG ambitions. It's all guaranteed to be good right? I thought Dragon's Crown was going to be a fun, guilty pleasure diversion between more grand gaming undertakings. Well, I was wrong. Dragon's Crown isn't just \"good,\" it's great, stupendous, marvelous, incredible, damn near PERFECT for its genre. I thought I'd really like DC, but I have been genuinely surprised at how much I love the game. Once again, VW has exceeded my expectations and given me a game I'll cherish for years to come.Dragon's Crown's tale is a fairly big deviation from the deep, largely character driven tales of VW's past games. Set in the magical kingdom of Hydeland, the story revolves around you, the player, as one of six preset class archetypes, and your adventures as you fight for the kingdom of Hydeland and quest for the mystical Dragon's Crown, an artifact said to hold the power to control dragons. Coming from the more nuanced, character focused narratives of, say, Odin Sphere orMuramasa, DC's story may seem to be disappointingly simplistic and straightforward at first. However, it really does grow on you over time. There are plenty of likable characters that you'll encounter several times, and the story's events have a genuine feeling of impact and importance to them.The whole tale is told via one central character you'll never ever see, a narrator. What a brilliant choice it was to have him! It's no stretch to say he elevates the story from decent to great, at least for me anyway. The way he delivers the lines, as well as the style in which he phrases the story's events definitely lends a MAJOR table top RPG vibe to the game, as if he's the DM and you're playing a game of D&D; or GURPS with your friends. Being reminded of my table top RPG days was powerfully nostalgic for me, and it really made me love the story in this game. When I was young, I used to play beat-em-ups likeGolden Axe,Knights of the Round/King of Dragons, and theDungeons & Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara games. Even though those classics didn't have particularly deep stories, they did to me as they inspired my imagination to come up with back-stories, personalities for the characters, possible banter, etc. Those classics also made me feel empowered, as if my character really was a legendary hero in their universe. I haven't felt that from a game in years. I feel it from Dragon's Crown. Bravo to Vanillaware for that! I also have to give credit to them for creating a fascinating universe to play through. Even if the main tale isn't particularly ground-breaking, the world of DC is incredibly well realized from a story perspective. There are roughly 50 side-quests to undertake in the game, and doing so unlocks a new, gorgeous piece of art, as well as an awesome page's worth of lore to read connected with the art. These pieces of art and lore are incredibly engaging. I found myself completing all side quests just to read new info on the fascinating universe of DC.Of course, I wouldn't be so caught up in the story of DC if the universe of the game wasn't so magical in its presentation, and it definitely is here. This game is so beautiful! Of course, this shouldn't come as any surprise to anyone familiar with VW. George Kamitani and the rest of VW's past works are filled to the brim with the kind of brilliant art design and execution that leaves your imagination afire and your heart captivated. Whereas Odin Sphere had a whimsical fairy tale look, and Muramasa opted for a mythological Japanese focus, Dragon's Crown is all about high fantasy. There's a sense of whimsy to it, but there are much more down-n-dirty and epic aspects overall. There's a huge variety to the locales you visit too. From traditionally Tolkien-esque fantasy towns, castles, forests, etc. to locales that feel more at home in ancient Greek and Roman mythological and historical settings, and even some inspired by Scriptures. Every place you visit just sucks you into the world of DC, making it breathe with life and magic. The characters are equally superb visually, both in design and animation quality. There's tons of variety as well, from the positively godlike physique of the dwarf, to the swift, slender build of the elf, all playable characters have a very distinct style and design (to the ire of some overly sensitive circles). Same goes for the enemy and boss designs which are, according to VW tradition, absolutely breathtaking. Same goes for the food dishes in the game that appear during campfire cooking segments. There are few developers who understand focus on art design does much more for a game visually and is far more timeless than trying to push the boundaries of ever-aging tech like VW does. They deserve applause for that.Sound design is also quite fantastic. Just as with the visuals, everything is saturated with a fantastic fantasy motif. As I said earlier, the narrator does the majority of speaking in the game, and the actor who plays him did a fantastic job breathing life into the game's story. For $2 you can also purchase DLC that allows each main playable character to act as narrator, which is awesome. All of them do a great job as well. The real highlight with the sound, however, is the music. Hitoshi Sakimoto hit it out of the park. From the quieter moments, such as sitting at the tavern to level up and navigating the beautiful home town at Hydeland, to the intense events, such as fighting a massive red dragon across the halls of a long-abandoned capital city built into a mountainside, this game's soundtrack is simply wonderful. Overall, the sound design is superb.The real meat-n-potatoes of the game, and the obvious focus during development, is the gameplay. George Kamitani stated prior to release that he wanted to take the classic beat-em-up genre to new heights, and I'd say he definitely succeeded here. There are six playable archetypes you can choose from. There's the Amazon, the Fighter, the Elf, the Wizard, the Sorceress, and my personal favorite, the Dwarf. All have immensely different play styles that make each one a very unique experience. The Dwarf is an incredibly strong brawler who has the unique ability to pick up and throw enemies to devastating effect, the Fighter is as straightforward as his name implies, and the Amazon favors tricky parries and a beserker style that rewards risk taking. On the other hand, the Elf is a much more strategic type class, with a strike and evade style that is deadly, and the Wizard and Sorceress classes are both magic users, with the former being more offensively capable and the latter being more of a supportive class. Each character offers a vastly different experience as you play. Not only are their move sets totally different, but each comes with a de facto difficulty setting, as some are more challenging to master than others. All are incredibly fun, especially when you can play with others in multiplayer. Fighting hoards of enemies, discovering secrets in the levels, as well as engaging awesome bosses, has never been more fun. It only gets better in multiplayer, both online and off.There are also RPG elements that are brilliantly implemented. There's a skill point system tied to RPG elements and undertaking side quests that really engages you with the development of your character. New skills/abilities/passive traits open up at an excellent pace as you level up, so you always feel like your character is getting new, fresh moves to play with. Sometimes, leveling up skills does much more than just increase their damage, adding new excitement to seeing what will happen with skills you already liked. Of course, as is the main draw of most RPG-hybrid games like this, acquiring new and better loot is an addicting highlight. Add in other strategic elements such as item degradation, item management, an appraisal system for all loot, being able to find bones to resurrect into allies you can recruit, etc., and the result is a game that is as mentally engaging as it is viscerally satisfying. As always, VW's attempt to build onto an established action genre with new and exciting RPG elements is a smashing success.There are some miscellaneous aspects of the game I have to praise VW for. First off, the online multiplayer in this game is, for the most part, superb. As I mentioned previously, you can find the bones of other \"heroes\" throughout the levels and, for a small fee, you can resurrect and recruit them to come along with you on your journeys if you select them to. These AI controlled characters are perfectly adequate, but if you have it connected to the net, other players will seamlessly jump in and replace NPC players. Some levels branch off to different paths with different bosses. Rather than a democratic system, you can pick whichever path you want and all the players that opted for the other path will still have their characters join you, only this time as NPCs. There are so many thoughtful design choices that went into the online multiplayer in this game, and it works very smoothly, for the most part. I also have to praise VW for the fact that they have continued to support this game immensely after launch. They have used patches to not only fix bugs and issues, but also to add, FOR FREE, the kind of substantial content most other companies would charge you money for as DLC. That. Is. Awesome. After a patch, DC has cross-play functionality, so if your friend only owns the Vita version and you only have PS3, you can still play together. The game allows you to upload your save file to a server so that you can continue your adventures on the go with thethe PS Vita version, if you have it (I do, and this feature is great!).Speaking of which, you may wonder which version of DC is the one to get, and that's a valid question. As it turns out, there is no clear winner. The game is equally great on either system, with each version having their own strengths. The PS3 version is best if you want to be able to enjoy the art design to its fullest detail, and it's better for multiplayer to have a bigger screen. On the other hand, the Vita version features excellent touch controls that easily outclass the PS3 version, which utilizes a very clunky, uncomfortable, pain in the @$$ cursor with the right analog stick. Being able to play a game like this on the go is also a major plus in the Vita version's favor. However, the smaller Vita screen does make it easy to lose track of what's happening and where your character is among all the mayhem. Like I said, I own both versions and I love them both equally for different reasons. Really, the only complaint I can think of for the game is that it's not cross-buy. If you want both versions, you've got to plunk down the cash for both, which can be seen as a negative. Personally, it doesn't bother me too much. At the end of the day, it's still a great game no matter which version you go with.I knew I was going to enjoy Dragon's Crown, but I've been genuinely surprised at just how much I LOVE this game. I've played it for well over 50 hours. I have leveled my Dwarf beyond the old 99 limit and beating the three difficulties (the final patch increased the level cap to 255 as well as added a fourth difficulty), finished every story event and side-quest, unlocked every piece of art, and I have no intentions of stopping there. I fully intend on beating the game on at least normal difficulty with each character class. This may be the very first game I platinum. It is just so special. VW has truly blown my expectations out of the water and delivered much more than just a pretty beat-em-up diversion. They have delivered an entry that has revitalized a classic genre (one that had been growing stale and tired until now) and elevated it to new heights. They also happened to release one of the most beautiful games of its generation, with a thrilling new universe that delivers nostalgia and fresh excitement in equal measure. I really cannot praise this game enough. If you're a fan of classical, epic high fantasy, artistic games that leave you stunned by their design, action games that have intelligent RPG designs, or just addictive beat-em-ups to play alone or with friends, then Dragon's Crown is the game for you. Buy it, prepare yourself for a rousing adventure, and enjoy reveling in what it feels like to be a hero of legend.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2014"}
