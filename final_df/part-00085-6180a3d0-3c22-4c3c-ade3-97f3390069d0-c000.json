{"product_name":"B00CQ7CIMS","description":"","reviewerName":"Ryan Sil. (Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...","summary":"Deja vu - Thy name is Luigi","reviewText":"So New Super Mario Bros. U rekindled my faith in the New Super Mario branch of the franchise with its strong level design and fresh-enough content for a sequel that the 3DS entry wishes it had. This particular installment in the lineup was made for this purpose - To highlight the 20th Anniversary of Luigi. And with that in mind, you'd think Nintendo would make this one even fresher, providing some all-new worlds and environments ideal for Luigi and his abilities helping it give off a unique and interesting experienceOooor it could just be a merely smaller clone/rehash of New Super Mario Bros. U............Unfortunately, we're given the latter. Everything you've seen in NSMBU is present and accounted for, including the worlds, bosses, etc. You even get the same cutscenes and sequences on the maps! NOTHING was changed....except for the level design...and Luigi's usual characteristics (higher jumping, slightly floatier) have been implemented.For whatever reason, the levels are all made much shorter ON PURPOSE. The maximum time limit is always 100 seconds, so you're always pressured to breeze through the pint-sized levels, not being able to take the time to establish any actual fondness or appreciation of the levels themselves. Even then, the levels are not quite as up to snuff as in other NSMB games, with the exception of maybe NSMB2. At least they provide a challenge.......Unless you decide to play as that Nabbit character, as I like to call him, &#34;Easy Mode: The Character&#34;. When playing as Nabbit, you can collect power-ups as extra lives, and not take damage from ANY enemy, including bosses. This wipes out any challenge presented in the game, and although playing as him is optional, the fact that he's playable ruins the entire point of this game's confused structure.Yes, I completely get it: This is simply DLC for the real NSMBU. However, having it sell for $20, and then releasing the game alone as a RETAIL TITLE FOR $10 MORE makes the game hard to swallow, especially considering the time gap between this and NSMBU - The latter was released on November 2012, correct? Nintendo had around SEVEN MONTHS (NINE if you count the retail release!) to conceptualize the project, and after that amount of time, it just comes off as a giant missed opportunity to make a great new 2D platformer based solely around Luigi.Despite all that's said, though, there's still at least some fun to be had. The classic 2D Mario formula is still alive and kicking, and New Super Mario Bros. U is a great title, so of course New Super Luigi U is bound to retain some things that made NSMBU a good play. It's just a shame the effort feels overall lazy, and there's so, so, so much more that could have been done.If you got this game with New Super Mario Bros. U as a Wii U bundle, then feel free to add a star to the rating.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2014"}

Also new to both the series and the RPG genre is the Trinity Sight System, which enables players to experience events from the viewpoints of three different characters.","reviewerName":"ahw","summary":"BORING!  Has the World Gone Mad?","reviewText":"To me, the appeal of Suikoden 3 to so many people is one of the world's greatest mysteries, right up there with Roswell, Stonehenge, Easter Island and JFK's assasination.  Why did so many people enjoy this game so much?  My theory is that someone switched the discs in my game when I bought it, and that I was actually playing a fake version of Suikoden 3 that really, really, REALLY sucked.Well at any rate, I'll review the game that *I* played.Suikoden 3 is terrible.  It is one of the most boring games I've played in my life, and I played all the way through it.  Up to the very end, I kept telling myself that the game MUST get better (based on the reviews I read).  Yep, right up to when they started rolling the credits I promised myself the game would get better.It didn't.  Elizabeth R. Powell's review is actually a pretty good description of my experience, though I would disagree with her contention that Hugo's plotline was worth playing.  It wasn't.  The worst part of the game hands are the game triggers (those events that happen when you enter a certain place that \"triggers\" the game to progress).  Some of the game triggers are so random it's ridiculous.  Sometimes, the game doesn't even tell you what you need to do next (like the chapter you spend recruiting people, and you have to talke to EVERYBODY in ALL the towns you visit).  I spent countless wasted hours running from screen to screen trying to figure out how to progress that damn game, baffled because apparently I was supposed to know I to go to some remote corner of the castle to speak with some character I've never even met before.  How in the world was I supposed to know to do that?  And of course the overly high random encounter rate, coupled with the boring terrain and terrible music made the whole experience dreadful.The story hardly makes up for the game either.  In fact, if the game had good gameplay, I'd probably complain about the boring storyline.  The uninspiring characters make you think Konami game designers flung darts at a personality chart to come up with their characters.All in all, not even worth a rental.  But I do implore you, if you are the least bit curious about the game based on the other reviews (reviewers bribed by Konami no doubt, CONSPIRACY I tell you), RENT, don't buy, the game.  Don't worry, I'm sure you won't mind if you don't finish it in time.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2005"}
{"product_name":"B0050SVGU0","description":"Mario Party 9","reviewerName":"hwrose379","summary":"Makes a few daring changes but for the most part it works","reviewText":"Mario Party 9 marks Mario's last appearance on the Wii before he makes his HD debut on the Wii U. For some reason, I really like the fact that his last Wii game was a Mario Party game...it almost makes sense, as if they made a Mario Party to make a statement like, \"Okay, time to say goodbye to the Wii! Let's throw a goodbye party!\" Now on to my review:As most people know, the Mario Party series is the most stubborn video game series when it comes to innovating. The first 8 games were all practically the same gameplay wise and the only difference between them were the different boards, minigames, and special items. Then along comes Mario Party 9, developed by a different company (ND Cube rather than Hudson Soft), and decides to shake things up...a lot. Mario Party 9 makes a lot of daring changes to the series and, to be honest, I enjoy most of them.Perhaps the biggest change to be seen in Mario Party 9 is the way you travel around the board. Instead of moving individually, all of the players move around in a vehicle. What the vehicle is depends on the board. For Toad Road, it's a car. For Boo's Horror Castle, it's a flying carpet. The person who rolls the dice is known as the \"captain\" for that round and everyone else just relaxes in the back. The idea of moving around in a vehicle brought the most outrage out of some people because it \"takes away all strategy.\" I heartily disagree. If you're the captain and the next player is in the lead, you can strategize and land the vehicle in a certain spot that makes disaster unavoidable to the next player. Sure, there's not as much strategy as the past Mario Party games, but the strategy is definitely there.The next big change is that instead of the boards being loops where you go around in circles, they're more \"point A to point B\" boards, similar to Candyland. This allows for larger game boards and more attention to detail.Another change is the tossing of coins, collectibles like candy, and stars. Instead, this is all replaced with mini stars and dice blocks. The boards are littered with mini stars, and the goal is to collect the most mini stars to win. If you are the captain when you pass over mini stars, you get those mini stars. It's a nice addition and to be honest lends itself to more competition, and I like it. Also, each Mario Party game has a certain collectible that can help you strategize your next move. In this game, it's dice blocks. There are 6 different dice blocks. Each dice block has a certain number range that can help you move. This is the source of strategy for Mario Party 9. Say the spot right in front of you is a Bowser spot...why not use a 0-1 dice block and roll a 0, then the next player can suffer the pain the spot brings. I particularly like this change but I do miss the candy used in Mario Party 8, some of the candies were quite comedic.The last change I can think of is the minigames. Not what they are or how they're played, but WHEN they're played. In the past Mario Party games, you play a minigame at the end of every round. In Mario Party 9, that idea is scrapped and you only play minigames if you land on a minigame spot on the board. This also caused a lot of outrage among fans but I quite like this change...it allows for a shorter play time - you all know that Mario Party tends to get tedious after a certain amount of time. The minigames are all very fun and some of them are quite challenging. There is a large variety between the minigames and that is always a welcomed fact. Each board also comprises of two \"bosses,\" so to speak: a midway boss and an ending boss at the end of the board. These \"boss battles\" are nothing more than minigames against a typical Mario-platformer enemy to rack up a lot of mini stars. It's a fun twist but wasn't quite executed well enough...they could've made the boss battles a little bit harder.The graphics for this game are visually STUNNING. The colors in Mario Party 9 are just so crisp and bright, and the developers really paid close attention to detail. The graphics and attention to detail in Toad Road were so enormous and amazing that the game actually lagged a bit on that board at certain spots. This only seems to affect Toad Road, but once you play Toad Road, you'll completely understand why the game lagged. To be honest, the graphics for this game are as close to HD as you can possibly get on the Wii. The music is also pretty good...it's nothing compared to the orchestrated music from the Galaxy games, but it is good, has a few catchy tunes, and includes a few remixes of classic Mario tunes.To wrap it up, Mario Party 9 does make some daring changes to the series and, to me, the changes work. I've garnered countless hours of fun from this game and I'm quite sure my family will continue to love it. It is definitely better played in multiplayer, but then again, all Mario Party games are. Overall, Mario Party 9 is the best in the series and is an absolute blast to play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2013"}

It is beautifully designed with interesting and quite often bizarre enemies, from the common types to huge bosses. The special moves is hilarious and over the top and fit the game quite well. One feature I love about this game is that there is a wide range of difficulties, everyone from the most novice gamer to the most experienced should find a setting that suit them. This is a feature lacking in many games, where the easiest difficulty really is not easy enough for inexperienced players, or hard is not really hard enough to give a challenge to really skilled players. Bayonetta nails this completely.Bayonetta is the story of a young witch by he same name, she was found buried in a coffin in a lake and hunt angels to pay her dept to hell. The setting is over the top noir and this give the game a silly, but still fantastic atmosphere, just like in movies like Sin City and the like. The only thing I do not like here is that the song fly me to the moon run on repeat for several level, the song fit the mood of the game, but it get rather tiering after a while.Graphics wise Bayonetta is a treat, more need not be said about it. The controls are great, and the audio, with the exception of the before mentioned song is great. The storyline is over the top, but very interesting. The characters are great, and the special moves, like summoning monsters out of Bayonetta's own hair is just amazing. Really I have nothing but good to say about this game. If you like comic book action, fantasy or action games you will probably like this game. I recommend it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2010"}

I need not have worried. Borderlands is one of the best games I've played. The visuals are very impressive and suck you right in. This is open-world gaming at it's best, with many large maps to explore as you complete the numerous missions. There are hundreds of weapons to collect and use, or sell along the way (gathering loot quickly becomes addictive). A wide variety of enemies will take you on as you progress up the levels. The combat is varied and the AI is good if not exceptional. Although there's little story to speak of there's enough humour to just about make up for this. It's possible that some might find the missions a tad repetitive but I was so engrossed in the game that I didn't tire of them and completed every one, including the 3 DLCs available. As for multi-player, well co-op is great fun but best played with people who you can rely on to share the loot. 4.5/5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2012"}

The money it made at the box office and the 11 for 11 at the Oscars all speaks merit. The video game isn't a disappointment either.The story to the game is the same as it is in the movie and follows it very closely. In the game there are three paths you must take. You can be either Aaragorn, Gimli, or Legolas working your way to Minas Tirith. You must recruit the army of the dead along the way. After that you work your way to the black gate to make a last stand.There is the path of the wizard. In this you get to play as Gandalf. You go to Isengard, and then on to the battle of Minas Tirith. Gandald is an awesome character.The third path is that of the Hobbits. You play as Sam and you must help Frodo. You escape from Osgiliath, Work your way through Shaleobs Lair, then onto Morus Mongol, and finally Mt.Doom where you must destroy the ring.The single player mode is alright. This isn't the hardest game in the world. It took me a little over a week to take out the single player mode. You can change the difficulty setting which does make the game harder.Co-op mode is fun. In this mode you getto play with another human being and there are two characters instead of one. Me and my brother had a lot of fun playing this mode and beat the game in a little over a day in this mode.The specials in the game are kind of neat. As you progress along you unlock interviews with the stars talking about the game and the movie. There are some specials on the making of it, and it's kind of interesting. The video looks alright and it's provided by DivX.I was a little disappointed with the secrets in the game. The two secret levels stink, but I liked all the special characters. The Hobbits are all the same, but Feramir is cool. I also like how you can mix and match your characters on levels after you've beaten the game.This is a good game. I'm glad we own it, and I've enjoyed many hours playing it. I wouldn't pay more than $30 for it, but if you can find it for under that, you have a sure fire winner. It's a good game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2004"}

Yellow was my first ever game for my GameBoy, I was the envy of my friends who all had either Red or Blue, which featured a distracting red or blue hue. Pokemon has evolved a lot since those days, adding many new features, most of which were welcomed. Although many features have been added, the battle system has not changed much. Some do not like this, saying it needs to evolve. I for one, being a huge fan of turn based RPGs, like how it hasn't changed. I wish more RPGs today stayed true to their roots. I'm looking at you, Final Fantasy. Now why pick Gold? Well actually I got both, along with both figurines. I did play Gold as a kid, so that's the one I decided to play first.I am already in 70 hours in Platinum, which doesn't even have all 16 badges like HG/SS.

If you haven't played the series before you will probably love tis game and rave about how great it is, but if your a vetern of the series w/Pandora and chaos you will be kinda unhappy with it. This is because the diehard fans know how great the series was and how much of the good stuff ubisoft removed from this game. The game is still good and fun. It redemmed itself to the hardcore fans w/the addition of the deniable ops missions. These are the true SC gametypes.

{"product_name":"B002NIP2SM","reviewerName":"Nicolas K. Gebbia","summary":"Ok........","reviewText":"I am a big fan of the Battlefield's such as BF 1942, BF Vietnam, and the almost perfect BF2.  I have spent more time playing BF2 then any other game my entire life and I can not wait till they come out with a updated version for todays standards.  In all honesty I still would be playing BF2 if I could get it to work on Windows 7.Let's talk about BFBC2.  For modern day FPS's I am a COD4 fan but MW2 just sucked for any PC gamer.  When I first bought BFBC2 I knew the single player would be garbage and it was, but I bought it for the Multiplayer just like anyone else.  When I first played it I just thought it was slow.  Not slow in the means like the game play was slow such as a big map and not a lot of people I'm not talking about that kind of slow.  I mean the slow like the game itself.  Like the actions in the game.  Its hard to explain, but I feel like its an awesome FPS played in a tub of Molasses.  Just the action shooting people just seems slow.  When you through a grenade it acts like a frisbee in the fact that its kind of in slow motion going through the air.  I dont know if I'm the only one that thinks this about this game.  But this is one of the main reasons I do not like it at all.I think a big factor with online FPS's (I am not expert, only my opinion from what I have seen so far) is that they are making them more graphic intense in multiplayer.  I think that might be a reason that everything is slowed down.  I love graphic intense games dont get me wrong but I want intense graphics on Single player not multiplayer.  I do know play multiplayer for graphics although nice to have but unnecessary.  Just think back when BF2 and COD4 was the new hotness.  You never had the same problems as you do with todays games such as CODMW2 and BFBC2.I dont know keep in mind that this is my opinion and you might have a completely different one.  But I loved COD4, all the BATTLEFIELD games up too BAD Company Series and even some aspects of MW2..but in the end I dont think I will be player BFBC2 for quite sometime but every once in a while I will continue to give it a chance.

{"product_name":"B00149ILCK","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"Awesome Game at the Current Price","reviewText":"I wasn't expecting much from this game since the reviews weren't great, but I was very pleasantly surprised. It's basically a combination of Grand Theft Auto gameplay with a little more in depth shooting and simplified Assassin's Creed free running. The story is interesting, but nothing too original; it's basically Nazis killing people and you getting revenge for it. It does have a very interesting visual aspect, where the areas of France under occupation are presented in gloomy black and white. While when you liberate the area it is presented in glorious color. The only problem with this concept is that the game has some beautiful graphics, but when they're in black in white the picture is ugly, dull, and less detailed making it at times tough to navigate especially when climbing. Also, when you liberate areas the Nazis are still there, nothing really changes other than the color.The main gameplay involves sneaking around and planting bombs, then when you're noticed it turns into a shooter. It's done really well, though at times it's annoying how easy the people discover you. The AI is very inconsistent, where at times they're idiotic simpletons, yet at others every Nazi is shooting you with pinpoint accuracy from very far away while you're running through a forest. The driving is another large aspect of the game, and it's very similar to GTA, serviceable but very floaty. The free-running could be very fun at times, I just almost wish there would have been more of it.Overall, I just really enjoyed playing the game, there's always things to complain about but it's still really fun. Every poor gamer out there should check out this game, it provides hours of entertainment, as long as you suffer through a few annoyances.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000035Y4T","description":"The game that rocked the world and changed arcade-style fighting forever returns in all its splendor. Choose from eight unique characters (some familiar faces have returned from the original, but a few new combatants make for spiced-up action), as you try to pummel your computer-controlled opponents to death. Each character has special moves that only he or she can pull off, making the game full of plenty of surprises...and blood. As with the original, whichever character wins the battle gets the opportunity to complete a Fatality, which is every bit as violent as it sounds. There's a reason that this game was so overwhelmingly popular, and the cold-blooded, hand-to-hand combat is as fun today as it was when it first came out.","reviewerName":"Simon","summary":"The series in its prime","reviewText":"Mortal Kombat II is widely held as the best installment of the bloody fighting series. Graphics and sound have been given a nice upgrade since the first installment, and controls are tight and responsive. The game walks a fine line between dreary, violent gore (ripping torsos apart, cutting people in half, impaling them, etc) and light humour (Friendship moves, Babalities). Too much of the latter turned the next installment of the franchise into self-parody, but it's kept in check here. The game features one of the most memorable roster of fighters since the original Street Fighter II, and gameplay is loose enough to let players develop their own combos. Finally, lots of secret characters and easter eggs await those who search hard enough.The SNES version is definitely superior to the Genesis port this go-around, with all of the gore intact and presentation true to the arcade. Still one of the best conversions of Mortal Kombat II. If you own an SNES and still don't have this gem, get it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2006"}
{"product_name":"B000099T2G","reviewerName":"R.A. McKenzie","summary":"Ever Have One Of Those Games Or Movies You Can't Bring Yourself To Hate?","reviewText":"It's tough to explain why a certain videogame was fun for me, while it has been rightfully criticized by others for its shortcomings.\"Rise To Honor\" is a short game, with decent graphics, basic level design, silly stealth missions, ridiculous action sequences, and a relatively simple story.  But like a typical action movie, it's one of those rentals that I can't bring myself to hate.  I enjoyed the barrage of bad guys to beat up.  I enjoyed the simplicity of those stupid stealth levels.  I enjoyed travelling from Hong Kong to San Francisco, combatting my way to the truth.  I enjoyed the mindless gunplay.  Most of all, I appreciated how the story --- while nothing special --- was treated with some decent drama.At its core, \"Rise To Honor\" is a chance to show off how you, the gamer, control Jet Li's body to kick all sorts of bad guy butt.  The motion-capture work is incredible, even years after its release.  You truly feel like Jet Li is the star of your own action picture, and it's the one element that will pull gamers through.  The story isn't worth going into, but let me just say that I enjoyed how Jet Li's undercover cop is thrust into a tale of betrayal, and tries to avenge who killed his honorable crime boss (strange, I know).  And what a coincidence...he finds his two childhood friends while fighting his way to through the end!\"Rise To Honor\" is a failure for some gamers because it tries to do a little bit of everything.  One level, you'll be using your martial arts to beat up some bad guys.  Suddenly, you're asked to unload bullets into countless foes.  Then, you're sneaking into a party from guards with flashlights.  It gets even crazier when you're outrunning a helicopter, dodging a sniper, and using a hospital stretcher to chase a villainess.  But you see, this variety works for me.  I know that many games have better fighting, better shooting, and better stealth.  But \"Rise To Honor\" somehow pulled it off for me, because it gave the basic tools I needed to entertain myself in one short dose after another.\"Rise To Honor\" is like playing an action movie.  The levels are divided up like a DVD chapter menu!  Just skip to your favorite part once you've finished it.  There are even making-of featurettes detailing the hard work that Sony put in.  This game will not go down as a classic, nor does it deserve to be.  But it is not a trainwreck that deserves endless scrutiny.  \"Rise To Honor\" is one of those rentals (or cheap buys) that won't disappoint you.  It doesn't aim for greatness, so why should you expect it?","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2010"}

For the life of me, I couldn't understand the wow factor of this new system -- why a game pad was an improvement over a Wiimote.So, I've been playing Nintendo Land with my son today. Nintendo Land is like being in a big carnival with a bunch of little games to play. We only have one game pad, so I use the Wiimote while he's on the game pad or vice versa.We can't seem to play Nintendo Land without a game pad. I suppose that's the whole point of Wii U. It's like a fat, touch-sensitive tablet with a small screen and physical buttons in the same configuration as the 3DS (except there is a thumb joystick on both sides). I can swipe the pad for some actions, move the pad through the air to aim, or use the joystick and buttons when needed. Sometimes, my action is on the game pad while my opponent's perspective is on the screen (seemingly necessary because he is using the Wiimote). Other times, I can't play unless I'm actually staring at the television while at the same time swiping my pad. I'm finding game play with it less than stellar. It's big and clunky to hold, not entirely intuitive. Worst of all, it is awkward -- not at all a recipe for an immersive experience. I still don't see the point, except to make it something different from the Wii. Am I on a tablet in my own world or am I playing on the television screen? For the opponent holding the Wiimote, it's just like playing the Wii so why not both have a Wiimote and just play the Wii?If I wanted to play on a tablet, I'd have bought a tablet. This attempt to merge tablet and Wiimote just doesn't work. That's just me. My eleven year-old son is playing with his friend right now. He rates this system five stars. His friend rates it a million (will count that as 5). I am not sure how this will pan out in the long run. I like video games, but maybe time is catching up with me and the latest is no longer the greatest. My personal rating is three stars, averaging out to 4 1/3 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2012"}

What greed.The gameplay is pure one-on-one fighting. You can choose from a number of fighters (I choose Sub-Zero), and then you battle onward from fighter to fighter. Eventually, you'll get to the Endurance rounds, which let you face against the defeated fighters, but you must face 2 under one go.

It's got more bugs in it than a $20 an hour motel room.  I can't get past the 2nd level - \"Shore Leave\".  I've sniped all the bad guys and the mission flat-out refuses to end.  What the hell??  I consulted a few walkthroughs just to see if maybe I was missing something and this seems to be a common occurence.  Seems a lot of people confuse, misunderstand or just plain don't read the user complaints and instead they advise to take \"bullet drop\" into account.  I've taken bullet drop into account, there are no enemies to shoot at, they're all dead, the mission just won't end!  I also found several other bug complaints by other people thruought the game, but I have yet to experience them since I can't even get past the second stinking level.  I loved the previous game \"Medal of Honor\" and found that I preferred it over the arcade-ish Call of Duty Games and I was really looking forward to this sequel.  What a disappointment.  You'd think they would have patched a game stopping bug like this by now, I guess EA has our money and they don't care?  It also suffers from what I call TFD (tiny fonts of death) which seems have become something of a trend in newer games.Update 6/28/13 - Finally got thru that stupid sniping level.  The only workaround I was able to find in various gaming forums was to just keep trying until it works, and finally, magically, it worked.  I know you're thinking \"why did you go back and play the game if you hate it so much?\"  Well I paid good money for this stupid game and by God I'm going to finish it even if it kills me, or at the very least raises my blood pressure a few points.  So I kept trying over and over and over again, playing that last portion of \"Shore Leave\" from the last check point and it finally just worked, only to find out the next item in store for me was....  a keep-up-with-the-bad-guy car chase driving level.  So out of the frying pan and into the fire!!  At least they were generous with the checkpoints and I was able to get thru it fairly painlessly.  After that I finally got back to the \"shooter\" parts of this first person shooter, then an on-rails turret shooter segment in a boat, after which I had to drive the boat myself... sigh...  then a cinematic which paused a few times before completely freezing up.  This is going to be a tough road to hoe, I can see it.  I'll be putting this game up for sale or trading it in as soon as I finish, if doesn't kill me first.  Of course I'll have to deal with the guilt of playing a part in the pain and suffering of some other poor gamer by selling it, but I can't in good consience let this thing occupy space on my shelf after I'm done with it.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2013"}

In Little Big Planet 2, the most major changes are the new Creatinator, Controlinator, Grabinator, and the Sackbots.The Controlinator, in my opinon, is the best. It lets you control an object that you create. You use this a lot in the story. In the story, you use it for flying bees, controlling a hamster thing, controlling a dog, controlling a bunny and much more. Using this in community creations lets you almost do anything.The Creatinatior is my second favorite. It is a hat that lets you shoot stuff from a small cannon on the hat. You control this a similar way to the paintinator, but instead of paint, it shoots anything you want it to. You use this in the story by shooting cakes at monsters and walls.The Grabinator lets you pick things up. It is very simple. You pick things up and throw them around. In the story, you use this to pick up and throw bombs, jelly, cake, and other players. The story even has a basketball level, where you have to throw a ball into the hoop. Speaking of the basketball level, This brings me to my next subject.Versus Levels are very fun when you have two people, but they can be annoying or boring when you are alone, so this game is much better when you have a friend to play with.Sackbots are always fun, but it is hard to find a way, in my opinion, to use them in your own level.If you are interested in this game, get it the first chance you can, because this is a very good game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2011"}

When I saw Folklore debuted at E3 '05 I was stunned by the beautiful visuals and charming idea of capturing fairies \"ID\" and using them to attack. After the game's release two years later is received luke warm reviews with most people complaining of the difficulty and repetition, and I have to agree.Game play wise Folklore takes a step in the right direction, but then trips with flawed execution. You can capture dozens of fairies and store them for later use. Each realm has different types of fairies and they are used not only to fight certain enemies, but bosses as well. Some fairies are weak against some and immune to others. You can assign fairies to each face button and execute them as attacks. This is the step in the right direction, but the trip up is the flawed mechanics. Every time you attack with a fairy the character stops and then the animation is played out. This can be very frustrating when fighting fast-moving fairies or bosses. Another flawed element is you don't know what fairy is good against each other because there is no data letting you know. You have fairies classified under elements, but you don' t know which can fight which unless you equip and unequip each fairy and this is daunting.If that sounds bad enough navigating through the levels is extremely hard despite the extreme linearity of the game. Most levels are like mazes that give you no direction on which to go and re-spawning enemies every time you reenter an area is a disaster. Really? Re-spawning enemies? C'mon. You have to fight each area to acquire the IDs to break certain gems or fight bosses. After you have visited an area once you can just run by them all. Another thing that I hate is there is no way to use items. You can collect karma items, but I have no idea what they are used for. Health can only be generated by save spots or when enemies drop them and this is rare. If you die you have to start all over again from the last save point.The other useless and annoying element to the game is the MP bar. It regenerates, but there is no special magic attacks so using your only attacks that drain a bar is absurd. After a few hits you have to wait for it to regenerate and this can be very annoying when fighting enemies that have timed down times.If you want to talk about something that really annoys me? There are 8 chapters in the game and each character has 6, but when you get to chapter 7 you have to play 1-6 with the other character. Playing through an already frustrating game twice to see the ending? Almost not worth it. The game does have a great mystery murder type story that will keep you guessing all the way through, but there are even problems with that. Lots of text readings and hardly any cut scenes. The scenes are pre-rendered CGI which is what next generation technology is supposed to illuminate. You also get weird comic style panels that you can fast forward and then RPG type avatar conversation screens.There are positive notes that make the game worth at least renting, and the biggest one is the great use of the Sixaxis motion sensing. This is probably the most use I've seen from any PS3 game so far. When you defeat a folklore you will see a red soul come out of it and that is the sign to hit R1 and pull the controller up. Some bigger folklore and bosses have you whacking the soul side to side, pulling up at timed moments, and shaking the controller vigorously.The game's best feat is probably its looks with gorgeous landscapes and beautifully designed folklore, but that's really not enough to keep you playing. Once you get to chapter 7 and realize you have to go through the game again with the other character it makes you decide whether to tread on or give up. If the game wasn't so frustrating with all of it's weird quirky game play elements it would be an amazing adventure.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Derek Ryder","summary":"wow the price is exspensive and the battery time?","reviewText":"first of all sony should put the price down bye 100 or 50$ cuz people won't buy unless if people saved up money no wonder nintendo is winning the sales its cheap! but its powerfull the psp is powerfull too the psp is the most exspensive portable gaming system ever and the most powerfull you can play movies its alot for a movie thats why im not getting any! theres music i got a 32mb and 256mb you can put photos good clear pics! really the psp is hate it or love it cuz the battery life sucks but the recharger takes about 30 minutes to 1 hour to get full pretty fast the games are exspensive too soo if you have money or a job than this is for you if not it aint for you!overall:1.hardware 10/102.sound 5/10 its not that good when putting head phones on and you like to put your music on blast! dipset!!!3.battery life 6/104.price 7/10 kind of good for a system like this!5.memory sticks 9/10 only flaw on this is that when i put my 256mb it went to 230mb?6.games 7/10 not a good selection but heres a list of games i reviewed/recommend1.tony hawks underground (remix) 10/10 i recommend2.lumines 10/10 i recommend3.ridge racer 10/10 i recommend4.metal gear acid! 7.3 i recommend to any card game fans!5.mvp baseball 7.9/10 i recommend to any baseball fans6.mlb 8.5/10 i soo recommend best baseball game7.coded arms 6/10 i recommend it to any hard players since its hard and any shooter fans!8.need for speed underground 7.5/10 i recommend its good9.gretzky 6.1/10 i do recommend it to gretzky fans10.nba 6.1/10 i do recommend it to nba fans11.dead to rights 2.3/10 i do not recommend12.smart bomb 1/10 i do not! recommend!!!!!!13.midnight club 3 7.3/10 i do recommend to pactient people!14.ape escape 8/10 i recommend!15.rengoku 5/10 its average but i dont recommend!16.spider man 2 6.3/10 i recommend only to spiderman fans!17.mercury 5.6/10 i dont recommend18.dynasty warriors 7/10 i recommend to dynasty fans!19.darkstalkers 8/10 first fighter i recommend!20.wipeout pure 10/10 i soo recommend21.atv offroad furry 5/10 idont recommend because theres too many dirt racing games out anoying!22.untold legends 7/10 its ok i recommend!23.twisted metal 9/10 good game i recommend!24.fifa soccer 8.3 its ok i recommend25.hot shots 7/10 i dont recommend it to older than 20!26.nba showdown 8/10 i recommend27.nfl street 7.2/10 i recommend it to any football fans28.tiger woods 7.5/10 i recommend it to tiger fans only!29.world tour soccer 5.9/10 a little over average but its ok but still i dont recommend!now accesories:1.32mb 4/10 i dont recommend at all!2.pro gamers kit 3/10 i dont recommend3.psp charger case 7/10 i do recommend!4.psp deluxe carry case 3/10 i dont recommend5.psp case (3rd party) 3/10 i dont recommend6.psp docking station 10/10 i soo recommend7.psp logitech playgear amp 5/10 i dont recommend half sounds good?8.psp max power battery 3/10 i dont recommend its a scam10.psp movie dock! 7/10 i recommend!11.psp playgear pocket case 10/10 i soo recommend12.sandisk 1GB 10/10 i recommend13.sandisk 256mb 10/10 i recommend14.sandisk 512mb 10/10 i recommend15.stereo station 8/10 i recommend16.safe case 1/10 not a safe case really i dont recommend!17.psp pro-teckkit 2/10 i dont recommend18.psp screen armor 2/10 i dont recommend19.psp screen protector 1/10 useless i dont recommendmovies are worthless cuz its so exspensive i only recommend them to any one who has money to spend on a movie for the psp for 30$ when you can get one on a dvd for 19$ hope i helped","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2005"}

The game uploaded and downloaded straight to my Origin account as soon as I bought the game.Yeah, the game has jetpacks, wall running, and other decent features. But behind the few new and fresh additions, it feels like something I have already played for years. It's twitch shooting, the pilots (actual players, non-AI) jump and run around when shooting. You think Call of Duty is bad with twitch shooting - try this game. If you are not one with fast reactions - don't bother with this game - as you will get slaughtered.The 6v6 gameplay is stale. Don't get me wrong, the game is fun, but I find myself hardly ever finding pilots. I usually just run into Titans and Bots. Speaking of, bots are literally some of the dumbest AI ever to exist in MP games. I don't even shoot them anymore - as you can stand in a group of them and they literally will take 5 minutes to kill you. Second of all, Titans are hard to kill. Not as in they dominate infantry, but as in they are tanks. It literally takes 6-8 lock on rocket shots to doom a titan - if you're lucky. Titans are fun to run along in and pvp another titan, but again, it takes way too long to kill other titans. Also, automated titans are beyond stupid.Level design is outstanding, Respawn did a great job implementing a fresh way of traversing through levels. No spawn killing. No weird \"killed in action\" type events. Just good MP maps with great shooting mechanics.The game runs great all in all. I hardly come across bad latency, sync issues, p2p connection issues, lagging, hit detection, etc.It's too bad that after playing this game for only 2-3 hours, I find myself getting bored.Graphics - This is obviously an XB1 game at it's finest. Even with all the graphics turned up, the game looks like a console port.Customization - It simply lacks compared to BF4 and COD. No perks, only a couple things to add in to your weapons, and not a lot of items to equip to your character. There are only 8 or so guns in the entire game. 1 smart pistol, 1 shotgun, 2-3 assault guns, 2 snipers, and 2 smgs. Slim pickings.Verdict - This game is fun, I feel Respawn wanted to create a \"home-like\" experience (creators of COD games) but with a new fresh appeal. They certainly did that. I just feel they did it wrong. 6 v 6 is plain boring on most of the maps. The whole point of competitive MP games is to face other -real- players, not bots or auto-titans.

{"product_name":"B000AB603U","description":"It's the dawn of a new age in real-time strategy (RTS) games. A brave New World is rising--a hostile yet beautiful world, filled with innovative gameplay, new strategic scenarios, eye-searing graphics and much more. Welcome to a world calledAge of Empires III.CampaignIn this action adventure tale of historical fiction, players take on the role of Morgan Black and his family, struggling against the hostile wilderness and a mysterious cult that's crept in from Europe.In a series of 24 scenarios divided into three acts, Morgan Black and his descendants help the Aztecs resist conquest by Spanish conquistadors, pit the French against the British in the French and Indian War and help Simon Bolivar lead revolutions in South America.MultiplayerWhether you're searching for a quick game or hoping to talk strategy with friends online,Age of Empires III's Multiplayer site is your community destination.Here, you can play with persistent Home Cities that gain power and strategic options the more games you play, compete for a spot on dozens of ladders, help organize your clan or chat after a game -- all without leaving the multiplayer portal.Fans ofAge of Mythology's Quick Search can still look for games swiftly, while players looking for something specific can browse game lists to find the set of options that matches their tastes.New Feature--Home CitiesThis revolutionary new feature to the RTS landscape is incorporated into all aspects ofAge of Empires III-- from Campaign to Multiplayer -- and is unlike anything you've experienced before.Much like the persistent character from a role-playing game that encourages you to keep playing, your Home City is an important support system to your efforts in the New World. During a game, your Home City can regularly send you supplies or military reinforcements.You are the leader of your colony, but your success brings glory back to Mother Europe. The more games you play, and the better you do, the more powerful your Home City will become. Every few games, you gain the ability to both upgrade and customize your Home City:Upgrade your city by unlocking new types of soldiers or buildings, or improving those you already have.Broaden your tech tree in whatever direction most fits your play style--invest in warships, native alliances, cavalry, artillery or economy.Customize your Home City by changing the appearance of buildings, the weather or even the types of people who walk, work and perform in its streets.Throughout a game, as well as in between games, you can visit your Home City to watch its citizens go about their lives, get an opinion on how you're doing, plot your next move or just marvel at the beautiful sunset.Full 3-D Graphics, Destructible Environments and MoreWe first set out to reproduce the rich detail ofAge of Empires II: Age of Kings. As we strove to make the fascinatingAge of Empires IIItime period come alive, that goal quickly evolved: We at Ensemble Studios wanted to create the best-looking game ever. From the stunning water effects to the hundreds of units battling on-screen, you'll feel like you're a part of the action in the New World.Tone mapping--This photo imaging technique balances the colors in a scene on the fly. The end result is a rich, warm game where bright colors are vibrantly rendered alongside darker counterparts, such as shadows.Lighting and shadows--The sun is always shining inAge of Empires, so it's important that lighting and shadows be an awe-inspiring experience. Units and buildings cast shadows according to a real sun position, and even cast shadows on each other. High Dynamic Range rendering allows us to represent the shiny glints of sunlight that bounce off highly reflective surfaces.Bump and specular mapping--Water glistens like water. Metal shines like metal. These advanced techniques serve to provide an extra level of rendering detail heretofore unseen in real-time strategy (RTS) gaming.Water--We felt that portraying stunning, realistic water effects in the game was so important that we devoted a programmer to it full-time. You'll find the water rich with details like foam near the shore, accurately modeled water motion, flotsam in rivers and realistic water colors. Plus, reflections change with the viewing angle, the angle of sunlight and the motion of the water. The overall effect is breathtaking.Cliffs and Riverbeds--Instead of just stretching terrain, we built a system to attach geometry to the terrain map to allow for realistic overhangs and steep cliffs, from areas like the American Southwest. This effect is supported on random maps too.CivilizationsBritishQuick access to Settlers gives the British one of the strongest economies in the game. The ability to upgrade two key units -- the Musketeer and Hussar -- make the British military formidable in the late game. The British Home City emphasizes improvements to technology and naval warfare.DutchAlthough Dutch Settlers are limited and costly, their civilization makes up for this economic disadvantage by building Banks and generating coin automatically. The Dutch Home City emphasizes upgrades to defense and economy.FrenchAlthough the French economy starts slowly, the Coureur unit, a Villager with strong fighting skills, makes the French difficult to attack early. The French also have the strongest cavalry unit in the game -- the Cuirassier. Plus, the French are experts at allying with the Native Americans.GermanThe Germans have fewer Settlers and therefore a slower economy. Fortunately, both the Settler Wagon and Uhlan cavalry spawn for free from the German Town Center. Plus, the Germans start with the ability to send Mercenaries from their Home City (long before other civilizations can).Native AmericanEuropean civilizations can learn new technologies and gain troops by forging alliances with the Native Americans. A British player who allies with the Iroquois is essentially playing as two civilizations: the British and the Iroquois.OttomanFor the Ottomans, Settlers spawn automatically from the Town Center. Building a Mosque and conducting research help keep that Settler production steady. Befitting their position straddling Europe and Asia, the Ottomans have more unique units than any other civilization.PortugueseStarting the game with two Town Centers, the Portuguese can quickly produce Settlers, control territory or support their allies. The Spyglass ability allows the Portuguese to easily spy on the enemy. The Portuguese also have a strong navy, strong light infantry and the best Dragoons in the game.RussianStarting the game with extra resources but fewer Settlers gives the Russians the flexibility of focusing on economy or an early raid. Russian infantry, individually weak, are trained in blocks at a faster rate, providing the Russians with the opportunity to overwhelm their enemy with greater numbers.SpanishThe Spanish have a strong military, with both hand infantry and cavalry. Flexibility in early shipments from the Home City give the Spanish the option to attack early or set up for a strong, late economy. Spanish Home City improvements benefit soldiers, buildings and naval units.&nbsp;CombatAge of Empires IIIgives players an amazing amount of control over their side of the battlefield.More to command -- Not only are you in command of large and diverse armies of infantry, cavalry and artillery, but also Native American warriors, mercenaries and tall ships.Multiple formations -- You can assign different formations to your army for different strengths and weaknesses, or have the game automatically choose the most appropriate formation. Examples include:Volley -- ranged infantry, like musketeers, take turns firing at enemies ahead of them.Charge -- your soldiers walk, then run into combat. Cavalry wield sabers, and musketeers fix bayonets. This formation does tremendous damage but makes your soldiers more prone to injury.Bombard -- your soldiers protect the cannons, while the cannons shell enemy ranks. Available only when you have artillery in your army.Battles are easier to follow -- You can still command individual units.

A lot of the reviews are extremely mixed and offered up a wide variety of pros and cons for this game. I became a hard boiled fan of AOE1 way back when it first came out and you'd often find me facing off with friends via LAN while my Phonecian war elephants ran amok through their ranks. AOE2 was even better, allowing better tactics for your infantry and cavalry as well as great seige equipment and castles. So what new suprises lurk in AOE3?Well, the most obvious one that comes to mind is of course your home city. Bear in mind that this game takes place during the Imperial years, when the different nations of Europe began looking for new countries to colonize overseas. Your home city is more or less like your \"sponsor\", providing you with regular upgrades to your army, navy, and settlers. Constructing buildings, finding special landmarks, and killing enemies acrue experience points, and after accumulating so many you'll hit pre-determined points where you can cash them in for free shipments from your home city. Some of these can take the form of military units or raw materials, and sometimes buildings. After getting a whole lot of experience points your city goes up in level and you can buy items called \"cards\". Said \"cards\" can be built into a deck (kind of like a weird Magic:The Gathering thing) of free military units and upgrades which you can customize to the environment you wish to fight in. For instance, as the Dutch my military tends to be strong on skirmishers and naval units, so by buying the right cards I can hire a group of skirmishers to go over to my colony for free. Likewise I can send a large fort to help protect my frontiers. By saving up for the really good cards I can hire privateers to raid enemy shipping.Indiginous native tribes (nicely done, each tribe is map specific. Fighting in old Carolina you'll ally with Cherokee; in the Yukon it'll be the Nootka tribe, etc. You'll learn to love/hate the Iriqouis Mantlet unit) can be allied with to give you even more unit flexibility and upgrades. Even more there are \"trade routes\" and if you set up trading posts along these routes you regularly gain free exp everytime the trade cart comes by. If you reach the proper levels you can upgrade the simple travois trade system to a stagecoach, and ultimately to a locomotive system, getting you exp even faster. Needless to say the trade routes are highly sought after in any game and add a nice touch to the overall experience.Military units are often nation-specific and that too is a great touch to this game. I love sending large groups of Veteran Ruytens (Dutch cavalry armed with pistols) on raids against enemy settlers. The Russians have a specialized artillery called the War Wagon, basically a cannon encapsulated in a coach that gets pulled around the battlefield (and wreaks serious havoc, let me tell you). The Ottomans have cool rocket artillery that they can lay down surprisingly ferocious assaults with. These units are again nation-specific and make me want to try out a number of these different empires to see firsthand what the strengths and weaknesses are.On the domestic side Settlers, your basic jack-of-all-trades unit, can do the standard resource gathering. Mines, trees, and herds of animals to hunt are sprinkled liberally over most mapsets. If you run out of resources on a particular map there are still options to continue this resource building via the construction of Mills (food) or Plantations (gold). Should you choose to buy the Factory card (highly recommended) you can freely harvest any resource in the game at the touch of a button.Online play is offered via Ensemble's own gaming net, kind of like Battlenet but with a few less frills. Network lag is an issue with most games I've played in. It's a lot of fun going head to head with human players and many games will turn almost into bedlam with lots of mass attacks, feints, and artillery displays that will leave most gasping for air.There are some drawbacks to the game though. While you can arrange your armies into formations once the fighting starts they seldom hold it and often scatter in different directions. For instance, while my skirmishers and artillery tend to hold the line reasonably well I can expect my Halberdiers (guys wielding massive, hard-hitting polearms) and often my cavalry to just run amok and get picked off singly. This is sadly compounded by the limited view you have of the map. When your army starts to spread out too thin you'll spend far too much time trying to redirect them back into formation, and all too often having them do so gets them shot in the back as they amble back into ranks at half speed. Were there the option to zoom out just a *little* bit this would alleviate many combat issues. In addition to this problem there's also an issue I have with artillery. You can order them to attack a certain enemy position or building but oftentimes after the first salvo they'll fire independently at random targets. While sometimes this isn't bad, like when they're being charged by a squadron of Hussars they'll sometimes fire at these incoming threats. Other times they continue bombarding a small building oblivious to the line of Pikemen coming over the rise with cannon-killing fervor in their eyes.Still this is a fantastic game. It took a little getting used to to be sure, but I have found myself pleasantly addicted to this great game and I'm already looking for more. :)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2005"}

I heard all the hype before it was released but didn't put much thought into it.  Video games based off of pre-existing superheros are almost always terrible, especially Batman games.  But I started hearing really good things about the game and when Amazon had it on sale for the Christmas season I decided to buy it...boy am I glad I did.As soon as the opening scene starts though you know you're playing something special.  Something that wasn't made to co-incide with a movie release but instead was made by Batman fans FOR Batman fans.Batman: Arkham Asylum starts off on the right foot by disassociating itself with any Batman movies or TV shows.  Arkham Asylum is a location from the comic books, a great place to venture.  You play Batman...not Christian Bale or Michael Keaton as Batman, just Batman.  Another step in the right direction.  The game doesn't get stuck on the Heath Ledger Joker mythos, it sticks with the traditionally styled characters.Joker has been captured by Batman but when he is taken to Arkham Asylum he breaks free and takes over the institution.  Your job is to stop the Joker and his minions and restore order.  The story itself isn't anything particularly flashy, but how the story is revealed is brilliant.  It might as well be a Batman movie as the action and gameplay are both top notch.  From your Bat-gadgets, the combat, everything just feels right and implementing them is extremely easy to do yet difficult to master.It was great to see some of my favorite villians from the Batman series and see how they are portrayed in the game.  The graphics are some of the best I've seen on the Xbox 360, animations are great, and the game has some of the best voice talent I've ever heard in a video game.  I guess that's to be expected considering the long line of well known talent they have, including a stand out performance by Mark Hamill as The Joker.The only thing I really didn't like in the game was the boss of the game.  I don't want to spoil anything but lets just say that they take someone way out of character.Overall I could not be more pleased with this game.  Well...I could be more pleased...if it were longer.  Not that it's a short game, but when the game ended I wanted it to go on so badly!  I'd have to rank the events leading up to the first encounter with Scarecrow as one of the greatest moments ever in gaming for me, it was just so cinematic.If you're a fan of Batman, a fan of action adventure games or just someone who loves a good game you owe it to yourself to give Batman a try.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00D41GCVS","description":"Sonic moves like never before. Vault over obstacles, free run up and along walls and sky dive between islands at lightning speed. Plus the Spin Dash is back.","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A (mostly) great new formula for Sonic with tons of potential (Important update at the end!)","reviewText":"Before I say anything else, let's get one thing clear right off the bat: do NOT rely on the majority of mainstream gaming \"journalists\" (pffft) or the plethora of pretentious, snarky reviews when trying to form an opinion on this game. After playing the game for a couple hours, it became clear to me that most media site reviewers didn't spend more than an hour, maybe two, before lazily writing the game off, as they so often are wont to do with Sonic games for the past half-decade. This is painfully evident when you compare the cringe-inducing lack of comprehension or skill in their video reviews with gamers with actual ability and aptitude who have posted their own gameplay videos online. This is a new Modern Sonic, totally different from most 3-D Sonic games thus far, and it requires a lot more than squirrel-tier ADHD in order to get down the basics of the game. When you devote the time and energy to become acquainted with the new gameplay mechanics and level design, however, you'll find that Sonic Lost World is a modern Sonic gem. Sure, it has its flaws, but overall, it is approximately as good as the stellarSonic Colorswas for the Wii, at least in my opinion anyway. For the sake of actually giving the game a fair chance and being informative, this is going to be a long review, written by a lifelong Sonic fan for all the Sonic fans out there. Either buckle up or jump ship now, you've been warned.The game begins with Sonic and Tails chasing Dr. Eggman (*sigh* I miss Robotnik) in the clouds, where they discover \"Lost Hex,\" a floating world that looks like Little Planet fromSonic CDmeets the fractured world fromSonic Unleashed, made from Hexagons. After being stranded on this world, a new group of villains called \"The Deadly Six\" take over Eggman's forces. This impels Sonic and Eggman to form a tentative partnership in order to stop the Deadly Six from destroying the world and that's all I'll say about the plot to avoid spoilers. The story in Sonic Lost World continues in the narrative tradition set by the lovely Sonic Colors andSonic Generations. That been said, expect a plot that would stand out and shine in any Saturday morning lineup. The writing is truly funny and heartwarming, the cutscenes are well done, and the voice acting is top-notch. I genuinely loved every bit of the story in this game. As lighthearted as it tends to be, there are some surprisingly dark moments as well, for a Sonic game anyway. Seeing Eggman bicker with Sonic and Tails, taking jabs at each other while trying to work together, is an absolute joy. Most of the new Deadly Six villains are not nearly as likable or unique as the main characters, but all fit the role of cartoon villains well enough I guess. I must say, this is the most bad@$$ depiction of Eggman since Deem Bristow's Robotnik from the Adventure games. Awesome. As with most Sonic games in recent memory, the game opens and ends with a breathtaking CG cutscene that makes me yearn for a Pixar-esque Sonic movie.Speaking of high-quality visuals, boy is this game gorgeous! Much like everything else in the game, the art design and graphics are clearly designed to emulate the classic Genesis titles. The levels are breathtakingly beautiful, full of vibrant colors and jaw-dropping vistas of Lost Hex. Each section of the game has unique themes with tons of variety within. Of course, this is a Sonic game, so there will be  levels reminiscent of Green Hill Zone, as well as levels themed on casino nights (complete with pinball machines), icecaps, mystical caves, and sugary delights. It's all a joy to take in. Character designs are also a delight, featuring many of the classic badniks that we've all known and loved from the Genesis days, complete with trapped flickies and other cute animals inside, as well as the more recent egg-pawns. What a joy it is to see those baddies make a return. The game runs very smoothly at 60 fps as well, which is a big boon in its favor. The sound design is equally nostalgic. Many old-school sound effects make a return that adds up to the classical mood of the game overall. Best of all is the delicious soundtrack. Sonic games always have noteworthy soundtracks, but this one is incredibly good. The tunes are varied, catchy, and all are equally superb. Some tracks even sound like the beautiful, uplifting music from theNiGHTSseries. I could listen to Tropical Coast Zone 3/Lava Mountain Zone 2 all day long; what a breathtakingly beautiful song! This game has stupendous visuals and audio, for sure.The biggest change to this game over Sonic's last installment is the gameplay. How does it work? Deliciously, for the most part. To be honest, I have never played a 3-D Sonic game that is as faithful to the 2-D Genesis classics in concept and execution as Sonic Lost World is. Seriously, I'm a lifetime fan of the blue blur.Sonic the Hedgehog 2was my first ever video game and is still one of my all-time favorites, and ever since then I've been a huge fan of Sonic. SLW feels like the classic Genesis Sonic titles played from Sonic's perspective in a (mostly) 3-D style game (similar in concept toSuper Mario 3D Land/World). Much like recent Sonic games, however, there are plenty of 2-D sections as well that are just as fun.Rather than being the ridiculously fast \"boost to win\" Sonic of the past several years, SLW is much more about acceleration and maintaining momentum through skillful platforming. Liberal, intelligent use of the spin dash is essential if you want to experience Sonic's trademark speed. Controlling Sonic himself actually feels akin toSonic Adventureandits amazing sequel, with more layers of complexity added in. Sonic can use a double jump similar to the one from Sonic Colors, but SLW does it much better in my opinion. There are two types of homing attacks. One is the more traditional homing attack, the other causes Sonic to punt an enemy into others to take them out. Pushing the L-stick by itself causes Sonic to break out in a leisurely jog similar in pace to Mario. Press the R-Trigger while moving and Sonic breaks into a good paced run. This R-Trigger also causes Sonic to perform parkour moves in certain contexts, such as near walls or up trees, etc. To be sure, this control scheme is rather complex, even for a Sonic game, and it will take a bit of time to get used to its intricacies and nuances. When you do so, you'll find the control mechanics are extremely pleasing to use. Chaining together a long line of rapid wall runs is super satisfying. Some sections feature Sonic running at break neck speeds. Believe it or not, these are a lot like the mach speed sections fromSonic 06 *shudders*, but MUUUUCH better. In fact, they're very refined and ridiculously fun here.These control mechanics are also complemented very well by levels that are, for the most part, extremely well-designed. I would go so far as to say this is some of the most thoughtful, insightful level design from Sonic Team in years, perhaps the best since Sonic Adventure 2. Much like Sonic's best classic games, levels are filled with multiple pathways that are designed to cater to players of almost any skill level and play style. Some paths may be for people who like to explore, others utilize Wisps (more on that in a bit), others are all about extreme parkouring, others are for newcomers to the series, etc. Many of the cylinder-like structures you traverse actually feature at least  two or three different types of pathways. Several Eggman capsules are in every level, waiting for Sonic to come and rescue the animals within (which you need to do to unlock later levels). Collectibles like red star rings are expertly hidden and super satisfying to acquire. Comparison to Super Mario Galaxy is understandable when you see the planetoid structures, but the way Sonic Team crafts them around Sonic's unique gameplay mechanics make SLW a wholly unique experience. Seriously, I am incredibly impressed by the aptitude of Sonic Team's level designers in this game. I'd even go as far as to say there's a subtle brilliance in the level design.The game is a Wii-U exclusive, and as such, expect liberal use of the gamepad's special features. Some of it works fairly well, some not so well. Wisps return from Sonic Colors, and all feature some sort of motion/touch controls. Sometimes this is great. The orange rocket wisp, for example, feels much like the canon from recent Mario 3-D games, where you use the gyroscope to aim. This feels great. On the other hand, in order to use the Cyan light-speed wisp, you have to aim and flick your finger across the touch screen; the problem is, it just doesn't always work so well and it feels like a gimmick, to the point of distraction. SLW's status as a Wii-U showcase is a mixed bag, honestly. This is more of a core Sonic showcase in general, and I think that aspect should have received more focus from Sonic Team during development. Don't view this as a killer app for the Wii-U, just view it as a great new Sonic game.Make no mistake, the core game of SLW is truly thrilling and a refreshing breath of fresh air, but it's not a perfect game. One thing I both love and loathe Sonic Team for sometimes is their insistence on throwing as many ideas into their games as possible, even when it's unnecessary and at the expense of refinement. I applaud the level of enthusiasm and creativity they poured into this game, but some ideas just don't work so well and result in a ridiculous amount of frustration. For example, there's an ice level where you have to roll Sonic around a death-trap obstacle course while encased in a giant snowball. The physics are wonky here and the level design can be downright cruel, resulting in frequent cheap deaths. Talk about infuriating. Some of the wisp powers feel unnecessary, with painfully shoehorned motion/touch elements that take attention away from the core game. I hate gimmicks like that. Sections where you have to bounce from super small trampoline clouds are annoying because of a bad combo of floaty controls and poor spatial awareness due to the camera. Other design choices are jarring for the franchise and poorly conceived. Collecting 100 rings no longer gets you an extra life. Are you kidding me Sonic Team? Why?! Also, much like Sonic Colors and Generations, there can be some brutal, I-want-to-chuck-the-gamepad-into-the-wall difficulty spikes at times, especially later in the game. While that isn't necessarily a massive flaw, things like this can add up and steal away the big doofy grin the rest of the game has given you. Undeniably, one of the most disappointing things about the game by far are the incredibly lame boss fights. You'd think with the name \"Deadly Six,\" there would be epic boss battles in SLW, but no. Many are anti-climatic because of how ridiculously easy they are, taking seconds... wait seconds? Yes, SECONDS, to beat. Even the bosses later in the game are a joke. Most of the bosses seem to be inspired by boss concepts from the Genesis titles, transposed into a 3-D game, which is a great idea, but the execution here leaves a lot to be desired. Some are genuinely thrilling and well designed, but for the most part, they're nowhere near the level of awesomeness that Sonic boss fights have been in recent years, sadly.All things considered, Sonic Lost World is a great Sonic game, at least equal in quality to Sonic Colors. It may have its flaws and some of the game will infuriate you, but I find that for every moment that enrages me, there are four or five that slap a big doofy grin on my face. The game is beautiful and as a new modern Sonic platformer, it is a truly great start. I hope the jaded, cynical, and hypocritical reaction of the gaming press doesn't condemn this new formula for Sonic games into an early grave. If Sonic Team sticks to this formula in future installments, they could truly refine it to a level of perfection that could be as high-quality as Sonic's very best 3-D games. So don't be shy, and don't let many of the unprofessional \"professional\" reviews dissuade you from giving the game a chance. Much like The Wonderful 101, this is a game that rewards players for taking the time to learn the game and master its level layouts and gameplay mechanics. Every Sonic game has been like this. I guess the \"pro\" reviewers forgot that. If you're still not convinced, I implore you to look up footage of people who are decent at video games playing it online and try to tell me the game doesn't look fun and isn't at least worthy of your consideration. As for me, I'd definitely recommend this game to Sonic fans and Wii-U owners alike, and find it to be a solid 8/10: It's a great new direction for Sonic with room for improvement in (hopefully) future installments. Give it a try, and you may be surprised at just how much of a good time you'll have with Sonic in this Lost World.*Update 12/29/13*It appears Sonic Team was listening to fan feedback the last few weeks. I'm not exactly sure when, but Sega has released a patch for Sonic Lost World that actually corrects some of the poor design choices I originally cited as negatives for the game. Now, 100 rings DOES net you a 1-UP. Great! You also get ten lives after a game over instead of five. The difficulty many people have complained about is really not much of an issue anymore, as these changes make extra lives much more abundant. Even better, the new upgrade now makes it an option to control wisp powers via traditional button inputs instead of ONLY using some sort of gamepad gimmick, thank god! The game is now noticeably better because of these changes. They have also released FREE (for now anyway) DLC that lets you play through a few levels with a Yoshi's Epic Yarn theme as Sonic, complete with Shy Guys and everything! In the future, there will be another Nintendo DLC level or two, widely believed to be centered on the Zelda series. That. Is. Awesome. Can't wait. Because of the things I discussed in this upgrade, I increase my score from 8/10 to a 8.5/10. BOOM! I've noticed that Sonic Lost World has been pretty polarizing in the fanbase. Some fans love the game (I myself fall into that category), others hate it with a passion (for some reason). If you are still on the fence, there's a DEMO you can play of the game on the eshop, so you can see if it's for you or not before spending your money. I implore you guys to at least give the demo a shot. What have you got to lose? You may just end up liking the game. Imagine that! :D","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2013"}

You really can't tell what you're going to say, and your choices are timed. For example, your response choices may be something like &#34;passive, aggressive, suave, or happy&#34;. Pick one. The problem is that you can't tell what you're going to say based on words like that. Unlike some games, your character actually speaks (instead of you just selecting a response and listening to what the other person says). But your response is timed; you don't have much time to think about each of the word choices based on the conversation. If you don't respond in time (5 seconds or less), then your answer becomes whatever your cursor happens to be highlighting at the time. I don't call that RPG. Also, does it really matter what you say? I got the impression that it doesn't.The mini-games (like hacking and lock picking--which are essential to completing missions) are not very responsive to keyboard and mouse controls. This is especially true of hacking, which is incredibly awkward and frustrating when using a keyboard and mouse.I got bored with this game after a short while and stopped playing. For me, the story was boring, not engaging, nothing new. The RPG was poorly executed. The mini-games were annoying. The controls/menu system were clunky. I'm not sure if I'll try to play it again. Honestly, I'd rather re-play other/better games I've played in the past, than try to play this one.I purchased it new from an amazon seller called &#34;the General Store&#34;.

{"product_name":"B002KSPKRS","description":"The Ear Force X41 is Turtle Beach&rsquo;s top-of-the-line XBOX 360 headset featuring 7.1 channel Dolby surround sound, XBOX LIVE chat and a digital RF wireless connection for crystal-clear game audio.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview:Combining outstanding comfort with a stunning 360 degree sound field and enhanced online communication, the X41 puts you in the middle of the action so you&rsquo;ll enjoy a gaming experience that&rsquo;s second to none.Playing your favorite XBOX game with the Ear Force X41 is like having a &ldquo;secret weapon&rdquo; in your arsenal. You&rsquo;ll get a competitive advantage by hearing sound cues that youcan&rsquo;thear with speakers, such as the soft footsteps of an enemy sneaking up behind you, or the loading of a weapon far in the distance, regardless of the direction. By hearing sounds others can&rsquo;t - and by knowing where they&rsquo;re coming from - you&rsquo;ll react faster and take them out before they takeyouout.If you&rsquo;re serious about XBOX 360 gaming, get serious about the sound. Invest in an Ear Force X41 and experience the game the way it was meant to be heard. It will help you to become a better player and you&rsquo;ll have a lot more fun enjoying your XBOX 360.&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround Sound Technology!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Take your gaming to the next level by experiencing how your Xbox 360 was meant to be heard!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Enjoy late night gaming without disturbing others!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround SoundThe Ear Force X41 transmitter uses a 150MPS Digital Signal Processor (DSP) to deliver genuine Dolby Digital sound, Dolby Pro Logic IIx, and Dolby Headphone surround sound processing technologies - the industry-standard formats for encoding multi-channel sound in XBOX 360 games and DVD movies. The X41 uses the latest version of Dolby technology to create realistic game sound in 7.1 channels for improved surround sound accuracy.Dolby Pro Logic IIx and Stereo EnhancerThe X41 transmitter incorporates the latest Dolby Pro Logic IIx decoding system for surround sound realism from Dolby Pro Logic II encoded audio. When used with stereo sources, the Dolby Pro Logic Decoder also enhances the sound by spreading the stereo signal to provide a &ldquo;wider&rdquo; effect. This results in a richer, fuller sound than normal stereo - almost as if it originates from outside of the headphones.2.4GHz Wireless Digital RF TechnologyThe Ear Force X41 transmits game audio to the headset with an uncompressed wireless digital radio frequency (RF) signal to deliver CD-quality sound that rivals professional-grade wired headphones. Best of all, the wireless RF signal does not require &quot;line of sight&quot; to operate. That means you can stand anywhere near your XBOX 360 and hear a clear, noise-free signal.Chat Boost&nbsp;Dynamic Talkback&nbsp;ExpanderIf you&rsquo;ve ever had trouble hearing teammates on XBOX LIVE when the game action heats up, then you know how frustrating it can be when you have to keep adjusting the chat volume. Chat Boost fixes this problem by automatically adjusting the XBOX Live chat level when the game gets louder, so chat from teammates isn't lost in the exciting parts of your game. As the game sound gets louder, Chat Boost turns up the chat volume automatically so you can still hear what everyone is saying.It's a simple solution to an annoying problem, and it all happens automatically - so you don't have to adjust anything!Microphone MonitoringIt's hard to hear yourself speak when a headset is covering your ears. The X41 corrects this annoyance with its microphone monitoring feature. The X41 adds a portion of the microphone signal into the headset signal, so you can hear a portion of your voice along with incoming chat and game audio. Microphone monitoring not only prevents you from talking too loud or accidentally yelling into the mic, it also eliminates that annoying &quot;clogged ears&quot; feeling when talking while the headset is covering your ears.Bass BoostThe X41 headset DSP also lets you turn on a Bass Boost feature that produces deep, rich bass tones by increasing the volume of low frequency sounds - just like turning up the volume on the sub-woofer on your home theater system. Bass Boost improves your gaming experience by kicking-up the sound level of explosions, gun shots and other deep-bass sound effects, making them even more dramatic.Wired Headphone ConnectionThe X41 transmitter includes a headphone output jack with volume control to connect an optional pair of wired headphones in addition to the wireless X41 headset. This jack outputs the same high-quality Dolby Headphone 7.1 surround sound that&rsquo;s being transmitted to the wireless X41 headset, which allows two people to hear the game sound at the same time.Independent Chat/Game VolumesSeparate volume controls let you adjust the game and chat levels individually, so you can easily balance them and never have to worry about missing a cue from your teammates.Advanced Battery Booster CircuitryThe X41 has a &ldquo;battery booster&rdquo; circuit that squeezes every last bit of power from the batteries and assures high quality sound until they&rsquo;re completely dead. This allows a pair of AAA Alkaline batteries to last for as long as 25 straight hours of game play. You can also buy standard rechargeable batteries in place of Alkaline batteries.Powered By USBThe transmitter is powered by a single USB port on your XBOX, or from a nearby PC or laptop. So there is no need to fuss with a separate AC power adapter.","reviewerName":"J. Young \"Hello\"","summary":"The X41 is nice, but not without flaws","reviewText":"The X41 is a nice headset hands down. I too owned the X4 and glad that I did.  Gaming has never been better for me.  Well, I saw the X41 available and thought I would give it a try.Pros:* I think the sounds quality is better than the X4. It seems more crisp.* Now uses RF versus IR so true line of sight is no longer required.* The headset is definitely lighter.* The controls on the headset were better thought out and easier to use with one hand while wearing it.Minor Annoyances:* Some may like the fact the microphone cable is no longer a puck connection to the controller.  So far, I do not like the volume control and mute being in-line with the cable. It is a little more inconvenient to easily mute quickly.  With the puck design, you did not have to take your hand off of the controller while playing to change volume or muting, but now you do.Cons:* The volume control on the headset seems to not be right. If I start as low as it will go, I have to go about three quarters of the way before I hear an sound and then it grows fast from there.* The microphone works the same way as the headset volume.  Hard to get it just right.  You have to go at least half way to hear anything and once you do hear something, the slightest movement up is too loud.* Battery life compared to the X4 is about 40% less.  Most likely due to the RF connectivity versus the IR.* The RF is very poor through even one wall 10 feet away.  At least with the X4, you may have lost audio altogether when you went to another room, but at least you could still talk on the mic.  The headset starts making loud crackles and pops when I move into the other room and is hard on the ears, so I have to turn them off or take them off.Outright Bad:Just one bad thing noticed so far.  The manual states that one way to tell your batteries are getting low is that you will start to hear crackling and pops.  Well let me tell you, at least for me, that is an outright lie.  I was playing on Live as usual.  I heard one quick crackle, played 5 more seconds, then the nastiest loudest screech and crackle and pooping came to my ears.  It honestly hurt until, as quickly as I could, took the headset off.  I do not play super loud, so if I did, then it would have been a huge problem.Overall a very nice headset.  I hope I got a bad device as I am exchanging this one for another to see if these issues will be better.  Either way, worth working through the problems, but definitely not a 5 star product yet.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2009"}

Well, now you can do whichever you'd like.A child wanders off and goes swimming in shark-infested waters. His parents pray to whatever dieties will listen, hoping that he will be saved. You are born from their need. You pluck the little idiot out of the sea and set him down with his parents, safe and sound. The parents are grateful and they want to take you back to their village to be worshipped by everyone.Since you're a new god, you have to learn how to pick things up, raise a creature, perform miracles, and more. Here to help educate you is your conscience: the side of good and the side of bad. These two are pretty entertaining. If you don't move for a while, they start say some funny stuff. You also meet other gods that try to help or hinder you.That creature I mentioned is a pet. It has different needs. It needs food, water, and rest, and it'll be happier and stronger if you play with it and have it work out. At first, it can only pick up small rocks and bushes. But if it trains, it will be able to pick up bigger stuff. It'll also do better in combat. Your creature can go into battle with other creatures. Sometimes, it's for a mission, and sometimes, to keep an enemy creature at bay. You can choose to hit, block, use a special attack, or heal.It can also learn to aide you. If it watches you or the villagers fish, it can learn to fish, too. It can feed itself or give the food to the villagers. Besides fishing, it can cast miracles, water crops, assign people to different jobs, provide wood, and more.You'll need it's help to fulfill the wants and needs of your people. They might ask for food, wood, buildings, children, or protection. It's hard to keep them satisfied.They can help themselves some of the time, though. You can assign people to jobs, like making babies, cutting down trees, or building. There are limited supplies of wood and food in each area, so you have to let it replenish or make some yourself. You can get food from fields, miracles, animals, or by fishing. You can water trees/forests to make them grow.You have various miracles at your disposal, ranging from healing to making piles of wood appear to hurling fireballs. To cast miracles, you can use a one-shot miracle, which can be found underneath things or given to you, or you can accumulate belief through your villagers' prayers.To move on in the game, you have certain missions to accomplish. Sometimes it's helping someone in need, sometimes it's defending yourself from a competing god, and sometimes it's getting a new village to believe in you. To gain a new village, you have to impress them, either through kindness or violence.You have a choice in almost anything of being good or evil. Your creature's appearance and behavior will be affected by your alignment. You can control him using a leash. You pull him in the direction you want him to go and tether him to anything you want him to interact with. If he does something wrong, you can slap hime. If he does it right, you can pet him. He'll learn through positive or negative reinforcement.I had one problem, and that was the fact that you can't skip the tutorial, so if you start a new game after beating it, it can get irritating.

Graphics are a top notch really makes you feel immerse with the characters and there surroundings which makes it really believable especially when your getting stalked around in the chilling woods at night and hearing the wind howling through the trees even the blinding light of Alan's flares will give a disorientated feel which makes intense scenes really terrifying. If you were to ask me if  this game is scary ? its not like Dead Space or F.E.A.R this game builds up the suspense and scares you at the right moments similar to Condemned: Criminal Origins but what really makes the suspenseful game is that you only rely on a flash light and some flares that will help Alan to seek the truth which builds the heart racing moments but as the game progress you will be able to find other weapons to fight off the darkness. Game mechanics are very fluid the combat system is really easy to grasp but the only flaw to is the vehicle which is terrible like for an example if you turn to a corner or even slightly turn the L Stick of the controller it cause the car or truck to power slide haha only gripe I have other than that the game is really exciting and rich even the voice actors are quite phenomenal in their performance for all the characters that you will meet during the game I would put this game 3rd behind Halo and The Las Of Us but hey that's just my opinion though hope this review was helpful.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2014"}

With that being said Im sure the haters will get on here and be ugly but that is of no shock to anyone.First off the Vita is the best handheld console to date period. The graphics on this thing are top notch for a handheld console. The 5 inch screen is amazing and is capable of 16 million colors on the screen at once. I cant really comprehend that, but thats what I have heard. The two joysticks are a huge plus and the power button is in a very good spot so you dont turn the thing off by mistake.I guess If i had to pick a con it would be the memory. You have to pay for your memory before you can even play the thing so dont forget it. At $20 for just a 4 gb memory chip it can get pretty pricey and you have to buy the vita memory chip. Other memory will not work in the vita.A huge pro in my opinion is the trophies sync. Us ps3 guys love our trophies (most of us anyway). You can view your trophies from your ps3 on your vita and it counts towards your ps3 trophies. pretty neat.I just wont make this review long because most people who will spend this much money on something will probably either do a lot of research or will buy it anyway.

Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World will sure to be an instant classic.","reviewerName":"maskedgamer","summary":"This game started it all for me!","reviewText":"This game turned me into a \"Tales of\" freak! To start off I will say that there is not many games on the Wii that are dissimilar. Most of them games designed for children ages 5-10, and not offering much for the mature player. I was looking for a new RPG to try out, and I caught an advertisement for Tales Of Symphonia 2. I guess that right there might be the throw off for alot of people; that have played and haven't played this game, that it is marked as a sequel. This game may be a \"2\" but it is really a stand alone game that just takes place in the same world. A lot of fans of the Original tales of Symphonia take this the wrong way because it's not focused around the old characters, and that it follows the story of 2 new characters Marta, and Emil.The game itself is designed for folks that are more interested in playing the game, rather than watch it being played. I.E. this is a real time combat game, vs.  a turn base game. It has a story line that makes final fantasy look like a mad TV skit, and it's combat play feels like street fighter. This game doesn't play around. The wii remote can make doing special easy for you, but you have the option of assigning your own moves to pull off wicked combo's. Yes, that is right you pull off combo's in this RPG. All the characters have awsome fighting skills, so you will be swapping from guy to guy. I even started playing Marta more because I enjoyed her fighting skills better. You also get to raise monsters that fight along with you, and in \"Pokemon\" fashion they evolve and turn into serious allies. Now it's really just a need addition to the game, but the game doesn't really focus around this ability. However, it really keeps the game interesting, and you'll be anxiously looking for mobs to fight.The Story is long, detailed, full of plot twist and turns, unpredictable, and certainly not what you would expect out of a Wii game. Judging by it's front cover, it just blends in with all the other Wii \"kiddie\" focused games. I had no idea there was actually a serious game underneath the surface. There is plenty of adult humor, gags, etc. that keep the game commical along side it's serious plot. The game is actually pretty deep, mainly because the main \"hero\" is an \"anti-hero\". Usually you expect the main hero to be fearless, but Emil is just the opposite. It's a great idea and it fits perfectly into the story. You grow just like your character when you play this game.Visually this game looks incredible. It's not trying to be something that it isn't. It's not trying to copy the life likeness that Final Fantasy games do. This is a Anime game, and it looks the part. Tales Of, was designed using stop motion technology, so the characters and animations move very surreal like. It's almost hard to describe, it's something you'd have to see if for yourself to understand.Overall this is a great game, and one of my favorite RPG's till this day. I now own all of the Tales Of American released games. This game truly made me a fan of the series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2009"}

It has always had more capabilities than the Nintendo DS because Sony seems to have aimed it more at a multi-media market that predated the iPad and our current generation of tablets.  It is bulkier (and a bit more fragile) than the DS, but the PSP is also aimed at a customer less likely to accidentally cover it in peanut-butter during a lunchtime gaming session.That said, is there really any need for you to be buying a PSP 3000 core system at this date?Really there'd be only one reason:  the disc.  Called \"UMD\", this miniature version of a DVD-ROM has gone away with the PSP Go.  Sony have said they'd like to have a way to let you carry all your UMD-based games over to the newer PSP models, but they can't really make that happen.  Next year in the United States will see the release of the next generation of PSP, the Vita.  It will also not support the UMD...but then again it'll be fairly more expensive than this PSP 3000 is now.If you already have a lot of UMD games in your library and your PSP is looking pretty beaten up...or if you feel the need to stock up on bargain UMD games and movies (UMD video was enough of a flop that anything released on it sells for next to nothing now), then you'll probably enjoy the PSP 3000 for a while.  You'll still be able to download games onto a Memory Stick from the PlayStation Store (which is what I do the most these days), but at some point you should expect this very fun ride to come to an end.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2011"}

Mysterious portals have appeared in them, leading him to disturbing alternate worlds. This game is a terrifying experience that fans and newcomers will never forget.","reviewerName":"Joy","summary":"The perfect game for spying on your neighbors!!","reviewText":"This Silent Hill 4 game gave me mixed feelings about it.  When I first watched my friend play it, it really bored me and made me not want to play it all.  It was nothing like Silent Hill's 1 through 3 and that's not a good thing!  But then when I first played it myself, I started to like it a little but it still wasn't even close to being as good as the first 3 Silent Hill games.The thing that really made me not like it was that the ghosts can harm you even though they don't even touch you and those Saint Medallions didn't last very long so after a while, it got very frustrating.  I did buy the game and actually found a way to enjoy playing it without the stress of ghosts taking away life:  using cheats with infinite health!!  I know that it defeats the purpose but I actually do like this game as far as storyline goes and the fact that you can't leave your apartment.  Some areas in the game are very interesting like The Prison and The Subway with that umbilical cord and The Hospital with those wheelchairs.  And the fact that you can see all these hauntings and spy on your neighbors is cool.  I definitely like this game now a lot more than at first and it's the hardest to play because of the ghosts.  It's not a scary installment but a very interesting and sometimes cryptic game.I also like how you can look out the windows in the apartment, listen to different things on the radio once in a while, and see different thoughts about the paintings in Henry's apartment after each level or so.  Throughout a lot of the game, Henry is with the neighbor Eileen and when you bring her to The Forest World, she'll read all these passages written on rocks and buildings mainly about someone named Bob, and I wonder, who the heck is Bob?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2005"}

But your luck doesn't end there:  you see, when HL2 first came out for the PC, the ending seemed like something of a downer:  it wasn't a super-hard mega-tough end boss, it was a bit of a casual stroll to the exit...only to drop a big cliffhanger in the way.  Because Valve wanted to start releasing episodic sequels.  While most of us had to wait quite a while for Episodes One and Two, here you have them, ready to go.  Each is a smaller continuation of the story, but each also adds enough newness to make the game engaging.  I loved the entire story arc, and I'd love to see an Episode Three, or even a Half-Life 3.Half-Life 2 casts you in the role of Gordon Freeman, the main character from the original Half-Life who managed to stop an alien invasion in the first title that took place when the research lab he worked in accidentally opened up a hole in reality and let the bug-eye monsters through.Or did he?You wake up in a world where the monsters took over, the bug-eyed ones really aren't so bad, and it's the rest of them you've got to be afraid of.  While you were snoozing, they appear to have enslaved all of humanity, and it's only through the hard-won battles of the resistance, now led by you, that you'll be able to save the world.Oh, but that's not all:  you also have Team Fortress 2, a rather cartoonish sequel to the early mutli-player frag-fest \"Team Fortress\".  Team Fortress was my first introduction to online multi-player fun, and I spent many hours in it.  This sequel injects enough humor into the game to make it laugh-out-loud funny.  You have a collection of player types (\"heavy weapons\", \"pyro\", \"sniper\", etc.) and some simple goals (\"capture the flag\", \"deathmatch\", etc.) and in the middle is usually a mish-mash of chaos and gunfire.Team Fortress 2 is a mostly death-match oriented title, so if you want something a bit brainier from time to time....enter Portal, a clever, mind-bending exercise in theoretical physics.  You play a \"test subject\" in the Aperture Science Labs.  Robots and a computerized voice guide you through \"tests\", and you're given just one item in the way of \"equipment\":  a hand-held generator that lets you open a portal in one place, then open an entry point in another.  Step through portal A, emerge through portal B.  The puzzle mechanic cranks up the intensity the further you progress, for reasons I won't spoil.  I will say this though:  the moment you think you're near the end, you've got a lot left ahead of you...if you can keep your wits about you.  If you can survive.If you like first-person games, especially if you're somewhat new to them, you couldn't ask for a better collection of products.  With the price, it's a bargain, and you're bound to find something you like.  I was extremely pleased to have a much easier time playing on the controller in these games despite coming from a keyboard-and-mouse background.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2010"}

Didn't rush through and even have lots of side jobs I can go back and complete since I saved at regular key intervals. This game is surprisingly WELL DONE with very few shortcomings. However, the one glaring mistake was the cupcake ending. They get you all fired up by presenting you with the Big Freakin Gun (a true id original), multiple vehicle assaults on the way to Capital Prime and a killer \"Grand Finale\" type of soundtrack inside the facility just so you can...roll over the opposition quicker than you can down a Value Meal?!?Maybe I need to replay it on a higher setting than Normal difficulty...But I found Normal to be quite sufficient in other areas of the game, particularly Mutant Bash TV, the Power Plant and the almost overwhelming Blue Line job. In fact, I even put away the BFG in Capital Prime to make the fight more fair since its Pulse Rounds just cut through anything and everything that comes at you. It left me with the feeling that different teams got certain missions to complete and everyone but the group working on Capital Prime got the \"adequate difficulty\" memo. It could also have something to do with running out of development time and just doing a quick & dirty for the final mission, since the (frames per second) quality of the final cut scene of the arks activating was dismal at best. And at worst, it just STOPPED and the credits rolled. I mean, how about a few humans exiting the Arks and seeing the sun and breathing the air for the first time since being sentenced to a subterranean existence by the Authority? See how that brings the story - and your reason for being in it - full-circle and leaves the player with the satisfaction of saving the rest of the human race? Sure, one can infer that from the final scene...But failing to hammer it home with another 15 seconds of cut scene is like a 4th-quarter drive that comes up just short of the goal line when time expires (remember the Titans in Super Bowl XXXIV?).Obviously I'm disappointed with the weak ending. But I still won't knock this game down a star because of 3 things that are important to me in a game:1) It was FUN.2) Literally everything worked well and just like it should...In other words, this product was sufficiently TESTED prior to release.3) I got more gameplay for my money than I'm used to getting these days in a shooter SP Campaign.Call of Duty/Modern Warfare has almost single-handedly destroyed the art - and joy - of the Single Player Campaign for shooter games by making them short & sweet and secondary to the multiplayer experience. Thankfully there are games like RAGE and Borderlands that still provide a Campaign that's worthy of a $60 price tag. The fact that RAGE has already broken the $30 price point at Amazon in less than 3 months since release (currently $19.11) makes it a BARGAIN for every shooter fan! Playing some areas of this game at night will have you peeking around every corner wondering when the next mutant or Authority barrage will jump in your face. And for this reason you should heed the advice of \"save early and save often\" in The Wasteland...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2011"}

You play as either Tyson Rios or Elliot Salem two former Army Rangers, now globetrotting mercenaries who during missions unravel a conspiracy that plays an important plot within the game.I like the fact that the programmers have implemented current events based on hotspots like Somalia and Iraq as it adds more realism to the game there's even a hint of the September 11 tragedy during a cut scene.First off AOT has interesting features like the Aggro that has you or your partner utilizing the most damage toward enemies while providing distraction. Overkill is a 10 second kill clock boost that provides a bit of invincibility and stealth.Back to Back speaks for itself.what's also cool is the GPS system it comes in handy when you are often lost as well as provide objectives and items such as a makeshift riot shield.After completing a mission you are often rewarded with cash which can be used for purchasing and upgrading weapons. It adds more fun to the game as the player is tasked to experiment with various weapons to see which ones are more suitable during certain missions and objectives and not to mention the optional pimping of guns and gear.The graphics are defiantly  up to next gen/current gen standards and sometimes it's hard to determine if the cut scenes are based on in game graphics or not. However, sound wise it can be a bit annoying like the often mentioned \"Help me Elliot\" \"I didn't know you cared Elliot\" and then there's the redundant music that made me wish I purchased the 360 version so that I can substitute my own soundtrack instead of the game's music.What's also a bit frustrating is trying to shoot the enemy who can take more hits than a tank. At times you are better off with melee as opposed to shooting, due to the lackluster targeting system and reticule.Overall Army of Two is a very satisfying game albeit too short for $60 but with possible future DLC, it's worth it. The dialogue reminds me of those buddy action flicks back in the 80's-90s and that's not a bad thing. Hopefully the problems will be addressed in a future sequel that's sure to happen.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2008"}

Nicholson","summary":"Borderlands...Single Person OKish, but terrible on-line gaming.","reviewText":"\"Borderlands\" for PC has finally arrived. This game is playable as a  single person,  or as a 2-4 person multi-player, which includes 4 player co-op.About the game:The game has a very cartoonish quality to it; very obvious at first but you quickly become use to it, to the point of not even noticing it. In fact it really seems to add to the mood for the setting of this game.This is first and foremost a FPS but has RPG like upgrades (now termed a RPS or role playing shooter) to the different skills of the 4 different characters.  Like traditional RPG you have  story driven goals as well as many side quests; quests that present your characters for possible significant rewards in the form of money, weapons, upgrade points etc, but at the risk of greater danger.You get to choose between (and keep) one of 4 characters; you then proceed to develop that player's skills; skills that are kept over from one game to the next, even in CO-OP. The carry-over  also applies to any weapons, shields, armor etc. found within the game. Nice!The four characters that are available to play are:1.) Lilith,  who specializes in incendiary, shock and corrosive attacks. Her unique skill is 'Phasewalk'.(invisibility).2.) Mordecai, who specializes in sniper rifles and revolvers. His unique skill is 'Bloodwing' in which he can send out 'birds' to attack enemies for him.3.) Roland, who specializes in combat rifles and shotguns. His unique skill is 'Scorpio Turret'; a portable machine gun turret with shield. Roland is also the 'medic' for the group.4.) Brick, who specializes in explosives and fist. His unique skill in 'Berserk'.Of course all the above 'unique' skills are time limited and require a cool-down period before reuse can occur.In addition all players earn points to increase their skill tree (which tend to automatically level up somewhat as player level increase). This includes, to mention a few, such things as in damage inflicted, resistance to damage, health regeneration, increasing rate of fire, reload time and weapon ammo capacity and many more; some skill tree enhancements are related to the particular individual and his/her 'unique' skill.As well there is a significant vehicular component to this game, giving you the opportunity to show your driving prowess, either alone or as either driver/weapon user.GAME PLAY: SINGLE PLAYER...Initially, I was very disappointed with the game; the cartoonish quality, the very irritating and repetitive dialogue from the robot (Claptrap), the fighting, etc. The overall effect was less that I imagined, considering all the hype.However, once I got to level 5 and started to earn XP points that I could apply to my skills, thing improved significantly. I started to meet some better opponents and also began to find some very interesting and powerful weapons.Also, seeing the hit points fly off enemies as you hit them with gun fire and watching their life bar disappear is a real rush. Making it to the next level and getting points to increase your 'skills' was also a very rewarding part of the game. These were the aspects that made this game a very good FPS with RPG qualities.Almost no two weapons are the same; most have some benefit and drawback,(increase damage but slow reload time) etc. BUT there are some weapons out there that real gems; having almost all strong positive attributes and few or no drawbacks. And that is what, along with the XP upgrades, make the game SO interesting.Shops, random chests and hidden caches can, at times, provide exceedingly rare and powerful weapons and add-on modules.Another nice bonus is the fact that you can RESET your skill points (with some minor costs) allowing you to 'respend' your XPs, if you've chosen unwisely the first time. This is a great feature.Negatives for Single Player1.)Game becomes quite repetitious as you go along, especially as you advance in skills/weapons.2.)Respawns are from the same place, with the same 'enemies' every time.GAME PLAY: CO-OP (ON-LINE):From a team orientated co-op point of view, well in a word...disappointing!Through GAMESPY...initially I had difficulty just trying to get connected but lately I've been able to join on-line games fairly easily, however these are with random players...these games were basically undisciplined and chaotic. There was little or no concept of 'team' play, nor did I have any control over choice of missions, where we traveled to, etc.I was NEVER able to set up a private game with my friends. And I now understand this is because I didn't have the correct 'ports' open on my computer to allow people to join a game I hosted...you'd have thought there would have been some explanation or instructions regarding this...but no, nothing!Through LAN...have never been able to connect with anyone.SUGGESTION REGARDING ON-LINE PLAY:HOWEVER, on-line is a great way to met tougher opponents and level up more quickly. Do this by HOSTING an on-line game, (name it whatever you like and then save it, so then you'll be able to play this game on-line whenever you want). If you have the right 'ports' open you may get other players to join you...if not, then just play like you would single person, but reap the rewards of better loot, XPs etc. While 'hosting' you control where and what missions to accept, where to travel etc.COMMENTS:I'm really liking the Single player game a lot more than I thought I would; after play co-op L4D for months I didn't think I every say that again about single person.With regard to on-line co-op play: well it's too bad they didn't use 'Steam'. The on-line play through STEAM is so well set up; easy to connect and simple to invite 'friends' to a private game.The 4 player co-op, may turn out to be a great game, if you can set it up with your own team. And while the co-op game features harder opponents, it also brings to light the crucial downfall of the multiplayer game (and in fact, the single game as well), that being, THE LACK OF RANDOM SPAWNING OF ENEMIES (a feature that has made L4D so playable game after game). The same enemies spawn at the same spot, every time through. If anything, this game has made me realize just how unique and well constructed the L4D format of co-op gameplay really is.The 'carryover' of improvements and skills from one game to the next, it's easy to see a co-op team (with the same 4 players) could  very quickly became a formidable group.And finally, some minor annoyances:1.) There appears to be no way to get rid of (or by-pass) the half dozen or so flash screens at the launch of the game,. Spacebar, enter, or Esc. does nothing to abort this tedious repetition every time you start up.2.) The mapping system; when you turn on the map (and you'll use it often as the layout is somewhat confusing) always start with a close up shot of where you are. The problem is that your target (waypoint) is usually off the map, requiring you to zoom-out to find it. This occurs with EVERY visit to the map, even seconds apart.CONCLUSIONS:To me, there was that compelling quality to \"Borderlands\" style of play initially  for the SINGLE PLAYER game, however this was not enough to prevent it from becoming quite repetitious and even boring towards the end.The on-line co-op game...so far unable to set up with friends to have a team oriented game. Whether the co-op on-line play will prove popular...well, I've some doubts! Only time will tell.However playing on-line by hosting a game is a great why to speed up your results.STAR RATING5:1.)Single player...2 1/22.)On-Line Co-op...1 1/2 Stars (maybe even less)R.

Then I could have remembered it as the `great game that never war' instead of the mediocre game it is.Duke Nukem is a game from another era and it would have been good, had it been released in 2000 or so. But in the day of Modern Warfare, Halo and Battlefield, Duke feels incredibly dated, and not in a nostalgic way. The graphics are poor, the gameplay is boring, the level layout and enemies are generic, the weapons selection is boring. Its not a bad game really, but it is very, very average. The Serious Sam series of games would have served as a better Duke Nukem update than Forever is.I played through the game out of a sense of duty more than anything else, it was far from enjoyable. The gutter humor and sexual references might have been funny when I was 14, but they fall flat today. Maybe it's because I am older and more mature, or maybe it's because the world has passed Duke by. There is nothing other than the namesake of this game to set it apart from the load of average shooters out now. If you really want to play it I suggest a rental, even as a discounted used game I couldn't recommend a buy.

{"product_name":"B0050SYK44","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Cravens \"Loves a good story\"","summary":"If Tarantino made a video game...","reviewText":"If Quentin Tarantino made a Spaguetti Western, post-apocalyptic-esque video game, this would be it. I can't believe how much fun this game actually is. Even if you're like me and didn't play the first Borderlands, don't pass this one up so quickly.  Where do I start?GAMEPLAY: if you aren't familiar with BL, the best way to explain this is to take the addicting looting system of Diablo and combine it with the basic elements of an FPS, throwing in some RPG via an inventory and skill tree. That's essentially the mechanics of the game, and it all slams together so well here. You have four basic classes to choose to play from, and each class has three paths to focus on in a skill tree -- this means there's plenty of variation to play. In addition to these basic mechanics, the game is open-world, though it may feel semi-linear as you can only explore on an area-by-area basis (think the opposite of an Elder Scrolls game, where you can walk around the entire map without hitting a loading screen until accessing a dungeon). I have to say, with combining so many of our favorite gaming formulas, this game has so many highlights. Sometimes I felt like I was playing something akin to Skyrim. Other times, the ambiance of a specific area or the design of a specific feature reminded me of BioShock. And sometimes certain things brought me back to my Fallout 3 days. However, I never forgot I was playing a completely new adventure that easily whisked me away for hours in the unique and captivating world of Pandora. Lastly, I can't forget the guns. No joke, there are millions of guns you can find. It is so satisfying to find a ridiculous weapon and destroy enemies for the next three hours with it, only to find another weapon that is even better.SETTING: Speaking of Pandora, it really is a fascinating world. Having a post-apocalyptic feeling yet retaining a notes of being futuristic, there are so many different areas to access. Sometimes you'll be exploring an underground cave full of chemicals. At other times, you'll be questing in a town that feels like it belongs in the Wild West after a nuclear fallout. It's crazy, and I doubt you'll be bored quickly.STORY: one thing many BL veterans mentioned is the lack of a good narrative beyond funny one-liners in the original game. Like I said I never played Borderlands 1, but I can tell you that in BL 2 the characters are memorable, the writing is well-thought out and downright hilarious, and the story moves at a great pace with scenes of great emotion and other scenes of great sarcasm. This is all coming from a guy who is used to epic stories from Final Fantasy or Mass Effect. Also, be sure to keep your ears peeled while you fight the various enemies. They say and do some hilarious things themselves. But seriously, the writing is just super clever. I mean, what other game has a quest called, \"Rocko's Modern Strife\"? Classic!REPLAYABILITY: with the various classes and varying skill trees, there is already plenty of incentive to reboot a new game or two... Or three. However, in addition to these, once you beat the game you open up more challenging modes that guarantee both tougher enemies and significantly better loot. Also, there are a healthy amount of side quests in here to help you clock in the hours that make AAA games a great bang for your buck. If you're a completionist like me, you'll probably spend 50+ hours on your first playthrough. No joke. Or, you can try a different character, pump through the story to get to the better game modes, then spend all your hours doing the side quests and finding the best loot. There are so many possibilities!One note -- definitely not a game for kids. The gratuitous gore would scar small children, and the extremely crass sense of humor means it's not a good idea to give this to a kid/teen who probably wouldn't understand half the jokes anyway. Just saying, parents, be smart and know what your kids are playing!In conclusion, this is one heck of a game. I feel that it combines the best of so many game genres into a single FPS while adding in a memorable story that motivates you to find out what happens next. Of course, you'll be laughing your face off the entire way.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2012"}

I love games that are story heavy and immersive.  If it wasn't for all of the QTEs breaking the flow of the game it would be 5 stars.  Every time I start to get immersed I find myself forced into some awful controller juggling act or finger contortionism.  A game should never take a player out of the fantasy.  In the best games you forget you are holding a controller at all because the game is so intuitive and non intrusive it feels natural.  The constant on screen pop ups are a huge distraction. Unless you are trophy hunting you can put the game on easy setting and minimize the interruptions to this dark and interesting story.  As the game progresses you jump from one character to another discovering the plot from different perspectives.  I like episodic games like this because you can treat it like a novel and jump in and out in small sessions.  Overall, I can not recommend this simply because it takes an interesting idea and turns it into a monotonous QTE.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2013"}

Tons of modes, tons of stuff to do, and the atmosphere is second to none. I have never seen a game go this far into D movie territory and pull it off. The swearing is ridiculous, the inside jokes are often funny, and the whole thing comes off as a labor of love. You rarely see this stuff anymore. Once per gen if that. I am glad they rereleased this because the Sharpshooter and Move are totally needed for this. The Sharpshooter works perfectly with it though you may need to calibrate it to your liking. Sometimes in these kinds of games want you to point at the camera but pointing at the center of my screen works better for me and makes the reticule more accurate. It all depends on where you put the camera.Anyway, after calibration you will have a crazy campaign with 9 or so stages and then other extra things to do. They added quite a bit to this game including new modes to play and extended scenes with more enemies and mini games. Everything you could ask for in a light gun game is here. Word of warning: there is more swearing and dark humor in this game then you may be able to handle. This is solid grindhouse feature and you don't have anything better to play with your sharpshooter so get it. Not for kids.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2012"}

The characters are deeply and magnificently created and molded in a way that only  Square could do, and plus the gameplay rocks.  The graphics...wow.  I didn't think that any graphics on the playstation could be any better than the infamous Dino Crisis, (A platform game, not an RPG) But this game blew all the other so called RPG's out of the water.you're not going to be able to put this game down.

IT's great fun being able to play so many characters.But...the reason that I did not give this game five stars is due to the well known fact that it still has that battle system.  I don't see how different it is from Final Fantasy Seven...the battle is almost the exact same thing.  Why is everyone saying that it's \"Different?\" I don't see a difference.  They're the same thing, only with different power ups and stuff.And how come during the battle you can't move the characters?  You  can only use weaponry and potions and all that...you can't actually move in circles around the boss or the enemy...all of your characters just stand there while you wait for your energy and magic bar to refill, so you can finally hit the badguy, (Or bad \"Guys\")And also the music...the sound effects...get really, really annoying.  Just Steiners armor as he's walking is so annoying that words cannot describe the sheer and complete annoyance.  I had to put my TV on Mute because it was so annoying.  The music was at times irratating and not at all as good as Final Fantasy seven.But the game is still fun.  I would indeed reccomend buying it, because it is truly excellent.  But if you are expecting a different battle system, (Like I was) or just hoping for an easy and short RPG, then do not get this game.  You will not find any of those.But still, like I said, this game does rule.

Players are free to steal cars, beat up the  local population for their money (or weapons), make time with  prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking  more structure can embark on dozens of plot-driven missions or steal  cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and go on vigilante  missions. Grab a cab and play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi.  Take a fire truck and earn money putting out fires. The game just never  gets boring.As in real life, there are consequences for your criminality. As your  random acts of mayhem mount up, the police start hounding you,  eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you  continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily  the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are  packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every  category.

It's because I got Vice City instead of GTA3 when I had the money. Anyway, this game was amazing. I already finished the whole game in about three weeks. The first mission where you have to get to the hideout was really easy but as you keep on completing missions and get a new mission, it will get much harder. The game itself is really good.

It slows down when there is too many police chasing me, but other times, it runs way faster than PS2 version and it runs almost perfectly. I also have Windows XP HE and I didn't need any patches to run this game. It was also on high settings;1280 X 1024. That means even if you have Celeron processor, you can fully satisfy this game without a problem. I'm recently playing the mod which replaces all the cars and stuff.

{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"To be or Not To Be","summary":"The best GTA game ever!","reviewText":"(FYI: I just bought this game about 3 weeks before writing this review. I'm still somewhere in the beginning of the game. I'm currently at the point where my 1st apartment went in flames and I just got a new apartment).I'm a big GTA fan and this is by far, the best one I ever played. Here are some of the things I like about it:1) Its almost realistic. When you run people over, they don't die instantly. It takes a 2-4 run overs to kill them.2) Realistic bullet wounds. If you shoot a person in the head, they die. Shoot them in the leg, they limp. Shoot them in the stomach, they are bent down covering their wound with their hand and trying to get away from you.3) If you commit a crime, nearby witnesses will call the police. Cops usually arrive in less than a minute.4) They added a cell phone to the game. You can call other AIs, dial 911, and so on.5) Maps are equipped with GPS.6) In previous GTA games, when you are in the police car, you're only mission was to kill the criminals in the stolen car. In GTA IV, you have variety of missions you can choose from hunting down wanted criminals, kill gang members, and of course, chase down stolen cars.7) Most of the bridges and tunnels have tolls in it.8) This game is base on New York City. There's a Statue of Liberty in it, except its called \"Statue of Happiness\" and the lady is holding a ice cream cone, not a torch.9) Almost realistic car crashes. If you crash, you can still drive, but you will see obvious dents in it. Crash it multiple times, the car will stop running or catch on fire.10) There's gas stations in the game, but your car has unlimited fuel anyway. I usually go the gas station and shoot the pump and the whole station will blow up. Then the cops will come after you.11) There's some missions with intense gun battles. What I like about the shooting part of the game is that you can take cover behind objects and shoot. You can lock on to the target and shoot or you can shoot freely.12) Several mini games such as playing 8 ball, darts, bowling (is there anything else?)13) When you get drunk, you get drunk. The camera goes all crazy and you will get hurt if you can't balance yourself. If you drive while being drunk, and the cops see you, you will be chased.14) You have the ability to hail a taxi cab and ride in the back and it will take you wherever you need to go.15) The cops will only look for you in a certain area of the map. However, the more stars you have, the bigger the search area. You have to get out of the search area to get rid of your wanted stars.16) If you drive at a very fast speed and you crash, you will be thrown through the front window and get hurt and/or possibly die.17) Civilians do not like to be bothered. If you keep bumping into them, they will either run or start attacking you. If there's a cop nearby and you don't get violent with the other person attacking you, the cop will arrest that civilian.18) You can break away from a police arrest, but they will shoot you if you do. Personally, I rather die and end up in the hospital than to be arrested and lose all my guns.What I don't like:Adjusting the graphics to my viewing pleasure. I'm still adjusting it to get the best picture. The problem I have if I set the brightness and/or contrast too low, I can't see at night. If I set it too high, its too bright and fuzzy during the day.Overall, its a fun game. If you want to believe you are one crazy criminal where you can commit any crime you want, this is for you. If you hate violence, look the other way.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2009"}

Rather than reviewing the system itself, which has been done many times, I think many people may find the history how of this revolutionary console came to the videogame industry's rescue very interesting; I know I do. I draw much of this information from various websites, one very good one in particular; unfortunately, I can't really plug them due to Amazon's policies. Email me if you want the websites.By 1983, the gaming industry, in existence for a mere twelve years, had risen to an astonishing 3.2 billion dollar industry. Atari spearheaded the industry, which introduced its first console in 1977 (Atari Video Computer System), and since had grown to hold two thirds of the entire market. However, in 1984 all this would end with a thunderous crash. This concise overview will show you the history of the home consol crash and how the NES came to the rescue.In 1976, Warner Communications bought Atari for $28 million from the company's founder, Nolan Bushnell. Over the next two years, Atari, suffering major production problems and Bushnell's bizarre management, lost Warner millions. Bushnell and Warner's CEO fought, and in 1978 Bushnell was forced to leave. Warner totally revamped the working style, and in 1979-1980, produced twelve new titles. However, Atari was still dragging down Warner's stock. Struggling to gain the market share, Atari made the smartest move they possible could have; in 1980, they began licensing arcade games, the first being SPACE INVADERS. Over the next two years, Atari overtook the market, bringing in over half of Warner's overall profits.However, very significant problems would totally destroy the infant industry. In 1981, Atari released PAC MAN on the VCS, and, because it was such a huge arcade hit, quickly became a bestseller. Unfortunately, the quality was very low. This was a major blow to the company's image, with fans and critics alike extremely disappointed.Another major stumble was one of video games' most infamous games, ET. Warner bought the rights from Spielberg for twenty one million dollars. Atari, expecting the game to be as big a hit as the movie, which was the highest grossing film at that point, purportedly made more ET cartridges than there were consoles themselves. ET proved to be a huge flop, nearly breaking Atari.By 1983, Atari was in serious trouble. Suing Activision (which was disgruntled Atari employees who broke off and formed their own company) and Imagic, the two leading third party developers, Atari tried to gain control over its software catalogue. Atari lost the suits. Third party developers began popping up overnight, and the industry becomes saturated with very low-quality products. (One of the most controversial is CUSTER'S REVENGE by Mystique, where the goal is to rape a Native American woman while avoiding being shot by arrows.) The third-party developers went bankrupt; these cartridges were heavily discounted, and the major companies couldn't compete. Another factor is the home computer market, that was just starting to come alive in 1984. With an increasing amount of computer games and low prices, people started buying these over the consoles.All these factors lead to the crash of 1984. In 1983 alone, Atari lost $356 million. Warner sold Atari to Jack Tramiel, former head of Commodore. The video game industry died, with no major American corporation coming anywhere near it. Enter Nintendo.A little history here will be highly illuminating as well. What many people don't realise is Nintendo is a very old company, founded in 1889 (yes, you read that right) as a playing card company. It became Japan's largest playing card company, and was very successful. In the 1960s, they moved away from the cards and got into the game and toy markets. (A very interesting sidenote: during that same decade, Nintendo's president opened up a `special hotel' rented `by the hour.' Supposedly, the married president was one of the hotel's top customers). In the 1970s and early 1980s, the company scored significant points with big arcade hits and the Game and Watch product line. In 1983, Nintendo released the Famicom (Family Computer). It was a massive hit in Japan. In 1983, Nintendo went to Atari because they wanted to release the Famicon to the American market. Do to complications I won't go into, the deal fail through. In 1984 they were looking to broaden their market share.1985, Nintendo announced the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System. They release SUPER MARIO BROTHERS in Japan, scoring a huge hit. In 1986, the NES comes full throttle into the American market, quickly becoming the biggest selling console ever, largely because of that title. The NES owes much of its success to SUPER MARIO BROTHERS. Coming prepacked with the console, there are an estimated 40 million copies of SMB in existence, making it the highest selling video game ever.Unparalleled, SMB blew open the doors to the videogaming world. With rich palettes of colour, eight four level worlds, spot-on play control, and expert level design, SMB was a much longer game than most of Atari's products and was a game unlike any other at that time. SMB also had the benefit of being very simple to grasp; run, jump, and fire. It was also the first side-sroller as we know it, though Atari's PITFALL set up the concept. Also, it's one of the best. Without SMB, NES wouldn't have been nearly as big a hit in the beginning.In the end, Nintendo came at the industry's key moment. With a powerful new console (for that time) and a very well-designed game, Nintendo resurrected video gaming. With its phenomenal success of the NES and SMB, the video game industry once again took off, becoming one of the world's most significant economical contributors.And we very largely have the NES to thank for it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2005"}

Mills","summary":"Ask yourself one thing...","reviewText":"Do you like Ghostbusters?  If so, then you will love this game.  Even if you don't like Ghostbusters this is a surprisingly solid game.  Considering the pedigree of Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray etc I new the story would be great and the voice acting would be top notch... which it is.  what surprised me is how good the game plays.  The concept of Ghost-busting seems almost made for a video game.The PS3 version has a motion control feature which works very well in this game.  You are actually wrangling the ghosts in by utilizing this feature and I mention it here because I believe it offers a little something for this version AND because one might overlook it if they didn't know.  Do yourself a favor and try it out, if you don't like it you can always switch back!My one complaint is this is one of those games that always seems to get a little cheaper each month whcih bums me out because I feel like I am getting ripped-off a little.  But considering its already like 45 bucks its a great deal as is as long as you think you will put this game back in the PS3 later on purely for the fact that you enjoy Ghsotbuster (like I plan on doing)  because the single player isn't long enough to justify a purchase if you only want to beat it once (it is a perfect rental however).  But personally games with a little character always keep me comming back to them especially ones based on such a great franchise.Terminal Reality did  really great job turning a movie into a game by adding collectibles in each level which are rewarding to pick up simply because they are hilarious and utilizes a fun little game mechanic so its actually fun to find the objects.  That and a great variety in weapons and enemies which make this game VERY REPLAYABLE even for non-fans.  So unless your a play your games once and have no interest in this classic franchise then consider buying this gem.Multiplayer is solid and a great fan service as you can play as your favorite Ghostbuster.  If you like the unique game play in this game as much as I do then you will thoroughly enjoy it and it goes a long way to maek oyur purchass feel worthwhile.  However its not of the same caliber as some multilayer modes in many modern games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2009"}

I played this game post patch 1 and 2, and I ran into very few bugs.  It fails itself, because they laid the game out to completely ruin the story on you, on accident.I can't lay out specifics because I won't spoil things for you, but near the mid end of the game, the game allows you to do a couple things that absolutely destroy the story and spoil the ending.  For me, I was on a great adventure, 25 hours into the experience, when it all came crashing down on me, because I made a choice I didn't know was a bad choice, and it spoiled the rest of the game for me.  I played the game as a good guy for the first 25 hours, and then for the last 5 I played as a bad guy, because I made one choice that wasn't clear to me was a bad one.I can hear you, why not reload a save?  Well, ultimately I did, but I couldn't unsee what I saw.So why rate the game a 3/5 and not a 2/5?  That first 25 hours was a lot fun.  Fallout is at its best when you just set out in a random direction and go see what's over the next hill.  That's the magic of the series.  I had a blast for those first 25 hours.What can you do?  Just enjoy the ride.  Beware, some seemingly innocuous choices can completely undo the game when there's about 5 or so hours left.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0028ZNX68","reviewerName":"MyPenName","summary":"Demo Game Review","reviewText":"This is a review for the demo version which includes the wired turntable and a disc with only 5 songs on it.Of course the wired turntable is sort of a pain, but I am sure most people will purchse the wireless version, so I won't go into the restraints with the wired version. Likewise, people who purchase this will also have the full song set of 80+ songs, not just 5, so I won't go into that either.Overall, it is a fun game for all ages. I think there is something in it for everyone, although you do have to be quite coordinated to be able to use the controls on the turntable properly. DJ plus Guitar Mode is fun and adds to the interest of the game. It is easy to setup and get started on playing within just a minute or two. The narrator vioce also walks you through everything, which is nice, especially if you haven't played Guitar Hero or Rockband and aren't familiar with those types of games.We didn't run into any problems, aside from being a wired turntable and having to setup so close to the tv, etc and we are looking forward to purchasing the wireless bundle. The kids (mine are 15,13 and 11) have so much fun playing these types of games. Yea, they are a little expensive, but it gives them something to do (even if we have to wear earplugs while they do it) and keeps them from bickering! I think it is worth the price in many ways and we are looking forward to expansion packs with more songs and maybe even incorporation of other instruments, besides the guitar.As far as the durability of the turntable, it seems made well.. as well as any other game peripheral and I expect it to hold up great under normal use. If you miss a note and throw it a few times, well then you might get a little less wear out of it lol.I recommend this game. It has the potential to be loads of fun for many age groups and obviously appeals to certain music fans moreso than other \"band\" games that are currently available.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2009"}

Make no mistake, though:Final Fantasy Chroniclesmarks the first time this pivotal installment of the cherished game series has ever been available on the PlayStation. InFinal Fantasy IV, players take on the role of Cecil, a loyal captain who questions the orders of his king, and for it is sent to slay a mysterious beast in a nearby valley.InChrono Trigger, Chrono must follow princess Marle's teleportation through time and locate her before an intergalactic parasite arrives to destroy the world.

Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 4 (formerly known as FF2 in the US) were two of the best role playing games released for any console system at the time.  Chrono Trigger is an RPG which combines elements of the Final Fantasy series with the character designs of Akira Toriyama (best known for his work on the Dragon Ball animated series).  Final Fantasy 4 was the very first Final Fantasy game to be released for the Super Nintendo, and introduced many features for the first time that would later become a staple of the series.  Both games are strictly 2D, and while they look very outdated by today's standards, their storyline and depth are still superior to many of the newer RPGs. The only downfall with Final Fantasy Chronicles is the loading time, especially in Chrono Trigger.  These games were originally designed to be displayed on the Super Nintendo, and the Playstation has a hard time keeping up with all of the sprite based graphics.  It also would have been nice if FF Chronicles included a soundtrack CD like the one in Final Fantasy Anthology.

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Reginald M. Lumagui \"green_lantern_2814\"","summary":"Square + Disney = PS2 greatness","reviewText":"Yeah, I'm not that big of a fan of Disney anymore. We all have to grow up, right? But even if you are or were before, this game is for you even if only for nostalgia's sake. Those who've played Square's Final Fantasy series will get a kick of this game, too, as you come across the heroes from FF7,8 and 10. This game is more of an action oriented RPG similar to Great Fencer Musashi for the PS1. You only get to fully control one player character named Sora while you have two other \"support\" characters who will aid you. And they do a pretty good job at it, too. They're not useless drones who get kiled all the time like in other games. Well, except for Donald who seems to keep getting killed all the time, but he sure packs a mean wand. Anyways, this game is a must have for PS2 gamers who like rpg's with a little action, humor, and nostalgia. It's definitely not an easy kiddie game although it's not so tough as Devil May Cry on Hard mode so some of you guys shouldn't be afraid thinking it's that hard. The options available to characters are plentiful and very customizable as you gain and use AP points for different abilities as well get various magic powers and summons by beating or doing certain events in the game. All voices are done by various stars and voice actors which is sorta cool. I found though that the FF character voices weren't as great as the Disney characters. Just hearing Pooh's voice was kinda cool. Out of the four most reent games I bought, Robotech:Battle Cry, Tekken 4, the Thing and Kingdom Hearts, KH definitely gets more play time because of the fun factor.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2002"}

And I understand Nintendo has more to lose with selling a stack of games for 30 bucks, since they can make a lot more selling them individually on Virtual Console.

PSP despite some early criticism got better and had some cool features and some good games that made it worth it for me. I thought I could expect something great right away from the new version, the Go, Boy was I wrong.On the positive side the Go looks great and feels great, it is much lighter than the original PSP and a little lighter than the 3000 version. I like how it slides, its size, games play nicely with the controls and I think it's comfortable.  The screen is smaller than that of the PSP but looks really good. You can change the internal memory to that of a 32 GB and I'm sure eventually you will be able to buy even more memory. The fact that you can buy the games online and get them on your Go is nice (but it takes too long! waiting 30 mins-1 hour for the PS store to PSP Go is painful!). You can also upload videos and music which is great (wait couldn't the PSP already do these last two features?). \"Mini\" games don't cost much and are fun. It definitely has a lot of potential to it.Nothing really justifies how it can be priced higher than the PSP. It has 16 GB internal memory which is not bad but what If I want to keep all the games I buy on it? I have to delete some of the ones I already have and then if I ever want to play them again I need to repurchase them? Or how about buying games and not being able to know if they're any good? The fact that PSP Go games that you don't physically own cost more or as much as a PSP game when it really shouldn't is a turn-off.  You can't exchange or sell the game either which is not a good thing as of now, if you don't like a game you buy at least you can get something for it even if it is minimal, with the Go forget it! You paid enough for the system and now you have to buy downloads for 40$ (there are \"mini\" games which you can buy for 5-10$ and some are really fun but it's an entirely different thing than a big game)? Also the Go doesn't have as good of an infrastructure as Sony would want you to think, it is likely to get better but for now it doesn't offer a lot and  there aren't that much games available. You can get some PSP titles which is good but with the PSP library of games you'd think there would be more available, it isn't the case yet but they released some big ones like God of War and newer PSP games are available on the Go.  I was also disappointed in the fact that it isn't compatible with PSP games and UMDs, when  a new game system comes out I think the ones buying it have come to expect this from consoles who have retro compatibility ( Wii, PS3, PS2, Xbox 360 and even the DS ) so why not the Go? Having a new console is nice but it doesn't mean throw away the previous one just yet! The battery is not replaceable in the sense that you can't remove it or replace it yourself which is unfortunate if you ever come to experience problems with it.I would keep my PSP for now instead of buying a Go. I'm not saying the Go will never be worth it but for now it's not unless you know you really want one or if have the money to experiment with or risk. I've owned a PSP since 2005 and still enjoy it and I don't see why you would NEED to switch to Go yet. Besides Sony has stated that the Go was not meant to replace the 3000 and that they would continue its support. Perhaps just like every console it's too pricey for a launch but this one really is, it doesn't cost a lot less than a PS3 (50$ approximately)! You can still buy and play games on a PSP, download stuff and it doesn't cost as much.  I'm not a hater, I like what it CAN do and the system itself is great but when it all comes down to the thing that is price, then it's too expensive overall.  For now if you're buying your first PSP get a 3000 (or maybe older) it won't be as frustrating and it's probably best for now as the PSP is still a good portable console.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2010"}

Nonimowse. \"bomber214\"","summary":"Plain all around fun, innovative, engaging, and robust.","reviewText":"At this point, 466 reviews later, I can't really add too much that hasn't been already covered.I'll just keep it simple:  If you are into shooters, this may be a good game for you.  It's got a unique take on a cover system -- arcadey but still useful.  You certainly traverse a battlefield in a completely different manner than most games.  You go from cover to cover, you try to get to the flanks whenever possible -- it really makes the battlefield environment feel three dimensional and real.The graphics are pretty good, but there isn't alot of variety within a level.  Honestly, that isn't too big of a deal as you'll be trying to spot cover and taking down enemies.  There is a fair mix of cinematics and action, and while the story writing (dialog, voice acting, etc) isn't of the highest quality I didn't find that it detracted from the game.I didn't really like the multi-player stuff, but many people did.  I found the maps too small, for starters, and I found that the cover system hindered my ability to succeed.  The roadie-run-shotgun-melee-smash was pretty much the prevailing tactic.  I didn't really factor this into my rating because I didn't buy it for the multi-player action _at all_.  For me, single player and co-op (and co-op is where it really shines) is what I was after.  The co-op stuff, both split screen and online, are absolutely the way to play the game.  If you are buying the game solely for multi-player then my review may not be helpful.The only major detractor I can come up with is the checkpoint system is a bit brutal, and having to sit through the \"lead-in cinematics\" without being able to skip through them, reload after reload, is a bit obnoxious.Overall I thought the game was well worth the money spent.  It has a bit of everything, and does a bit of everything.  It's a very pulpy actiony arcade third person shooter -- and while not perfect, it certainly delivers on the entertainment front.  If you buy video games to have a good time, and to be entertained then I don't see how you could miss with this title.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2008"}

But that is not what this game is, sorry. Not what it is meant to be. Think the movie; only what if he had NOT been shot to pieces in the end, what if he (or you, controlling him) had managed to force an escape?Criminality ensues. Violence. Vengeance (closing some of the thin plots in the original screenplay). Lewdness? Yep. Profanity? Yep. Lots and Lots. There really are no missions beyond the main missions (other than money-making ones, or time-based missions when enemy groups try to take your territory ala Vice City Stories) but somehow that is no detraction. The story is so involving that you don't care one whit. In fact, the only real disappointment in this game is when all the missions are over, and you realize the story is finally done. Only then will you put it down.It's just beautiful to go around town as Tony Montana, hitting on women and blasting holes in men; every bit as satisfying as you've heard.But of course, there are a few negatives: although Tony has a \"Balls Invulnerability Feature,\" he cannot shoot police or run over civilians with impunity, which is more irksome than pointed. And if you try to fully Pimp Your Crib later in the game, you will find that feature messed up as well: furniture will disappear, and along with it your precious money.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2012"}

Although, at the moment I put my PSP and it's plug stuff in, since I'm currently focused on my Vita.One can carry four extra cartridges in the to go case.  This is nice, but for such a large on the go case it lacks extra memory card space (which having more than one memory card for vita is problematic, and not really recommended.  32GB of music and video separate from the games would be nice).

I would say this game is okay. It has good graphics and the puppies are adorable.These are just the basics of the game, you don't have to read:When you first start, the game gives you a walk-through, which is good because that way, you don't have to keep looking in the manual, and if you miss something, you can always look in the books (i mean in the game). You get to name your dog and you can teach it to come when you call their name through the mic., as well as commands. There are the standard commands (sit, lie down, roll over, etc.) and then there are other commands you can teach your dog, like hi-5. You buy food, drinks and shampoo for your dog along with brushes. (The brushes and shampoo depend on whether your puppy has short or long hair) As you progress in the game you can buy more dogs although you can only keep three with you, if you get more you have to put them in a puppy hotel, which i don't like about the game. There are three types of contests to enter your dog into. When you walk them, your puppies may find objects to either wear or play with, or just to sell for more money. Some of the objects are neat though, like you can find a Mario hat while out on a walk that your puppy can wear or a Princess Peach kart based on Mario Kart (this specific kart is exclusive to lab and friends) that your dogs can play with. Plus your dog can meet a friend's dog with Wi-Fi Connection in Bark Mode.The game is fun for a while but then it gets sort of boring but that's just my opinion. I don't like how you have to care for them every once in a while so they don't run away and there's no possible way to shut them off. Although they are adorable this game can get boring. I like games like Animal Crossing but it turned out this just wasn't the game for me. I just don't have the devotion to take care of a virtual puppy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2009"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J6DC","description":"","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"Action is Spectacular!","reviewText":"I have never played a Castlevania game before, so I was hesitant to buy this at first. However, each trailer I saw for this game looked great and when I played the demo, it kinda reminded me of God of War 2 (one my most favorite games of all time), so I had to give this one a shot. After I finished it once, here is what I thought.PROS.SOLID AND FLAWLESS ACTION: The combat system in this game is just perfect. Last time I enjoyed punishing enemies was in Devil May Cry games. Everything works just as you want to. Controls respond very well. Tactical use of dark and light magic adds whole new dimension to the combat. Once you master the different moves, the joy you get punishing the enemies using them, is just indescribable.SPECTACULAR SUSPENSEFUL STORY: It has been a while since I have experienced a story in the game that makes me go wow. While the game does starts out a bit abruptly, things will make sense in the end. Don't want to spoil much.UNANITICIPATED AFTER CREDIT ENDING: If you are familiar with character names than you may see this after the credits ending I am talking about, but I sure as hell did not see it coming. I was very surprised by it and quite frankly could not get this ending (LONG VIDEO) out of my head for days. Don't want to spoil much, but please FINISH THE GAME, trust me, after the credits will make it worth your while.BEAUTIFUL GRAPHICS AND ANIMATION: This game will make you go through jungles, valley, barren towers, huge castles etc. etc. Frankly, they are very nicely designed and the game looks great in 720p.GREAT VARIETY IN ENEMY: It has been a while I have seen SO MANY different types of enemies in the same game. Different types of werewolves, vampires, goblins, deads and other creatures I can't remember names of. All of these gothically designed. I am telling you artwork in this game is just magnificent.RIDING HUGE ENEMIES GAMEPLAY: I personally loved it. Once you weaken huge enemies such as big warewolves, spiders etc, YOU CAN RIDE THEM. Use them to unleash devastating attacks, solve puzzle etc. etc. Truly remarkable.TONS OF CHALLENGING BOSSES: Slaughtering hordes and hordes of enemies and moving forward in the game will reward you with some really compelling boss battles. Just like levels and small fry enemies, these bosses are also very aesthetically animated. To me boss battle was the third strongest aspect of the game (after story and art). As soon as I defeated a boss, I look forward to the next one. Such anticipation and mysterious story really drives you forward in this game.ACROBATIC  GAMEPLAY AND PUZZLES: If you like puzzles there are tons and tons of them in this game. If you don't like puzzles no worries. Spend your experience points and you don't have to solve them. HOW WONDERFUL IS THAT? I salute this game for providing that option. Genius! The acrobatic gameplay, which would be hanging from cliff, then jumping from cliff to cliff, is pretty good. Kind of like Prince of Persia: Sands of Time games. What I particularly found interesting was use of the chain to do acrobats. There points in the game you can jump off of cliffs, use chains to hang somewhere, use the momentum of chain to break through weak structures etc. You have to play it to get a feel for what I am saying.UPGRADABLES AND HIDDEN ITEMS: In this game you can buy new combat moves and upgrade them by trading your experience. While most of the moves can be purchased through the first gameplay (assuming you don't trade experience for solving puzzles), to get all moves and all hidden items, you will have to play different chapters in the game over again.TREMENDOUS REPLAYABILITY: The game itself is long enough. If you want to go for 100% of the items, it will even take longer since you will have to revisit chapters and use your upgrades. In addition it comes with 4 different difficulty levels and a minigame. This will keep you engage for a long while.OH DID I MENTION FREE CASTLEVANIA SOT GAME WITH THIS GAME?CONS.MINOR ISSUES WITH PUZZLES: Honestly the only con I found in this game was I was too used to God of War 2 controls. Because of that I was stuck in puzzles such as clocktower puzzle. Fortunately I figured out the difference in controls and was able to solve the puzzle. An example: In clocktower puzzle, ever time I tried to raise a platform, it would rise halfway and then fall as my character would let go of the lever contrary to the fact that I was holding the button. THE KEY IS TO LET GO OF R2(or L2 whichever is to hold the lever) once you hold the lever. The character will hold it himself without you having to hold the button. Other than this I think some puzzles are a bit too challenging. But again every one of them is solvable and if not, YOU CAN ALWAYS SOLVE THEM BY TRADING EXPERIENCE.CONCLUSION:I frankly am quite impressed by this game. As listed above, Pros. easily outweighs Cons. My score for this game would be 9.5/10.  God of War, Prince of Persia and Devil May Cry fans, THIS IS A MUST BUY. Only thing I recommend is play it on the hardest mode possible for those of who are veteran to God of War type of games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2010"}

When I learned the PULSE Elite Edition would be released I was planning on getting the prior version at a cheaper price as a result. In the end, I was able to grab the newest version of the headset. As a father of a 5 year old and with a baby on the way, my playing time has been reduced basically at night or very early in the morning on weekends when everybody's asleep. I have had the chance to build an honest home theater setup, which goes to waste when playing a game as I try to avoid waking  up the family. Enter the Pulse Elite Edition.A very easy to use wireless set that simulates 7.1 sound, the Pulse has proven to be more than expected. Once you get used to the button locations and configuration it is really easy to use. A thing that worried me when I opened is they looked quite big, being a guy that wears glasses I was worried they would feel tight and press on the glasses, I was pleasantly surprised when I put them on, they are not lose at all yet I did not feel any pressure on my ears while wearing glasses, I just could not believe how comfortable they were! And let's not talk about the looks, they are stunning and feel very well made!Once charged (important to note, the required USB cable to charge the headset is not included in the box, the cable you use to charge your PS3 controllers is intended to be used with this headset) I got familiar with the different settings and configuration, and started playing. At the time I got these I was playing Assassins Creed (the first one) and experienced a very particular issue: while playing, the sound would be frequently interrupting. After some research in Google I found out about a problem the older version of this set had when used near a Wi-Fi router, apparently, the frequency that the headset uses is the same used by the Wi-Fi devices (2.4 GHz frequency), causing glitches in sound and the loss of internet connection in some cases. After learning this I turned on my laptop and continued playing while checking for any internet signal loss. Fortunately, no problems with the Wi-Fi internet connection as described in forums and the like, so it would seem that what was a problem in the prior version is no longer an issue in the Elite Edition. I have to mention that my wireless router is in the same room my PS3 is located, and there seemed to be no interference at all. My next step then was to try with other games, surprise there, the problem seemed to be related for some reason to Assassins Creed only, Infamous, Festival of Blood, Limbo, Shadows of the damned, Arkham City and others I tested sounded flawlessly. I cannot describe the level of detail in the sound, is something you definitely have to experience.  While this set is not noise cancelling by design, the sound experience is quite immerse. I was unable to find any troubleshooting suggestions or reports on the problem I had with the one game but I was glad to discover it was an isolated incident and not a problem with the headset.While I have been, and intend to continue, using these with my PS3, it is important to note that any device with an audio jack can be plugged to this headset, the required 3.5mm audio cable is included in the box. I also plugged the USB dongle in my laptop, the driver auto-installed in a matter of seconds and there I was playing music and videos in the computer with these on!Are they worth the list price? A difficult question as I planned on spending less than a hundred bucks on a similar set, but to be honest, the Elite Edition gets rid of the 2.4 GHz issue, offers a quite welcome hidden mic and performs amazingly well. Add to that the fact that they can be used with other devices such as iPads, iPhones, PSP, PSVita and you have a winner over other similar sets.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2012"}

With players experiencing entirely new and exciting emphasis centered on the blending of on-mission and off-mission play, resulting in an increased sense of realism and more interesting and unrestricted gameplay.An outstanding and a first to the GTA franchise is the new multiplayer modes allowing you to play online in competitive, co-op, and free form modes. Competitive mode has you fighting against the cops, jacking cars, or racing to finish odd jobs.GTA 4 others so much more to the series than ever before with a polished story line with a slick script, detailed world of the modern New York City, releastic social life full of gentleman's clubs, comedy clubs, bowling alleys, and bars, which all house unique activities, an environment which you can interact with, with 4 islands to explore, plenty of side missions and of course a very entertaining multiplayer with plenty to do for several months or years to come. A must have for console owners.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2008"}

Obraztsov","summary":"Disturbingly excellent video game with an amazing storyline.","reviewText":"I'm a pretty picky gamer.  Although I love RPGs (as an example), most of the Final Fantasy storylines since VII have been pretty garbage.  Even for some of the best/most critically acclaimed games out there, the storylines usually lack a lot of realism and the focus is on other things other than storyline.  However, this game's story is SO high quality that my boyfriend (who hates to watch me play video games) actually got super into it watching me play and knew everything that was going on, and I think was just as enthralled as I was.  And trust me - that's saying a lot.  This is a truly A+++++ storyline game and one of the best I've ever seen in a game.WHAT *IS* THIS GAME? - good question.  I was super confused for awhile. But this was previously only a PC/Mac game (did not buy the Mac version because of quality issues I read about) that was released chapter at a time, ending on the fifth chapter.  To make it a little more confusing, there's another The Walking Dead game coming out with Daryl Dixon as the protagonist.  Anyway, the makers of this game decided to finally release all final five chapters in XBox 360/PS3 editions.  So you get to play all the way through.  It was also sold as a high discount compared to most games ($30 vs. $60).I had heard just amazing things about this game from the fans, but didn't delve too deep as too why because I didn't want to get spoiled in case they did release it to console one day.  After it won G4's Best Game of the Year and took home a bunch of other awards, I was thrilled to find out it was being released just a few days later on console.  Great timing!Like I said before, there are five chapters in this game and they're all obviously the same story.  But yay, you don't have to wait for the next chapter!  It's just right there.This game is actually so good that I think it would be totally worth the full game price of $60 (there's a lot of hours in this game and the replay value is HIGH), but I'm glad it was sold at a discount since users who didn't have a strong enough PC to play on or a Mac and didn't want subpar quality had to wait for quite awhile.STORY - simple enough.  At first.  You play Lee, who is on his way to jail when the game starts.  You find a little girl all alone named Clementine (cutest little girl EVER) and she becomes your pal that you want to protect.  You run into a bunch of other people on the way and form groups of sorts and fight zombies and people together.  Or each other.This game is NOT related to the comics/show.  Well, you'll run into Hershel Greene briefly and maybe (?) someone else; and it IS set in Georgia, but you won't be hanging out with Daryl Dixon or the Governor or anything like that.  The characters are completely original, but they're fantastic.  The major similarity to this and the comics/show is the atmosphere.  It's dark, gloomy, brutal, gritty, and painful.  Oh, and sometimes you'll get a chuckle.  It doesn't hold back and is quite sick and depraved.  Also, lots and lots of cursing, which is something that they can't do on TV.  That definitely adds to the realism.What makes this story so interesting is how your decisions really do factor in to what happens in the game in the long-run.  Remember those books where you would \"choose your fate?\"  It reminds me a lot of that.  And the most difficult part is that the majority of the time there are no clear-cut right and wrong answers.  You're not on the dark or light side like Knights of the Old Republic; sometimes there simply are no right or wrong decisions - just decisions.  It's incredibly painful to make decisions sometimes (like whose life to save! Ugh!), and the little girl is just so sweet and adorable, and making decisions regarding her are some of the toughest.  Do you tell the straight-up truth to her about everything, or do you try to make things seem better than they appear?  Do you let her accompany you on dangerous missions after you promised to never leave her side, or do you make her stay back even though it breaks her heart?  There are a lot of tearjerkers moments in the game and the fact that there's no right/wrong answers makes it more so.The writing is so good that it feels like you are a PART of a new series of The Walking Dead show.  There's a lot of talking (some optional), but not in a boring \"watch this overly dramatic 10 minute cutscene\" kind of way, but it integrates you into this dialogue.  You have to give a lot of opinions and make a lot of decisions, and you're usually on a timer to answer to add to the pressure.  You definitely can't just put down your controller and eat while watching a big conversation, you HAVE to participate.  It really does an amazing job of balancing fun game play and a great story.POINT AND CLICK - yes, this is basically a point and click game.  But a very well-done one.  You definitely don't need to be a veteran FPS player to play this game.  You just have to know how to click buttons and figure out some puzzles and how to fix a situation sometimes.  But there is still plenty of action.  You'll be attacked by walkers quite a bit...you'll be put in really, really scary situations and have to make quick escapes.  It builds a LOT of tension just like the show does.  It's also like merciless like the show as well.  No characters are safe.  If you hate stories in games and just like to shoot things, skip this game.  Well, maybe.  The story is so incredibly good that you may be pleasantly surprised. And if you're a big TWD fan, I feel pretty confident that you'll like it.REPLAY VALUE - high, high, high.  I was already wanting to replay it before I finished.  Considering there are a million decisions you can make and they seem to all make an impact somewhat (think kind of like Heavy Rain, if you've played it), it definitely creates enough curiosity where you'll probably want to replay it.Basically, the hype is real.  Play it.WARNING:  Watch the end credits of Episode 5 to the very end...there's a little sneak peek of something for the next episodes.  Yes, Telltale has confirmed it.

I got my own copy (still the original) and found the game to be a refreshing switch from other games I was goofing off with at the time. Diablo's premise is that you enter the town of Tristram to defeat an evil that has sprung up out of nowhere and resides in dark places below the village. The graphics for the time were pretty good albeit grainy and dark by today's standards. The characters you could play as were all great although the only real difference between them (Magician, Warrior, Rogue) were the starting stats, and even your Warrior could learn spells (same as the Magician) provided he found enough books and skill levels, the Magician could do much the same with Warrior weapons, provided the player put points into Strength and Dexterity. The plot to be honest was a bit ho-hum, go down, hack and slash, and rescue some kid while defeating monsters with thier own story and lore, which oddly I found no interest in. To make matters worse the singleplayer game went much quicker than multiplayer and so a shorter game is less apt to hold your attention span. But it's real value came when adventuring with friends either by internet or modem (yeah, people did modem to modem gaming back then...unreal ;) ) and it was in this way the game became unbelievably addictive as hours long searches in dungeons for the best weapons and equipment became a pastime.Diablo II was the much ballyhooed and awaited sequel in gaming history at the time. The game saw a few delays getting out of production (usually a surefire sign a game will be a dud) but turned into solid gold. In every single way an improvement over it's forebear. And the plot was outstanding! The music, atmosphere, the weapons and armor you could find...what was there to *not* be liked about the game? The story has you following the previous game's hero (the plot assumes it was the Warrior) and watches his downward spiral as he travels east towards the place of Diablo's rebirth, releasing mayhem as he moves. Besides special missions that give you permanent stat upgrades and named items you have a gigantic choice of places to explore, there are runes and gems that you can drop into weapons and armor, giving them custom upgrades.D2: Lord of Destruction follows the path of the last bad guy, the Lord of Destruction, into the frozen lands of the north, homeland of the Barbarian. This expansion gets a lot of mixed reviews, but personally I like it. The music, locales, and especially the amazing experience one can get just by going through the expansion once is not to be ignored. Plus super customized &quot;named&quot; armor that you make by having certain rare runes is definitely a bonus beyond words.Online play is fun but with so many hacked items it's simply better to go it alone and try and get some good stuff that's legit, a real sign of respectability these days. The game is very addictive and you'll find yourself going back to it again and again. Try it out and see :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2004"}

I played it for the first time this year and while it was fun I can't say I love it. If anything, I enjoyed it mostly because it gave me a nostalgia trip for the original Dark Forces game, which was one of my first computer games back in 1996.Jedi Outcast looks and feels dated even though it's been less than a decade. Yes, games age, but even games like KOTOR and Rogue Squadron, which came out around the same time, still look and feel great. By contrast, the graphics in Jedi Outcast just look blocky and flat. The locations are generic. There are even some familiar locales, like Bespin, but you're pretty much stuck in a bunch of rooms that look no different from the Imperial ship later in the game (compare that to the Bespin in the Force Unleashed Wii games, which actually does look like Bespin).However, what really frustrated me was the gameplay. The lightsaber combat is uneven and unwieldy. Jumping isn't very precise, which is a big problem because Jedi Outcast thinks it's a platforming game. You often have to make precise jumps onto narrow ledges. This led to no small amount of frustration.I'm not sure why some people rave about the story. The story is pretty rote - the princess (Jan Ors) gets captured, and the hero (Kyle Katarn) has to go find his sword (lightsaber), track down the evil king (Dark Lord Desann), and rescue her. You don't have any choice in the story or outcomes. Even worse, some of the movie characters act out of character. Luke Skywalker seemingly has no problem with Kyle going out looking for revenge against Desann. LandoPerhaps I've just been spoilt by recent games like the Force Unleashed and KOTOR and Rogue Squadron, which have great graphics, controls, and stories. I'm glad I tried Jedi Outcast just to see what ever happened to Kyle. I loved shooting Stormtroopers Dark Forces style. But with so many great Star Wars games out there, this one should probably be pretty low on your list.- Enjolras","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00320JAWY","description":"","reviewerName":"DryvBy","summary":"The anti-war saga in the sea of military shooters.","reviewText":"War is hell, if you didn't already know this. Hatred erupts into a firestorm of death, leaving behind only tears and destruction. It's what breaks humans down into a blanket of depression for years to come. In the midst of military shooters arises a different type of story that doesn't praise war but expresses the discomfort of being in war.If you haven't already had the story spoiled for you, you might be in for a big surprise. What starts out as a typical modern warfare scenario quickly turns into something dark and horrible. This is the best part of Spec Ops: The Line. The game wants you to question your own actions and put you in a situation that makes you uncomfortable. It does this pretty well for some while others it just doesn't work at all. The first playthrough, I was a bit shocked and slightly disgusted at what was presented in the game. There's some disturbing imagery that's presented pretty violently which has caused players to even quit playing, especially late in the game.The problem I had with the story is that while it does a great job at presenting an alternative modern combat story line that's a great advocate for anti-war, it felt a bit forced. The imagery is very disturbing but you don't have any alternative in how you go about your mission. You're going to be forced to do the things that disgust you. It loses a lot of it's effect when your lead to do something and you're just \"following orders\". I also don't look at civilians, soldiers, or any bad guys as being human too. They're polygonal figures that represent human beings but their soulless bodies are nothing I can get truly emotional over. This is just my opinion, of course. It just didn't do as much for me. It's not changing my mind on how I view war games or any violent video games. Because it's just a game with a pretty good story.I think everyone that plays the game will agree the story is great, but that doesn't make a video game and especially of the shooter variety. It's about gameplay more than a story. If you read a book with a fantastic story but it's poorly written, then that's a bad book. If you watch a movie with a fantastic story but it's poorly acted and directed, then that's a bad movie. Video games are no different. A fantastic story with bad gameplay is not a good game. That said, Spec Ops: The Line is just not that good of a game.The biggest problem lies within the most idiotic AI I've seen in a while. If the enemy AI isn't baffled on how to get to cover correctly, then your squad-mates are probably making perilous decisions. The kind that gets them killed. The kind that makes you restart checkpoints over and over because they're too stupid to not stand in front of an enemy with a shotgun during a reload. Every now and then, the AI will show off some impressive flanking maneuvers that overrun you but it's far and few between.On harder difficulties like Fubar (very hard), you'll spend a good chunk of your time dying. Skill or no skill, you're going to die and watch that load screen over and over. Since the game is based around a cover system similar to Gears of War, you can either blind fire or pop up to take a shot. If there's a good group of guys around, just forget about it. You're going more than likely die because all of the enemy units have 100% accuracy on your head right when you pop up. You have to use commands for your squad-mates to attack enemies and just pray they don't stand there taking hits.There's a lot of luck that goes with the game. If you're careful and taking your time, that doesn't mean you're going to achieve victory since there's issues with auto-aiming enemies, bad squad AI, and grenade spams. It's achievable to beat the game on any difficulty, but there's a lot of frustrating moments that aren't even your fault.While there's a lot I hate about this game, there's still some other benefits besides a story. The atmosphere is nice if you like war-torn cities. Dubai is where you're going to be doing all of your killings and it's very apocalyptic looking. This is best witnessed on the PC since the textures are much cleaner looking.Since the game is a shooter, it's a good idea to talk about the shooting mechanics. There's not a lot of recoil or aiming issues in the game. It's an unrealistic third person shooter that manages to stay fun if you're not running into the above issues. You'll constantly change out different types of weapons from shotguns to RPGs. All of the guns are fun to shoot and give a satisfying generic action feel. It's arcadey and I liked that. But again, I can't express how much the shooting is bogged down on higher difficulties due to generic AI scripts.I wouldn't recommend buying the game. It's worth a rent if you're interested in a different take on war in video games. There's just way too many problems to recommend buying a short game with so many gameplay issues just for a twisted war story.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2013"}

First of all the good stuff; graphics are decent, sound is good, the controls are very similar to Halo so its easy to pick up, tank and squad controls are easy to figure out, a huge amount of attention was paid to the detail of the maps and units involved to be as close to the real thing as possible, the idea is inspired...to base a game on a real life series of battles, and no bugs or problems in use.  Now for the not so great; the command structure is a little too simple...not what I was hoping for, AI is decent, but still suffers from boughts of stupidity, non destructable environments, too much of a Rambo type game vs a squad game...I now have my hopes pinned on First to Fight, I really didn't like most of the voice acting and some of the dialouge, and cutscenes are fine...but make a way to quickly get through all of them.  I can honestly say that I liked Full Spectrum Warrior better and you don't even get to shoot in that one.  All in all, a decent game, but could have been better.  It is well worth $25.00 or less so wait for that to happen, grab it up and enjoy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2005"}

While we can't use the Zapper for RE4 this sure does work. While the game is on rails and it moves around for you it makes a great cinematic experience and the difficulty stays about the same throughout but can sometimes get a bit too tough in spots.The game has you playing through important sections of previous RE games and it's a great blast to the past. For fans of the series it's wonderful to go back and have certain scenes trigger memories. While the newer RE games aren't present the others are and you can even play sections of the game that you couldn't in the original such as playing as Albert Wesker in RE1. You can upgrade your weapons, shoot objects in the game to find hidden files, and you are rated after each mission.There are even some sequences where you have to press buttons during key sequences like in RE4. The boss fights are really fun because each one is different and they all have their own way of having to be beat. The controls are pretty simple and easy (especially on the Zapper). There are plenty of enemy types, weapons and so forth to use.I find that REUC is one of the best arcade style games on the Wii and shouldn't be passed up. The game is short mind you and isn't worth nearly $50 but as soon as the price drops it'll be a steal.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

Voice acting and music were great.  Music contains hints of the original FFVII along with its own.Control (4/10): Poor use of buttons.  There is one attack, one dodge, and one block button.  The block button is basically useless.  I used it for 2 battles against Summons and that is it, I used the dodge for the remaining 98% of the game.  Both Magic and physical attacks are mapped to the X button and you use the L&R; shoulder buttons to switch through them which can be kind of a pain.  With 4 buttons, they should have used one for dodge, 2 for attacks (think GOW's small and heavy attacks), and one for magic.  The only positive is that the controls are responsive.Gameplay (4/10): This is were the game really fails.  Crisis Core is a low level Hack n' Slash game especially considering the one button attack command.  All battles are basically the same no matter the monster and the \"side quests\" are dull and really don't give you anything of value.Overall (7/10): While the production values are great, the gameplay is really lacking.  The story will carry you though the game at most once.  The only reason for replay would be to collect all the items.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J4VQ","reviewerName":"A. Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"The PS3 Reloaded [a newer model is now available]","reviewText":"UPDATE (November, 2010):Before you decide to buy this model, note that thePlayStation 3 160 GBand for fifty dollars more you can get thePlayStation 3 320 GB. You may also want to consider thePlayStation 3 320GB System with PlayStation Move Bundle________________________________________RATINGI will begin with the rating part so that those who are already familiar with the PS3 line may save a little time.On balance, I found the PS3 Slim or the 'PS3 120GB' to be a worthy addition to the current PS3 line. It comes with several major improvements over its predecessors and the 'trade offs' are few and, to most us, insignificant.This how the new model compares to its predecessors:PS3 SLIM vs. PS3 80/160GB+ $100/200 less+ Smaller+ More energy efficient+ More quiet operation+ Cooler+ Smaller Cell processor manufactured using a 45-nanometer manufacturing process+ New, more advanced HDMI 1.3 chipset+ Easier HDD upgrade- No Linux support- No on-off switch in the back- Push rather than touch 'On' and 'Eject' buttons- Not as pretty= Unchanged game-playing experience= Same great Blu-ray player= Same PSP integration= Same WiFi, Bluetooth built-in= Same Dualshock 3 rumble, motion sensitive controller= Same I/O optionsThe PS3 Slim is a superior product when compared with the PS3 80/160GB models. This relatively inexpensive, feature packed, versatile gaming machine, multimedia hub and outstanding Blu-ray player, earns back the 5th star that I granted the Classic models and I didn't feel that the PS3 80/160GB models deserved.Granted, when compared to the PS3 Classic, the PS3 Slim lacks PS2 compatibility, has 2 fewer USB ports and and it lacks media card slots but these shortcomings are offset by the significantly lower price, energy efficiency, larger storage and an updated CPU and HDMI. And, keeping hope alive by feeding it rumors, who knows? Sony just might add PS2 software emulation once it stops manufacturing the PS2 sometime, next year.MY TEST DRIVE IMPRESSIONSThe good news is that you can do just about everything you did with the PS3 80/160GB models and in the exact same way. During my test ride, I was able to play all the games I brought with me without a problem, the Bluetooth remote controller was recognized immediately and so was the Playstation Eye. Both a USB-dongle full-size wireless keyboard, a USB-connected wired keyboard and Sony's own Bluetooth mini-keyboard worked as expected. I was able to upload pictures, videos and music from a USB thumb drive and a USB-connected SATA 2.5\" hard disk and play them in the same way I do it on my own PS3. The person who allowed me the test drive suggested that I do not sign into the PSN but I have no doubt that the Slim behaves exactly like its predecessors on the PSN, running HOME or while browsing the Net.The Slim has the exact same ports in the back, the same buttons in front - albeit 'push' buttons instead of the 'touch' buttons, the same 2 USB ports, comes with the same Dualshock 3 controller, USB cable and Composite AV cable accessories.The older PS3s weren't particularly noisy but the Slim seems to be more quiet and, after several hours of play, it didn't get as warm as my Classic. The ONLY 2 USB ports bother me a little because I brought along the Eye, a USB-wired HDD, a USB keyboard and a dongle-based wireless keyboard. That meant that I had to do a lot of plugging and unplugging when testing. In real life, it's not so convenient to charge a controller and access more than one USB-connected peripheral. There are third party generic USB hubs (ugly) or PS3-specific port extenders and media hubs that could be used to increase the number of USB ports and bring back the media card slots.My overall impression of the Slim is \"nothing new\" at least on surface. The \"cooler, quieter, smaller, more energy efficient\" you don't notice while playing a game or watching a movie. The really great news about the Slim is that so many more will be able to afford it and, with a larger user base, more developers will feel more strongly motivated to publish more, better games that all of us will enjoy.THE SLIM (PS3) vs. THE 'XBOX 360 ELITE FALL 2009'This is not meant to be a 'fan' statement. I don't own a Wii but I do own an Xbox 360 so I will be able to discuss PS3 Slim vs. Xbox 360 Elite and, hopefully, it may help a little those undecided between the two or those thinking about getting a PS3 as a second gaming console. Please be aware that, even though I own both consoles and I try to be as objective as possible, I do tend to favor the PS3.Parity------- Storage: 120 GB on both systems- CD, DVD playback: both- Bluetooth/IR: Bluetooth included with PS3, Infrared remote for Xbox- Community: PSN/Home memberships are free, Xbox Live includes free Silver membership and one-month Gold subscription, paid thereafterAdvantage PS3 Slim------------------- Blu-ray: PS3 only. Blu-ray disks aren't used for HD movie playback but to deliver games as well. Since they store several times more data than a DVD disk, PS3 games can be 'bigger' and be still delivered on one disk, eliminating the need for swapping during gameplay.- WiFi: included with PS3, available as an add-on for Xbox.- HDMI 1.3a on PS3 (more vivid colors, better sound) vs. HDMI 1.2 on Xbox- Controller: wireless on both systems, rumble on both, PS3's only is motion sensitive, rechargeable batteries built into PS3's, Xbox rechargeable battery packs available for purchase.- Integration with a handheld device: PS3 integrates with the PSP, the Xbox offers Zune integration. I would call it 'advantage PS3' because the Zune integration is limited to file transfers.- Internal power supply: yes for the Slim, a large external 'brick' for the Xbox.- Ability to upgrade the Hard Disk: the PS3 could use any cheap 2.5\" SATA on the market (a 500GB can be had for $90 at the time of this writing and the existing PS3 disk can be recycled to upgrade a laptop or as external storage) without voiding the warranty. I am not aware Xbox HDD upgrades beyond 120GB but, judging by the 120GB upgrade HDD for the smaller models, they are likely to be proprietary, more expensive solutions.- Slim comes with USB, Ethernet and Composite cables, Xbox has only Composite in the box.Advantage Xbox 360 Elite Fall 2009----------------------------------- Headset: not included with PS3 but any Bluetooth device will work, wired headset included with Xbox Elite.- Ethernet: PS3 supports Gigabit Ethernet, Xbox is limited to 100BASET-T.- USB ports: Xbox comes with 3, Slim has only 2.It seems that a PS3 Slim can be brought to parity with the Xbox 360 Elite by purchasing a Bluetooth headset (possibly for less than $10 and that would make the PS3 a superior choice since the Xbox headset is wired to the controller. For the amount, the PS3 will match and surpass Xbox feature for feature if we don't factor in exclusive Xbox games or unique Xbox Live features.To bring the Xbox 360 Elite to parity with the PS3 one would need: a WiFi adapter ($70) and rechargeable batteries ($10). I will not add the various cables to the list because, depending on setup, they may or may not be needed and PS3's Gigabit Ethernet is not likely to make a difference in anyone's gaming or movie streaming at this time. $80 would bring the Xbox closer to the PS3 but the Xbox won't support Blu-ray, does not have a motion sensitive controller, can't function without an external power supply and, Zune withstanding, it does not integrate with a hand-held gaming device. In addition, continuing the Xbox Live Gold beyond the initial month would be another $30-50 per year for the life of the Elite.I chose not to factor in the quality of available software because it's impossible to be even remotely objective when it comes to judge Sony's exclusives vs. Xbox exclusives. My guess is that, in the end, those who must have Halo will buy a Microsoft Xbox regardless of cost or other features and those who fall in love with Little Big Planet or Uncharted have no choice but a Sony PS3. The general consensus is that, at this time, the PS3 has the superior hardware (see above) while the Xbox has an advantage in exclusive titles and some exclusive content. In addition, many multiplatform games are developed on the Xbox first and then ported to the PS3. That can make the Xbox versions appear to be superior and, more importantly, the PS3 versions do not always take full advantage of PS3s superior hardware. This seems to be less the case as developers are becoming more familiar with the PS3 platform - the software gap, if there is one at this time, it is closing fast.Update on PS3 vs Xbox 360 (July 2010)-------------------------------------Quite a bit has happened since I posted this review and almost all of it was good news from a user's point of view. Microsoft got 'the message' and there is a new, slimmer, quieter Xbox with a larger but still proprietary disc and with built-in Wi-Fi, plus a proprietary Kinect port. Sony, on the other hand, has launched a premium 'pay' service on the PSN featuring Hulu 'plus' and maybe other goodies to be added in the future but the 'free' PSN service is still superior to its 'free' Xbox rival, in my view.So, revisiting the comparisons above, the PS3 still holds the advantage when it comes to Blu-ray and motion-sensitive controllers. The PS3 120GB's drive while smaller is still easily upgradeable while the Xbox is not (my 120GB Slim got its 500GB upgrade within days of purchase at almost no cost given that I was able to reuse the 120GB drive for other purposes).ESSENTIAL ADD-ONS AND ACCESSORIESFor those who decided that the PS3 Slim is what they wanted, the list below may help them budget for the extra purchases they may want to consider. There are surprisingly few extra a PS3 REALLY needs and I listed them in order from what I view as the more to the less important or needed. Those at the top are, in my view, more 'essential' than the ones at the bottom, but with the exception of the HDMI cable which is a must have for an HD TV set, you could easily do without the rest or get them later if you really feel that you want them.- HDMI CABLE - It's a must for anyone who already has an HD TV. It's not included in the box and I am not going to provide a link because there are dozens of vendors at Amazon, competing and that's a good thing because one can be had for only a few dollars. Just make sure it's HDMI 1.3. A 'High-Speed' rating is not necessarily a plus if the cable you need is only 3 ft. or 6 ft. long. All HDMI 1.3 cables should be High-Speed rated and only High-Speed cables support 1080p resolutions. At these lengths, paying a premium for 'quality' can't be justified because the odds for the digital signal to be misinterpreted are close to non-existent.- REMOTE CONTROL - Unless your HD TV supports CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) which allows for the user to command and control multiple CEC-enabled boxes with one remote control and for CEC capable devices to command and control each other,Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc Remotecould make the operation of the PS3 a lot easier when you are not playing a game. It's optimized for movie viewing but XMB navigation, running slide shows and shopping at the PSN store are easier with the remote control because it does not need two hands to be operated. In fact, it can be operated with one thumb.- WIRELESS HEADSET - This is the one important component that the Elite bundle includes (theirs is wired) and the PS3 does not. Any Bluetooth headset would do which is why I am not going to insert a link to Sony's product or to anyone else's.- SECOND DUALSHOCK 3 CONTROLLER - Even if you play solo only, a second controller may be charging while the other is in use.- USB PORT EXTENDER - Again, there are many competing offers. I would prefer one where the ports are powered. Some singing games may come with their own extenders.- PS3 EYE CAMERA - This is not exactly a 'must have' but it's definitely a 'very nice to have' as the Eye is not only a camera but also a stereo microphone - depending on your needs, it may eliminate the need for a headset. I obtained mine cheaply, with a used copy ofEye of Judgment. If you decide to go that route, be VERY careful and ensure that the camera is indeed included before your order.- MEDIA CARD READERS - They would plug into a USB port and will allow your PS3 to read/write to Media/Multimedia/Secure Digital, Memory Stick (PRO), Compact Flash, or XD Picture cards. They can be had for anything from $1 to $20.________________________________________________Note 1: MY OWN BIASWe own a 'Classic' 60GB PS3, currently upgraded to 320GB, DualShock 3 and complemented with various peripherals: PS3 Eye, Logitech Driving Force GT Racing Wheel, Bluetooth keyboard attachment, headset... etc. We also own an Xbox 360 Elite, 3 PSP 3000's (got 3 kids) and a second-hand DS. We used to have a PS2 but we sold it shortly after purchasing the PS3. I've helped several of my neighbors purchase, install and upgrade their own PS3's. I am posting this review because I had the opportunity to test drive a PS3 Slim for several hours a couple of nights before the official launch - someone I know works at a store that sells gaming consoles.Speaking for myself only, I tend to favor the PS3 for several reasons and here they are:- WiFi - This is a major convenience for me. I hate 'wires' and the PS3 has the WiFi built in and it's VERY easy to set up.- Blu-ray - I was an early adopter and I haven't bought 'new' DVDs in more than a year. Having the PS3 doubling up as a Blu-ray player is another major convenience for me.- HDD Storage upgrade - I don't believe that 120GB is sufficient these days and our console has exceeded the 120GB threshold already after lots of downloaded games and movies and transferring thousands of photos and songs to it. A PS3 can be easily and inexpensively upgraded to 500GB today and this is a big plus.- Little Big Planet - It's a Sony exclusive and my kids just love this game. They would probably run away and resettle with a family that has LBP if I got rid of the PS3.________________________________________________Note 2: THE SLIM'S SPECS AND FEATURES- 45nm, 7-core Cell processor CPU- RSX - Based on NV47 Chip (Nvidia GeForce 7800 Architecture) for graphics- Updated HDMI chipset (bitstreams hi-res DTS-HD, TrueHD)- 256MB XDR Main RAM and 256MB GDDR3 VRAM memory- 120GB Hard disk - 2.5\" SATA - can be replaced with any 2.5\" SATA and a compatible 500GB HDD can be had for about $90 at the time I write this review- Blu-ray 2.0 player (possibly still the best) that also plays DVDs and CDs- Ethernet 10/100/1000Base-T wired networking- WiFi 802.11 b/g (from 10 Mbps up to 54 Mbps) - wireless networking I couldn't live without- Bluetooth 2.0 for game controller, headsets, keyboards and so on- Video resolution up to 1080p- Audio supported: LPCM 7.1, Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, DTS, DTS-HD, AAC- Other outputs: HDMI, Optical, Composite AV- Other I/O: 2 High-speed USB 2.0 ports- Power: dual 120/240V- Power consumption: 250W- Weight: about 7 lbs.- Dimensions: about 12\" x 2.5\" x 12\" (my measurements)- Included controller: DUALSHOCK 3- Included cables: USB and Composite AV, power chordAdditional features:- Displays JPEG stills.- Multi-featured, surprisingly good slide show functionality.- Plays MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and MPEG-4/h.264 videos.- Bitstreams DTS-HD and Dolby TrueHD to receiver- Upconverts DVDs to 1080p over HDMI- XMB in-game access.- In-game and off-game text and voice chat (headset, keyboard or Eye are needed).- Video chat with up to six people (PlayStation Eye is required)- Can discover media servers on the home network and stream content from any DLNA-compliant device.- Web browser (still has some usability and compatibility issues) but plays YouTube well.- Google Web search.- Remote play on a PSP connected to any wireless access point - play music, videos, show pics, turn on the PS3 remotely if on stand-by- Upload PSP games purchased from the PSN Store to the PSP.- Online software updates improve PS3 functionality and keep the Blu-ray player features current.- Online third party updates.- Online gameplay.- Download and play PS3 games and demos from the PSN store.- Download and play PSOne games.- Download and play movies and shows from the PSN store.- Supports HDMI Consumer Electronic Control (HDMI-CEC) - control the Slim through the remote of any CEC-enabled TV such as a Bravia.________________________________________________Note 3: HDD UPGRADEIf you are on the upgrade path, less than $90 would buy you a 500GB drive. The one that I tested would be the500GB Scorpio Blue Mobile Sata 5400RPM 8MB 2.5INwhich replaced my laptop's 60GB drive and a friend's 80GB PS3 HDD. The nice thing about upgrading your disk is that you are also going to be left with a perfectly good 80GB or $160GB or 120GB drive which you can place into a cheap enclosure, and theStarTech AT2510U2 InfoSafe 2.5-Inch USB/SATA Hard Drive Enclosureworked for me. After I upgraded my own console to 320Gb, I used the free leftover drive as a backup device for family photos.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube. For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"J. Jongeling \"slice of heaven\"","summary":"Some things improved, while others...","reviewText":"Ah, Resident Evil for the Gamecube! How exciting! Or maybe not so exciting.The re-make promised many things, and did deliver to some certain extent. However there are some things that make me rather agitated, and other things that make me downright mad.DIALOGUE - While much better than the original, it still lacks grammar in some spots and still sounds sketchy at certain cutscenes. Why we couldn't perfect this, I have no idea. You're a multi-million dollar company, CAPCOM - and we're in the 21st century. I think you probably could have hired better actors or at least done more interesting overdubs. I'm sure you certainly have enough funds to do so.GAMEPLAY - It has its ups and downs. The puzzles are somewhat more simple, but also more difficult at certain points. The character movements are more fluid...but almost TOO fluid. Tapping the B-button and directional button simultaneously to run finds you stepping ahead more than you wanted to, sometimes running past a door or even stepping right into a zombie. You can master the controls, but it takes awhile - which is quite frustrating.The color scheme of the game is very dark, which makes it hard to see things. Plus the added fact that you can't really see if a zombie is around the corner or not (save for the rooms with the mirrors which helps) so you end up running right into the grasp of a feisty friend.DIFFICULTY - If you were hoping that the RE-make of Resident Evil was any easier than the original, keep dreaming. It's actually more difficult; and being that the original was the toughest in the series (up until this), I'm sure many were hoping that the difficulty on the remake was a bit more easy to handle.Some very frustrating things about this game is the limited ammo you get (in the hard mode, you barely have enough to stay alive and have to use the knife half of the time, even if you ARE experienced with the series and know how to save ammo), how fast your health deteriorates, and the all of the god-awful backtracking you must do.Your enemies may also choose to come back to life if you do not eliminate them by burning them.Chris (the stronger of the two in the game) can only take three bites before it's \"lights out\". That includes the ankle munchers. The ammo supply is very short limited, which forces you to use the (very weak and almost useless...ahem) knife throughout the first portion of the game. The characters do have new defense weapons, however, but you must find them (like items) and pick them up. Unfortunately, they too are in short supply.ENVIRONMENT - Okay, we all know that the environments have changed for the remake. So has the mansion. While the brilliantly colorful post-rendered backgrounds may catch your eye, there's several downfalls to the new environment. The rooms that you always remembered never lead to each other. Room A does not lead to Room B. Room A leads to Room D and a half; way down in no-man's land. Which can be both a curse and a blessing; for those who have played the \"original\" every spare minute of their life, this may be a breath of fresh air. But for average players like me, it's rather frustrating. The puzzles have been switched around a fair bit, and there are more enemies.The environment of the game is very dark, and you can't see as well as you'd like. I find myself subconsciously looking for a light switch on the wall every time i enter a new room. With the added danger of zombies and dogs, it's like fighting your way out of a paper bag.I find this game quite frustrating and difficult. I think in the late 90s, the reason Resident Evil 2 seemed more popular and likeable than the first Resident Evil was because they toned down the difficulty without sacrificing the suspense. Just like Resident Evil Zero. Excellent game, totally A+. This game on the other hand, I would rate a C+ or a B-. Graphics are great, environments are great; but those with weak hearts and irritability should probably steer clear of this game.~Jared","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2006"}

This remake is no different.  Nothing has been changed to the story.  We still have all our lovable characters like Ocelot and Raven.  The game hasn't lost its touch.  The game still has the classic characters and all there voices back...well atleast of few of them.  Metal Gear Solid Remake is a really great addition to the Nintendo Gamecube library and is a must have to any die hard Metal Gear fan.  The game has new gameplay elements that were from Metal Gear Solid 2.  So it's a mixture of Metal Gear Solid 1 and 2.The game had great visuals.  It's even better then Metal Gear Solid 2's visuals.  It really shines the Gamecube and is suprisingly tasty and juicy..eheheh.  The game has fantastic visuals on the bosses and the infamous Rex looked even better then ever.  The Visuals are simply awesome.  Really makes the Gamecube look good for what it is(not that it isn't).  The game has a great position of camera angles.  It really is good to see a game with good camera angles.  Besides the Camera Angles and Visuals the boss battles are even more fun.  The game has really great boss battles and there much easier now that you have first person view.  The boss battles are just as good as the original too.  Visuals, Camera Angles and Great revamped gameplay makes this just plain awesome....Oh boy but now lets get to my baddies....Ok overall this screams A+ game but man did the creators let this game go.  WHAT HAPPEND TO THE CLASSIC MUSIC!  The classic boss battle music are taken out and new music that sucks compared to the original are played now!  Ugh I loathed the music played in this game!  They took all the classic songs out!  To make things worse I was more mad that they changed Mei Lings voice and Grey Fox's Voice(Cyber Ninja)!!!!  How can you change those classic voices.  Besides that the characters were more believable in the original then the remake!!!  And the original had not face emotions!!  I couldn't take it!  To make things even more worse!!!....They took out the infamous \"Snake?..SNAAAAAAAAKE!!\" Now it's all horribly done!  I really didn't enjoy any of this and Metal Gear Solid is a classic.  I couldn't take it anymore!  I must agree with a previous review saying that Snake looks like \"Neo\" I agree, what's up with that!?  That just ruined it for me I thought Snake looked way better in Sons of Liberty..heck I thought he looked better in Metal Gear Solid one and I'm not even gonna get into the controlls!..  Lemmi just get to it...Good-Visuals are great-great camera Control-New revamped level desighn makes this game even more better-The Boss battles are even better then the original-Some cool music but not that good overall-Some cutscenes are very memorable..-Some character voice actors return to play there voices of the characters they once were...Bad...oh man I might sound harsh for most of these..-The music!  They took out all the classics-The cluncky controlls are terrible! Especially getting in codec why did they have it set up like that?-The voice acting...Ugh Even Snake was more believable in the original then he was in Twin Snakes, What is up with Me lings voice?  The cheesy american Accent was great and Some other memorable characters have lost there voices!!-Ugh the Cutscenes?..what is up with the Matrix like moves man?!?  Silicon Knights should have done a better job-What happend to the infamous \"SNAKE?..SNAAAAAAAAAKE\" Now it just stinks!-A game I was very hyped up for ended up being a stinker..The Ugly-Grey Fox's voice is now not the same memorable character we once knew and loved...And so many I can't keep count just look at the \"Bad\"..The Game it self is 5 stars worthy but ruined by so much classic things taken out...The game is a revamped and better looking then ever.  The first person perspective, new character models, and great revamped scenarios like the battle with Rex is just awesome and I loved everything about this game but only to be ruined by so many memorable things that were in the Original.  Also I must mention that they should have added some stuff like the superior Resident Evil REmake.  This game should have had some added things and that is another con I had.  The Extras and easter eggs are pretty lame too most of them are just Ninteno Licenced stuff like Mario ect.  The game can be beatin within 4 hours heck it took me longer with the original then the remake!  Overall it is a must by for few but people who were expecting more of the same like me will be very dissapointed.  I remember I reserved this game and was hyped as heck only to be dissapointed when I put this baby in my GC...Man this game is overall great but also a huuuuuuuge dissapointment...In the end I give it a3.9 out of 5 stars...yeah that's pretty harsh but that's what I think..Overall it is solid joy but alot of classic things were take out of this remake..Final Verdict:From my opinion I stick to the original anytime...Still more superior then the Remake..Lates","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2004"}

Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"For RPGs, there's nothing better today","reviewText":"FIRST IMPRESSIONSAnyone dreaming of hundreds of hours of immersive RPG play stretched over months and months of awesome adventures must come to Skyrim (West of Morrowind, North of Cyrodiil, by the Sea of Ghosts) because there's nothing better today.This is not a full review because it should take me months to complete the game if something the size and scope of Skyrim can ever be completed - I still bump into new quests in Oblivion 3 or 4 years after I thought I 'completed' it. So, for what is worth, this is my experience after the first few hours in Skyrim. I expect to keep updating, expanding and refining this review as I play.So... after my first few dozen hours in Skyrim... comparisons with Oblivion beg to be made and the best I can say now is that us, Oblivion veterans, this much-awaited new installment will not disappoint. The land is bigger, the views are breathtaking, the characters you encounter are more varied and significantly more intelligent, the voices and the musical score are levels above what we had in Elders Scrolls IV. And, almost to my surprise, no bugs. Sure, I've only scratched the surface but there were no crashes yet and no significant frame rate drops or maybe I was so into playing my part I didn't have time to notice them.To anyone trying or who considers trying an RPG I'd say 'go for it' because Skyrim is the best there is in this category today. By far.RPG FEATURES AND THE ELDER SCROLLS HERITAGESkyrim shares the lore and has a lot in common with Morrowind and Oblivion. I've already heard of the Blades, of the Nine, of the Thieves and, of course, the Nords who were found in and around Bruma are the majority group here. In time, I expect to uncover a lot more things in common between this world and those from prior game. Still hope to stumble upon Umbra, my favorite Oblivion sword, at the bottom of some dungeon. A lot of it feels very familiar - did I mention Sheogorath? - but there's a much more modern/advanced-looking interface that makes everything so much more fluid and more natural-feeling - if fighting a giant spider with a sword can be called 'natural'Like many 'modern' RPGs, Skyrim doesn't care much about classes. You become 'you' based on what you do and how well you do it. Practice doesn't necessarily make perfect but it certainly seems to make better. If swords is your favorite argument to settle disputes then, after much practice, you are likely to become an expert swordsman and so for. Or you can try stealth and aim at becoming the best cutthroat the world of Skyrim has ever seen. It's really up to you/me.The skills have been simplified and streamlined a little, their number reduced to 18. I didn't see 'athletics', for example and I don't believe Skyrim has such skills as 'blunt'.The magic schools are a little different with 'mysticism' gone but with 'shouts' added as a new and innovative type of magic - the longer you shout, the stronger the effect.Combat adds 'block' as an active skill. Just keeping your shield up is no longer good enough.Oh... and... 'dragons'. I've only encountered one so far and so much fun it was, especially with the rumble turned on in the controller and a good surround sound you feel the turbulence the giant wings create while flying within inches of your face and the ground shaking when the beast lands (big mistake on the dragon's part) to confront you directly.THE TECHNICAL MERITI confess that, following the bug-plagued Fallout series, I was a little apprehensive and was prepared for the worst. But, as I mentioned already, the game turns out to be bug free so far. We'll see how it behaves as we move further into the world and the interactions and dependencies multiply. I will add more to this section later but so far I'm quite impressed.By the way, the controls and the streamlined user interface feel great. And... a 3-D map? I love it.MY RATINGThe contents of my review are likely to change but I can't see how my rating could possibly go below 5 stars. Skyrim promises to be the best console game I've ever played and it's likely to stay this way for a while.->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2011"}

Start with a single character, then travel through the world, gathering a party of up to 10 different characters.","reviewerName":"Andrew Hamada","summary":"Both terrific and terrible.","reviewText":"Dungeon Siege, unlike most \"RPGs\", is primarily a hack'n'slash, mindless combat game in the vein of the Diablo and Gauntlet series' of games.  If you're looking to purchase the game and didn't like EITHER of those series', turn around now.  The game is great if you enjoy the \"kill-endless-hordes-of-monsters-and-get-better-stuff-to-kill-bigger-monsters-very-little-thinking-involved\" style of gaming.  If, however, you're looking for something more along the lines of a Final Fantasy (heavily plot driven, character based immersive RPG) or Baldur's Gate (heavily strategy based, plot driven RPG), you're looking in the wrong place.If, however, you enjoy the first type of game, then continue reading.Dungeon Siege is basically Diablo 3: that is, it's Diablo II made better.  The graphics are greatly improved, with both the characters and environment rendered beautifully in 3d.  Unlike Diablo II, you don't have to rapidly click your mouse button for hours - you can click the target once and your character will continue attacking it until it's dead.  You can also set your character to have intelligent AI: to have it move freely, to have it attack specific kinds of monsters, or to have to have it defend specific characters in your party.  Potions are consumed in the amounts you need to consume them, instead of wasting an entire big health potion on a few scratches.  The game provides innumerable other player-friendly devices, including pack mules, healing rings, variable difficulty settings, and the like.The variable difficulty settings are a mixed bag.  I began playing the game on easy, to try and get a feel for it, and the game is a joke on this difficulty setting: My main character could rush into a room of 50 or more enemies and take them all down without having to use a health potion.  I was wondering why so many health potions were dropping until I switched into Normal difficulty.  It proved far, far more difficult, and I learned the value of the quicksave button.  The difficulty settings are quite steep, given that there are only three, and provide a unique level of challenge to every player.  It does, however, take the fun out of the game when you can dumb down the difficulty for a boss that you have trouble with.The one aspect where this game will pale in comparison to Diablo II is the multiplayer.  Unlike Diablo II, Dungeon Siege's multiplayer characters can be imported from single player.  It is, therefore, possible to use cheat codes and hacks to create a massively overpowered single player character and then use it in multiplayer.  The online internet (ZoneMatch) based version of the game will end up like that of Diablo I, where everyone has the highest level character possible with the best equipment possible and PVP is a joke.  Character advancement will be non-existant, and several key aspects of a massive multiplayer community will be missing, like an economy and a learning curve.  If GPG & MS had taken the time to create an online-only database for online characters, the multiplayer version of the game might stand a chance.Because the net-based multiplayer will be so incredibly poor compared to D2, don't buy the game expecting to jump into a better version of D2.  Buy it because of its fun single player campaign, and to play it with your friends.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2002"}

I am 33 years old and I definitely put this in the top 5 list easy.  It combines so much greatness from the old Mario games and piles it in with the greatness of new technology, puzzles, and story.The controls for swimming is the only thing that I would want improved.  The concept and story are fun to follow.  Each level is a lot of fun.  Many of the levels introduce new gameplay to them (ie: flying like a bee, swimming like the penguins, gravity or anti-gravity pulls, floating and disappearing as a ghost, etc etc, the list could go on).Most companies would take one of the novel/creative ideas and make an entire game around that one aspect...but Super Mario Galaxy didn't settle for that and adds creativity to every level.  Each level is designed to be fun and challenging...and figuring out how to defeat the boss creatures is too much fun.My 4 year old loves watching us play while he uses the 2nd controller to collect the Star Bits as we play.  It's a perfect family game.  I could go on and on, but when it comes down to it, this is the most creative game I have EVER played!!!

So now I have three new Worgen toons,and one Hordie Goblin toon.Which so far makes a grand total of 8 toons.I have found the new environments to be quite dazzling.The quests for levels 80+ are not too difficult,but despite the mad XP you get for each one,it might take you some time to level.I hit 81 after the third day. I'm not as quick as my younger friends.My new Worgens are quite cool.I have a new dual-specced DK;a Mage and a Warlock.The DK starting area is the same,with only minor changes.The speed of the DK is fantastic.The mobs are dead before I realize it.The starting area for the other Worgen toons is very dark and spooky,with crazed Worgens running at you all the time.Fun.Watch out you don't get bitten by one!!! Mwahahahahah!The Goblin I chose,a Hunter,is cool-looking.She looks a little sleepy,but she runs around in her souped-up hot rod completing initial quests and does it with speed and lots of giggling.The music and environment of the Goblin/Horde faction encourage you to stay to see what's next.So far it's been great fun.The music in the game,both factions,has changed almost entirely.Once again,the ambient music adds a lot to each battle/area/quest,etc.The new second-tier profession of archaeology has proven to be a lot of fun,albeit time-consuming. Which is fine with me because I don't want to spend every second in a raging battle.The drops from the mobs have been upgraded to fantastic!!! Green is the new purple,I think,or is it blue is the new purple?Either way,the gear is quite amazing and I have been outfitting my higher-level toons with some sweet new gear.There are too many new things to comment on here,but suffice it to say that I am enjoying Cata very much.I don't understand the nay-sayers who are disappointed.Things change,and perhaps if you give it a little while,you may find you will he happy about it too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2010"}

I only wish I waited a week after release, but now I'm out $80 with nothing but a not-so-warm and happy feeling that I've spent my money on a product which implies my endorsement this type of system, and by purchasing the game, I've contributed to the mess that is the video games industry by spending my money to support online-only DRM.Out of the almost 2,000 reviews here, various gaming blogs and other news sites, if you're not already aware, this game has the 100% necessary requirement of online play. If your internet is down, no game for you.Basically, you're leasing this game, and only under the good graces of EA. If they decided to shut the game down, you can't play. No online, no play. Servers overloaded, no play. This is NOT an MMO, where you are logging in to a server to play a game, this is DRM (digital rights management) which is the authentication method used to verify the license of the game.Oh sure, they'll eventually fix it, and they've already promised us a free game, currently unidentified, from the EA catalog, but don't be surprised if it's some kind of bargain-barrel game. But what they HAVEN'T promised is a method to fix the online-only DRM, so their promise of a free game is just to dangle a carrot in front of us in the hopes that we'll forget how thoroughly they're burning us.The DRM method used is the new trend in video games, and the only way to express your dissatisfaction is to NOT buy the game. Compare this to video games ~10 years ago, where you got a CD, and you can install the game at any time. Nope, even if you got the physical media for this game, you might not be able to play this next year, or whatever. I can pull out my old Doom or Quake games, each easily over 10 years old, and still play them today.Social features of this game aside, this is NOT an MMO (I know I'm repeating myself). 100% online is not a requirement for a game like this.Save your money, send a message, don't buy it.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2013"}

Some are better  fighters, while others can survive in water or handle explosive bomb rocks.  However, even the best Pikmin herder will have to sacrifice a few of the  plant-headed beasts for the greater good. It's the making of new strategies to  minimize losses that makesPikminchallenging and fun.For a first-generation GameCube title, the graphics, sound, and music are  fantastic and show an awesome amount of detail. Though it's noPok&eacute;mon, this game should appeal to wide-eyed younger gamers as  well as seasoned vets. The controls are intuitive and feel perfect for the  standard GameCube controller. However, learning to position the camera can be a  tad frustrating during some of the more tense moments, as it has only a few  magnification levels and needs constant adjustment.The biggest obstacle Olimar faces is time. He has only 30 days (each day is  about 15 minutes in real time) in which to find the necessary parts. While this  keeps the pace of the game up, some may find such limits somewhat frustrating,  as it means there will be a lot of repetition and rethinking of strategy. It  also means that diligent gamers may findPikmina rather short game.At the end of your gaming day,Pikminis one of the best games on the  GameCube.--Mark BrooksPros:Very innovative and originalGorgeous graphicsGreat sound and musicAmazing blend of action and strategyCons:Time limit causes players to repeat tasksExperienced strategy gamers may findPikminends too quicklyDifficult to control camera during tense moments","reviewerName":"D.

{"product_name":"B00004TSXC","reviewerName":"Michael J. Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"D&D Old-Style Goodness","reviewText":"A long time ago, Neverwinter Nights (NWN) was the official Dungeons &  Dragons game for America Online. At least, I think it was America Online. It was some subscription service. Whatever.Anyway, it was a limited game engine of sorts that used the wacky Dungeons & Dragons rules to allow people to play together online. It was revolutionary in its day.With the arrival of this latest version of Neverwinter Nights, D&D; gets a steroid boost of immense proportions in the form of a real time 3-D game engine. Sort of.NWN is both a module creation tool and an adventure. You can download other adventures or make adventures and host them just like a \"real\" Dungeon Master. It's the closest thing to creating your own MUD -- and you could conceivably make one bigger than most MUDs, with up to 64 players on simultaneously at one time.I have created an adventure but never really hosted it. The time it takes is simply too much -- it's like all the effort of writing an adventure, plus difficulties of design. Worse, the first version I got of NWN kept crashing my machine. Since the patches, it's considerably better. In fact, NWN is made to be patched as opposed to game companies pretending everything's perfect (even though they know it isn't) on release. You just hit \"update\" and NWN updates itself.NWN is made for a wide range of computers, so it scales the effects. This is definitely apparent when Maleficent and I play -- by looking over at her (slower) computer, you can see a world of difference. I have particle effects from waterfalls, shadows thrown from a dozen light sources, and glittering reflections in polished surfaces. Mal...well, doesn't.In fact, for a long time we couldn't get the game to work at all on her computer, which drove us both nuts. It turned out that the only problem was actually the graphics card -- it had a particular flaw with the FEMALE MODEL TYPE. That's right, even though the graphics card had worked in my computer previously, because Mal was playing a female sorceress (who else?), it crashed over and over. It took a lot of work, but we finally got NWN to work on both our machines.The adventure itself is compelling and massive. The box says over 60 hours of gameplay and they're not kidding. Since Mal and I tend to scour everything bare, we really did take up the 60 hours if not more. Additionally, there was easily room for both of us to play in the universe without feeling claustrophobic. We completed separate quests and then would link back together later. Mal's meaner than I am, so her character was more neutral. I played Talien as a paladin (you're surprised by this, right?). There's no satyrs in NWN however.That said, there is a lot of flexibility. The third-edition rules are amazingly implemented in the game engine, which is a compliment to the developers as well as the creators of the third-edition rules. The choice of races and classes are balanced well. And NWN goes further -- there are rules that enhance the game, such as level-dependent items that players can't use until they're high enough level.The combat system works exceptionally well and even the trade system works smoothly. Characters are more or less likely to be helpful depending on how high or low your PC's Charisma stat is. If your character is really stupid, he talks funny (\"Me am strong!\"). And there's always the nasty and the good choice. Maleficent had the opportunity to constantly ask for more cash, whereas I tried to always do the right thing. True to form, our alignments matched our actions.The monsters are beautifully rendered in three dimensional form, taking the static artwork from the Monster Manual to new levels. Umber Hulks never looked so terrifying. And when a dragon gets up on its hind legs and walks over to swat you like a fly, it's positively nerve wracking. Still, not all the monsters are to scale -- the dragons and giants should have been larger. There are also quite a few monsters missing. But that's okay, because there's so much to explore that you don't miss it.Mal and I beat the game at 15th level even though there were items for 16th level characters. I suspect two people playing the game (which is meant to be played solo) ultimately end up dividing the spoils and thus advance slower. I've spoken to other people who played NWN and felt that the game's difficulty plateaued too quickly. I played NWN as a paladin along with Mal and as a elven evoker -- in both cases I died quite a lot. It may be that fighter types have an easier time of it.There were two major problems in gameplay that cropped up, however. Like all good (and bad!) MUDs, NWN has not perfected pet code. By pet code I mean the code that allows a player to control a monster or NPC. Henchmen are available in the game, a requirement for some particularly difficult areas. Every other chapter of the adventure, henchmen would bug -- they wouldn't listen to our commands, they would repeat the same phrase over and over, they would attack friendlies (!) or they would simply not recognize the PC as their employer anymore. Given that some NPCs are critical to survive, this became a big problem when we had to permanently dump the thief in favor of a cleric we didn't need. The problem always fixed itself when we entered a new chapter of the game, because the NPCs are essentially recreated at higher levels. Still, it's extremely annoying.Much worse were the quest bugs, another feature that often hampers text MUDs. Sure enough, many of the quests simply did not work -- NPCs who were required to finish the quests disappeared or wouldn't recognize the item given to them. Unlike the henchmen code problem, the quest bugs I was able to manually fix by going into the code with the area creator and tweaking it. So that was a surmountable, but still annoying bug.The campaign adventure series itself is surprisingly mature for its type, involving plagues, bad choices, murdered lovers, and vengeance. While the end battle is quite climactic (it took Mal and I several days to figure out how to beat the bad guy), the narrative summary is far too brief and without any accolades. It's sort of a \"yay, you won, bye\" rather than a true feeling of accomplishment.Since I don't get to play much D&D; these days, this is the closest thing to it. I haven't figured out how to play with my friends over the Internet yet, but we intend to and are planning to buy the expansion adventures (all of them!).Is NWN perfect? No. But it is a fantastic world-building tool that manages to provide a really fun gaming experience that takes me back to the old days around a table with my friends.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2009"}

With true-to-life race car steering, shifting, braking and acceleration, your game gets so real you may want to buckle up.","reviewerName":"Riyad Kalla","summary":"Experience Depends on the Game... Wheel is Great Though","reviewText":"Summary [8.5 out of 10]====================================The Logitech Driving Force GT PS3 Wheel is an excellent driving wheel with a good build quality at a solid price point that will satisfy any casual or avid racer. Unfortunately not every game makes correct or full use of driving wheels, but the ones that do (e.g. Gran Turismo 5) create a surreal driving experience that will satisfy any driving fan.For the purist that must reproduce the true racing experience in his or her house, we would still suggest the Logitech G25; it is, however, more than twice the price of the Driving Force GT.What's in the Box?====================================It's a good sized box, about the size of a Logitech 2.1 PC speaker package. As shown on the box there was an instruction booklet, pedals and wheel (with integrated shifter).What I was really surprised to find in the box, and it might have been a toss-in for some promotion because I don't see it mentioned on Logitech's site, was a full copy of Gran Turismo 5: Prologue. If you already have it, then use this copy (if you get one) as a gift I suppose. If you didn't have a copy, you will be so freaking happy they included one, it does the wheel justice while other games don't:After spending time with this wheel and especially Gran Turismo 5, I would have to say that you cannot review a driving wheel, or al teast this driving wheel, without having a copy of Gran Turismo 5 to test with. The experience is so much better with GT than it is with other \"arcade\" racers that it's a night-and-day difference. More on that later though under \"Driving Experience\".For anyone that has used a force-feedback wheel in the past 10 years, I think the form factor of these things has always been the same. A life-sized steering wheel attached to a tapered base that is fastened to a table or desk of some kind using clamps or grips of some kind; this is very similar:As you can see the steering wheel reproduces all of the 17 or so buttons you find on a standard PS3 controller. The red wheel and \"enter\" button on the bottom right can be used for navigation and confirmation as well as in-game adjustments for games that support it (like Gran Turismo 5).I'm not sure what the split-circle +/- does on the bottom left, I never got it to really do anything in any games.In addition to the full-sized wheel the base unit includes an integrated shifter. The shifter doesn't have much play up or down as it behaves more like those auto-shifters (flappers) you find on some higher end cars that let you drive in automatic or shift automatically if you want. It just clicks up or down as you are driving and a spring re-centers it when you let go. It doesn't click \"up\" or \"down\" into position like a gear shifter, it's more of a toggle action.Of course you have your pedal plate. I'm a size 11.5\" and the plate felt like a nice size, sturdy, good resistence on the brake and gas and my foot never fell off it or slipped off. It's a perfect size.I did find that the pedals stood upright a bit too vertical, so sitting in a chair and playing, my foot was always cocked up when I was off the gas or break. This made switching from gas to brake with 1 foot uneasy for me and I ended up driving with both feet instead; I just couldn't flip from gas and then cock my foot up enough to clear the brake as I moved it over to the left to push it back down. What ended up happening is that the side of my foot would hit the break as I moved my foot to the left and push the whole pedal pad over.I would also point out that the pedal pad would be perfect on carpet because it integrates a retractable spike-strip on the bottom of it that can click out, and dig into the carpet. On hard/wood floors like I have, it was moving around a little bit, so I secured it by pushing it up against the table you see in the picture above. I believe there are little rubber feet on it but they don't do as good a job stopping it from moving as the carpet-spike-strip would if it was on carpet.Keep that in mind if you are on a hard floor and don't have a way to secure it in place, I'm sure putting it on a mat on your hard floor would work fine (like a yoga mat) or something else that will cause it to stay put.Hooking it all Up====================================As with all racing wheels since the dawn of mankind, you fasten the wheel base that everything hooks to, to a table or desk using clamps that tighten to hold it in place:If you don't have a table or desk that this can be fastened to, you will need to get one if you plan on using this. I lucked out in that our coffee table had a lip on it that I could hook to, but I have a friend that has a low coffee table that he hooked the wheel to that provides a lack-luster driving experience as he is bent over the wheel.Someone else that came over to try the wheel out didn't have a coffee table at all in front of his TV and was wondering how he would use it; my only comment to him is that he couldn't unless he had something to hook it to.The base unit is front-heavy with the steering wheel; meaning if you didn't secure it to the table, it would happily fall steering-wheel-first off the table onto the ground. You can't just set it on something and use it; it needs to be clamped down.Also you will want it attached to something sturdy because you can get to fighting with the force-feedback and turning the wheel and moving quite a bit while racing. This could move whatever you have the wheel attached to in more vibrant racing moments; something I did with our coffee table because it has wheels on it.For example, if you tried to hook this to a bar stool or something, I don't think that would work out really well.After getting the base-unit in place, everything plugs to it into sockets in the back of the base-unit, right behind the shifter. You will plug in:* Power Adapter* Pedal Plate* PS3The wire length between all 3 of these things is pretty liberal, so unless you are trying to spread yourself across your entire living room you should be OK.The shortest connection is from the pedal plate to the wheel (understandably, since the two will always be near each other) and uses what looks like an old-school COM port connection.In what I consider the most important connection, the base-unit to the PS3, Logitech was pretty generous. You have a 10' or 11' USB cable to connect to your PS3. In the picture above I am about 10' from the PS3 and that is about as far away as I am going to get without a USB extender.The power adapter also had a generous lead on it, which I plugged into the wall behind me, about a 5' run total and there was still plenty of slack on that cable.For those curious, the power adapter is one of those \"huge bricks that I have to plug in and will cover a bunch of other plugs\" types. The prongs themselves are set high enough on the brick though, that if you are plugging into a wall socket, you can use the top or bottom socket without blocking the other one.If you are using it on a power strip, I'd suggest making it the last plug off the power strip so it hangs off and doesn't block other plugs cause it will. It's a bit bigger than a deck of cards or there-abouts in size.Build Quality====================================My gut reaction out of the box was \"meh\" honestly. I have used force-feedback wheels in the past and only once can I remember being impressed with the non-plastic build quality.However, after using the wheel for a while and playing quite a few games with it, I came to find the build quality above-average. The wheel is solid feeling, it's got a leather-wrap feel to it, the force-feedback is dynamic and consistent and the pedals were sturdy and performed well. If you want to turn the force-feedback up, the wheel can really wrestle with you, so if you like a powerful experience, you can certainly get it with this wheel.The pedals didn't feel amazing to me out of the box, but playing with them I didn't have any complaints, besides the comment above about how vertical the pedals stand.The gas is easy to depress but sping-loaded in a firm fashion to make it somewhat hard to push down with your hands. And the brake is firmly spring loaded, but in a smooth, shock-absorber way that makes it satisfying to use and feels more like a real car.The shifter does feel a little rinky-dink because it's just a plastic knob on a metal pole that is attached to a spring-loaded click-shift mechanism.If you want that tactile feedback, you'll want to get the Logitech G25 Racing Wheel.If you are a build-quality nut and don't mind paying for you, you really should be looking at the Logitech G25 Racing Wheel; that's more of a direct race-car replica, complete with metal parts, full shifter, clutch, etc. But it's more than twice the price of this wheel (just a warning).Driving Experience====================================First a list of the games we tried (in alphabetical order):* Burnout Paradise* Dirt* Gran Turismo 5: Prologue* Grid* MotorStorm* Nascar '09The \"awesomeness\" of this wheel (and I imagine all racing wheels) depends 100%, completely on how well the game you are playing implements it.Let that above statement sink in... you could spent $900 on a wheel, and if the game you are playing doesn't have a tuned wheel experience, you will likely go back to using a controller.Gran Turismo 5 is excellent, Grid and Dirt are bad; even though there are a ton of adjustments for the wheel, I wasn't able to find a combination of settings for those two games that made them playable for me with the wheel... there is a certain amount of arcadey lag that occurs between the wheel and what your car does that screws you up in tight spots, sharp turns, etc.You spend a lot of time spinning out and then spinning out more as you try and get straightened out on the track.Your mileage may vary and your tollerance may vary, but this was a comment another friend of mine with the Logitech G25 Racing Wheel echoed about those two games as well. Some of the bad controls can lead to road-rage though if you are expecting a perfect-simulation-experience from all games:I tried this wheel out, along with my wife, our friends and their children. I didn't see anyone \"not get it\", it's pretty straight forward and accessible to anyone that has driven before. Although the children seemed to pick it up no problem and like the idea that they were racing \"for real\".While the wheel does expand the experience of driving, especially if you stick yourself in \"first person\" perspective in the cockpit of the cars of some of these games, bad response from some games can ruin that experience just as fast.Conclusion====================================After some time with this wheel and quite a few titles, I think I've come to the conclusion that if you are a Gran Turismo fan/junkie, and plan on getting it, this wheel or one of Logitech's others is a must-get along with the game.If you just like racing games, especially more arcadey ones, you should probably skip getting a force-feedback wheel. The wheels themselves are excellent, but they are only as good as their weakest link. If the game you are playing wasn't tuned for the wheel you are just going to end up going back to the default PS3 controller after a while anyway so you can win races.It's unfortunate, but with a lot of the problem titles, I didn't find playing with the 20 settings or so for force-feedback in most of them helped at all. Some I couldn't even see a difference between a 1/10 or a 10/10 \"Force Feedback\" setting.Areas of Improvement====================================As with all our reviews, we don't like to criticize without providing suggestions on how to improve the product, so here are our suggestions for the Logitech Driving Force GT PS3 Wheel:* Any of the following individually (realizing that all of them together would increase the price too high):o A clutch on the pedal pado Gear flippers on the wheel for easy shiftingo A Shifter that included two well-defined gears and not the small-range-of-motion up/down click-shifter that is on there now so you feel cooler throwing it into gears* Wireless connection to the PS3 (Is that possible? I don't know how much data is being transfered from the wheel to the PS3)* A chart or guide that has \"Best suggested settings\" for the most popular driving games. You can spend a lot of time messing with the Force Feedback settings for different driving games. It would be nice to have \"recommended\" settings out of the box since the sampling of popular driving games on the PS3 is so small, it shouldn't be hard to do this.* MINOR: Easier to reach Start button (for pausing) on the wheel. The phone rang while I was playing a few times and I fumbled and crashed 3 times trying to pause the game. I can't imagine getting interrupted while driving is an uncommon thing for a video game. Would have been nice.* SUPER-MINOR: Working horn button, there is a horn button in the middle, and it lights up and depresses, but none of the games I tried it on did anything. This is super minor, but I like honking a lot before smashing into people.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002BSC54I","reviewerName":"An Android Fan","summary":"To steal a phrase from a certain video game, better than I'd feared, worse than I'd hoped","reviewText":"So I recently finished Zelda: Skyward Sword. I originally got it for Christmas but didn't really pick it up until recently, what with the Mass Effect 3 face glitch (simply will not play until I can play as my Shepard!) All in all, it's a good game. It's even a good Zelda game. But still far from perfect.Graphics - I'm not going to get in depth with graphics because as we all know, the Wii uses last gen hardware, and so graphics aren't going to be all that great. They're pretty comparable to Twilight Princess despite the game being 5 years newer than its predecessor. That's all that needs to be said on that. It gets an 8 (average) because it's average in terms of what we expect from a Wii title.8/10Sound - Sound is very good. I enjoyed most of the music the game had to offer. I didn't think the song playing between the water dragon's cave and the entrance to the second forest temple fit too well in a Zelda game, but hardly brings it down all that much. The song for the end credits was a good homage to the original entries in the Zelda series. For some reason Nintendo still has sounds it delegates to that monotone speaker in the Wiimote controller, though.9/10Controls - And speaking of controls, this is where the game takes a big black eye. I was hoping that after Twilight Princess, Nintendo would've seen fit to focus less on motion controls. Instead, they made an even heavier emphasis on said motion control. The motion control scheme sounds good on paper - swing your Wiimote to swing your sword, aim your Wiimote at the screen to aim your bow, etc. - but it doesn't prove so good in execution. It proves to be cumbersome, unwieldy, imprecise and in some cases, maddening. At least in TP, you had a fairly small set of moves, each distinguishable from each other. In this game, just with the sword alone, you have horizontal strikes, vertical strikes and diagonal strikes, two of each, in fact, and many enemies where only one set will work, the others fail, and the controller is so hairline sensitive that it's far too easy to do a vertical slash when I needed a diagonal, or a horizontal slash turns into a ham fisted shaking of my sword, or a forward jab results in the enemy laughing at Link's inability to produce the same result. If I'm fighting a boss, I want to do that - fight the boss. I don't want to be fighting both the boss and my controller because it thinks I want to do something completely ineffective. This is especially true when having to manage that awful whip weapon, especially seeing as how both it and the sword rely on the same controls, so using the one when you need the other is far too easy, especially when fighting the boss found in the dungeon where you get the whip. The boss himself isn't hard - it's the fact that you have to fumble around with the controls almost as much as you do fight it. But the most damning of all is the tilt controls. The tilt functions (yes, plural) are found everywhere in the game. You need tilt to free fall, you need tilt to swim, you need tilt to control your free-flight Beetle, you need tilt when flying on your mount (and the tutorial for flying the mount is misleading - tilting up on your Wiimote does not - I repeat - DOES NOT cause your mount to fly up. You need to \"flap\" the controller to do that, yet this is never mentioned in the tutorial,) so suffice it to say, you're going to be tilting a lot. There's a reason why Sony's Sixaxis was a colossal failure. It's a simple enough question - why use tilt when you have the thumbstick - a much easier, more reliable, more easily reproducable, more fine tuned control system than tilt could ever be? Somebody might respond that Nintendo wanted to take full advantage of the WiiMotion Plus. It's understandable if they want to showcase its capability, but not to the point where that's the one and only consideration at ANY AND ALL COST. That desire has to be tempered and balanced with a consideration towards how well the game will play - if the controls are cumbersome, it's time to make some changes. I've yet to read an unbiased review for this game anywhere that didn't have at least one mention of the control scheme giving issues. Having no option to change the sensitivity hurt this score as well.3.5/10Gameplay and Presentation - As controls directly affect gameplay, it is impossible to give a perfect score in this category. But despite that, the game is still fun. Nintendo promised that they were moving away from the Zelda games of old, and... to some extent they succeed. Many of the conventions we expect to see in Zelda games are still intact, but they did throw us a few new curve balls. The second trip to the desert was probably my favorite dungeon, despite having to find an invisible and actively moving target, and what sold me on it was what happened immediately before the actual boss fight begins, as it's not something that a Zelda game's done before. (At least, that I'm aware of.) A common enough convention in other games, sure, but I wasn't expecting what they did with that particular dungeon so I will give them kudos. A certain other boss you have to stop from reaching its destination was another good twist.On a sidenote with the gameplay, I almost wish I could give Link the t-shirt that says \"Let me just drop everything and work on YOUR PROBLEM\", as the townsfolk, like always, are needing his help with everything. It's probably a good thing that we can't interject our own personality into the main character, because I'd probably tell them, \"Okay, I'm in the middle of trying to find my childhood friend, someone dear to me, who's gone missing and whose life is in serious danger. I'm also trying to stop an evil entity from breaking out of its prison and destroying the entire planet. There's also a magic-wielding sociopath who wants find my childhood friend for his own nefarious schemes and kill me in the process. But SURE, I'll be glad to dust your house/find your (Fill in prized possession here)/go fetch something you could easily get yourself for you, since you don't want to do it! Not like I've got anything important going on, right?\"I do feel the need to bring this up as well the dialogue feels like it's straight out of a Saturday morning cartoon. A lot of us have been playing Zelda games since the first one when we were kids, and so I do not know why there's yet to be a Zelda game with dialogue that is on the level. This is especially evident with the first dialogue with Link, Zelda and her father. And I'm not saying there should be the kind of dialogue we have in Dragon Age, Skyrim or Game of Thrones, but is it so much to ask to have a script that isn't cheesier than the state of Wisconsin? Ghirahim is far too much of a clown to be taken seriously. If Nintendo was trying to make a nuanced, sinister, disturbing villain out of him, then they failed at it miserably.I do like Fi, however.... well, okay, SOMETIMES I like Fi - her emotionally neutral, overly analytical, almost computer-like speech is humorous, especially with how oblivious she remains to just how she sounds. Now if she'd just stop reminding me that my batteries or health are low.... or if she'd stop saying something that's either blatantly obvious, or give away the solution to the puzzle 30 seconds after I've encountered it.... she could at times be more annoying than Navi, and that's saying something.Nintendo did get both the intro and ending right. Considering those are the two most important elements of the story (especially the later) I will give them credit where credit is due.And I really hope Skyward Sword is the first and last Zelda game where our mount is a flying bird. This is Zelda, not StarFox.Upgrading makes its debut, and it's a good addition. Get some supplies from the enemies, upgrade your shield or other item(s.) I do not know why the Slingshot is still a weapon in this series, however. It was obsolete the moment the Beetle was found (longer range and no ammo to collect) and twice obsolete when the bow is collected (why use a sling when you have a bow and arrow?) I didn't bother investing into it, as I had more important things to put my materials into than seed satchels. Arrow quivers, on the other hand, received the full upgrading experience. One related gripe regarding the process - whenever a bug or upgrade treasure is found for the first time in each and every playthrough, the game deems it necessary to pause the game, just stop it dead, and repost the information we've seen thousands of times before before letting us continue. Even if you collect a given bug, go save your game, quit, enter back in five minutes later and collect another of that same bug type, the game will once again pause the game and give its full description of what that bug is. And it does that with each and every type of bug, and each and every type of upgrade treasure you find. I think I've got a good handle on what items do what when the last dungeon in the game is looming on the horizon.And why, oh why are we limited to selling only 4 types of treasure or bugs at a time? Randomly selected, at that?Also, why are we over a decade past the turn of the 21st century and there's STILL no voice acting in a Zelda game? Before any ultra-hardcore Zelda purists (read: Raving psychopaths) start breaking their keyboards pounding away their righteous fury at how voice acting would somehow break the \"holy sanctity\" of the game, or start talking about how that'd turn Zelda into another mass-marketed series that only wants to turn a buck, let me stop you right there. First of all, every video game, regardless of when it was made or the genre it was built for, is a mass-marketed game, intended for a business to make a profit. Second of all, again, note the year we're in. It's time for voice acting, already. Should it be good? Absolutely. But for the last time, start giving voices to the characters. Reading text is boring. Boring is bad. And considering the sheer amount of written dialogue... the sheer amount of BAD dialogue.......One last thing on the subject - I'm not sure why Nintendo would think we'd need tutorials if we're playing on Hard Mode, given that we have to go through the entire game once to access said mode. I wanted to say \"I think I've got a good handle on this, thanks!\" more times than I would care to admit.And that stamina bar? That has to go.8.0/10Replayability - There's a Hard Mode after the game's completed once, but like every other Zelda game, Skyward Sword is completely linear in fashion - no branching story lines, no moral choices with long-term consequences that dynamically change the story, nothing like that. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, as it shows evidence that Nintendo has listened to its fans decrying the easy difficulty of its previous Zelda games.5/10All in all a good experience. I'm not going to say if it's better or worse than Ocarina of Time or Twilight Princess, because nostalgia can cloud an otherwise objective point of view. So, it's a good game in and of itself. Hopefully when the next Nintendo console comes out, they'll have given something more responsive and dependable than the motion controls we have to put up with now. While control and general presentation issues do prevent the game from being perfect, or even as close to perfect as games are capable of becoming, it's a solid entry in the Zelda series and one of the best games the Wii has to offer.Overall: 8/10 (NOT an average of the other scores.)Graphics: 8/10Sound: 9/10Controls: 3.5/10Gameplay/Presentation: 8.5/10Replay Value: 5/10Overall score: 8/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2012"}

The game unfortunately had a troubled development cycle and then released very close to Red Dead Redemption which is why it didn't garner as much attention as it deserved.  I won't speak much about the story here as it is something you should experience for yourself, but I will say that I really enjoyed it, even if a lot is not explained in the end.  The graphics are beautiful and the soundtrack is the best I've heard in a game in quite a long time (it's included on a CD in the limited edition).  The atmosphere is wonderful, and you feel genuine dread and suspense if you are on the verge of getting overwhelmed or killed.  There's also a healthy dose of dark humor I really enjoyed.  Although I've said many positive things about Alan Wake I realize it isn't for everyone.  The game is story-heavy and gameplay does play a slight second fiddle in terms of quality.  I was so immersed that I didn't care, but some players might.Regardless, Alan Wake is something that everyone should experience at least once, so I'd highly recommend giving it a try.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I0K3CK","description":"","reviewerName":"D","summary":"The best New Super Mario bros game","reviewText":"Back quite a few years ago New Super Mario bros was Released on the original Nintendo DS which was the first 2d mario game in over 10 years and I admit I liked it at first but something seemed missing and it was to easy then about a year or 2 later it was followed up with New super Mario bros wii and it was a major improvement over the ds one however it was WAY to focused on chaotic multplayer which was unique but in the end I'd rather just play mario single player. Now we get to this game and I must admit this should have been the original New Super Mario bros game.Even though it is called New Super Mario bros there's not really that much new in it which is really the only disappointment I have with the game. Theirs a new power-up the squirrel suit which is basically like the raccoon suit of the game but instead of flying you glide at first I didn't care for it but it grew on me as it is a lot better then the silly propeller suit from new super Mario bros wii though. Yoshi is back as well and baby Yoshi's make there new super Mario bros debut which is a major plus. Also most the classic power-ups are back like the fire flower and the ice flower.  As for the Music a lot of it is the same from the previous new super Mario bros games with more \"Wahs\" but there is a few new ones like the main levels (overworld) and the \"athletic\" levels have new songs.I was never impressed with the graphics of the new super mario bros games the were good but something looked off. However this is the very first time Mario has been in HD and I admit I actually like the graphics this time around it fits with this game mostly because of the HD graphics. Even though there the same style as the other New Mario bros games. The Backgrounds are nothing to special there pretty much exactly like the other games with one level having a yoshi's island ghost style to it which there should have been a lot more of them or ones like it.The game play in the New Mario bros series has been pretty well done threw out the years. However I always thought the games were to much of a cakewalk and to generous with the extra lives as in by the time you get threw it you will have 99 lives by the 5th world. This one however is really what you put into it if you skip the green mushroom houses then you will be losing plenty more than likely near the end of the game this is the first mario game in over 10 years that I've seen a game over screen.The thing that separates and the reason I think this is the best of the new Mario bros series is the challenge it gives you there's almost always something new in each level with the exception of a few aimed for the good old fashioned koopa shell throwing goomba stomping ones here and there. Its still not quite as good as Super Mario Bros. 3 or World but it is the best 2d Mario since those days. Also I can't comment on the multiplayer of this game as I have not played it yet but I assume its pretty much just as chaotic as the previous wii game. Theirs also challenge mode which will test even the most hardcore Mario players even those who think the mario games are easyThe Gamepad is used well and not overused if someone wants to watch tv you can play the game off the gamepad without missing a moment. The graphics it are obviously down scaled but it still looks very nice and I believe it still is in hd so playing on there is just as amazing then on the tv. Anyway if you enjoy the old school mario games or a newcomer to mario you should check this game out along with New Super luigi U.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2013"}
{"product_name":"B002I0K3CK","description":"","reviewerName":"hwrose379","summary":"New Super Mario Bros. U may be the best in the series, but it still shows much restraint","reviewText":"I remember when I learned that New Super Mario Bros. 2 was coming to the 3DS. I also remember when I learned that New Super Mario Bros. U (abbreviated to NSMBU) was coming to Wii U about two seconds after I learned about New Super Mario Bros. 2. It kind of struck me as odd that Nintendo was releasing two New Super Mario Bros. games within three months of each other. Nonetheless, NSMBU may be the best game in the series. But, does it live up to the \"New\" name, or is it more of the same?*STORY*If you guessed that the main story for this game is that Bowser runs off with Peach while Mario and co. pursue him, then you're partially correct. Instead of taking the Princess to his castle, Bowser decides to ambush Peach's castle and hold her hostage there. Using a giant mechanical claw, he takes care of Mario, Luigi, and the two generic Toads by throwing them far away. This is all relayed through a rather comical opening sequence, where Bowser scoots the Princess out of harm's way before dealing harshly with the others. While this is a fresh twist on the usual kidnapping story, it still uses the same underlying plot: the Princess is kidnapped, and she must be saved.*GAMEPLAY*The gameplay here is, unsurprisingly, very similar to that of this game's predecessors. The gameplay still consists of Mario running through various levels to collect three star coins and ultimately reach the flagpole at the end. However, the new Flying Squirrel power-up brings an interesting new mechanic to the game. The Flying Squirrel allows you to glide across large chasms and pits that you can't simply jump across. You can also catch a slight upward draft with the flying squirrel suit, bringing some verticality to the game. The squirrel also allows you to cling to walls momentarily, and this is extremely useful - it can save you from a poorly timed enemy attack and it can save you from falling into a pit. This game also marks the return of the Baby Yoshis. The Baby Yoshis come in three varieties, with each variety having a unique ability. The pink one acts as a hot air balloon, the blue one can blow bubbles that turn enemies into coins, and the yellow one can illuminate dark spaces. The pink and blue Baby Yoshis can be carried with you between levels, unlike the adult Yoshis (which also return in this game). The pink baby Yoshi is personally my favorite variation, and it combined with the Flying Squirrel power-up is an ideal combination. The pink Baby Yoshi really provides extra verticality that the flying squirrel can't provide on its own.This game controls exceptionally well, as Mario really does feel like an extension of your arm. However, I do not like that you have to use the run button to hold the Baby Yoshis, and there were many instances that the game registered me shifting my thumb as me removing my thumb off the button entirely, causing my Baby Yoshi to go plummeting into a pit. In addition, Mario feels overly slippery on ice. It's fine for the controls to be more slippery in the ice levels, but it's a little ridiculous here. It requires a lot more effort than it should to get Mario to come to a stop on the ice.This game can be challenging, and it has an appropriate difficulty curve. The game naturally starts out fairly easy and the difficulty ever so slightly increases with each world. The difficulty curve is near perfect in this game, however there were some levels that felt way to challenging when compared to the other levels around them.*LEVEL DESIGN*This game is comprised of eight main worlds plus one special world, with approximately 8 levels per world. Unfortunately, the level design here can be forgettable. Most of the levels are rather generic, however, some do stand out, such as Skyward Stalk, a level which requires you to climb upward on a growing beanstalk until you reach the flagpole. Despite the forgettable level designs, the ghost houses here are overly puzzling. In many cases, it is not overly obvious which route you need to take, and the ghost houses really require you to think and use your problem solving skills to determine how to get to the exit.As for the boss battles, the Koopalings return to man the castles at the end of each world while Boom Boom from Super Mario Bros. 3 mans most of the mid-world towers. In addition, Bowser Jr. is fought in both of the airship levels in this game. And, of course, Bowser is the final boss. The boss battles here are rather creative and can be challenging at times. Each boss battle feels unique, such as Iggy's battle where he constantly switches between running on the ground and the ceiling all the while summoning lava monsters to attack you. The boss battles are rather impressive in this game, and I commend that.*SINGLE PLAYER*I believe that we have all come to expect that a Mario game can deliver a solid single-player experience, and NSMBU delivers. In fact, single player is the definitive way to play NSMBU, for reasons I will discuss momentarily. Single player never feels like a chore and the experience is as refined as ever. There never once was a period of time where I felt that multiplayer was required to reach a certain area that may contain a secret. Overall, NSMBU features the best single player experience in the NSMB series, thanks in part to the perfected controls and overall pacing of the game.*MULTIPLAYER*On the other hand, however, multiplayer is just as flawed as it was in the Wii iteration. There simply isn't enough room for four players to move without constantly running into each other and unintentionally knocking each other into pits. A fifth player can jump into the game by manning the GamePad for \"boost mode,\" a mode which allows you to use the GamePad's touchscreen to place blocks in the level. These blocks are intended to help the other players reach places they wouldn't be able to reach on their own. It is a neat concept, but it simply doesn't work. The blocks just add to the chaos and make it even harder to navigate the level as they are constantly in your way. In the end, it really is a missed opportunity that Nintendo didn't take the time to fix the problems that plagued multiplayer in New Super Mario Bros. Wii, and it ultimately hinders the experience.*GAMEPAD INTEGRATION*The GamePad is hardly used at all in this game. The screen mirrors what is displayed on the TV at all times, which does allow for Off-TV Play. The GamePad is used for boost mode, as mentioned earlier, but that's really the only special recognition the controller gets throughout the whole game. Then again, when it comes to a Mario platformer, the stakes are higher and any added GamePad features would feel more like a distraction than anything else.*GRAPHICS AND SOUND*Even though this is Mario's first HD adventure, NSMBU falters in the graphics department. Don't get me wrong, the game looks great and it is visually appealing. But once you look past the gorgeous new backdrops, you begin to notice that NSMBU is essentially a prettied-up version of NSMBWii and nothing else. There aren't any special textures to be found here, and the character models are, more-or-less, copied and pasted from the Wii iteration.NSMBU also falters with its soundtrack. Granted, the game does have more new music than NSMB2 and granted, the new music here is good, but the composers stopped halfway. Half of the soundtrack is, once again, recycled from the Wii version. It really is a shame that the composers didn't take the time to finish the soundtrack. They had a great start, but sadly left it there.*VERDICT*When all of these points are taken into account, it can be seen that Nintendo really played New Super Mario Bros. U safe. The game does introduce several new features, everything is ultimately held back by the developers' fear to go above and beyond and create a fantastic New Super Mario Bros. game. Nonetheless, New Super Mario Bros. U does provide a solid platforming experience, and any Wii U owner that's looking for a good 2D Mario fix should give it a try.STORY: 8/10GAMEPLAY: 9/10LEVEL DESIGN: 8/10SINGLE PLAYER: 10/10MULTIPLAYER: 6/10GAMEPAD INTEGRATION: 7/10GRAPHICS & SOUND: 6/10FINAL SCORE (not an average): 8/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2013"}

In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels.

While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system.

Considering that Nintendo wanted to actually try to get involved in the CD-ROM gaming scenario, but the problem was rying to make sure that it abstractingly portray the gaming. Mainly, because Nintendo was afraid that people would start bootlegging copies of CD-ROM video games courtesy of thhe software that came out for copying for other game systems like Playstation 2, PS1, Sega's Dreamcast, and the Xbox by Microsoft. So Nintendo tells people to get the system for itself. The Gamecube is absolutely worth the wait.Nintendo's Gamecube, is a compact video gaming system that actually can hold as many as four controllers. The gaming from this system is very revolutionary. The graphics and the speed of the video games is just as equal to the speed of its previous game system, Nintendo 64, right away. What I also like about the Gamecube that the other systems don't have is the compact size. It is so easy to carry around, especially for people who have so much trouble lifting hard and heavy goods. It truly makes it a lot easier to store and have around. The only reason people may not want the Gamecube, is because it doesn't play DVD's like PS2 and Xbox. That shouldn't matter a bit, the system is much better for the games alone.All that I can say is that there should be much more to expect with Nintendo's Gamecube soon. With so many other devices to add to this, like the Game Boy Player, and so many great games coming out, this one has to be the buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2003"}

The Gamecube is much smaller than the XBox, meaning it doesn't take up a lot of room to set up.  There is no DVD cabability present, but if you allready own a DVD player it isn't a big loss, plus online capability is on its way.  Not to mention that the Gamecube is the cheapest system around right now.  The first party games are naturally top notch; games like Super Smash Bros. Melee, Pikmin, and the upcoming Super Mario Sunshine and the new Metroid and Zelda games are great, plus Capcom's classic Resident Evil series is Gamecube exclusive, and Sega's Dreamcast classics Skies of Arcadia and Phantasy Star Online are on their way as well.  However, the controler is rather clumsy in design, but if you can get past that there is no problem except the fact that the Gamecube doesn't have as much third party support as the PS2.

{"product_name":"B00006HBTW","description":"It&#x92;s a pretty bold claim but for many,Mario Partyis the best multiplayer game series ever. No need for guns or complicated role-playing elements here--Mario Partyis fun because it&#x92;s simple. The original N64 game created an entirely new subgenre--an unlikely combination of traditional board games and lots of ultrasimple arcade titles. The idea is that you travel around the board trying to collect stars, which must be paid for with coins, and you get coins by competing in minigames, which occur at the end of every round. These minigames generally don&#x92;t last longer than a minute or two, and many are based on oldGame & Watchtitles. There are over 50 minigames inMario Party 4, and each involves either a free-for-all, two players against two, or one against three (depending where you land on the board at the end of your turn). These can involve anything from skydiving to basketball dunking, or car racing to hide-and-seek, to name a few.Admittedly, this basic description of the gameplay might not sound too exciting, and indeed if you&#x92;re playing with less than three human opponents it can be pretty tedious. But play it with the full complement of non-virtual rivals and the game&#x92;s infinite capacity for cheating, backstabbing, and ganging up allows it to completely transcend the humdrum sum of its parts. There&#x92;s nothing terribly new in this third sequel except that the graphics are much improved and the minigames are all new, but that really misses the point: get this game out at Christmas instead ofTrivial Pursuitand you&#x92;ll wonder how you ever got through the holiday without it.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Jody \"bigdumptruckdotcom\"","summary":"Great for Younger Players","reviewText":"My almost-5-year-old loves this game.

Transform him from a na ve student to savior in a war 1,000 years in the making. Immerse yourself in a deep storyline and learn to master Atsuma's fighting and magical abilities.","reviewerName":"Tristan A. Hayes","summary":"An innovative approach to RPG games, but the light that shines here is the awesome storytelling.","reviewText":"Enchanted Arms is probably one of those RPG's that you would overlook. I myself will admit to the fact that I overlooked the title. I had remembered hearing that it was first available on the Xbox 360 and remembered that it did not seem to look very special. Nevertheless, when I finally took a look at the title in a store for the PS3 ats its new 19.99 price, I knew that I must have it.Enchanted Arms starts by allowing you to play or rather control Atsuma, a teenage schoolboy at the prestigious Enchant University. He has two friends Makato and Toya, whom players will grow to like instantly. After leaving the classroom and exploring Yokohama City for its yearly festival the action begins to start instantly as an earthquake strikes and Atsuma goes after his dog, which he quickly forgets about once arriving at the school. Players will control Atsuma in typical RPG fashion of exploring the university at every nook and cranny to discover what happened. Upon reaching the center of the problem, all chaos erupts as Atsuma awakens the Queen of Ice using his powerful arm that can negate all other magic. Upon her awakening, the greatest cutscene emerges as she completely destroys Yokohama City.After that, point Atsuma wakes up in a jail cell in London City and meets up with the princess Lady Karin and her bodyguard ex Captain of the Knights, Rygar. They will soon meet up with the final party member the lone wonderer who does everything for money and love Yuki. After this point it becomes a game of trying to do all else to prevent the scenario that happened at Yokohama from happening at the other two cities (the imperial London City and the interesting, Kyoto City). The quest will embark the player upon many locations and encountering tons of other characters and other subplots.Enchanted Arms uses a modified battle system that is unlike any other in role-playing games. By adding a grid for players to launch their attacks on, it adds a bit of strategy to the typical turn based battles. Most of the skills do have areas of effects so the positioning of characters is vital. It was perhaps a nice addition to make this game stand apart from others but I have found that at times it can make the simplest battle take at least 3 minutes or such. Luckily, for players who like to battle or level grind, there is an option that does allow the battles to be auto played turn by turn. This feature will most likely be utilized heavily once the story gets good at around the 10-hour mark when everything begins to fit together. One of the additional features to the battle system is the ability to use the special EX Special Moves, which are just special moves that usually have a wide array of effects and ranges. The most powerful are of course Atsuma's and they look beautiful (preferably Mega Phoenix). Battles can also be played out with the games take for animals, golems, which are just tons of creatures that players will encounter on their quest who can join your party. Typically, they are weaker than the human characters but in certain situations their types and attacks can perhaps give the player a winning edge over the opponent. One such is in the beginning a few of the golems know healing moves, so before a player has a healer they will perhaps keep one of them in the party.Enchanted Arms sports some classy images at times. The highest setting is 720p and most of the attacks look beautiful on any HDTV that supports that quality. There are quite a few FMV cutscenes in the game and each looks amazing. The most memorable one is the destruction of Yokohama City by the Queen of Ice, another one involves Queen of Ice fighting. The environments are large and expansive as well, and there is occasionally tons of attention to detail. My most memorable one is the attention to the look of London City when viewed from the highest point in the city.Soundwise, the game features a large collection of voice work. The golems still sport only Japanese tracks, which I found to be quite interesting for when they launch an attack or even when they are created from golem cores. The characters all have fitting voices. The Japanese tracks for them are also available for people who are opposed to English voice acting. I listened to the entire game in English and experienced no problems whatsoever. Any supposed emotion for the scenes were all expressed well, and I would like to commend the voice actor for Atsuma, Rygar, Yuki, Toya, Queen of Ice, Sayaka, Makota, Lady Karin was my favorite, she sounded like she was really royalty.The game is reasonably well balanced in its play style. There are an abundance of sidequests that can be tackled at any time and reward the player with the strongest golems in the games. They do not need to be pursued unless one wants to the complete the game or is on a second run through with the New Game+ file that is created upon the first completion of the game (stats and characters skills are transferred over). It is not vital to complete these missions to beat the game. Ignoring what the faqs say, one does not need to level grind to beat the final bosses, simply be around level 50 and it should be an interesting battle (have items!!!!). I found it to be on the edge of hard at times for the sake of getting enemy types wrong and cheap enemy skills (such as the Ninjas suicide bombs once they go to 0 HP that deals damage to everyone on the field). All in all the game should very well take anywhere from 40-60 hours to complete the main story.Enchanted Arms for the PS3 is perhaps an RPG that is needed for most players that provides them with a rewarding story, interesting and innovative gameplay, and a lengthy game. Sure, there are some improvements that could be needed, such as the at times underused and relentless shaking of the six-axis controls during a few parts, but there are other parts that let the title shine. For its price, I found the game to be very enjoyable and one of my favorite PS3 games to date. It is truly one of those titles that once you complete it, that you get the great feeling of accomplishment and feel like it was totally worth it.Enchanted Arms storytelling and action is quite compelling however without the addition of the autoplay feature, I could not imagine people getting the game.

All said and done I just don't find it near as fun as the first two games. The setting is fun and the environment activity is amazing. However the tracks themselves really are too cluttered and not as interesting as the other games. The clutter can make it really hard to see your path and it seems very inconsistant what you can drive through debris wise and what you can't. That said  It really ceases to really feel like a good offroad racing game like the original two games with all of these issues.I'm torn on this game. On one hand I want to recommend it but part of me can't. If you can go into this game not expecting the Motorstorm of old you can find some enjoyment. However if you want something that feels like the first two games then I'd avoid it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0049DYNNO","description":"","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"Perfect for those who do not have the original SNES cartridge this is based on","reviewText":"In 1993, Nintendo decided to re-release the original NES Super Mario Bros games PLUS the version of Super Mario Bros 2 that was only released in Japan all on one SNES cartridge and call it Super Mario All Stars. Then they took it up several notches by updating the graphics and sounds of each individual game as if they were played as 16-bit SNES titles. It sold like hotcakes and eventually when they made more of the cartridges to keep up with the demand, they added an additional title, Super Mario World. I was fortunate to get it at the time and it was great to play through them all in updated graphics and all.Now, flash forward to the year 2010 and Nintendo announces they are releasing this on the Wii as a limited edition title. Renamed Super Mario All Stars Wii, this is the same exact version of the SNES title. That's right; you get four games (for reasons unknown, Super Mario World was omitted) as they were back in 1993. You also get an audio CD of the classic music tracks heard from various Mario games and an art book that discusses the history of Mario games. Having said all that, this begs me to ask:1) Why didn't Nintendo update the graphics and sound effects of all these games as if they were titles similar looking to the excellent New Super Mario Bros DS/Wii games?2) Why weren't there any extras included in the game disc? Why didn't they include additional classic Mario titles? There is still plenty of room left even after putting 4 games onto the same DVD. They could have added video interviews, retro commercials, etc.3) Why say that there are 20 tracks on the CD when 10 of them are just sound effects from the various Mario games?Many people would prefer to just have the music on the CD.4) The art book that comes with it is decent and all but doesn't really feature a lot of commentary from the creators of the games. All you get is a couple of lines and that's about it and it does not include all of the games Mario starred in.Overall, Super Mario Bros All Stars Wii Limited Edition is not a very, solid approach to honoring Mario and since they are celebrating his 25th anniversary, you would think that they would go all out. Realistically, this release is for those who no longer own any of the original versions of the titles included, own a working NES and SNES and did not download the original versions via the Virtual Console service. For $30, this would be an excellent value for those people. If you're a collector, then it is worth purchasing to own for years to come.I'm skipping on this for now because I own the SNES cart and have a working SNES so I can play this anytime I want. Maybe for the 30th, 40th or 50th anniversary Nintendo will wise up and put more effort into the tribute towards an international gaming icon.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2010"}

{"product_name":"B002ZJPYHS","description":"","reviewerName":"genocidal_maniac","summary":"Interesting premise. Uninspired and dull level design","reviewText":"This is a very weird and disjointed game. It is an interesting idea that's worth pursuing, but the execution and just some general design choices make it fall short of better games in the genre.To start off, this game is set in the current US war in Afghanistan vs the Taliban.Interesting premise, as I said. There are currently men and women dying in Afghanistan. There is much human suffering. Some people might question this. I think, eh, it's no worse than depicting WWII or the Vietnam war which many games had done before.Where this game falls short is in the characters and in the gameplay. The reason for this is because of the dueling objectives. It is set in \"real life.\" Yet, the gameplay is arcade-like. This is very weird to experience. Shooting is very quick and accurate. Reloading is extremely fast. You have regenerating health. The worst thing you see happen to a squadmate is a dislocated shoulder, while you seem to be able to kill dozens of Taliban without a sweat.But because it's set in real life, the enemies are a little too close to reality. It's like reality with a dash of whimsical. They are 2-dimensional basically no different from robots. Call of Duty's enemies are similarly stupid, but COD isn't set in real life. COD is kind of like a big dumb Michael Bay movie, and so is removed from reality when you play it.The level design is extremely bad in this game compared to Call of Duty. Modern Warfare 2 especially had some very impressive gaming moments in the level design. Here in Medal of Honor, the levels feel very cramped and static, with no inspiration. the \"walls\" of the world are very obvious, making you feel even more constrained. All games have \"walls\" of course, but a smart level designer finds a way to make them invisible and organic.Pretty much every level has some stupid moment where you run up and have a buddy give you a hand up like a 6 foot ledge. There is no reason for this, almost as if the level designers were simply tasked with putting one in every level.The personality is completely lacking in this game. There is no interesting banter between squadmates. Is that realistic? Yeah, probably. But in real life there will be at least conversations during \"down time\" at the base. You don't see that. So there is less attachment.While I have compared this game with Call of Duty a lot, another game to keep in mind is the ultra-realistic ARMA and Flashpoint games. Afghanistan can be made interesting if you have the movement limitations of a real life soldier. But with arcadey movement + shooting, the real life setting becomes too limiting. Arcadey movement + shooting requires epic settings. Realistic movement and shooting works well with real life setting. This game is in-between and suffers for it.Interestingly, I've only spent a few minutes in the multiplayer, and I do feel like it's better than Call of Duty and Battlefield 3. Better than Call of Duty because...Call of Duty has a pretty lousy game engine and is largely hitscan (they make up for this by creativity in level design and character work). Better than Battlefield 3 because this focuses on close combat and not on vehicles, which always felt clunky to me.The multiplayer is actually made by a different development team using a completely different engine. Go figure. Just another disjointed aspect.There are some interesting moments. And of all the games set in Afghanistan that I know of, this one does seem like the most cinematic.Still, it's lacking something. Like, it's missing a true creative genius who understands how to make a good game.There are better games. No recommendation.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2013"}

Well dear reader I will tell you why.  SUPER MARIO 64 is a gaming revolution,  it was the game that everyone had to have.  It took Mario into a whole new atmosphere.  The world that is inside Princess Peach's(aka Princess Toadstool) castle is immense and highly imaginative.  Although the graphics may seem a little bit dated(it was a launch game remember that) it is still a sight to see.  As far as play control goes, it is a bit difficult to get the hang of moving Mario around, but once you get used to it then controlling Mario is a breeze.  In fact it is some of the best playcontrol that a game has to offer.  The Super Mario 64 storyline is familiar to Mario fans but at the same time a touch refreshing.  Yes Peach is captured but she is being held prisnor in her own castle(in a picture in fact), and one of the funnest parts of the game is hanging out outside.  One of my problems is that Luigi is not in the game, in fact no mention of him is made either.  Nintendo should have left the Mario Party franchise alone and focused on creating a Super Mario 64 2, but alas they didn't.  So if you own a Nintendo 64 and don't have this title, or are thinking of buying a N64, then get Super Mario 64 because it is by far a true gaming experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2001"}

{"product_name":"B00005ML10","description":"One of the most anticipated titles in PlayStation2 history absolutely  lives up to the hype.Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Libertyis the  follow-up to one of the most captivating and intelligent adventures on the original  PlayStation. Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M.

{"product_name":"B00005UNWB","description":"The publishers ofGrand Theft Auto IIIare back with another game  geared towards a mature audience. But fans ofGTA IIIshould note that  whileState of Emergencycontains adult themes and extremely violent  gameplay, that's pretty much where the similarities end. WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number  of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode,  but it's strictly one player. In spite of these flaws, the game remains  addictive and fun. It bears repeating that gamers looking for anotherGTA  IIIwill not find it here: this game provides an arcadelike experience  that's excellent, but in a very different way. Parents should note that this  game carries a Mature rating for its blood, violence, and gore.--Raymond M.

Don't play SoE and expect it to be like GTA3,it's not,but it's still alot of fun.This game for the most part is about destroying buildings, blowing up people and creating pure chaos in a riot.(Sound fun huh?-evil grin-)There is a revolution mode,where you attempt to solve the problems of the oppresive forces with indvidual missonsincluding escorting certain people,finding items,and even a few assasinations.This part of the game gets really frustrating really fast esp on the escorting missions.The people you escort do not defend themselves at all,and when you have a small army hunting you down,it's tough to stick up for a guy with low defense all the time.Another bad thing about revolution mode,is that there aren't alot of good weapons that randomly generate (including guns!)and when you have 10-12 guys with guns,flame throwers and even rocket launchers,a can of mace or a club just ain't gonna cut it!Buy this game to play in chaos mode;that's where the true beauty of this game lies.One serious downfall with this game is that mostly everything is\"locked\".Meaning that all the stages but the first,and all the playable characters but two are unable to be played unless you achieve high scores or pass certain levels in revolution mode. Really bad idea especially if you start the game up for the first time wanting to play as the big,fat ex-gang member!! This can all be solved of course by getting cheat codes off the internet!(Don't you just love cheats!!)Some people complain that there is not a 2 player mode;which IS kinda bad,being the fact that no one really helps you out in the game(some gang members will help you beat up oppressive forces,but alot of the times while you are trying to pummel on the same target,you accidentally punch the guy who's helping you!A gang member won'ttake kindly to that!)I think however if a 2 player mode was enabled,there would be a split screen on the tv;one showing where the first player is,and the other showing where the second is.Man,I hate that!So it's really no big deal that there's not a two player mode to me,you might feel diffrently...Controls are really easy to get familiar with and you will be amazed at how fast the hours fly by when you play in chaos mode!The music is just typical fighter-game background music;nothingspectacular,but it's not bad either.All and all,buy this game soyou can play it whenever you want to relieve stress and blow up,shoot,beat,ignite and completely obliterate some virtual people!Look up the cheat codes to solve the lack of variety with playable characters(once you enter the cheat codes and save to a memory card,those \"locked\" players will always be available for you to play with!)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2002"}

{"product_name":"B0002CHJ8C","reviewerName":"Crono \"Mega RPG gamer\"","summary":"Amazing game, but difficulty kills it.","reviewText":"Tekken 5 is to put it quite simply, one of the best fighting games out there. You have Virtua Fighter 4 EVO for the absolute hardcore, you have Soul Calibur II for the casual fighters, and you have Tekken 5 which appeals to button mashers, casual players, and the hardcore alike.Starting with graphics, Tekken 5 is absolutely gorgeous. This game is simply beautiful as they come. Amazing backgrounds, character models, lifelike expressions, amazing handrawn narratives and incredibe CG movies are just a testament to Namco's efforts to up the graphics. Tekken 5 is easily one of the best looking PS2 games, and no joke, it would also be one of the best looking GC or Xbox games at least. One level in particular, Moonlight Wilderness is just amazing. The soundtrack is very good, and seriously help to transform the fights beyond the screen. One track in particular from the Moonlight Wilderness level is phenomenal.Gameplay has remained unchanged since Tekken 3. The game is still very well balanced, but rewards players that practice and master a handful of characters. There is a very large cast of characters that are incredibly diverse, unlike say VF4 EVO's cast. Still, it rewards speed, and if you're looking for something fast, this is your game no doubt.As for extras, Tekken 5 is loaded with them. It's got a ton of CG endings, Tekkens 1-3, a Devil Within Action minigame, trailers, a theater mode for watching the various character endings again (which you will want to do), the entire game sountrack for your listening pleasure and even trailers from the various shows of the game! It's brimming with unlockable characters which surprisingly, are not too difficult to get.So what drags down the game to 4 stars? It's not the lack of innovation. Sure the game hasn't changed much, but why would you want it to? Look at any good game series, Halo, Gran Turismo, Dead or Alive, Soul Calibur, they all are mostly just upgrades rather than full on brand new games. No that's not the problem. For one thing, the game has no online play. It is simply a shame especially considering that you can customize your character to an amazing extent. But even more so, it's simply too difficult. For the newbies, there is no tutorial mode. I'm pretty bad at fighting games, but I always liked Tekken for its accessibility. Unfortunately, the difficulty tends to spike often in the Story Mode, and as usual, there are plenty of moves which are still difficult to execute due to their insane amount of button combinations. Furthermore, the final boss must go down as the cheapest boss in history. He has an insane amount of overpowered moves such as a fireball that takes out at minimum 50% of your health, and at max 90%. And not only is it a fast attack with no cooldown period (he often uses it 3 or 4 times in a row) there is no way to dodge it unless you quickly sidestep. What a shame that the entire game is so balanced, but the final boss just kills it even on the easiest setting. With such a large cast, only the most powerful characters with powerful single moves such as Jin or Kazuya will be able to win the final battle, while people like Xiayou or Kuma will have a hellishly impossible time trying to beat the boss.Ultimately, Tekken 5 is a great game. If you liked previous Tekkens, you will like this game. But the stunning difficulty, and the completely overpowered and incredibly cheap final boss almost destroys the best part of the game, the story mode. It takes a whole lot of patience, and quite possibly some broken controllers to beat the final boss. Still, this game is worth, at least, a rental. You really need to play this game to appreciate how awesome it is, shortcomings and all.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2005"}

The action is intense, the gameplay is fantastic, and the sheer, jaw-dropping gore is over the top.If you like action games, you'll love this game.  If you like violent games, you'll love this game.  If you like vulgar humor (which I don't care for all that much), you'll love this game.  Mature is kind of an understatement.  The cussing is extreme to say the least.  The good news is that if you don't want to hear it you can turn the voices off.What really makes this game better than the average action game is . . . well . . . everything!  The graphics are amazing if you like the style.  To be honest, the black/white visuals are what first caught my attention.  The sound and music are really good as well.  Although a lot of the songs are hip hop which I don't care for, they actually seem to fit when you're playing.  The moves you can perform add lots of variety.  Plenty of ways to attack, lots of items to use as weapons (such as barrels and spikes), and cool finishing moves.  You even get to use a golf club to hit people's heads off!One reviewer commented on not liking the fact that if you lose you must restart from the beginning of the level.  Trust me . . . that's not a problem.  It's so worth it to go back through the level to score obnoxious kills!  I've died a few times (i.e. I lost all my continues and died again), and I was more than happy to go back through the level to smash some Jack-fodder.  The action just doesn't get dull.  The boss fights are really cool, and actually offer a pretty good challenge (and I'm on Normal Mode).The story is rather interesting, and the voice acting is well performed.  It offers some great humor that had me laughing out loud!  My wife watched me play a level one time, and even she was getting into the game!  I was fighting a boss, and she was yelling \"Watch out!\" \"Here he comes!\" etc.  That was a great experience!The controls work perfectly from my experience.  It has great use of the motion controls, the camera works very well, and in spite of what others have said I find the lock-on feature to be very effective.Basically, the only real cons to this game are what most would consider the pros.  If you don't like lots of violence, language, crude humor, etc. then you won't like MadWorld.  Obviously if you don't like action games you won't like it either.  But if you like these things, you will love MadWorld.  Actually, there is one minor problem I have with this game.  The writing in the game (which gives you some objectives in the first area) is very small.  I have a pretty small TV, so that's probably the reason, but if you already have a widescreen it probably won't make a difference.Do yourself a favor, and immerse yourself in some Madness!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00012BSJ4","description":"When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing:Metroid. Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better.

I can remember the joy that flooded my heart as I walked out of that GameStop in Conroe with my newest toy. I can remember how cool I felt as I stuffed that beast into my back pocket, and I remember how quickly I put it up on Ebay. The original Nintendo DS was a cool system, but it looked ugly and it really didn't make you feel cool. The new DS Lite, however, oozes cool and will undoubtedly make the system a must-buy for any Nintendo fan!Whereas the old DS was silver and clunky, DS Lite is sleek, shiny, and iPod-y. Additionally, Nintendo has made some small changes to just make this system work a lot better. For example, the microphone, which used to be located on the bottom left corner of the gadget is now right in the middle. This helps in a game like Brain Age where you use the microphone. Now, you just hold it like you normall would and you don't have to put your mouth in some weird location. Also, the power button which used to be located above the D-Pad is now located on the side of the unit. I can remember getting really far in a level in Mario 64 DS and then accidentally hitting that button and losing all my unsaved data...no more. Nintendo has also made the stylus a little fatter this time around, making it much easier to hold and enjoy.Of course, none of this is new information to anyone who has been following this product since it's announcement in early January (me). However, I was surprised at how small, sleek, and cool looking this product really is. Additionally, I was blown away by how many neat games are now on the system. I currently have Mario Kart DS, which is just awesome (especially on Nintendo Wi-Fi Connect), and Brain Age, which I can't tear my family away from. Add in Animal Crossing, Metroid Prime Hunters, and New Super Mario Brothers and you literally have one of the most impressive handheld systems ever!The DS Lite still does everything the original did, but the package is much more inviting this time around. I highly recommend it to any Nintendo fan and anyone debating on whether to get a DS Lite or a PSP. There is really no contest here.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2006"}

I am already a PSP owner and had both PS3 and Xbox 360, PS2, NES up to the old school Game Boy. From the two hand-helds I like both the same. I feel the PSP is more ergonomic and feels much sturdier (holds better in my hands, no fatigue after hours of play due to a larger screen and firm buttons) and is a good travel companion. The DS could have been if it had a dual voltage charger. I care about this because I go on vacations overseas to see my family, friends and home country. A 3rd party dual voltage charger is available but the PSP comes standard with one (just have to get a cheap Euro plug).However, I got it mainly for being nostalgic about Mario, Kirby and Zelda games. I grew up in the NES era so this brings back nice memories. The graphics are definitely nice and I don't want to compare this with the PSP's because there's no point. I'll take better gameplay over better graphics anytime...Another potentially weak point I see in the DS lite are the screen hinges. I'm very careful with my gadgets but just opening and closing the lid fees little bit flimsy and might give up in the long term. The x,y,a,b buttons are also smaller than on the PSP's so think this was designed more towards women and kids but it is definitely playable.The screen is nice lit and games are very colorful - it's been a joy playing the New Super Mario games just for little over one hour. Sound is great too!Oh, and wireless lacks WPA/WPA2 protocols so you have to lower your router's security settings to make it work with the DS lite which is not a very good thing (the PSP supports WPA and WPA2 along with WEP which is standard on the DS lite).Given all these minuses I've found over the PSP I take it only one star being my next choice of gaming for platformer games (the PSP has good platformers too but I like the Ds's much better).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2009"}
{"product_name":"B001NIP3EG","reviewerName":"Jeff W. Shimkus \"Movie Manji\"","summary":"Better and easier than first Bioshock.","reviewText":"I like the easier hacker games in this game. The original Bioshock had difficult hacker games that were numerous. I often times used a buy out for the first one. In the sequel, I loved the replacement. It is easier, quicker, and still challenging (but not frustrating). the story is suspenseful and interesting.I have more confidence being a big daddy protected by armor and having WAY more slots for your spices. Fighting the big daddies was hard enough in the first without stumbling with the controls; switching from plasmids to weapons. You can use both in the sequel. I loved the choices you have to make throughout in dealing with little sisters and various characters. There are consequences with your actions and it is sometimes challenging to be good. You can harvest little sisters; which is especially cruel being that you are a big daddy. I had the most fun adopting little sisters and protecting them while they collect Adam. It took some strategy before hand, something that i did not enjoy as much as in the first.There is no lack of freshness in this game, which is too often the bitter cries from the fans of the original. It adds to what we know of Rapture, and it further involves us in confronting the political shake-up and all out civil war that made Rapture synonimous with plagued insanity. It involves the moral tale that man in never truely happy, and he seeks out to destroy his own creations.All this talk about the sequel must make you think that I didn't like the first. I loved the first Bioshock immensely! This series is my new favorite. It's dark, and scary, and very suspenseful. The first time I saved all the little sisters I heard a bone chilling scream. I really scared me. I knew it was the big sister, but still it took me off guard. I felt cornered and trapped. Desperate to survive. She moved quick. Damn quick! And jumped everywhere in ways I couldn't. Only by playing smart, and hitting hard, did I survive. I had so much fun playing this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2010"}

You never quite know what's around that corner or what's waiting for you at the end of a dark hallway.  Believe me, the shock moments are well executed in this game and will startle you on more than one occassion.  Walk by an abandoned car and suddenly a shrieking zombie comes skittering out from underneath it.  The sense of dread and fear you get when you run down the end of a dark hallway hoping to find an exit door only to see a zombie standing in the darkness slowly fading into view as your flashlight illuminates the area in front of you is enough to make anyone tense up with genuine fear.  Moments like these are what make the game so great...on it's own, SH2 is just a simple 3D puzzle/exploration/find-the-item game...but because you're always in a tense state as you perform trivial tasks like searching a room, etc., not knowing what will jump out at you, the game's rating instantly goes up to a 4 out of 5.The game is relatively hard the first time around as some of the puzzles are ridiculously obscure.  But the difficulty CAN be adjusted separately for the puzzles and main game itself.  But you owe it to yourself to play the game on NORMAL or HARD first.  As an added bonus, there's an extra scenario only for the XBOX, so we XBOX owners truly benefit!  Interesting game, and one that will hold you over until HALO 2 and Shenmue II come out!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00009WAUZ","reviewerName":"M. B. Link \"wildfirelink\"","summary":"Nice try Capcom, but I was bitterly disappointed","reviewText":"Mega Man X7(2003). The seventh game in a seven part series.Ever since Megaman X4 was released back in 1997, hardcore fans of the series were impatiently waiting for Capcom to follow up on its impressive streak of solid MMX games, I being one of those fans. It took them nearly four long years to finally make MMX5, and when they did, it received nothing but mixed reviews. While it still stayed tried and true to the classic 2D formula, there were a few changes that ended up bringing the game down, such as the lack of anime-cutscenes and a guiding feature that hindered more than helped the game. Despite these quibbles however, I felt that this game was needlessly bashed by other hardcore fans, so I stood up for it. Afterall it was still a fun game and it stuck tried and true to the classic gameplay. Same thing for MMX6, only this one got even more criticism by the die-hard fans. I personally thought X6 was a reasonable game, though the story was bad, but once again, it delivered in challenging old-school gameplay. As a hardcore fan who is open to most games, I am willing to defend X5 and X6 to the end. However, the same cannot be said about the new entry, X7. Read on and see why the negatives outweigh the positives:POSITIVES-For the most part, THE GRAPHICS HERE ARE PRETTY GOOD. Bringing the game to the PS2 was an advantage here because it allowed the environments to be brought fully into the 3D realm with lots of detail. Not only the environments, but also the characters were animated fairly well too.-Contrary to the last couple of X games, X7 ACTUALLY SPORTS AN EXCELLENT ROCK SOUNDTRACK. Nothing real memorable, but the tunes do stay true to the earlier games.-I like the option of BEING ABLE TO SWITCH BETWEEN TWO CHARACTERS AT ANYTIME DURING A LEVEL. This helps when a certain part of a level is too difficult with one character, but the one has an easier time.-Though most of the voice acting isn't necessarily great, I thought that the voices for Zero and Signas were excellent. If you pay close attention, you can tell that the voice for Signas is the same as the voice of Alucard from Castlevania: Symphony Of The Night.-And on the bright side, X certainly doesn't sound like a girl like he did in X4.-Certain enemies you encounter will bring up old memories of the first few MMX games.NEGATIVES-Here is where the X7 comes crashing down: WHEN A MMX GAME IS NO LONGER CLASSIC 2D, THEN A MMX GAME HAS LOST ITS \"SOUL\". What I mean is, by moving the game to 3D, the game loses its feel that most people have come to love. I'm not against making 3D games at all, quite the opposite in fact. It's just that the MMX series was meant to be classic sidescroller gaming, and by taking that away, the MMX games are reduced to nothing more than a generic 3D shooter that already looks like so many other games. Besides, we already have a 3D MM series, and that's none other than Mega Man Legends. I appreciate Capcom for trying to add a little bit of new to the formula, but this has really gone too far.-Also, without the classic 2D formula, the level designs become drab, without excitement.-While there were some places where the camera switched to 2D sideview, in both modes THE CONTROLS ARE VERY SLUGGISH. This is probably what turned me off the most about X7. Remember how X and Zero had smooth controls in all the past games? Well, its mostly gone now. Having sluggish controls is a big nono when it comes to these games because the games are all about fast action, and the game becomes no fun to play when your controls aren't very responsive.-Unresponsive controls means the game is going to be very difficult to play, and not in a good way.-A MMX GAME WHERE YOU HAVE TO UNLOCK X, THE _MAIN_ CHARACTER?? Utter Blasphemy.-What's the point of Axl? He may be an easy character to use, but he's just plain annoying. I cringe everytime he speaks.-Remember how in X6 how they thankfully gave you the option of listening or not listening to Alia's advice? WELL THEY SOMEHOW MESSED THAT UP HERE TOO! Everytime you get to certain points (which is like every few feet) Alia will whine at you to listen to her advice. This is almost as annoying as when you were FORCED to listen to her in X5.-Also, the dialogue moves very slowly and you are forced to sit through everything.-The story has gone so far off track that it's become difficult to follow. So Zero is still around even after X6 where he (*SPOILER ALERT*) put himself into a capsule pod to awaken in the future where the MM Zero games take place? His presence in X7 completely negates those two games, AND THEY ARE VERY GOOD MM GAMES TOO, unlike this one here.-Don't get me started on the bosses. It's been stated before but Capcom really has run out of ideas for bosses. An onion?? I won't even touch that one.-The gameplay can become very unbalanced at times. While Zero can storm levels, it's nearly impossible to use him on most bosses in the game, even the easy ones.-WHAT'S THE POINT IN PUTTING SIGMA IN THE GAME?? Is there some sort of rule where Sigma has to be the final boss in every X game, regardless of how he does/doesn't tie in to the plot? He hasn't been an important storyline element at all since X5, where he was a BIG part of the plot. I just wish Capcom would surprise us a little in that area.While I do give Capcom props for trying to add new dimensions to the MMX series, it proved to be a vain attempt to get a new audience, and it ended up only making everyone yawn. Since it's a bad game overall, I'm giving it only 2 stars. 1 star is too low though because I only reserve that for absolutely terrible games. X7 is still somewhat playable. It's just not my cup of tea, and that's saying alot because I'm actually a lot more open to newer MM games than most of the diehard fans are. They will continue to put down X5 and X6 needlessly, but I believe X7 is where the low point really is. Once the game has lost all the aspects of the MMX series, it's over. X7 unfortunately demonstrates that fact. I hate to say it, but this is where Capcom should call it quits. IF YOU ARE A NEW FAN, AVOID. OTHERWISE THIS GAME IS A WEEKEND RENTAL AT BEST.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2004"}

{"product_name":"B004YVOCYG","description":"","reviewerName":"Gustavo \"VidGame Junkie\"","summary":"Ezio has gotten old.","reviewText":"Intitially, while I was waiting for the game to come out, I knew that if the developers tried to add too much to this tower, it would eventually fall over. In the case of Revelations, there are some added content which is great, others not so much. Die-hard AC fans have played three games arleady, and most likely exhausted all there is to be given. For Revelations, it still stays true to the classic AC feel. Classic enough that they brought back Altair from the first game of old, but the fact that he has a changed look and voice might disappoint players who have played the game series till this point. I can tell in some dialogue that the actor they put on tried to follow the same format as the original voice of Altair, and cudos to him. Nevertheless, the accent takes away the stoic nature. Now, I don't wish to put out that the game is horrible, I say the contrary.Story-wise, it is the same but with a new twist towards Constantinople. The story was well put together, with two different main objectives for the story line. The ending, and I speak from my own experience, does bring nostaligic players to some sad moments, but I digress to avoid spoiling it.Gameplay is pretty much the same as Brotherhood, but vamped up slightly to fit the new disc. You now get a hookblade, which vastly increases freerunning and climbing cabability. Also, challenges for different factions unlock different perks, such as weapons or faction abilities. In fights, it was a job well done. The higher ranking officers do sometimes make a fighter finally take the flight, either for difficulty reasons or it just takes too long and isn't worth it. Otherwise, there are many different types of guards that force the player to adjust in mid-battle. And, of course, along with the good old throwing knives and then the infamous crossbow, you get bombs. You get a good selection of bomb types to choose from, which is a good way to determine a sense of style. The only issue I had hear was with some aspects of gameplay, such as sending assassins to do missions across the country. It is the same thing, but with a little more need to always look at the map and see how annoying it is to keep an area occupied. But Ezio is now a mentor, so that is an excuse.In regards to combining the first game and the second and thirs game, the developers did a good job. I mainly liked the soundtrack from AC1 and was sort of disappointed that the darkness was sort of taken away onward. But this game does a good job combining both styles music-wise. But, that is just me liking music. The game strongly advertised the ability to play as both Ezio and Altair. What that did is sort of put high expectations on how much you get to play as Altair, when in reality it is less than half of what you can do with Ezio. However, this is still Ezio's game and Altair is looking over the shoulder, so if you want to get Revelations just for Altair round 2, find a different reason.Multiplayer is still fantastic, and the gameplay has been advance for all good reasons. I say that multiplayer was the best thing that developers had done to continue and add off from Brotherhood.In conclusios, this is a great game for fans (Assassin noobs may have some trouble following the story obviously). Though the main story is short compaired to its predecessors (Especially AC2), it still satisfied me. I don't give it a 5 star rating only for the little annoyances that got me, but the fun factor is all the way up. This game was a good way to close the stories of Ezio and Altair.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2012"}

A decade has passed since the events of the first game, and the face of E.D.N. III has changed dramatically. Terraforming efforts have been successful and the ice has begun to melt, giving way to lush tropical jungles and harsh unforgiving deserts. Players will enter this new environment and follow the exploits of their own customized snow pirate on their quest to seize control of the changing planet.GameplayLost Planet 2, like the original game in the series, is a third-person shooter featuring huge boss battles, challenging terrain and the ability to pop in and out of battle mechs, known in-game as Vital Suits. The primary difference in gameplay this time around hinges on the inclusion of RPG gameplay elements. Players can now customize many of the aspects of their playable snow pirate, including his physical attributes, clothing and to a certain extent, weaponry and gestures. Players will control these customized heroes across 6 interconnected episodes, creating a truly unique and interactive experience that changes depending upon the actions of the players involved. With this concept, players will have the opportunity to engage in the story in a much more dynamic way as plot threads evolve from different players' perspectives.MultiplayerBeyond the deep single player mode,Lost Planet 2is loaded with extensive multiplayer modes and play options.

Machine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers, lasers, sniper rifles, grenades and a host of other weapons are scattered across the game. However,Lost Planet 2's biggest weapons come on two legs: the heavily armed and armored robotic Vital Suits return in greater numbers and variety than the first game. There are Vital Suits that transform into other vehicles, and even some that hold up to three players and take multiple players to operate. Also, the grappling hooks that made the gameplay inLost Planeta true 3D experience are back, allowing gamers to gain tactical advantage by quickly scaling buildings.Key Features4-player Co-op Action- Team up to battle the giant Akrid in explosive 4-player cooperative play.

With everything I've seen here, I was expecting stunning graphics and rock-solid controls. Sadly the graphics, while detailed and often inspired, remind me of a pop-happy version of Portal 2. They aren't bad by a long shot. Objects just tend to jump around where resolution is concerned. And your doll-like arm takes away from what is otherwise a very well executed atmosphere of fear. Even with all of the abilities you'll gain (which should make you feel like a fearless superhero), the sound and lighting in this game are going to get under your skin and you'll end up fearful of turning the next corner.The controls feel overly loose. This is not a precision shooter. I almost always found myself wanting to melee wherever possible, to avoid the need for aiming and firing any of the guns in this game. Your field of vision is even more claustrophobic here than what you could expect in other first person gaming experiences. Add to it enemies that disorient you further, and a map that looks simple enough, but doesn't translate well into the world you see before you; and you've got enough cons to draw this game farther from the bullseye than other reviewers have purported it to be hitting.Collectible objects are often difficult to see, and you'll have to be very precise in looking at them in order to retrieve them. Placement of such objects is not well thought out. Too many times I would pick up a recording directly next to a vending machine, and find myself unable to play the recording without activating the vending machine. Switching between left hand powers and right hand weapons sounds like a good idea, but isn't intuitive enough to be called effective.In the end, I thought Bioshock presented a very unique experience, an often insanely frightening environment, and (though I kept hoping the game would improve upon my opinion) a mediocre experience with regard to control, collecting and field of vision. While I am disappointed overall, this still isn't a bad game. It just isn't one I want to pick back up a second time; not even to go after the platinum trophy. So try it before you buy it. For there are better games out there to be played. But if you've run out of new options, there are also games much worse than this to be found.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2011"}

This one is the perfect blend of difficulty, replacement ammo and health kits. Often the monsters come in groups and are tough, but you can usually kill them (after a death or two) by using a little strategy in your weapon choice and making sure you pick up the health kits that drop next to the dying creatures during the battle.The game auto saves only at levels (called chapters) but for the most part you aren't left with terrible situations to redo (unless you died in one). As long as you continue to play you are given the chance to replay from a point right before you died. Only when you quit the game and come back do you drop completely back to the beginning of the last level you attained. This isn't so bad because there are some things you wish you'd done differently, especially in the realm of blasting open a few boxes to collect ammo and other goodies.I have a fairly large (52 inch) screen and the video is awesome.

The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn't become too easy. In addition,Extractionalso features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed.

It takes you through the encounter of the marker, and then you start to see the colony's workers hallucinating and go on killing sprees. This had a more story-developing element in that you get to see what happened firsthand. This is definitely worth investing in for those who follow the Dead Space story and are interested in seeing the original outbreak of the colony.Visually, the game was well done, especially for it being on the Wii platform. The visual elements really coincided with what you see in the original Dead Space. What you do to Ishimura will be seen in Dead Space - there were times when I played the original thinking, \"I wonder what caused that to happen\", and then you see those elements in Extraction! The music and sound effects also go hand-in-hand with the elements of the original (the ones that stick out in particular are the doors opening and the computer voice of the Ishimura). You also get the same choice of array in weapons from the original game, which is also a big plus. Mechanic wise, I was satisfied. There were times where I felt a little overloaded with the mechanics due to me forgetting which part of the nunchuk a weapon selection was tied to and not having the HUD readily available on screen (there are multiple times where weapon mapping will change). There are moments where you get to pick a path and can look around the room freely (going off the \"rail\") - I wish those moments lasted longer, as they seemed rather too brief to snag everything in the room). Also, I got rather frustrated while encountering bosses and had no ammo on me, nor were there any ammo crates in the room to grab from (some boss fights lasted 20 minutes because I had no other weapon with ammo except the basic welder which has poor damage dealing).The bonus material is also a good collectors addition to the Dead Space story, as it includes 6 Episodes of the graphic comic that followed the story with the colony.Overall, I was very pleased with the game. I was a little disappointed in the amount of gameplay and a few parts of the mechanics, but with it being a rail game, I'm willing to be forgiving.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2011"}

The idea of a floating city-marvelous. The tongue in cheek comments about our society and religion- priceless. The concept of multiple timelines and dimensions was awesome. But shame they didn't incorporate at least one without violence. If you are the average gamer you will likely love this game. If you have grown tired of games that use killing as the only solution to everything and are looking to do more than combine various weapon to kill more and better it will perhaps lead you to ask a few questions.I enjoyed the jabs at political and social engineering propaganda.  I even appreciated the fact that it showed political change as just another bloody power lust and the rather mystical ending. The people who put this game together seem to be both politically and socially aware. I just wish they would have spent a bit more time exploring the positive side of that mystical element and not fall prey to shooting everything in sight...like 90% of the games available for the XBOX.Isn&#8217;t it time that gaming embrace more than dumb puzzles and gunplay. I wanted to finish the game so I could write this review, and it had a good ending, but I really had to force myself to keep killing everything in sight. Aren&#8217;t we over killing yet?? The folks who did this game are obviously very bright. How about a sequel where the fight for freedom ends in a society where we don&#8217;t buy into a choice between two types of violence and imprisonment. Can we visit a lighthouse that looks more like Fresco&#8217;s Venus Project??? Can we combine political intrigue with plots to liberate free energy from corporations and end with a better world? No one is writing games that show the real struggle of going from a consumer society where most people live in poverty to one where our basic needs are REALLY provided for without trying to dominate others. How about it folks? Perhaps a combination world of the early Fable series with some quantum physics and positive social engineering. And if you accept the challenge please make it run on the 360 platform. I am not going to do the Xbox One. There simply aren&#8217;t enough unique games to hold my interest anymore. I&#8217;m tired of killing and solving dumb puzzles.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2013"}

You have no choice but to spend 15-30 minutes wondering where is the game introduction? What am I doing?  At the end, you sort of start from scratch, with a mission to recover those 3 elemental warriors as well as seven others who will help you in completing your quest.  Later on you'll realize that this was the best option to get you prepared for the rest of the adventure.The adventure is linear, especially inside the temples; you just keep going forward defeating the evil trolls.  The fights are constant and challenging and with so many warriors in your control, there's almost no repetitive combat.My favorite part of the game was in the Badlands, where I had the chance to climb on a horse and ride past literally hundreds of computer generated trolls fighting with your soldiers.  Looking closer I could see their health status dropping on both the trolls and the guards, then I got too close and the trolls headed in my direction, and my soldiers behind them, amazing AI!  With all this happening, I also had to dodge blazing cannonballs that spurt dirt and debris when they hit the ground. Then you add the epic background music (from the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra and Kings Choir) and it felt like I was being part of a scene of the Lord of the Rings movie, you really have to see it to believe it.All emotion aside (my heart is still pumping from that last paragraph) I highly recommend this game, it's pretty impressive for a launch title.  It's also not that difficult, which is great for younger kids and mature players alike.  The built-in auto-save feature worked effectively by saving your progress immediately after completing an important fight or event.  I never found myself backtracking because of a missed save.By the way, play this game on a high definition TV if you have the chance and witness the difference in quality, you'll be surprised.This game offers lots of fun for young and adult audiences.  The Teen rating is too conservative in my opinion; I never saw anything resembling blood in this game.  I guess an E rating would give the impression that this was a kiddie title, a turn-off for some gamers these days, believe it or not.Anyway, I hope that you find this review helpful.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2005"}
{"product_name":"B0002MPT6Q","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"space_hamster\"","summary":"Near perfect combination of RTS and Turn-based strategy","reviewText":"Up til' now, the Total War Series has slipped under it's radar. Although it has earned the respect of hardcore gamers, the niggling annoying features in previous incarnations were a major turnoff. Fortunately, with Rome: Total War, the Total War series finally comes into its own. This is the most fulfilling Strategy game created to-date - it's every hardcore strategists wet dream. The game itself is extremely configurable - you can command the computer to supervise the management of conquered cities, and automatically resolve any military conflicts. Or, as you gain experience, you can master these features yourself (a choice which pays off in the long run).The number of military, diplomatic and espionage tactics that you can pursue are near-infinite. Rebel army blocking your trade routes? Either bribe them with a diplomat, or annihilate them with an army. Beseiging a large town? Either attack the town immediately with ballistas and onagers, or wait for several more turns and starve them out instead.The piece-de-resistance of this game is the real-time combat engine, which rivals Warhammer: Total War in sheer detail and visceral brutality. It's possible to zoom-in to watch realistic battles between enemy troops, or zoom-outwards to get the overall view of a battle. From my experience, the game engine runs smoothly on midrange PC's (AMD 2000+, 1GB RAM, GEForce FX5700 Ultra). Seeing a group of infantry being hurled into the air or crushed by a cavalry charge is awesome to behold.The best aspect of real-time combat, is that it relies less heavily on the rock-paper-scissors system that other RTS games have used (eg. Age of Mythology, Empire Earth, etc...). A specific unit is not required to counter another unit. For instance, both Hastari, Principia and Trarii can be used to counter cavalry - but a spear-wielding Triarii would still be the best choice. Once you start playing, it is intuitively obvious which is the best counter-unit to use.The only negative aspect of the game is the prologue/tutorial. At no point are you allowed to save the game, which means you must spend 2-3 hours trudging through the tutorial before you can finish it. This will definitely be off-putting to new players. A word of advice to Creative Assembly: Add a savegame option to the prologue in a future patch.In summary, RTW is a bona-fide classic of its genre. The Total War series has reached a whole new level with this latest entry. Like other fans, I look forward to Napoleon: Total War!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2004"}

They are eerie, atmospheric and overall, smooth and interesting. The humans look excellent and the monsters look outrageous. Being that the game so dark, however, you really aren't able to see that much of the level design. (Though what you do see is very cool). The cutscenes are very well done and a pleasure to watch.STORY: The story is very cool and interesting. When I play - I'm interested in watching the cutscenes and interested in what's going on. The story is pretty easy to follow and the dialogue acting is pretty well done.GAMEPLAY: Here is my only complaint with the game. The game can be kind of repetitive. It sticks to a pretty basic FPS outline. Go in room, clear room, get items in room, move on to next room. There are some variants to that formula, but not a lot. Otherwise, it plays just like a classic FPS. The game is definetely a blast to play. The atmosphere to this game is the best I've ever seen. This game is creepy, really creepy. Sometimes, when you go into a room, the lights will just go out and an evil laugh and then... you get the idea.SOUND: There are some really creepy sounds in the game, some really scary random noises. There isn't really much music in the game, but what sound there is sounds really good. Especially with the 5.1 that the game comes with. The noises the monsters make are pretty scary too.OVERALL: This game is awesome. The complaints I have are rather minor when you compare it to how much fun this game is to play. Graphically it is the best I've seen to date. (8/9/04). And it is also the scariest game ever. I've jumped playing it on several occassions.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired.

Not realistic in the very human way, but beautifully animated. Some will obviously find fault with that and complain.2.The controls are easy to use- a mix of sword fighting and magic curses. There are combos but no button mashing that makes you want to throw the controller.3.The main character is not only a girl, but the daughter of Death who thought she was an orphan. She has kind of an empty personality...4. It's a relatively open world, but you won't need to spend hours wandering through endless forests searching for a way out- there is a map in the corner for reference.The negatives; there ARE glitches and bugs that haven't been patched. This gets in the way of not only progressing in the game, but also the all-important achievements. Where it got me was glitching out the boatman more than halfway through the game. Without him, there is no way to get to the island where the last treasure is hidden. I was so frustrated I put the game on hold. Other glitches I experienced were characters temporarily disappearing or getting stuck, but resetting the game fixed those for me.The main character and her endless love for her dead boyfriend get really really old really really fast. The reunion scenes where they meet in the underworld are always the same and always pointless.Despite the glitches, I would definitely recommend this game...I haven't found anything else like it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2012"}

I couldn't get an hour into Oblivion or Dragon Age before I got bored.  That's simply a matter of taste.  My brother in law prefers games that are so complicated you have to take a night class at the local community college to get a handle on how to move your character.  And that's perfectly fine.That being said, if you focus too much on the idea of this game being an RPG, you are probably going to be underwhelmed.  The customization of the main character is very limited.  The plot is largely linear, with the exception of dialog choices that affect how other characters regard you.  You have some skill trees to build on as you get experience points and you can emphasize whether you're a sneaky type or a &#34;I'VE BROUGHT HELL WITH ME!&#34; kind of ruffian.  You get the standard variety of firearms (pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, SMG) that you can (and will need) to customize as you get the funds to do so, and that's about it.So, if you want a game that gives you tons of options that will ultimately affect the gameplay... well, not so much.But for me, that's about as complicated as I want it.  There are little hints in the intel that you gather that helps you know how to talk to certain people, but that's as far as I want to go.  Plop me down in a mission and let's DO THIS.And when you are &#34;doing it,&#34; it's a lot of fun.  When I play this game, I find myself *thinking* like a spy.  I sneak around, hack computers, disable security systems and will almost always take a moment to crack a safe (all done through three different types of mini-games that are challenging without being tedious).  I'll sneak up on guys for a quick kill.  If they're too far away, I'll use my silenced assault rifle bullets to take 'em down.  And when things hit the fan, I'll break out my modified shotgun.It's not ground-breaking.  The story isn't on a level of &#34;Heavy Rain,&#34; or even the &#34;Mass Effect&#34; trilogy.  The combat is duck and shoot, similar in mechanics to the Uncharted series or the aforementioned Mass Effect games.  But it's well-delivered.  The missions are very well thought out (at least, to me and my attention span).  And above all else, I had a blast playing it.Considering the price, you can't go wrong.  It's not a run and gun FPS or RPG.  It's a third-person shooter with some storytelling elements and moderate customization.  It's not hard to pick up and the game does a great job encouraging you to build your skills.  All things considered, this is a must-have for anyone who enjoys a third-person shooter.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2014"}

Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros.

The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"Mor and Tookie","summary":"Love it!","reviewText":"This game is so much fun.

We have in our household now 2 XBOX 360s, one XBOX, a Gamecube, and a Wii.  We had another Gamecube before, and a Nintendo 64 before that.  So I'm not an \"XBOX Fanboy\" or whatever--I'm actually glad Nintendo is doing well.I just think the Wii is this year's Cabbage Patch Kid or Tickle Me Elmo.  Everybody wants once simply because everybody wants one.I'm also mystified at the ratings the Wii and its games are getting.  I picked up Metroid and Mario Galaxy and thought those would be \"sure things\" in a sea of awful games currently available for the Wii.  Boy was I wrong.NO CAMERA CONTROL FOR MARIO??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  This was a major step forward in platforming and gaming in general, all the way back to Mario 64.  It's a limitation of the Wii hardware, I suppose, so I think it fits here in a general review of the Wii.How is \"pointing\" the Wii-mote in Metroid better than an analog stick?  At least you have \"camera\" control with the pointer, but is it really any better than using a second thumb stick?  I don't think so.Graphics.  We all know about the graphical shortcomings of the Wii.  Both Metroid and Mario are hailed as offering some of the best graphics available on the Wii.  Well, that's not saying much, compared to even the WORST games on the XBOX 360.  This is definitely \"last gen\" hardware, graphically speaking.  That's too bad, because the Gamecube could hold its own against the original XBOX and PS2.Wii Sports - yeah, yeah, yeah, my Mom played this with my son this morning, which would have NEVER happened on the 360.  I guess this should make me shed a tear for inter-generational gaming.  I found the games to be utterly random and unpredictable.  My kid flailing wildly threw more strikes than anyone.  Huh?You need to be squarely in front of the TV to play it appropriately.  It's a consideration.If you're used to gaming on the PS3 or XBOX 360, I think you will be disappointed in most aspects of the Wii.  The \"ace in the hole\" for the Wii is the motion control, and IMO it isn't implemented all that well.We had lots of fun with the Gamecube and N64.  And, in fairness, my kid has been playing the Wii all day (and I do think the Wii Zapper is pretty slick), and this is a kid who plays a lot of 360.  So it may appeal to some.Also it appears to be a high quality machine, easy to set up, and well packaged.  We have 2 360s and they've been fine, but you can definitely tell the Wii is one polished piece of equipment.  That's always been true of Nintendo equipment, and this is no different.And bully for the average person who enjoys a Wii because they're intimidated by the controls and games of the PC, XBOX 360, and PS3.  Some folks will enjoy the Wii's simple--but IMO shallow--pleasures.I played it today and may continue to do so for \"quality time\" with the kids.  But for quality gaming, and the best titles, I'll stick with my 360.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2007"}

Keep in mind this review is for the \"Uncaged Edition\".Pros:Great number of combo movesSkill upgrades/points- Each kill you get you receive experience points and rage orbs.  Experience points go towards upgrades for claws, more powerful attacks, and better combos. Rage orbs allow you to engage in \"Fury\" attacks like- Claw spin, claw drill, etc.  The better you do in combat also upgrades your fighting ability against certain enemies (Droids, Machetes, Jungle mutants).  You also need to search for mutagens that allow you to increase mutant powers (Hidden around the levels these mutagens include; Increasing max rage, increase health, decrease time to regenerate, increase combat reflexes)Find hidden \"Action Figures\" in the levels to unlock a Bonus option at the main menu to actually unlock new uniforms (Legendary Wolverine- Brown/yellow, Classic Wolverine-Yellow/Blue, X-Force Wolverine- Black/Gray). In the Bonus you enter an arena where you have to defeat another wolverine character with the selected uniform you want to unlock.  When you beat him in Bonus you can use the uniform in the Story mode.Achievements are challenging enough yet easy enough to obtain for the Xbox 360 version.  Once you beat the game you unlock the Hard level, but before you start a new game you can replay the levels to unlock the other achievements, unless of course you unlocked everything already (Ex: 2000 kills, 250 lunges, 20 quick kills, Set 20 enemies on fire, etc.)Replay- It really depends on your goal of getting every achievement.  I would say you probably will need to play several levels over or at least another run through the campaign to unlock everything.Controls are simple enough that you will slice and dice pretty easy and Wolverine will do major damage to his enemies.Cons:Graphics are a little cartoonish at times.Most levels are confined, which doesn't allow you to search around very much.  However, this helps in finding hidden items like dog tags and action figures because if the hallway winds another way or there is a wall to break through there must be something to find!Great game!

The funnest part of the game though is trying to figure out all the character's special moves by randomly pressing button combinations. I still dont know how to do all the moves but most most of the characters in the game have a special move where you press down and then forward + A/B at the same time. With Subzero it shoots an Iceball (DragonballZ Style) at opponet and freezes them. If you see this game around I'd buy it. It has crap loads of characters and 3 secret unlockable ones: Smoke (Human form) (Like Scorpion) Shao Kaun, and Motarro. Motarro is the coolest, he is a huge centitar and has a special move where he picks up the opponet with one arm and slams them against the floor. And another where you hold B and he spits a green energy ball at opponet. This game is very adventurous and you can set it so its not so bloody for the younger audiances or turn the blood green so they think it's snot or something.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2005"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Spectacular, lives up to every bit of the hype","reviewText":"The highly anticipated Super Smash Bros. Brawl is here, and it lives up to every single ounce of the hype that has been surrounding it.  Make no mistake, Super Smash Bros. Brawl is one of the best games ever made for the Wii at this time, and the absolute best multiplayer game available for the system as well.  Starting off with a massive roster of fighters (some of whom have to be unlocked) including stalwarts like Mario, Link, Donkey Kong, Samus, Kirby, Pikachu, and Star Fox's Fox McCloud; to new characters to the series like Kid Icarus' Pit, Meta-Knight, Zero-Suit Samus, Fire Emblem's Ike, and to top it all off, Sega mascot Sonic the Hedgehog (!) and even Metal Gear Solid icon Solid Snake (double !).  Even with such an unorthodox roster of fighters, Super Smash Bros. Brawl manages to have a wonderfully balanced roster, no matter how ridiculous the game can get.  Graphically, the game has some flaws in terms of the details of the characters and environments, but these aren't all that noticeable thanks to the fact that the game is so insanely fun.  No matter if you play Super Smash Bros. Brawl online or offline, this is one of the most fun video games you will play on the Wii, or possibly any other system to boot.  Four-player mode is where the game really shines, as things just get even crazier.  Not to mention that you can also share game replays, screenshots, and even customized levels with others, which is a great little bonus feature in itself.  The only real other flaws here are that the game's Subspace Emissary stages, while fun, could have been better, and there are some long loading times to be found too.  Small flaws aside though, you simply can't go wrong with Super Smash Bros. Brawl.  There is a reason you got in a Wii in the first place, and it's because of nearly flawless, first party games like this.  If you own a Wii, you need to own Super Smash Bros. Brawl, it's just that simple.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00006GSO0","description":"The Simshas much in common withTony Hawk's Pro Skater: There's a great emphasis trial and error, it encourages personalized solutions to problems, and overall success comes down to both balance and timing. Also, like the Tony Hawk games,The Simsis a very addictive game.Players micromanage the lives of a family of virtual people and influence the outcome of their lives, be it success or something akin to a nervous breakdown. The bestselling PC version of the game has, in recent years, been upgraded with elements like parties, pets, and vacations, but this iteration is closer to the basic formula.You start the game living with Mom in a one-story suburban house. You are immediately presented with certain life tasks, such as fixing the TV and making lunch, which are aligned with the skills you'll need for the game's main challenge--keeping your sims in balance on eight conflicting categories. For example, eating will have an impact on your sim's hunger rating, but it will also impact his bladder rating. You'll have to make sure that he keeps himself and the house clean, that he sleeps to restore his energy, and that he also has time to keep himself entertained. The free will option lets your sims coast a bit, and you can also save time by stacking tasks together. Time passes at the rate of about one minute per second in the game, but you can fast-forward sim time when you need to, such as when they're sleeping.The controls are justifiably complex, but adjusting to them is not difficult. You see your sims from an overhead perspective that you can both rotate and zoom. You direct their actions by moving a line cursor to where you want them to go or to what object or person with which you want them to interact.The game is surprisingly funny. Neglect your sims and they'll shout and wave their arms to get your attention. Allow one's energy to get too low and he or she will likely collapse and sleep right where they were standing. When that happens, Mom is likely to serve them dinner on the floor.Gamers may find that it takes a while to get the hang ofThe Sims' style and control scheme. Stick with it and you may find real time fast-forwarding by.--Porter B.

Everything in the game has more detail and color put into it and it looks more 3d than the pc version. The controls are set up quite nicely on the dual-shock controller too. It takes about a half-hour to get used to the controls. You start off in the \"get a life\" mode which is kinda like a tutorial which takes you through the control scheme and how everything operates, but unfortunately forces you to complete before you can play the normal sims mode. It took me a good 7 hours to complete! There's also 2 multiplayer modes, one of them is a co-op mode which you can play through with another person.....this was a neat edition exclusive to PS2 version of the game. The PS2 version also goes more in depth to the physical charateristics and customization of your sims. The over-all presentation of the game is pretty good. Since I only played the pc version a couple of times, I was quite pleased with the PS2 version of the game. If you already own or have played the pc version, then the PS2 version may seem like the same thing all over again.

It's hard to believe that it was only a mere five years ago, when the NFL 2K Series first appeared on the cutesy Sega Dreamcast. My have they grown... No longer content with second place in the football console wars, Sega pulled out all the stops and released a living, breathing, sweating, trash-talking, smash mouth football game. If there ever was an idea of the &quot;perfect&quot; football game, this would have to be it. In fact, so much so, that purchasing the anticipated Madden 2005 seems like a waste of money. But hey, I'm a hard-core football fanatic, and I have no qualms splurging seventy bucks on both football titles. Regardless, I can easily see myself playing this game till the Pro Bowl when I finally remember that Madden game I purchased oh so long ago, still un-opened, collecting dust on my shelf.The presentation on this game is absolutely phenomenal. Last year, I mentioned that NFL 2K4 did an outstanding job utilizing the ESPN license. This year is no exception. Sega should give seminars on taking advantage of a licensing goldmine such as ESPN...*cough*...Atari...*cough*...&quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;... The pre-game, in-game, half-time, and post-game presentations are flawless, albeit the virtual &quot;Boomer&quot; is a little bit creepy. Playing the game is like watching an actual NFL broadcast on the world's leading sports channel. Statistics in the multitudes will fly across the screen during the course of a game, replays from every which angle will be shown in a tiny window off to the side as you choose your next play, and the ingenious VIP system, which acts like a blueprint of your and your opponent's play calling tendencies, allows you to prepare in detail for the current or following game. Throw in the ability to schedule the tone of player meetings (angry or maybe encouraging) and allotting prep time, either through film sessions or a specific physical training regimen (arms, legs, biceps, quads), for your players in order to improve their ratings, and you have a game that puts you front and center in the driver seat of a football team. Granted, I'm only mentioning only a handful of the vast variety of features that are available at your fingertips, which is only a testimony to how deep this game really is.The NFL 2K series has long been known for it's superior graphics engine. Fortunately, over the years, the series has become less of a one trick pony and more of a complete football experience. Regardless, NFL 2K5 is hands down the most realistic and beautiful looking football game I've ever seen. Players are size proportionate with rippling muscles and veins. Jerseys are colorful and vibrant and twist and wrinkle at the right spots. Player faces are dead on, and smile or frown depending on the game situation. Cheerleaders look less like ghouls and more like Barbie dolls. An example of the great graphics engine in this game was during a replay of an interception my defensive player grabbed in the end zone during a game. As I zoomed in, I actually caught tiny particles of dirt and grass flying around the cleats of my player as he scrambled to his feet after making a diving interception. Dirt and grass! Why is this a revelation, you say? Only because it would have been hard to notice such detail without the benefit of the zooming button during the replay.Game play is where this game all comes together. Overall, it's basically the same as last years model which isn't a knock since it was great to begin with. If it ain't broke, then don't fix it, as I like to say. Like Madden there are three play calling windows, the top allotted for defensive side of the ball and the bottom being for the offensive side. The variety of plays are abundant and nicely varied. Running is still easy with a stud running back which makes it imperative to choose the All-Pro difficulty if you're looking for a true challenge. The AI is more stingy and intelligent on this setting without being frustrating. A major gripe I had with last year's game was the poor tackling even on the most difficult setting. This year, it's fixed, not only making individual tackling a possibility, but allowing you to choose the type of tackle (bone-rattling or shove) you want to unleash. Also added is an evade move that can be utilized by the quarterback if he's about to be sacked by tapping the right control stick. The player animations are a sight to behold, especially during running plays. Watching a running back scrape for an extra yard or two after being tackled, a defensive end grab for the leg or a quarterback, and a cornerback leap for an interception just brings tears to your eyes.The NFL 2K series has grown tenfold in it's short existence. So much so that I think it will be a challenge for Sega to top what has to be the perfect football game for next year's entry. Though I'm sure that Madden 2005 will still lead in overall sales, I think it's safe to say that ESPN NFL 2K5 will lead as an overall football gaming experience. Much congrats to Sega.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000R39GPA","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"Some Serious Control & Camera Issues","reviewText":"I first played Star Wars: The Force Unleashed as a demo on the Playstation Network Store and I thought it was pretty good. Albeit, the controls were a bit strange & cumbersome but overall not too bad. Plus I figured with a few more months until launch the issues would likely be ironed out. Well, I was wrong. But more on that in a bit.First I'll touch on what I actually like about the game. Being a moderate fan of the original Star Wars Trilogy it's simply fantastic to get a bit more of the story of the events that transpired prior to the setting of Episode 4. To my understanding this is the first ever video game where the story is adopted as part of the official Star Wars Canon.The game places you as Darth Vader's apprentice known as by the code name 'Starkiller'. Initially, you'll begin by proving yourself capable by hunting down various Jedi throughout the Galaxy. Vader's intention is to overthrow the Emperor with Starkiller's help. Or so it seems. The story is definitely a highlight that I won't spoil here.Graphically the game is quite visually appealing. Character models are well done and the environments are significantly varied from planet to planet and even on starship's and eventually the Death Star. By in large some of the best graphics are on Starkiller's Force powers such as Force Lightning.The major problem that this game - and to a larger extent Action/Adventure games in general - is the camera and controls. The player is given very little input into the camera itself so you'll be relying mostly on the game. Too often the camera is at the wrong angle for a particular jump or completely ignoring a group of enemies pouring murderous fire just off screen. It's extremely frustrating to constantly have to run from a group of unseen enemies because the camera won't focus accurately. Or miss a jump over and over because of poor camera placement.Controls are similarly flawed. Even simple Force moves like picking something up and hitting an enemy require the use of multiple buttons. Even when you remember the right sequence the results are often mixed. How many times I tried to hurl an object at an enemy only to watch it go the opposite direction and miss entirely are too numerous to count. Force Unleashed also uses liberal amounts of scripted button sequences particularly for larger enemies and for boss fights. These sequences usually require an insane amount of dexterity or just sheer hit and miss tactics. I found myself often having to repeat a sequence because buttons require almost millisecond timing.The Force Unleashed also uses a paper thin leveling system that rewards the player abilities in 3 areas - Talents, Powers & Combos. Earn a level or find an upgrade sphere and you can use those to upgrade an ability of choice in each respective area. The main issue I have with the system is that it's far too simplistic and not varied enough to maintain the game through repeated plays. Even playing the game casually I was able to max out almost all of my abilities.[...].","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000P46NKC","description":"Resident Evil 4 Wii","reviewerName":"David Allen \"Trust999\"","summary":"You Cannot Go Wrong With The Resident Evil Series Of Games","reviewText":"Back when I first purchased my Wii console, I was lent this game. I thought it stunk. I hated the controls, the lack of ammo, and thought the game was overly difficult. Over two years later I happened to purchase Darkside Chronicles which is a railer. I loved the game. I liked the idea that I did not have to handle a second controller with the left hand to move the character and perform some other functions as the game took care of that for you. I became a very good shot by playing that game, and after some thought, decided to ask to borrow the game again to give it another try.I had only managed to get to the Village in the first round, and that is where I got stuck. Now I had a better feel for the game, what to do, how to play, and a better idea of which weapon to use. I had my better aiming skills, so all I had to do was master this control issue. It did not take too long to get over that hump, and I was enjoying the game and moving along through the levels in no time. I believe that part of the control issue was the design of the nunchuck. In the hole where the stick moves, Nintendo moulded the sides like little hexagonal walls instead of a nice round circle. So if you wanted to drift a little left or right, it made it a lot more difficult.I found the art work very well done, and the sound affects and music very well done. Some of the music was down right creepy, especially in the later Castle levels. I liked the side games earlier on in the game to earn bonus items. These seemed to have changed into the Shooting Gallery games which I found fun at first, but not forthcoming with enough bottle caps for my efforts, and they were useless anyway. For the most part character movement was designed very well, and if you had mastered the controls, you would not find yourself stuck in some rut or something with no way out, or constantly falling off a roof or cliff. Although, sometimes it seemed like forever before you came up on one, the Save Points were pretty well placed. The unseen in game save points on a few occasions left a lot to be desired. Most times the game would return you after a death to near where you were when you died, on rare occasion, it would place you way back at some point where you had to make a ton of moves to get back to the point you were before you died. I learned fast that you get to that point and then backtrack to the save point and then if you died, you did not have to re-do all the little moves like moving things, picking up stuff etc.The puzzles were a challenge, but not overly difficult. I was able to figure out almost all of them without seeking a hint. I rarely had any issues with health, although I came very close a few times. Fortunately, you could buy health from the merchant. Enemies were easy at first and progressed to a bit harder as the game progressed. Most times this was not an issue at all. The Regenerators were the ones that gave me fits occasionally, and they were also creepy. Bosses of course become stronger and more plentiful as you play along. A few were pretty tough, and you might have to try a few times to take them out. Others were easy as cake. The variety of weapons was good, and if you did your work and upgraded a lot, and bought bigger better weapons, you should have no problem at all getting though the game. The ammo, that was a different story, ammo was always in short supply which forced you to conserve, be smart in your weapon choice, be accurate which was a problem in panic situations when you were being swarmed by enemies, and always be looking for it. There were plenty of times when I got into a situation with a ton of ammo, and I walked away with little or none. Part of that was my inability to remember to use the kick and stab method to eliminate some easier enemies. In the heat of the battle, I just wanted to keep shooting and not have to worry about getting close and kicking. I also paniced a bit and missed a lot of shots or made ineffective ones. Players should note, that when ever you upgrade your weapons capacity, the merchant will fully load the weapon for you. Very handy free ammo trick.I liked the characters in the game. You play as Leon most of the game, and on rare occasion as Ashley. There are other characters like Luis and Ada, but outside of Ada saving you or leaving something for you, these characters don't so much. Of all of the characters in the game though, I love the Merchant. Nothing like a shady character in a black trench coat lurking about in seedy locations trying to sell you stuff. He was my life saver many many times and I was more happy to see him more often than I was to see a typewriter Save Point. Loved his greeting: \"Welcome! Gotta lot of nice things on sale stranger. What are ya sell'in?\" Always happy to sell him my precious treasures and buy lots of new upgrades and weapons. They should make it so he can sell you a minimal amount of ammo too like you can buy health spray, but only 2.Overall I found the game for the most part fun, a bit creepy at times, cool at others, and yes like any game, frustrating occasionally. My advice is to keep trying, think about what you have to do and do it smarter, and you will make it through.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2010"}

This is because it's from Nintendo, and so far, every first party title from the company on the Wii has ranged from good to spectacular.

The games themselves take advantage of your Miis and makes great use of them as well.  In that respect alone, Wii Play is worth checking out, but the mini games themselves aren't very fun, and the ones that are (like Shooting Range) don't have much of a lasting appeal.  Billiards however is the best of the bunch here, and makes great use of the Wii's abilities.  All that being said, Wii Play is worth a look at the least, and is worth picking up if you want another remote and don't mind spending a little extra cash for another disc of mini-games, but don't expect the same kind of lasting appeal or fun that you got with Wii Sports or Wario Ware.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2007"}
{"product_name":"B007V9QKH0","description":"","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Some stumbles at the start, but you'll come to love it","reviewText":"Dragons crown is the spiritual successor to Odin Sphere, and it shows. The story is very high fantasy, with dragons and major spellcasters around every corner, a paint palette environment that gorgeous and straight off a fairy tale, a whimsical musical score, and a gameplay setup that any side-scroller beat-em-up gamer will come to love.Starting off, the sorceress does have K cup breasts. Comparatively, the fighter has a head that looks like a grape on a cantaloupe, the barbarians and knights are as broad as a Winnebago, and virtually every character has something of a caricature about them. Some people may find it distracting, and it is when you don't have something to fight, but I basically tuned in out after about 5 minutes. Everything is bright and colorful, but muted enough to not feel like an mild acid trip. The enemies and well drawn and detailed, and especially the boss opponents are extremely creepy and interesting caricature's of traditional fantasy foes. The dragon is the best by far obviously, and just watching him move is creepy and well delivered.The audio is wonderful with only a few nits. One of my favorite things about almost all Altus games is that the whole game could be in Japanese. You can voice your characters as youl ike, but the Narrator is locked into English, something very distracting to me. I've gotten several comments that there's a free DLC to have the Narrator be voiced in Japanese, but that's such a let down to have to rely on DLC for something that seems so basic. Overall, the audio is very nice. The spells aren't fantastical enough to completely overwhelm the screen, and the background music is a constant nice present. Almost no characters are voiced as part of the story, but this actually helps to reinforce the \"reading a fantasy story\" feel that the game is going for.Gameplay had some serious stumbles. The tutorial doesn't cover some rather crucial aspects. This floating hand has several skills your not told about, like the ability to pluck treasure out of the background twinkles, and the beat-em-up attack structure is rather merciless to start with. The wizard throws fireballs that're arrow straight, so you have to be almost in perfect line with the target, and the depth on some of the characters is so difficulty to nail down that you will struggle with attacks at the beginning, though to do get used to it and only handful of attacks have no area of effect.This can't take away from very glowing experiences. You do feel like Hercules even from level 1, and the quests branch, meaning you're not entirely on rails, and the decisions you make have real consequences, and do require serious weight at times, as sure you can sneak in and steal that dragons hoard item, but... isn't that like poking a grizzly with a pointy stick?The multiplayer aspect is rather nice and a bit weird. Loot goes into a community pool, which is a bit of a struggle if you're playing local multiplayer. There's no roll off, so its kind of an awkward debate about \"I need that belt for damage resistance\" vs \"Well, I need it for spellpower.\" The multiplayer is very well fleshed out as well, maybe not as smooth as something like Castle Crashers, buts that's due to having to load more local content based on whatever quest you're on.Overall, the tutorial could've used more polish, and they probably should've focused grouped the character designs a bit more, but these are nits, and fans of side scrollers, Odin Sphere, and Dark Alliance will all feel comfortably at home with this neo-nostalgic gem.Follow-up: I was expecting the story to come together after the tutorial. I was hoping everything that had been gradually introduced would cream together beautifully like a wonderful cake, and they just don't. The story is weak and bland, and unvoiced almost entirely but for the narrator. The promised Japanese voiceover track isn't present, and in its place is having any of the rather lame voices of the american characters. Going from Odin Sphere to this is like going from a $45 filet to a hot dog. Its rather... unbelievable.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2013"}
