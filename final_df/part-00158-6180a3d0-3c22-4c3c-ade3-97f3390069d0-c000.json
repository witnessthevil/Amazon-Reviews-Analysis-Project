And... she was right, it is a pretty fun game.  There are some parts of the game that are super corny, super cheesy, and way over the top, but these parts made me laugh instead of hating them. I didn't however liked all the \"button mashing\" in order to fight, (made my thumbs hurt) and I also didn't like the fact that (yet another game) has a camera system that sometimes gets away from me when i'm trying to see what i'm fighting or do something.  But the locations and graphics are extremely gorgeous, the battles are super fun, and the character relationships are very well done.  The game actually had me laughing a lot.

You must escape the doomed city or become part of a ghastly new food chain: one with you at the bottom.You play as either Leon Kennedy, a rookie cop who's having areallybad first day on the job, or Claire Redfield, sister of one of the stars of the originalResident Evil. Leon and Claire's meeting is depicted in a visually stunning, B-movie cutscene. They're quickly separated, but occasionally meet up throughout the game.Right after the gruesome intro, you're dumped into the thick of things and have to dash through the devastated city streets, fleeing from one horde of zombies after another. As you make your way to a supposed refuge--the city police station--you find evidence that the citizenry fought bravely against the undead menace--and lost. Smashed barricades, abandoned police cars, boarded-up stores, dismembered bodies, and hundreds of expended bullet shell casings are all-too-common sights. Once you reach the station, you discover the remains of a siege. The defenders' desperate final hours are recorded in a fragmented journal. Its pages detail a possible escape route through an underground passage. Did the cops make it out? The alarming number of zombies wearing tattered police uniforms may be a clue.Resident Evil 2keeps the terrific puzzles and action of the original while vastly improving cinematic qualities such as dialogue, camera angles, cutscenes, atmosphere, and location design.

I had just barely gotten the Playstation and was renting a bunch of stuff. Originally I hated this game because I couldn't figure out how to play it. I had been a Nintendan with occasional defects to Sega (I own a Genisis) so I was unfamiliar with what has become a nearly standard control style for Playstation games. I didn't understand the pivoting, nor did I grasp the concept of holding R-1 to aim and X to shoot. I got frusterated and set it aside. However, my brother picked it up immediately after and managed to get me past the first screen. (Yes I got killed right away.) I watched my brother navigate his way through the game until he finally got killed by the first Licker. He begged me to buy it. So I did. After a while I decided to give it another try, and once I got used to the control style I beat it. I have played this this Resident Evil, and it many different incarnations across differnt platforms more than any other version. I have also bought this one the most times trying to get the \"ultimate edition\" and eventually got tired of it and bought the Dual Shock Greatest Hits version after the N64 version's FMV sequences were so terrible. Although I will not buy the forthcomming GameCube port unless they imporove it as drastically as they did the original, I still recomend RE 2 as the most fun of the series. If for some reason there is someone out there who does not already have some version of this game do yourself a favor and pick one up. GameCube owners, I recomend waiting for the GCN version as it is supposed to have all of the various enhancements that all of the various versions of this game had, including the much desired analog control the N64 version featured.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2002"}
{"product_name":"B000B2YR74","reviewerName":"Brendan L. Agnew \"rothwyn\"","summary":"Wake up and smell the ashes. . .","reviewText":"\"The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference.\"For nearly every PC gamer in the world, Half-Life is one of the most recognizable and acclaimed names in the market, and easily in the top tier of first-person shooters. This was further solidified in late 2004 when, after much anticipation and demonstration, Half-Life 2 was finally released on the PC. It was embraced by gamers and critics alike, and recieved several awards for Game of the Year.And now, finally, console gamers can see what all the fuss is about with Half-Life 2's full transition to the XBOX.Picking up an indeterminate number of years after the otherworldly events at the facility at Black Mesa, players once again don the battered crowbar and HazMat suit of sceintist-turned-savior Gordon Freeman. If you've never played any of first game, not to worry. The narrative of HL2 is very much its own beast, and you'll recieve all the info you need about the previous game from various NPCs you meet in and around City 17.Arriving (somehow, you're not quite sure) on a train, you'll immediately notice a sense of dystopian depression in all the people around you. Apparently, an unknown power called the Combine has taken control of the affairs of planet Earth. People are transferred from city to city with no explanation as to why, reproduction is severely prohibited, and \"Civil Defense\" task forces are everywhere, masked, armored, and spoiling for a fight. In fact, they'll soon be coming after you, and it's only with the help of a small but determined resistance movement that you'll be able to survive.From there, the game introduces you to some old friends and some new ones, a story of struggle, survival, free will, and good old-fashioned heroism. The story is done entirely in-game; no cut-scenes, no cinemas, no breaks in the gameplay at all. The entire story is told while you are physically controlling Gordon, never taking the player out of the world. And during the course of this story as you traverse the world, you'll experience some truly incrediblt things. You'll engage in fierce firefights with squads of Combine troops (who have incredible AI), you'll battle it out with heavily armed vehicles, be hunted by nightmarish creatures, and lead rebels against seemingly-invincible war machines. You'll grow attatched to some characters, and grow to hate others, and all the while you'll constantly be using the world.Which is where the game really excels. The immersion of this game is practically perfect, and it does this in two very important ways. First, video game characters have never been more convincing; Alyx in particular is an incredible achievement, and you'll find yourself accepting that these characters geniunely exist rather than being AI programs and polygons. Secondly, the physics in Half-Life 2 have to seen to be believed. There is literally no other game on the market, first-person or otherwise, that gives the player as much control over their environment. Using the Havok physics engine, HL2 allows the player to do everything from pile bricks on a see-saw and push a swing in a playground to cause bridges to collapse and drop cargo containers on enemies. This makes both the shooting and the puzzles in the game much more fun, much more realistic, and much more rewarding when you use your brain and get creative.For example, in one part of the game you're running through the canals of City 17 being chased by Combine troops, and pass near a bridge where enemies are firing down at you. At this point, all you have is a pistol and a crowbar, and instead of using up valuable ammo trying to take down each Combine soldier individually, you could just hit one of the conveniently placed flammable barrels to bring the whole bridge crashing down.The entire game is full of situations like this that reward creative thinking, and when you pull it off, it looks absolutely beautiful. Not just because the physics are astoundingly convincing, but because the game is just darn good graphically speaking. HL2 is easily one of the best-looking titles on the PC, and while the XBOX version features a couple downgrades on the texture and resolution side of things, it features the same solid frame rate, gorgeous animation, and brilliant art of its PC cousin, and easily stands as one of the best-looking console games of the year.Additionally, while HL2 lost the mouse-keyboard control scheme in the transition to consoles, Valve did a marvelous job of mapping the controls to the XBOX pad. Gordon Freeman isn't as heavy or cumbersome as, say, the Master Chief, and so the controls feel a little light and quick after Halo and Halo 2. However, they feel RIGHT for the game, for the character, and the world, making even the platforming feel fairly polished, and the shooting feel positively divine.And while HL2 for the XBOX is a single-player-only affair, it's deffinitely a world you're going to have an incredible time in. From the rooftops of the city to the dank parlors of Ravenholm, it's also a world you'll probably want to visit over and over again. If you're a fan of first-person shooters, you simply must experience this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2005"}

I like the button layouts, the placement of the analog sticks, and the inclusion of the triggers on each side.  The directional pad leaves a little to be desired, but that's a fairly minor shortcoming.  And it's nice to have the big green 'X' in the middle to bring up the XBox dashboard at any time.  This particular controller is wireless as well, which I consider a must these days.  Why use a wired controller when the wireless offers a range of 30 feet and can be used with a rechargeable battery?Supposedly this controller will run over 30 hours with a set of AA batteries, but I'd recommend just buying the battery pack and either charging it with a Play and Charge Kit or a Quick Charge kit.  This will allow uninterrupted gaming as you can charge the controller while you're playing it simply by plugging it into the Play and Charge.  Definitely worth it.One note--many retailers offer the black controller for the same price as the white one.  They're essentially the same thing--if you want the black it's worth your time to find someone who will sell it to you for the same price as the white ones cost.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2007"}

More than just a cutting-edge game system, Xbox 360 also integrates high-definition video, DVD movie playback, digital music, photos, and online connectivity into one sleek, small tower, and in the process puts true Next-Gen power right at your fingertips.Xbox 360, shown with wireless controller, is a sleek, customizable gaming and entertainment systemUnder the HoodXbox 360 is much smaller than its predecessor--it measures approximately 3.3 by 12.2 by 10.2 inches and weighs 7.7 lbs. It's powered by custom IBM PowerPC-based CPU with three symmetrical cores each running at 3.2 GHz. It also carries a custom ATI graphics processor loaded with 10 MB of embedded DRAM, 48-way parallel floating-point dynamically scheduled shader pipelines and Unified shader architecture. This is powerful enough to draw 500 million triangles per second.

A. Recht","summary":"When am I going to learn?","reviewText":"I bought a 360 about a year ago. I only feel qualified to review it as a system now because I can safely say I owned this system for the entire length of its functional life, and don't think I'll be getting much more out of it, since it no longer works.That's an exaggeration. It'll work again. I just have to get an entirely new disc drive for it.Which brings me to the strange duality of the 360. On one hand, there are some truly great games available for it and only for it. The graphics it's capable of are superb, the standard wireless controllers are outstanding, and they're even designed rather ergonomically. And yet--before something can be good, it has to function.Let me tell you a quick story for comparative purposes. The first system I ever owned was a Sega Master System. 1986, folks. Being a kid, I kicked the heck out of it. Dropped it. Spilled stuff on it. Treated the cartridges poorly. My brother enjoyed chewing on the electrical cables (seriously). Guess what? It's in the other room right now, still hooked up and functioning perfectly (including the chewed cords; nothing a little tape didn't fix).On the other hand, my Xbox 360 was treated like it was the statue of a deity. It had its own particular spot, well-ventilated, was never knocked over, spilled upon, or spoken to vulgarly. If I had to move it, I wrapped it up in a blanket so it wouldn't get dinged. And less than a year after buying it...it breaks down.So--lifespan comparisons. Sega Master System = 22 years and counting. Xbox 360 = 10 months.Really, if you're going to be charging people hundreds of dollars, at least have the common courtesy to use quality parts. I can understand not building them to military specifications, but can it at least last a year before it breaks down? I may be fixing my 360, but you can bet it's the last time I trust this company with my money.Next time I'm going with a Playstation--which, given, also break down. But it seems they don't do it with nearly the regularity and predictability of the Xbox. Sorry, Microsoft. You had two chances. (Oh, right, I forgot to mention. I also owned an Xbox. Guess what? It stopped reading discs after...about a year. Seems to be a pattern.)","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"An awesome Star Wars game","reviewText":"The Good: Uses the Star Wars license for an original game, great combat system and leveling up is easy, the new conversation engine makes you decide the outcome, lots of different weapons and upgrades, great voice workThe Bad: Difficulty can really bring things down, items are too expensive to buy, graphics aren't anything special, constant loading is annoyingI've finally played KotOR after many years of hearing about it and I have to say its a wonderful game. Just because it's Star Wars doesn't mean it can be a good RPG. Bioware really went out on a limb here to bring the whole \"choose the light or dark side thing\". Conversations can steer your story by what selections you choose and depending on what they are you'll drift light or dark. The actual combat in this game though it pretty solid. You can choose from your SW weapons everyone knows.You fight like in a real time RPG game but the fighting is done for you, and all you do is select what actions to choose. The level up system is easy to follow and very useful. The story is very unique in a sense that there aren't any of the old SW characters in here. It's completely original and I'm glad about this. I also love how you can upgrade weapons and armor by finding upgrade items and this will give your weapons new attributes and power. What might turn some players off is the fact that the difficultly can be extremely unbalanced at times and the constant loading is ridiculous.The game's graphics are ok but nothing that pushes the Xbox too hard. You get to bring 2 different characters with you at a time and the game sports a transit map system where you can go back to your hideout or haven from where your at...the downfall is you can't do this when you are in a \"dungeon\" full of enemies. What really made this game frustrating was that all the items were so expensive and finding the money to get them was difficult and I died all the time. I never finished the game really since I got stuck about 25% through and couldn't get past it.

Since then we've had to content ourselves with the excellentUnreal Tournamentmultiplayer combat series. For this first true sequel Epic Games hired Legend Entertainment, who made a name for themselves with theUnreal: Return to Na Paliexpansion pack and the woefully underratedWheel of Timegame (based on the books by Robert Jordan). The result is fun and frantic, if a bit too short-lived.Unreal II's best feature is its lush graphics engine. It's state of the art. All the locations, which range from bizarre alien worlds to those based on the filmAlien, exude dynamic realism. Human and alien characters are well-animated and rendered, but have a cartoonish exaggeration that clashes with the realism of the architecture. The designers were undoubtedly shooting for a comic-book look, which explains why the women look like blow-up dolls with bare midriffs and the men have hulking muscles. The monsters, too, ripple with strength and menace. This style will please some, but is less effective than the more realistic styles employed by similar titles--although at least the art direction is consistent throughout the game.Unrealcast you as a prisoner who--through both good and bad luck--was freed from confinement, but marooned on an alien world. He goes on to become a sort of messiah figure to the four-armed natives, while other, scarier, natives want to kill him. It ends with a cliffhanger that this game does nothing to resolve. Now, you play as a new character who works for the Terran Colonial Authority. You're a space marshal on the ship Atlantis. You and your buxom partner, who looks more like an exotic dancer than a police woman, have to solve problems in a game only tenuously connected with the originalUnreal.Core gameplay and mission design are good, but uninspired. Legend has taken a conservative, almost minimalist approach. They've made a solid shooter that takes full advantage of Epic's state-of-the-art graphics engine, but did nothing to set the shooter apart from the crowd.

The suits on Earth have funded a private army to take away your human rights!  You teach them a lesson by joining a band of Freedom Fighters and wiping them off the face of the planet... literally.You team up with the guerilla fighters to take on the Earth Defense Force (EDF).  Your mission is to kick them out of your city, district by district.  Each district has a bunch of Missions:  Drive a vehicle somewhere in X amount of time, Rescue some Hostages, Defend an area, Assault an enemy stronghold, or Demolish a building.  You can attempt these in any order and how you complete them is entirely up to you.  After you successfully complete a Mission, you get rewarded with cash for upgrades, a higher chance of civilians helping you, or a reduction in EDF control of that area.  When the EDF control drops, you can perform a key Mission that advances the story.  Once you complete a district, you can move onto the next one.  There are a total of six districts.  Each has a greater difficulty, but better weaponry.Graphics:  8/10The graphics are good, but they're not the best you'll see.  The visual effects and explosions punctuate the action as you destroy EVERYTHING!  The character models are a bit on the bland side, but they get the job done.  The Martian architecture and vehicles are really interesting.  The landscape looks good, although after a while it all looks like slightly different red rocks.Gameplay:  8/10Red Faction Guerilla is full of vehicle chases, large scale battles, sci-fi shootouts, and destruction.  Blowing stuff up has never been so much fun.  You can literally drive construction vehicles through buildings and they'll collapse fairly realistically.  You also get a wide variety of high tech explosives.  Rocket Launchers, Mines, Rail Guns, Tanks, Armored Cars, Fuel Cans, and the mightiest sledgehammer known to man.  All of these weapons are upgradable as well.  In general, the controls are pretty good. A few of the vehicles feel a bit sluggish or floaty; but when the game is this much fun, a few flaws are easy to overlook.  The game has an arsenal of powerful weapons, but is lacking in defensive equipment.  This game could have really used the Halo Bubble Shield or Health Packs.  In the game, you automatically recover your health if you don't get shot for about 10 seconds, but there are times when it feels like shotgun guys appear out of nowhere and you don't stand a chance.  If you die, you either respawn at a Mission Checkpoint or back at one of your bases.Story: 6/10There really isn't much of a theme to Red Faction Guerilla and the NPC's are greatly underdeveloped.  But a shallow story is better than a bad one, right?  This game and Transformers 2 raking in $400 Million pretty much prove you don't need a great story if there are lots of 'Splosions!  The story serves its purpose and ties all of the missions together in a pretty solid package.Replay Value: 9/10There are a ton of Missions in the game that you can play in any order.  Some even have challenge times that you can try to beat.  (Destroy this building with a fuel can and a pistol in 1 minute.  The Pro Time to Beat is 15 seconds.)  The Campaign is long and after you finish the main story, you can keep playing!Red Faction Guerilla also features a bunch of multiplayer modes and even more equipment.  Team up with your buddies for Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, or Team based Destruction!  The multiplayer modes are really fun and the more you play, the more costumes you unlock.The game is rated M for Strong Language, Action Movie Violence, and a bit of Blood - but not gore.Overall:  8/10There are 20-50 hours of fun gameplay in the Campaign Mode and an infinite number of hours in the Multiplayer Matches.  Red Faction does have a few quirks, but where else can you put remote detonation mines on an armored car, drive it off a cliff into a building, jet pack out of the car before it hits, detonate the mines to destroy half of the walls, and snipe the survivors from the air?!  If you like open ended games like GTA, and you like the idea of blasting entire towns to rubble, then this is the game for you!Rent it if you have about 25 hours to finish the game and you like open ended world games.Buy it if you love blowing stuff up!  Unlike a lot of 9 hour action games, Red Faction's Campaign offers up to 60 hours and the Multiplayer Modes really are fun.Avoid it if you don't like action games, sci-fi, explosions, destruction, loud noises, or you're racist towards Martians.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2009"}

Malone","summary":"RE ports on GC- Recommended to a certain demographic only","reviewText":"Many RE fans are giving the Gamecube ports bad reviews citing the fact that \"This is the exact same game I played on Playstation! Weak!\" Fools, these ports were not made for you.Resident Evil has been around for eight years now. It started on the Playstation, then it jumped to the Dreamcast, now it's on Gamecube. While true blue RE fans from the Playstation era got themselves a GC so they could play the REmake of the original RE1 and the prequel RE Zero and the upcoming RE4, the majority of Gamecube owners had never played any of the original RE games in their Playstation or Dreamcast incarnations. These Gamecube ports are for them, so they can enjoy the entire series along with us salty veterans.That said, I personally only recommend RE2 and RE Code Veronica to the newcomers. RE3 adds almost nothing to the continuing storyline. RE3 did have some good gameplay, but it was unsatisfying to me because it had no \"Normal\" difficulty setting. You had to choose either Easy or Hard. Easy was insultingly too easy, and hard was more difficult than I like. I've never understood why they named it RE3, and named this Code Veronica. RE Code Veronica is the true sequel to RE2; its story literally begins where RE2 ended and then continues forward, whereas RE3 actually begins *before* RE2, and then eventually ends shortly after the events of RE2, feeling quite pointless when all is said and done. Code Veronica should have been given the title RE3, and RE3 should have been titled simply RE Nemesis.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2004"}
{"product_name":"B001E8VB6O","reviewerName":"Jon","summary":"Great for gamers, AWESOME for DC/Batman fans","reviewText":"This was the very first game I picked up when I finally bought a PS3 in October.If you like DC and/or Batman comics then you'll love this game.  My friend and I who both grew up reading comics and liking Batman took turns playing different parts and loving the moodily-dark experience.It's written by Paul Dini who has done work on the comics.  It gets all of the moody darkness of the Dark Knight's world of Gotham and gallery of criminals right.  The graphics of the game are very much like reading one of the graphic novels.Batman is perhaps a tad \"overly-muscular,\" but it somehow seems right with this game.  Everyone's various ways of writing and drawing Batman over the years have shown the characters visually different at times, and this is just one more rendition.Literally the only slight gripe I have about the game is that they went with Bane being nuts and stupid when \"venomized\" like the cheesy Batman and Robin (or was it Batman Forever?  Who cares!) movie did.  And the Scarecrow parts get a little irritatingly repetitive.But that is it!If you like action/fighting games, then you'll love this game too.  The fighting engine is great, and it's just so fun to beat up on five+ guys with a legendary character like Batman.This game just simply amazing.  The fighting style is such that you CAN do well either as a button-masher if you're simply a fan of the comics or character, OR if you're a fan of good fighting games.  I began this game as the former, but after awhile of playing I got the hang of the controls.  Super super fun.The gadgets, the dark fear-inducing, the gliding, I love it all!  And one AWESOME thing, that may be minor but I still LOVED, is that you can't \"die\" if you fall off a ledge, like so many other action games get bogged down with.  In this every time you fall, Batman automatically shoots his grapple.  Again, minor but really nice since games can get just so tedious when you have to maneuver a little ledge and OOPS, you fell, now you gotta go and do it all over again.They did just about everything right with this game.  I can't wait for Arkham City, and who knows, maybe some day they'll make a co-op game where you can have two people play split-screen as Batman and Robin.  That'd be fantastic.Bottom-line: well worth the money; you'll probably want to make sure you're buying the Game of the Year version.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001E8VB6O","reviewerName":"R.Suarez \"R-Suarez-\"","summary":"An incredible Batman game at last!","reviewText":"When this game was announced I wasn't really interested in getting it, unfortunately there have been a few Batman videogames worth getting, in my opinion. As the game developed and the first images and trailers were released, I really got excited by how the game looked and the story Paul Dini himself wrote for this game (for those not familiar with him, he was the producer and writer of 'Batman The Animated Series')This I am not afraid to say, is the best Batman videogame I've ever played! As a fan of the character (comics, movies, cartons, you name it) I can tell you this game does justice to the Batman universe. The story, though a little flawed at the end, is just great. Many characters from the comics appear, some of them have major roles in the plot and some other have cameos during the game. Some are even hidden as Easter eggs in the form of the Riddler Challenges (you have to solve riddles during the story mode, some of them include looking for Scarface, Catwoman's suit and others, even Ra's al Ghul makes an appearance) All of Batman's skills are used as well as many of his gadgets (which you have to acquire as you progress in the game) While the game has many memorable sequences with Bane and with Scarecrow's fear gas (to name just a couple) some of the boss battles felt as remakes from prior games, they were not bad, on the contrary, but the battle with Poison Ivy seems like a remake of the same battle in the SNES animated series game for example. I just felt I should mention this as additional information, that fact does not demerit the game at all.The graphics, even in it native 720p look stunning, the environments are detailed and creepy, the music, loosely based on that from the Christopher Nolan films is also a great addition to the game. The voice acting is definitely one of the best things here, as it is voiced by the original actors from the animated series, those familiar with the TV show will remember Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamill as The Joker.Replay value? Definitely, many of the trophies and Riddler challenges can be unlocked until you have all the gadgets, so you can definitely return  to certain areas to obtain those. Also when completing the game in story mode, you are free to continue and roam in Arkham to complete the Riddler challenges. Which I thought was kind of cool so you don't have to start over again just for that. The challenges also offer a good chance to play specific areas in the game to achieve specific goals.Exclusives: the 'Play as the Joker' PS3 exclusive is neat, though you can only use the character in challenge modes, it would be neat to play as the Joker  in story mode but well, may be next time. The Amazon exclusive comic-book while a nice add on, it is not really an essential piece to the story, it goes back to show some things mentioned briefly during the game but nothing you would regret missing.If you are into Action/Adventure games this is definitely a must own game. Way better than what I had expected. Now all we need is a sequel!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2009"}

If you haven't played the Uncharted and Infamous games this bundle is a complete steal. The Uncharted series is unquestionably in the top tier of current gen games and Infamous is very good as well. I don't think a better collection of 4 games has ever been boxed with a system.Personally I like the reduced size. It reminds me a lot of the late model PS2s. I love the fact that the laser can be accessed so easily for cleaning purposes. It was certainly a pain to have to crack open my older model PS2 every couple months for lens cleaning every time I got a disc read error. A couple years from now when older systems will eventually start having problems a lot of owners will appreciate that design change. The fact that they didn't restore backwards compatibility with PS2 is a bummer but that's been the case for all the recent models.At 299 this deal is debatable when compared to the other bundles. Some stores offer a Uncharted/Uncharted 2 bundle with a controller for 60 bucks. Basically making the games a 10 or 20 dollar ad on if you need to buy a second controller anyway. The Assasins Creed III bundle is also 299 and comes with a 500 GB hard drive instead of the 250 GB of this bundle. If you plan on downloading a ton of games/content that might be a better bargain for you. You can also get a 250 GB bundle with Uncharted 3 which retails at 270. Maybe hunt down the controller bundle and get the 3 Uncharted games with the system and two controllers for 330?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2012"}

The graphics are beautiful, the voice acting is great, the controls are solid, the animation is fluid, and overall it's a ton of fun. The only drawback for me is that it is overly easy and it gets repetitive. You can never die. Any time you jump and fall into a bottomless pit, the girl will save you every time without fail. If you're in a fight and you're about to get killed, the girl will save you. It takes a lot of the challenge out of the game but it also saves from a lot of frustration. You should also never get lost because she will tell you exactly where you need to go. There are surprisingly few enemies in this game and the ones you will face are really easy to kill.

The camera was easy to connect to my console through the USB port and it was recognized instantly by the PS3 with no problems,  the cameras video output is amazing with a clear and relatively smooth frame rate and clarity that is astounding for such a small and compact item.  The camera also has a rotation of 360 degree and elevation and lowering degree that make it very easy to direct the camera feed also the front of the camera has a nice close up or distance knob that makes it easy to get your full bod into the camera view or just a face shot if that's all you want.  My friend had a question as he like me did have limited room for the PS3 console where he had it set up and that was would he need to elevate the camera to get a upper body view of the person in front of the camera since he had to place the camera on the console,  and again thanks to the rotation and elevation abilities of the camera that shouldn't be necessary if the console is at least waist high to the person whose playing in front of the camera.  So whether you decide to buy the camera separately or get the bundle will be up to the buyer but still as far as the camera hookup is concerned a very easy accessory to add to the PS3 console with no headaches to write about....","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2010"}

While Samus Aran is a gaming pinnacle there's not much behind her besides she's an orphan raised by the Chozo race of Tallon IV. A \"Great Poison\" came to the planet from a meteor impact and ever since the Chozo had to flee their home world. Samus, being armed with Chozo armor and weapons, attempts to save the world from the Space Pirates and jellyfish...I mean Metroid. The game consists of five huge levels that you go back and forth from finding upgrades to your suit. There are a total of 4 weapons, 4 weapons upgrades, plus a few Morph Ball upgrades etc.My favorite part of the game are the cool Morph Ball sections yet there aren't enough of them. You can, eventually, use the Spider Track Ball upgrade to click to ceilings and walls and there are some really cool segments for this yet only a few. You explore each level by needing to use a certain upgrade to get through such as a door needing a certain weapon to open it. You can also get missile expansion upgrades, power bomb upgrades, and energy tank (life) upgrades, but most of these are extremely hard to find and only die-hard Metroid fans will spend the time finding them. On the other hand there are tons of different enemy types and cool bosses. The game is just about exploring and now that it's in 3D Nintendo really makes you explore. The controls are \"dumbified\" for Nintendorks who were used to the 2D era and didn't know how to control an FPS so there is a lock on system (that is a bit annoying) and you use the L trigger to move your reticle. This can be really annoying for people used to standard FPS controls. You have to always stop to find out where to jump while enemies are attacking you. First hint: Nintendo this doesn't work! Secondly, there are a lot of different types of environments from water, to ice, to viney green lands.Once you find your Gravita suit you can run through water with no problem so in turn you can explore more areas. After you get all of your add ons you have to find twelve artifacts to get to Metroid Prime. Basically, if you've played other Metroid games this is exactly like those except in 3D. I hated the constant backtracking and lousy save system. You will be in one level but the next add-on is two levels away. Instead of warping there you have to run through every single level and the enemy respawning doesn't help either. The best thing I liked about this game was the visuals. They look amazing for a launch title, and what's amazing are all the effects. Water and steam will hinder your vision, there will be static on-screen when your electronics are disrupted, Samus' face will reflect off her visor.The sound, on the other hand, isn't so great with Ecco the Dolphin esque music and creepy techno. While some of it works it just sounds really old. There is also no multiplayer at all so this is another disappointment. You can link your Metroid Fusion GBA game for extra stuff, but I couldn't try that out. The game also sports the lamest endings ever (and I got the second best one). Overall, if you hated Metroid before you still will, and if you loved it before you'll love it more. Newcomers stay away if you don't like your FPS formula messed with. I don't hate Metroid I just wish it would evolve more.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

If you liked Fable 2 then you might like Fable 3 but it's not spectacular.I've played co-op on Fable 2 and Fable 3. I've played through all of Fable 2 twice and I'm about 1/3 the way through Fable 3. I'm rather disappointed with Fable 3 so far. Here are my thoughts:Pros* They \"fixed\" co-cop so that now if you're playing it solely for co-op, your second person can be a \"real person\" with their own money and items, etc.* Overall good graphics* Magic powers can be combined in cool ways* The gnomes are hilarious (they're like the gargoyles in Fable 2)* The levels are bigger and more openCons* The yellow line leading you to your next objective is \"broken\" (eg: doesn't show up at least once every 5 minutes)* Interacting or selecting people often does not work (eg: you stand next to somebody and you have to step back and approach them again to make it recognize that you're near them)* There is almost no selection in stores and shop stands, probably because they tried to get rid of menus wherever possible* The way in which they got rid of menus is not good, now everything is just a pain or too stripped down* Scenery in the distance often times does not look good at all* Too many of the interactions and objectives seem \"G\" rated rather than \"T\" to \"M\"* Too easy, no way to increase difficulty* So many other bugs. This game is the typical rushed product that obviously needed another month or more of developmentI just feel like this game could have been quite spectacular if it had not been rushed out the door.

The early parts of the game follow his unit, the Rose Cochon (pink pig) brigade, as it takes missions to protect the humans' alliances with the other races of their world. The story doesn't really develop until later in the game, when Jack is forced to choose an alliance that will dictate the entire rest of the game. The game's main virtue, in terms of story, is the wide variety of characters that it has - 175 in all, similar in scale only to the Suikoden games. Depending on the path chosen, different characters can be gained.The gameplay is a cross between standard RPGs (encounters lead to mini-arenas where enemies are fought, just like most other RPGs) and action RPGs like Kingdom Hearts (the action is real-time, and the player must attack and dodge with the controller. The player is always Jack, who has four options: attacking, defending, using a charge attack (that takes energy gained from regular attacks to do a more powerful one), and items. His companions tend to be more diverse and have a wider array of skills and weapons. Mages, clerics, and warriors - among others - are available.One of the neatest things about the game is the fact that the NPCs live actual lives - depending on the time, they will be at a different place and can be observed moving back and forth. Stores will be closed at night; not unusual, but unlike some others which have an arbitrary locked door and a sign, this one actually shows the shop owners heading home. One early puzzle involves getting a chest guarded by a dwarf; at 5 o'clock game time, the dwarf will head for the pub, and you are free to get the chest's contents.Despite some darker twists in the story, the graphics are bright, colorful, and cheerful, the music is bouncy and energetic, and the characters all have light-hearted moments. Graphically, the game resembles a cross between Final Fantasy IX and Dark Cloud 2. It's cartoony and the characters are misproportioned like FF9, and the colors more resemble DC2. The voice acting is done pretty well, but can be turned off if preferred (the options are text only, text and voice, or voice only).As a whole, this game falls into the same categories as other RPGs, but also tends to stand out on its own merits. While a lot of the game is the same old stuff, it has a few quirks to make it unique.Rating: 8/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2008"}

In this game, not only do you play as Drake, but as a young (child version) Drake as well. The story jumps back in time through out the game, where we learn how Drake and Sully met and become friends. A new woman is brought into the picture. This time, she's a former love interest of Sully and not Drake.Rather than starting out the game in the middle of nowhere like Uncharted 2, this time you're in the heart of Europe in a British pub. But just as in past games, you are quickly jumping from location to location throughout the world. Each scene remarkably done and visually stunning.On thing I really like that's different in the Uncharted 2 storyline is this time there's less issues with your team mates turning on you. In Uncharted 2, people on your team were often taking off, and you lost your allies as quickly as they joined you. In Uncharted 3, your team of 4 sticks with you and works together. Your not getting abandoned because you partner ran off with the bad guys, even if they were just pretending to be on their side.The story is just as compelling as it has always been. Uncharted 3 plays out like a blockbuster movie, only you get to control the moves. Climbing, running, fighting and shooting your way through everything you can imagine, Uncharted 3 has managed to even out do their last game. As usual, while playing you also look for treasures throughout the game to collect. You have your journal again to help you solve puzzles as well.Online game play is set up by using a pass code that's included in the games case. Once set up, you have game play options such as:Team DeathmatchPlunderTeam ObjectiveThree Team DeathmatchFree-for-AllHardcoreCo-op ArenaCo-op Hunter ArenaCo-op AdventureThe online game play benefited quite a bit from the open beta testing. The online matches are smoother and have less issues than there were months ago when they first opened the testing. I played quite a bit during that first month and can definitely see much more fluidity in the online game play movement versus how it was during beta.This is not a game you will want to rush through.

If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster. While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C.

And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"HONEY BUN RUN","summary":"I rather play RE4!","reviewText":"Graphics are terrible. this game is boring and the game play is so bad it's not worth playing. do not play this! also Allen Poe is a sick man! this game is not scary at all!

{"product_name":"B003O6EATE","description":"","reviewerName":"Jack Pacini \"MasterMage\"","summary":"8 months with the Playstation Vita, here is my review.","reviewText":"Fist of all I have to say that the Vita has great potential, and already has some decent games. That being said, I think Sony is missing the mark on a few things when it comes to the Vita.First off why wasn't it fully capable of running everything the PSP can run out of the box? After a few updates I still have a few PSP, minis, & PSone games that it wont play. Their installation bubbles are still sitting on my PS3 waiting for updates to come along that will make them work. I'm not holding my breath. Not that I could put them on my Vita anyway...Which brings me to my second issue. Why on earth would they limit how many \"apps\" you can have on this thing at one time? 100 is the limit. I'm sure it's not a major problem yet, but it will be once more people build up sizable game collections on the Vita. I ran into the problem once the update for PSone support was released, as I have quite a few PSone downloads. I reached the 100 \"bubble\" mark on my Vita (that's 10 full homescreens), and now I can't put any more games or apps on my Vita, despite the fact that I have over 6GB of storage left on my 32GB card. Come on Sony! Why limit how many games someone can buy and have on the system? Now I have to inconveniently play swap-in/swap-out with my games instead of having all of my Vita compatible games conveniently ON THE VITA! I absolutely hate the whole bubble set-up anyway, give me a simple folder set-up like on the PS3. You know a folder for Vita games, a folder for PSP games, ect. That works for me, 100 bubbles that I have to manually organized doesn't work for me. Sony, ever hear the phrase, \"If it isn't broke don't fix it\"?Now that I have gotten my major gripes out of the way, I'll say what I absolutely love about the system. The graphics are amazing for a handheld, heck they are amazing period! Uncharted looks almost as good as the PS3 Uncharted games. The cross-play games I have look virtually identical to their PS3 counterparts. PSP & PSone games look better than ever. Minis look just as good if not better than on PS3. This little thing is a powerhouse!I've come to realize that downloadable games are they way to go with handhelds. While the Vita's data cards are much more portable and durable than the PSP's UMDs, downloadable games take up zero actual space. The trade off is needing disc storage space, but to me it's worth it in the long run. It's a real luxury to be able to grab just my Vita on the way out the door, and know I have 75+ games at my disposal. It makes me wish that the Vita had at least 128GB of built in storage. I wouldn't own any physical versions of Vita games if it had enough storage. 32GB isn't nearly enough to go all download, considering I've almost filled my 32GB card in less than a year. Also realizing that my second big gripe above makes storage size a moot point anyway.Cross-play is an awesome feature, and I would like to see more games that exist on both PS3 & Vita make use of it. I'm looking at you Mortal Kombat and Ultimate Marvel v. Capcom. I think it's a serious system selling feature, yet it seems to be being mostly ignored by 3rd party developers, a real shame.Cross-buy is another wonderful thing. Buy PS3 game, get Vita downloadable version of same game free! How can you beat that? On games I was already going to buy like Sly 4 it's an awesome bonus, but it has also made me take a second look at games I wasn't necessarily interested in like Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale. I will no doubt be buying both of those games when they launch in case it's a limited time offer. I have already bought almost all of the cross-buy download only games, mostly to send a message to Sony, that this is the way to go with customers who own both a PS3 and Vita.A few little minor things that I would like to see in future updates:Downloaded PS2 games support. The system is more than capable. So why not?Cloud saving for PSone classics & Minis. It's inconvenient to have to copy save data manually to PS3 to play at home then manually copy the new save data back to the Vita when I'm going to be away. Cloud saving would eliminate all of that.I wish that when you turn the Vita sideways in the music player that it would go into a long view like most music players on smart phones do. It would just be easier to operate with one hand that way.I would also like to see more video formats supported, but I doubt that will happen as H.264 seems to be the new standard. A real pain for me since I have all my videos formatted in the old MP4 format.Game series I would like to see make their way to Vita:Grand Theft Auto. Something along the same lines as the PSP games. Not Chinatown Wars though. While it may have been a good game after GTAIII I can't go back to \"helicopter\" view.The Elder Scrolls. I'm not looking for Skyrim, but a port of Oblivion or an HD remake of Morrowind would be awesome! I would also like to see a completely new Elder Scrolls game made specifically for the Vita, that would be EPIC!Gran Turismo. How a Vita version of this hasn't been at least announced is beyond me.Batman Arkham series, hands down the best Batman games period on the go! Who wouldn't want that?More HD collections. They did Metal Gear Solid HD collection on Vita, and I know Final Fantasy X HD is coming to Vita, but why not Sly, Jak & Daxter, Ratchet & Clank, God of War, ect.? All of those games would be amazing on the go in HD!All in all I'm mostly satisfied with the Vita, and it will get better as time goes on and it gets a bigger library, and further updates. Worth the money now, but just barely. If you're on the fence, you might want to wait until a price cut or until that \"must have\" game comes out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2012"}

This thing could be a real beast in both the gaming and smartphone market if they wanted it to be.The problems, at least as of this writing, are not trivial however. There are multiple bugs in the software that runs the device. Like for instance, when I first set mine up, I had to create a temporary, fake account to get past the login screen, even though I had an existing Sony account. This was stupid, and added layers of complexity normal people do not want to deal with, but didn't kill me. What killed me was when my Vita mysteriously started rejecting all installations from both the internet AND my PS3 4 days ago. The solution? Full format. Everything's fine now, but seriously...The Vita COULD be a smartphone, if not a compact one. It's got a microphone, and obviously, speakers. It's got a touch screen, and in the case of the 3G model, 3G capability. Why isn't it? (AT&T;)By far the biggest failure is backwards compatibility. I finally logged on to my PSN acccount only to see in my download list \"This application cannot be downloaded to the vita\" OVER AND OVER again. The only PSP game I could download directly to the vita was FF4. I -could- get a few more (namely Peacewalker, but oddly, not MGS:PO) to download from my PS3 onto the vita. Why the complexity? Why some games but not others? And seriously, why no PS1 games!?! If the PSP can run PS1 games, why can't the Vita, which can arguably run PSP games better than the PSP can (case in point: Peacewalker)!Remote Play, the technology sony promised would allow you to play PS3 games on your Vita over the internet or a wireless connection, is a complete and utter fabrication. Basically right now you can access the xcross media bar, play PS1 games, and watch videos. Same as the PSP. As a father with a very young child that usually gets priority on the TV with the likes of Sesame street, this feature alone could sell a system to me. But right now it's a complete waste of time.Speaking of remote play - why is it I can connect to my PS3 via remote play  wirelessly, but I have to use the USB cable (which doesn't charge when connected to the PS3 btw), to access the content manager? What a joke.And don't even get me started on the release library...****This next part is Conjecture***I'm sure in six months Sony will have all this sorted out, hopefully, and this bumpy start will all just be a bad memory.  If/when Sony gets wireless content management with the PS3 sorted out, all the OS bugs dealt with, Viable remote play (at least over wifi,if not the internet), and fully PSP/PS1 compatibility working, the Vita will be a powerhouse. Throw in PS2 games & maybe a phone app, and I seriously would consider ditching my iPhone, for the first time in 5 years. If Vita v2 also had a PSPGo style flip model with a more compact layout for phone usage, I definitely would ditch my iphone. But until then...*******end conjecture****...I think i'm sending my vita back. Ninja Gaiden on the vita is pretty sweet, but I have a large library of games on my psp that just doesn't want to work on the vita, there's essentially no reason for this, and on a device like a portable, where you want to carry around a few devices as possible, this is a major dealbreaker.Call me back when you have full compatibility and viable Remote Play.

So instead I got the Nintendo DS version at first I bought the International version and that version came in a clear case which I later replaced with a black case. Then I traded in the International version for the Region 1 version (Region 1 being Canada, America). Anyway's I was excited, this game is really good. On some of the levels sometimes the star coins are hard to get or the level itself is a scroll version level so that can make it all the more difficult but all the more exciting because it makes me want to get the Star Coins even more. I usually am not so into the newer games not because I don't think their cool but because they tend to be more expensive. Older games, systems and accessories aren't usually expensive but it's based all on whether there prepackaged, still complete or if there loose. I mean I bought an Electric Blue Nintendo DS that was marked down for $60.00 but I reduced that price by trading in some old items receiving $45.00 in store credit. So do the math $60.00 - $45.00=$15.00 (not including tax). So the American version of the game used was $25.00 the store owner said he would give me $15.00 store credit so $25.00 - $15.00= $10.00 Which in this case the owner said he would pay the tax. Buying this game didn't affect my collection since I only have right now about 11 games at the moment. So I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves Nintendo DS games.

{"product_name":"B00I5LMSE2","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Triple Delight","reviewText":"Certain critics have attacked the Kirby franchise before for not being challenging enough, or not offering enough precise platforming, or this, or that. Those critics will go unnamed, although they totally know who they are, and you probably do too. My response has always been that HAL's venerable franchise was never, has never and will never be about intense difficulty, and instead, has a square focus on pure, simple fun. Entry after entry, whether they focus on old-school platforming or a neat little gimmick (Tilt N' Tumble and Mass Attack come to mind,) these games have historically been a delight, through and through. While there is significant challenge present in bonus stages and item hunting, the biggest emphasis is on just having a grand old time.That's why &#34;Kirby Triple Deluxe&#34; is such a joy, I think. Returning to the franchise's roots as a vibrant platformer on a handheld, this newest offering takes everything that was so great about &#34;Return to Dreamland,&#34; then builds upon it with a plethora of ideas both old and new. Of course, we see Kirby's classic suction ability return, and along with it, a &#34;greatest hits&#34; of sorts of power-ups, along with some neat new tricks.The Bell power lets the pink puffball whallop foes with two chiming bells, and the Beetle power sees him take on the form of a rhinoceros beetle, complete with a horn to impale with and wings to fly around with. My personal favorite new addition would have to be the Archer ability, which gives Kirby a fedora (m'lady) and a bow, allowing him to either accurately pierce enemies with shots, or fire a barrage in mid-air. It comes in handy quite often. The much-hyped Hypernova ability is also fun, allowing Kirby to gobble up everything on screen, including things that are much, much larger than him, such as huge trees and entire trains. Also nice are some returning abilities that were omitted from &#34;Return,&#34; such as the excellent Wheel ability. All-in-all, the variety of power-ups here, at around 25 or so unique abilities, is great, and despite one or two duds (like the perfunctory Circus,) they're mostly a joy to toy around with.As for the brunt of the gameplay itself, you'll find that this is the arguably the most polished entry since &#34;Crystal Shards,&#34; with platforming that can either be done with the D-Pad or Circle Pad. Controlling Kirby feels nice, as he has a nice amount of heft to him, yet at the same time feels light and puffy when he's floating through the air, as one would expect. Furthermore, this game continues the trend of recent entries of allowing the little guy to float simply by holding the jump button, and also letting him float for a seemingly indefinite amount of time. And while this may seem like a very odd thing to commend, I can't help but give serious props to the swimming controls, which are typically the bane of any good platformer. Players will feel entirely in control of Kirby as he swims around underwater, avoiding obstacles and hitting enemies with little bubble jets. Too many games get underwater mechanics wrong, by either making the character move too sluggishly or too erratically, and this is one of the only ones in recent memory that I can remember getting it so, so right.Despite being a classic Kirby platformer, there is a bit of gimmickry here that takes advantage of the 3DS' abilities. The most noticeable of these is the fact that almost every level has a foreground and background that Kirby can switch between. That means that not only can enemies or obstacles smack you from the left or right, but also from the front or back. While it is definitely true that this is a cool concept without the 3D slider dialed up, having that feature enabled really brings a lot to the table. It feels like the whole world is really popping out at you, and possesses a great deal of depth. Having the 3D enabled also allows you to see collectibles and distinguish when an enemy is in front of you or to the side of you more easily, which makes it one of the only 3DS games in which I feel the effect actually adds to the experience. Also taken advantage of here are gyroscope capabilities, and while they usually annoy me in other games, I find that they work like a charm here. They're non-obtrusive and utilized in fun, creative ways. Bonus points for there being an ever-present re-calibration option on the bottom screen!The gameplay of &#34;Triple Deluxe&#34; is not only fun, but incredibly functional. Everything here works just like it ought to, and the gimmicks are limited but used right. It plays like a dream for those looking for a casual romp through colorful levels, and for those who want to challenge themselves by getting the collectible knick-knacks, which actually becomes surprisingly difficult in some levels. There are Sun Stones that unlock bonus levels, and &#34;Keychains&#34; from most of the Kirby titles, which are collectibles in the vein of the &#34;Super Smash Brothers&#34; trophies. Speaking of which, the two other games here are pretty nifty. One of them is a &#34;Smash Bros&#34; clone with a surprising amount of variety, which will probably tide you over until the real thing hits this summer, and another is a challenging rhythm/platformer hybrid in which you play as DeDeDe. You're getting a pretty great value for 30-40 bucks, and whether you're an adult hoping to get bang for your buck, or a parent looking for satiate their kid with a game that will last a while, this fits the bill.&#34;Triple Deluxe&#34; is not only fun to play, but it's also a delight to see and hear. This might actually be the best Kirby yet in terms of A/V prowess. The levels are all incredibly varied, even within themed worlds, and the vibrant nature of the visuals helps players to relax and simply enjoy their time bouncing around the world. Kirby's character model is expressive and downright charming, and each time he does something new, you can't help but to let out a tiny &#34;aww.&#34; All of the other models are nice, too, though, with every enemy having a nice variety of movements and expressions, and most of the boss battles being fairly creative. It's all held together by a charming soundtrack with only one track that I personally didn't care for, and the rest possessing more musical variety than one would expect from the series. Good stuff, for sure, and some of the best visual aesthetics and audio in a 3DS title to date.Personally, I feel that those who would give this a game a bad review on account of it being &#34;too easy&#34; simply don't get it. Because, frankly, that's not a real critique. If you took one look at a Kirby game, you'd know what you were getting into. This is a game whose core demographic consists of children and those looking to have a relaxing time with a fun, breezy game. And by those standards, &#34;Triple Deluxe&#34; delivers in spades. It can be enjoyed as a fun, simple platformer, and it can also be broken apart as a nice challenge if one undergoes the task of unlocking every bonus level and collecting every trinket, not to mention playing the other modes to completion. Everything here is a fantastic value, and an overall great time.&#34;Kirby Triple Deluxe&#34; is one of those titles that I would argue is essential to anybody purchasing the console it belongs to. This is definitely one of the best 3DS games available, and if you know what you're getting into, then you can expect to spend a good amount of time with, and you should certainly buy it. Not only that, but you can also expect to have a smile on your face for most of that time, which is pretty high praise for any game. Yes, the story is a bit non-existent, and yes, you can breeze through the main campaign it if you so choose, but if you're having fun the entire time, I'd contend that it doesn't really matter. There's a lot to do here, and all of it is fun.Plus, come on, how bad can a game be if you can suck an entire train off of its rails? Not bad at all, I'd say. Not bad at all.Score: 9.0","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2014"}

Star Fox Command returns the series to it's dog-fighting, space shooting roots that made the series such a hit on the Super NES and N64 years ago, by ditching out of the ship platforming and rail based missions in favor of some pretty wide open environments and some innovative features using the touch screen to help pilot your ship.  The graphics are some of the best to be seen on the DS so far, despite some polygonal break up here and there, visually the game still packs a punch.  The touch screen features are also some of the best of any game to take advantage of on the DS, and the multiple strategic options and braching storylines help make Star Fox Command a winner.  The only real drawbacks of Star Fox Command is that it's ultimately too short and may be too easy for some, but the multiplayer modes are fun enough (only needing one DS card to play with others is always something to be happy about), and the WiFi capabilities are a nice touch as well.

The front and back cameras are used as augmented reality interfaces to make games more interactive (i.e.: looking at a map in Uncharted while holding the Vita in bright light will reveal hidden writings, the brighter the light is the better you can see the hidden signs)The main LCD is also a touch-screen and a very smooth responsive one but the screen is not gorilla-glass if you ask (feels sturdy though). The screen is bright with vivid colors and awesome viewing angles - one can hold it flat and look at it from sides without problems. People were complaining about dead/stuck pixels, mine had none and I'm very picky about these things.The speakers are nicely placed below the D-PAD and action keys without getting in your way but aren't as loud as I'd like them to be.Graphics wise the console is very capable but your mileage may vary depending on your game. Some games look really good (Uncharted, Wipeout) while others don't (F1 2011, Asphalt Injection, Monster Hunter). I wouldn't say this is a PS3 on the go but comes very close in some games.The \"Near\" feature lets you discover users close to you with a Vita. This is based on location services and requires an internet connection to work (The Wifi version doesn't feature a GPS as I learned)The trophies feature is a nice addition but it's unclear what games support them and don't.The operating system seems to handle multitasking better than the PS3 in some regards especially to downloads.Build quality of the device is very good, doesn't squeak and feels compact despite its size. The front and back are prone to scratches and fingerprints so make sure you invest in a screen protector and a case (I have a HORI screen protector for the front which is AWESOME - was a breeze to install and left no bubbles/dust but caution is always advised)Battery life isn't bad, at about 4.5hrs on a full chargeThe bad:The remote play feature is useless and doesn't work with any of PS3 titles I tried (about 50 in number)It *sometimes* locks up needing a hard reset (had to google how to do it). First time I have inserted a game it hung on a black screen. I freaked out because it wouldn't respond to the power button. I have not experienced any hangs after the last firmware update (1.6) but I'll have to see.PSN titles aren't cheaper than their physical counterparts.The familiar XMB menu system is gone in favor of a more iphone like interface where everything sits in its own app, even the settings section and photos/music etc.Has no internal storage requiring you to purchase yet another new and proprietary memory card to save games and content. Some games won't even start if you don't have a memory card.There's no quality control from Sony and publishers/game studios apparently \"puke\" mediocre games with crappy graphics just because the Vita is yet another platform that make them money (Monster Hunter, F1 2011, Asphalt Injection etc)So there you have it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2012"}

I ranked the original a 10/10. And the director's cut improved the controls, added some extra cutscenes and has slightly improved graphics. Why then did I give the director's cut a 4 star review? Well for one reason and one reason only-Frame rate. I think all the 5 stars reviews are from people who only played the 360 version and wanted to give it a good review and for the 360 it deserves the 5 out of 5. But the director's cut has an awful frame rate problem, playing the game is like watching a YouTube video with a low internet connection. The game lags all the time! I still think it's an amazing game and I love the new stuff but this is the director's cut it's supposed to run smoother! If you're a huge fan like me or don't have a Xbox I still say it's worth it but otherwise I'd say wait to see if they patch it. 8/10(This part is for the game itself from my Xbox review of the game)Deadly Premonition is a very strange game. It's a \"so bad its good game\" and a good game at the same time. To explain; the fighting mechanics, graphics, and driving sections are horribly bad but their so bad that their funny. I never laughed so hard at a game. The standard enemy walks at you backward in an almost crab walk and when you shoot them purple blood comes out. There are a lot of funnier stuff then that but I won't spoiler it. On to the good parts, this game has a amazing story line, likable characters, one of the most epic soundtrack in any game (look up \"deadly premonition life is beautiful\") and it is truly unpredictable. This is rare in a game. This game is a one of the only \"cult classic\" game this generation.  If you only want to play for gameplay this game isn't for you but if you want a unique, funny, crazy experience. Buy deadly premonition. 10/10If they release a patch for the directors cut I will rank it 11/10 :)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2013"}

The first Mario Kart game for the SNES was hit, but the N64 version added new stunning 3D Graphics, but got got rid of some of the things that made the SNES game so much fun. Mario Kart Super Circuit takes the best of both titles to make one of the best kart-racing games around. It includes 20 new courses to race on. For those of you who have played both the SNES and N64 versions (like I have) you would find this game to be closer to the SNES title, which I personally think is better than the sequel on the N64.The graphics of this game are similar to the SNES game, but are mind-blowing for a handheld game. Like the SNES and N64 versions it includes 3 modes: GP (Grand Prix), Battle and Time trial. In GP you choose one of 8 characters: Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Wario, Yoshi, Donkey Kong Jr. and Bowser, and race in a variety of courses in 50cc, 100cc, or 150cc mode. 50cc mode is the easiest to race in, but in 100cc and 150cc the computer gets a lot faster and more challenging. There are also several items that you getting by running over boxes which help you during the races. Lightning bolts (the rarest item to get) makes all of the other opponents small, mushrooms give you a speed burst, banana peels make one of your opponents crash if they slip on it, red shells are used to shoot directly at an opponent to get them off course, and green shells keep bouncing off the walls until it hits one of the racers. If you earn enough points to win a Cup you'll win trophies. Also if you race well enough and earn enough coins you can unlock new tracks from the SNES Mario Kart title.In Time Trial mode you race in any of the 30+ courses and try to set records for each lap and/or race.In battle mode you and a friend choose a character to battle against each other. You drive around a course trying to pop each other's 3 balloons. You pop their balloons by shooting green or red shells at them or throwing banana peels at them. This mode is very fun especially if you get tired of GP mode.The backgrounds are very colorful, and the individual go-karts are detailed nicely. The music and the sound effects are great as well, and the gameplay is amazing.If you are looking for a very fun racing game for your GBA, check out Mario Kart Super Circuit.

You get the sense you are sitting down in front of your TV on a Saturday afternoon to enjoy the game.  The only things missing are a roast beef sandwich and your favorite drink.  Helping bring the in-game production together is the team of Brad Nessler and Kirk Herbstreit calling the action and Erin Andrews issuing sideline reports.  No Lee Corso this year which is good or bad depending on how you feel about him.The action on the field is smooth and crisp.  The running system has been vastly improved with the new \"locomotion\" system.  By using the right stick your player can juke and twist defenders out of their jocks or lower his soldier to get the last few tough yards.  Blockers actually block, even twenty yards downfield and you can move to take advantage of their blocks.  Receivers now hug the sideline to make great catches as they fall out of bounds.  The Defenses seem to react better and often gang-tackle opposing ball carriers rather than just stand around.  You have so much control over your team, especially with defensive adjustments that it can be daunting.  Your secondary can press or play off, double-team, adjust to one side or another, blitz or spy...same goes for your linebackers.  There's so much you can do you'll find yourself still trying to make adjustments while the offense is snapping the ball!  On offense you have the usual selection of audibles, hot routes, players going in motion, etc...Dynasty mode is back and while the basic Dynasty is pretty much the same, you can now play your Dynasty online against a group of other players who you will compete against not only on the field but off the field as you recruit high school players.  You can access your online dynasty from your PC as well.  Dynasty modes give you the ability to create newspaper stories and highlights for your team.  Cosmetic stuff but it adds a nice sense of authenticity.Speaking of recruiting, if you are a recruiting geek like me you'll have almost as much fun with that aspect as you will with game action.  Each week you'll go through your list of prospects and select if you want to call them or not and choose how much time you with to spend on the phone with them, from 10 to 60 minutes.  You can than choose which subjects you want to discuss with him such as early playing time, pro potential, conference or coach prestige, academic prestige, athletic facilities, and many more.  You can compare your program to another program he is considering and if your program is ranked higher in that subject, you will raise his interest in your program and decrease it in the rival's program.  Very Cool!  You can also schedule recruiting visits to your campus and set the activities like visiting the press box, attending a pep rally, talking to professors, all designed to hopefully raise your prospect's interest and get the all-important commitment.  Honestly the recruiting system is one of the most attractive features of this year's game.Now we get to the bad...Nessler and Herbstreit are only ordinary and repeat the same lines over and over.  It's annoying to hear Herbstreit say he expected a \"closer game\" when a powerhouse has just destroyed a team they are supposed to destroy.  As usual, penalties are problematic...leaving penalties on their default settings will result in few if any penalties during a game.  But then I raised holding penalties from 50 to 60 and I ended up with a barrage of penalties.  There seems to be no middle ground.  There are far too many injuries.  Many of these are minor bumps which give you the option of playing or resting the injured player but don't expect to get through the season without a few major injuries.Road to Glory mode is back which allows you to create a high school player and have him grow and progress into the collegiate ranks.  However it uses the exact same Erin Andrews video segments from last year's NCAA Football 10 which is very disappointing.  I realize Ms. Andrews may have been a \"bit busy\" this past year but its cheap on EA's part.  The Road to Glory is frankly boring and should be dumped in next year's edition.On to the ugly part...There are some definite glitches in the game which EA has yet to address.  First, players are getting a \"download failure\" message at the start and end of games, evidently meaning that stats are not being saved to your record online.  I placed a call to EA tech support who was aware and working on the problem but as of two weeks now, no patch has been forthcoming.  Even worse is that there are major issues with player and recruit progress over many seasons.  By the time you are into your 5th or 6th season of Dynasty mode the best recruits are only getting overall ratings in the high 60s or low 70's.  They are not progressing much over their college careers either resulting in nearly every team getting low C's or D ratings for their teams.  This is a MAJOR issue with the game and needs to be addressed by EA promptly.One other gripe is that EA offers a package of recruiting reports, recruiting advisor and progression helpers that you can buy for $30 but seriously...you've already spent $60 on the game and the additional $30 seems a bit steep.Overall this is an outstanding game.  The in-game action is the best yet with fluid movements and realistic animations.  The presentation is top-notch and the recruiting system is a blast.  But a few nagging technical issues keep this from earning a top grade.UPDATE:  EA has fixed the download failure.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00004YRQA","description":"Building a better system from the ground up sometimes involves digging into even the most mundane components. Take memory cards, for instance. To provide larger storage capacity and faster access rates--PlayStation2 cards transfer data 200 times faster than cards for the original PlayStation--PlayStation2 developers have upgraded the technology for the new memory card. The 8 MB Memory Card uses Flash Memory, the storage technology that's revolutionizing handheld computers, digital cameras, and MP3 players. In contrast, the 128 KB memory cards that were designed for the original PlayStation use memory blocks. While large files can spill over several blocks, you can't store more than one file per block in that design, no matter how small the file. The 8 MB Memory Card allieviates that problem by organizing and storing files much more like a computer hard disk.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"You're gonna need this sooner or later...","reviewText":"As with a lot of game consoles when you first buy it(besides the old Genesis, SNES etc) there isn't a memory card packaged with it.

You can't use your PS1 memory card as the files are quite big and obviously it just wouldn't work. Doesn't matter what you play, you're gonna need this. Sports games to save your game stats and if you do tournament-like things, RPG's obviously so you can not play the 20-40 hour games in one shot and so on.

Although this game mostly consists of you using alot of melee attacks,such as relying on using your fists and items you find scattered around that can be used as weapons. I found the storyline to be very fascinating,as it kept me intrested as to what was going to happen next. The music is also very good and has a nice creepy touch to it.

{"product_name":"B00005B8G1","description":"The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

If that was too subtle for you, here it is in plain terms: there is NONE. That's right, there isn't a handheld video game system out there that is even remotely powerful enough to be in the same category as the GameBoy Advance, and there won't be for the foreseable future.Of course, if lack of competition made a product great, then Microsoft would be selling cars faster than General Motors by now. However, the GBA really deserves to be considered the leader of the pack- as measly as that pack might be. Surely you will recall the almighty Sega Game Gear -originally retailing for slightly more than this, 16 bit and 45 minutes of power on 6 AA batteries. The GBA delivers a whopping 15 hours on 2 AA batteries, with crisp 32 bit graphics and an even smaller size than the GameBoy Color. It is also backwards-compatible with all previous GameBoy titles.(...) From a pure gamer's perspective, let's face the fact that no more new titles are going to be made for old GameBoy, but instead developed for GBA. Additionally, it's just a whole lot more capable with the multiplay abilities and all that extra power. The only thing one might wish this system had is a backlit screen, but the extra power consumption for one would be a pretty lousy tradeoff. Nobody complained that the old GameBoy wasn't backlit, so why should anyone complain now?Bottom line is, this is a sweet system and a real deal. It's great for long, boring car trips and can hold its own against most TV-based consoles in sheer processing power. Get one today!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2001"}

Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"Thief:  Not the open world stealth game you were looking for","reviewText":"So outside of Knack and Killzone:  Shadow Fall, this is the first AAA title that wasn't a port of a PS3/PSN game released for the PS3, with great anticipation, ushering in the new generation properly.And while Thief does has its moments, it's ultimately a letdown.The 15 minute preview video I watched of the first mission boasted \"There are multiple ways to approach this; what follows is just one method\".  Here's the problem:  The game FORCES you into scenarios.  Doors/windows/hatches close behind you.  Want to drop down?  Sometimes you can without a button press, sometimes it requires a button press, and sometimes you can't at all, even if it appears you can.  There is a grand illusion at work in \"The City\" (really?  In 2014, that's the best you can come up with?  talk about an \"F\" for originality!) that you can be a master thief and go anywhere, and do anything, to get the loot.  Not so.And, to make matters worse, by the midpoint of the game you will acquire a skill which will let you deal with guards with your fists if you're spotted (i.e. instead of being killed you'll kill them).  Essentially, this breaks the need to play stealth, and while that's appreciated for people who don't want to try to do an entire run of the game without being spotted on Master Thief difficulty, it does kinda defeat the purpose of a game built on a stealth premise.  Focus also pretty much makes the game broken, you can choose not to use it, then why offer it in the first place then?And even with the new generation of gaming systems, the enemy AI apparently is still stuck in the PS2 era as guards get stuck in the environment and will otherwise just ignore you all together unless you make it blatantly obvious (i.e. run smack into them, leave a dead body right in the middle of the room/street, etc).Finally, LOAD TIMES.  Wow.  Forget it if you expect a seamless transfer between environments.  You're looking at a 20-40 second load time EVERY time.  That is absolutely unacceptable in this generation of consoles, period.This seems like a game destined for a discount within the first 2-3 months of release and is NOT a game you should be paying full price for.  The in-game map is atrocious and almost unusable, enemy combat is handled with the triggers vs. the face buttons and is a poor man's version of the Arkham games, and while the graphics and sound are great, it reminds me of a saying \"If you put lipstick on a pig, it is still a pig\".So consider it 4 or 5 stars for the graphics, sound and potential replay value, and 1-3 stars (depending on your level of annoyance) with the U/I, controls, gameplay and overall polish.If that's something you're willing to pay $60 for, more power to you.  For all but the diehard Thief and stealth fans, save your money for Infamous: Second Son and Destiny; those games will be much more worth your money.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2014"}

It perfectly married action and suspense to deliver a truly viscerally unique and highly enjoyable experience. Dead Space 3 misses the mark. One of the most glaring reasons for this was the strange decision to make this a Co-op experience. That in and of itself is not a bad thing. Tying a large portion of the plot and character progression to said co-op campaign while leaving it out of the single player campaign however was a very, very poor choice.The allure of the Dead Space series had always been its story and atmosphere, but in 3 you are asked to choose between these aspects. If you want the story then you are going to have to have an online, no local co-op, partner ruining any chance at a tense atmosphere. If said atmosphere is your priority however, be prepared for your single player campaign to be very light on story and context.Maybe if the gameplay held up, this strange design choice would be forgivable, but alas that too has been altered. A big plus of the two previous games were there very enjoyable selection of weapons. In the third game however you are all but forced to create your own weapon. While this can be a fun and rewarding experience, it would have been nice it they hadn't neutered the previous games weapons, in order to make weapon creation more appealing. The enemies are much faster than in the previous games, but somehow seem less threatening. The hectic pace doesn't lend itself well, making the few actually jarring moments not hit as hard because they are sandwiched between wall to wall combat.Much has been made of the micro transactions but they are in no way mandatory. If you don't want to use that system then don't; its that simple. Dead Space 3 is not a bad game. The graphics are great, controls are fluid, sound design is very good, and the combat can be enjoyable. Unfortunately, because of strange, out of place design choices, it quite simply doesn't live up to the games that came before it. If you haven't played the series before, this is not the place to start. If you've played the first two, then I would recommend getting this. While the experience won't be, in my opinion, as good, this is still dead space. If you're a diehard fan its a buy, but for everyone else I would say this is a solid weekend rental.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2013"}

After playing, loving, and re-playing every Dragon Quest game that's been released over here (which adds up to four games), I have finally completed DQVIII, the first entry on the PS2. And believe me, it was worth every second of waiting.The 3D transformation is a triumph. While familiar landmarks of the 2D entries are present and accounted for, they are now in glorious, colorful 3D, and look great. Also in the graphics department, the new full-motion cutscenes are amazing, and easily one of the game's highlights. Characters exhibit real emotion in their movement and facial expressions; weapon and spell effects in battle look awesome; and there are even great little touches, like equipment that has cosmetic effects. If you're one of the whiners who hated on DQVII because of it's \"dated\" look, well, you no longer have anything to whine about.The gameplay is classic Dragon Quest, but has been updated in a number of ways. While you still explore towns, travel the world, and hack through dungeons, and the battle system is as satisfyingly simple as ever, there's now a little more depth. Borrowing elements from this summer's phenomenal Atelier Iris, the game now has skill-point allocation and item combination. While not revoloutionary, it adds a healthy dose of fun and variety.The story, while pretty conventional, does have a number of surprising twists, tons of laugh-out-loud moments, and a lot of personality. Even minor characters are fleshed out well, and although the hero is still silent, the developers have found ways to give him substance for the first time.While I could go on and on about things that make this game fun, the real reason is actually very simple: Level 5 has taken a classic formula, and polished it until it gleams. The old pleasures of leveling up, finding new loot, and raiding the dressers of NPCs are back, only this time they've been brought to modern standards of presentation and style. If you're a fan, there is no question. Buy it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2005"}

A licensed game about zombies that doesn't focus exclusively on shooting their brains out, an adventure game with puzzles that make sense, an episodic structure, and it made millions while actively outshining the AMC TV show of the same name. If you haven't bought this yet, then go do so.The Walking Dead, set in a boilerplate zombie doomsday scenario, focuses on how human relationships are affected by the collapse of society, and the crazy @#$% people do when survival takes precedence over buying video games. This particular story is centered around Lee Everett, a convicted felon on his way to jail when the game opens, who is freed by random chance and asked to take care of a little girl called Clementine. This may begin to evoke RE4 and sweet memories of shooting Ashley in the head for kicks, but Clementine is the emotional center of the game, rather than an annoyance who you order to hide in a trash bin while you deal with the chainsaw psychos ahead.Instead of mowing down Las Plagas, you are put through piles of dialogue and simple puzzles. There is no morality system, and characters will remember your words and actions, making you worry about the opinions of others more than what will happen if you rub that rubber duck against that corpse.The Walking Dead is sort of a big deal with the TV show bandying about in plain sight, and part of the game's initial success can be attributed to the brand recognition, but remember that the game was originally released in 5 separate chunks, so the game is obviously good enough on it's own merits to drive players to get the whole thing, become a conversation piece in the way Bioshock Infinite and The Last of Us did, and win over 90 game of the year awards. TWD has revolutionized the gaming industry, and should be experienced by everyone with the means to do so.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2013"}

I really thought it was going to be a dog. But, being such an extreme fan of the original, I was still looking forward to how it would be. I was especially irked by the removal of the skill system, a system that I thought made the game more like an RPG instead of just a first person action adventure game. After I played it, I was very impressed. It looks graphically stunning, has even more player freedom than the first Deus Ex, and even more endings. I loved playing through this game. It is a bit easier than the first one, but still squarely in the right range of difficulty to maintain my interest, but not make me too frustrated that I get killed in the same area over and over.In the final analysis, this is a spectacular game much like the first, but the original Deus Ex is still my favorite game of all time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2007"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYK44","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Siddiqui","summary":"Grab your guns and start looting.","reviewText":"It has been three years since the release of the original Borderlands and allowed players first set on the dangerous world called Pandora in search of vast riches. This cell-shaded first-person shooter used cooperative play and goofy humor to create a world full of wonder and loot. While Gearbox uses a lot of mechanics that made the first game so great the developers have refined enough of the game to make it superior to the first one. While some of the issues from the first game still exist Borderlands 2 refines and improves enough of the old mechanics to make it an adventure you'll want to share with all your friends.Taking place after the events of the first Borderlands you take control of one of four vault hunters who have come to Pandora in search of loot. However since the opening of the vault in the first Borderlands the Hyperion Cooperation, led by Handsome Jack, have the entire planet under his control. It's your job to stop Jake from gain possession of a legendary item, take your revenge, and assist the people in Pandora. The story isn't anything special but a large improvement from the first game.Pandora isn't the same a deserted planet full of bandits and murderous animals but populated with much more characters for you to interact with. The characters list has expanded with a diverse amount of old and new faces, each have entertaining things to say. Characters such as the four playable characters from the first game make a return and play a large role in the story as well as characters other notorious people such as Mad Moxxi and Scooter. New additions such as he villain Handsome Jack and the disturbing Tiny Tina are delightful additions that maintain the same goofy nature of the Borderlands universe. Most importantly the people that populate the world don't look or act like mindless husk that either grunt or remain mute, but interact with the environment and actually speak. Gearbox has also updated the dialogue of the enemies you face, spouting psychotic and threatening taunts as they attempt to collect the reward for your head. It is strange that an option to review these conversations is absent since characters can unexpectedly stop talking when another character begins to speak.The voice-acting in Borderlands 2 is nothing less then spectacular. Each character is brought to life with strong writing that combines heartwarming moments, murderous outburst, and humor. At times I would stop and listen to the person speaking, to prevent it from being cut off by some unexpected event. These personalities are what bring Pandora to life, something that was absent from the first game.While the characters provide a lot of entertainment it is the world of Pandora that will keep you busy. The environments and locations within Borderlands 2 are larger, more diverse, and offer an array of richer colors to allow each detail to illuminate the screen. Like the first game some textures still tend to pop in but this is still a visually appealing world, with a lot to offer. Explorers will find a lot of challenging enemies and visually pleasing environments.But what is an adventure without missions, and Borderlands 2 offers a large amount of optional quest and a wonderful array of story missions. While a lot of the missions still require you to collect, defend, and kill specific targets you will presented with creative dialogue and sometimes a wacky objective to complete, just wait till you find the mission \"Shoot This Guy in the Face\". With an online checklist you'll be able to track each task and can ignore objectives to prevent unnecessary clutter, allowing you to complete one mission and move on to the next easily. It's a shame that a separate save function is absent, instead those seeking to replay a certain mission will have to reply the entire game.Borderlands 2 includes a challenge system in addition to the traditional experience system found in RPG's. The challenges in Borderlands 2 are full of specific but plentiful tasks that automatically update and reward you continuously with tokens and increase your badass rank. These special items allow you to permanently upgrade various attributes that apply to all your characters. This overarching reward system allows for a friendly system and encourage players to experiment with other classes without feeling like they are starting from nothing when beginning a new game.Completing missions and challenges is fun wouldn't be as much fun without physical rewards, of course I'm talking about loot. Guns, grenades, shields, modifications, and relics offer a lot of possibilities to improve or alter your combat abilities. Unlike the first game the gun models have been updated with more visual options. Customizing your weapons and armor with the large amount of options for you to change and improve your loadout during the course of the game. You can mark useless items called junk to sell easily and pick up items such as money, health, and ammo automatically without having to manually input the command.Finding a new piece of loot is fun, but testing it on one of the many hostile enemies that inhabit Pandora is even better. Every enemy you face whether they are human, animal, robotic, or mutated will  prove to be formidable, and they don't mind fighting one another. New enemies such as the Stalker, that can turn invisible, are one of many new enemies that will require you to change tactics and approach each fight with caution instead of charging in. These new foes are refreshing since each area you enter can be litter with new adversaries for you to kill.Despite the new enemies combat hasn't change much from the original game. The shooting mechanics remain the same solid style from the original game, such as fight-for-your-life moment where you can revive yourself if you manage to kill an enemy before the timer runs out. All the elements from the first game return, with the exception of a new substance called slag. This purple material weakens the defense of any enemy and amplifies damage. Fall damage has also been removed, removing the need to be cautious when jumping off a cliff.The four new characters offer new abilities and tactics to better accommodate the updated system. While players will still have original classes such as Maya the Siren and Axton the Commando the newest additions; Zero the Assassin and Salvador the Gunzerker are exciting and welcomed additions. Each character comes with a special ability such as Maya's talent to trap enemies in the air, Axton's turret, Zero's decoy, and Salvador is able to go into a rage that increase damage and defense. Unlike the original Borderlands these characters are provided with a back-story to describe there lives before coming to Pandora, but these audio recordings must be found in the world.Each of these racial abilities can be upgraded and alter through the skill tree. Offering three different options for each characters, and players can choose to reset them at anytime. While options for specific weapons type exist within the skill tree, your character isn't limited to specialized weapons anymore. You can also slightly change the appearance of your character, but these are limited to new head gear and clothing colors that can be found throughout Pandora. Those seeking to fully upgrade there character will have to play through Vault Hunter mode, a harder difficulty setting that scales the obstacles of Pandora to your level and saturates the fields with dangerous creatures.While Borderlands is fun to play with yourself you can bring up to four people along for the ride. Borderlands 2 supports up to four player cooperative play and allows for split-screen up to two players of any class. While the game attempts to set the difficulty based on the amount of players and level of each character it is best if you coordinate with people to ensure that things don't get out of control. One of the issues of the first game was joining games with players who were either ahead or behind on missions, now if you complete later missions while someone else is hosting the game you can choose to skip it when you gain access to it. With tougher enemies, better loot, and the excitement of completing objectives together makes cooperative play to be the best way to play through Borderlands 2.If you played Borderlands then you'll feel right at home with Borderlands 2. Gearbox doesn't attempt to go beyond what the original title did but instead builds on what made the first game great with new additions and refinements, making it a successful successor to the original game. While it can feel hollow at times with similar objectives and lack of separate save files, the world of Pandora is full of adventures that you will want to spend hours exploring, completing missions, and getting better loot. So raise you guns high and let's starting hunting for treasure.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2013"}

To be honest though if you really want to play the next best 1st person shooter to Half-Life 2 then get the expansion pack and this, but they should be out together soon enough.This game can run on a 32mb graphics card meaning if you have a high-end 64mb module or a 128mb you are going to be in for a good time. I ran it on a 256mb and it was very good with the UO expansion was astonishing. Nearly anyone with a somewhat recent PC can play this 1st person shooter and I am sure it will leave most happy that they did. Was it better than Medal of Honour: Allied Assault, as we have heard? Yeah, it is, but not by much, a margin maybe, but still anything that can live up to MOHAA surely can't be missed and COD lives up to the hype.The concept is the same as MOHAA except that there is more action, more high-octane moments, a different type of enemy AI. UO has a lot more going on in terms of what you can pilot and drive in the story, although not freely but as part of the story. The Both COD and UO game play certainly have the Cinematic intensity that it claims including various set pieces like the storming of the Reichstag. UO has more thrilling missions but this one has the original Enemy at the Gates opening. UO has an Enemy at the Gates finishing, a train bombing run, a lighthouse demolition, the Soviet offensive, all stunning to boot.COD or OU iare not however HL2 graphics quality or anything close, but does offer a vast improvement over MOHAA, so in that respect is quite good, just nowhere near cutting edge. However COD:UO does have very convincing camera jitters and spectacular smoky explosions. So does COD but not as good quality. The textures let both games down a small bit but the environments and maps are genuinely war like all the way through and can not be faulted. The enemy AI and your own team AI can vary between very helpful and not so helpful but this depends on if you do your job or not. It is actually quite reliable. More so in UO - when your team take on an enemy the AI allows each to take multiple hits so that they eventually come into close combat and start hitting each other. This AI must be taken as is, even though slightly unrealistic, the game is not a war simulation but a 1st person war adventure and to be honest, does exactly what it says on the tin. So apart from the staged element, which actually ads to the game, it is more of an experience than a game you will turn to time and time again, however it is worth it for the experience of the single player mission alone.I can not fault it much except to say that it is shorter than UO, a bit easier than UO, and UO is shorter than MOHAA. Weapons realism is not fantastic and the game was a little shorter than UO (this is a 1.5 day game span while UO had 3) but to be honest I am only cribbing. The pandemonium of war is all here in a spectacular fashion because the story is a winner as you play a mini version of BAND OF BROTHERS as part 1 and then a mini version of ENEMY AT GATES in part 2. So WOW! You even feel loss at the end.However when a new war simulation like OPERATION FLASHPOINT comes out for high-end cards I know we will have the true war winner. Please bring on the real war simulator!Pros:- Play the two films mentioned above.- Best new war game and 2nd best 1st person shooter.- Awesome war atmosphere.- Smoky explosions.- Can run on a 32mb card!- COD + UO makes for a great experience.Cons:- 1.5 day lifespan for COD and a 3 day lifespan for UO.- Weapons are not so realistic.- Graphics are not 128mb worthy.- We really need a new Operation Flashpoint with map editor!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2005"}

Coupled with a variety of gameplay modes including single player, multiplayer and the co-op Special Ops Mode, it is destined to be one of the most popular games of 2009 and a worthy addition to theCall of Dutyseries..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }","reviewerName":"A.

It would probably be game of the year right now, that's how good it is. I'm probably one of the few that liked Arkham Asylum better, but that does not take away from how great this game is. The big improvements is the combat is much smoother - which allows for easier combos - and the map is very open world. I had a hard time stringing together combos in Arkham Asylum but I regularly achieved combos of 40+ in this game.There are more in-depth reviews of this game that are better than I could give and there isn't much to be said more than what's already been said. I came in on the party 3 years late so the best thing I could tell you right now is this game is still awesome 3 years after release.

The graphics are dated, but the game has held-up well...even by today's standards.  It runs fine on my Windows XP Home SP3 computer. The game crashed a few times for me, but as long as you save frequently, you'll be okay.POSITIVES* story* voice acting and dialogue* ability to use many objects in the game world* RPG style for some conversations* green/red target so you can tell who is a friend/enemy* realistic environment with cats, rats, birds, etc.* menu structure is well doneNEGATIVES* too much running around* the graphics are a bit stiff and square (but that was standard when this game was made)* too much lock picking, too many key codes* too many locked panels/keypads/vents/doors* enemies bounce around during fights* the screen bounces around when some enemies hit you* often, direct hits to the head won't kill an enemySome control panels, vents, and doors blend into walls; and this makes it hard to tell they exist.Sometimes during a mission, the game loads another section of the mission. The load is quick, but sometimes you can't tell what direction you're facing (i.e., forward, or backward toward the prior section).The environment of some missions look very similar (like inside the ship during the naval shipyard mission). This increases the likelihood that you'll get lost or run around in circles. There is some signage in the game, but it's also missing signs that would normally exist in real life (and that makes it difficult to know where to go next).The environment is fairly open, so you can roam around, go into many different rooms, etc. However, this means there are lots of pig trails. It can be difficult to tell where you need to go next to accomplish an objective. There is a compass in the game, but it only shows direction (not direction to the next primary objective).Sometimes characters get in front of you, and they won't move out of the way; in an open area, that's okay; but in close quarters, it becomes a problem (you have to backup until you get to an area that you can get around the character).OTHERIf you get stuck, then use a walkthrough. If you find parts of the game annoying, then use the cheats (especially for lock picking). Avoid the \"killpawns\" cheat, because it may remove a good guy (and if you need to talk to that person to complete an objective, then you will get stuck---can't advance to the next mission).There is a visual walkthrough by Mike Mangold; sometimes it was helpful, but I found that it takes you through a lot of pig trails; so if you're not interested in every nook and cranny in the game, and if you don't need to pick-up every object, then skip ahead in the walkthrough to the real mission objective.I observed that all scenes either take place at night or indoors. That probably made it easier for graphics (don't have to display too much detail, especially for the landscape).I enjoyed playing the game, but I did use cheats frequently.  Because of the negatives mentioned above, the game was tedious/annoying at times. I'm not sure if I will play this game again; if I do, then it will definitely be with cheats.Visit my Amazon Collections to see my 4-star and 5-star PC games:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customers/A12LH2100CKQO/collections","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001CRM3RI","description":"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Warsis the highly anticipated first game in theGTAfranchise designed for play on the Nintendo DS. But although it comes in a small package, this is a full-fledged game that stands on its own. With an all-new, deep story that approaches the familiar sights and sounds of the infamous Liberty City from a different perspective, an innovative control system and multiplayer options,Chinatown Warscaptures the tone and flavors of the long-runningGTAseries in unique ways that both longtime players and those coming to it for the first time will find hard to put down..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Grand Theft Auto:Chinatown WarsPlayers:Offline: 1; Online: 2Gameplay Modes:Single player; competitive &amp; coop multiplayer via Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.Kick some tail as Huang Lee.View larger.Use the DS stylus like never before.View larger.Reconquer Liberty via PDA.View larger.The Story: Left for Dead in the Worst Place in AmericaFollowing his father&rsquo;s murder, Huang Lee is given what seems a simple mission: to deliver an ancient sword to his Uncle Kenny to ensure his family retains control of the Triad gangs of Liberty City. Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement. While driving players also have access to five in-game radio stations and use of their weapons. Your PDA provides efficient management tools for your growing crime empire, including quick weapons switching, a running total of available cash, in-game e-mail and Internet access and nearly instant game saves any time. The control scheme inChinatown Warsutilizes an easy to use and comfortable to play combination of steering via the D-pad, choice of action through the face buttons and/or stylus taps and manual and automatic weapon locks and unlocks via shoulder buttons.Key Game Features:The Largest DS Game Ever- Contemporary Liberty City is a massive world complete with pedestrians, weather and traffic patterns, five different radio stations and four different sprawling boroughs to explore.Endless Gameplay- Mature storyline with over 70+ story missions; plus dozens of side quests, collectibles, contextual mini-games and the all new mission replay feature.Street Economics- Addictive drug dealing side game with 6 different drug types, 80+ drug dealers and a supply / demand driven narcotics economy.Play with Friends- Nintendo Wi-Fi mode for head-to-head and co-op multiplayer mayhem.Bragging Rights- Chat, trade guns and commodities with your friends, and compete for glory via online tournaments and leaderboards on the Rockstar Games Social Club.PDA Interface- Use the touch screen as a PDA device to set GPS waypoints, change radio stations, communicate via e-mail with in-game characters and order weapons on the Internet.Online Bragging Rights and MultiplayerCare has been taken to ensure that players can share theirChinatown Warsexperiences with friends and fellow players in different ways. First, players will have access to theChinatown Warsas well as the greaterGrand Theft Autocommunities through the Rockstar Games Social Club. Here they can chat, trade commodities, purchase special in-game items with in-game currency, check the leaderboards and compete in online tournaments. The DS' Wi-Fi capabilities also gives players the opportunity to take their game online as they battle for supremacy in their own little corner of Liberty City in both head-to-head and co-op multiplayer battles.","reviewerName":"J. Sherman \"The Critic\"","summary":"Take-Out","reviewText":"Let me get this straight; according to Rockstar Leeds, the tools for building an empire are the Nintendo DS, its stylus, and this game . . .Works for me.One of the most critically acclaimed DS titles (and, ironically, a sales flop), GTA: Chinatown Wars whips up a miniaturized adventure in the most dangerous city on Earth.  As the son of a fallen Triad boss, you must avenge your father's death and recover a stolen family heirloom.  When you actually get around to doing that, there's a bunch of missions that walk you through the game and the story.  Even if you never get around to that, There's still lots to do in the fully interactive environments of Liberty City, especially regarding touch screen use.  From hotwiring cars to scoring drugs to working at a tattoo parlor, each gaming session promises a new experience (however morally depraved).  But the one thing that keeps the game from achieving absolute greatness is its fickle AI; you get a pass if you slam into a few cars, but speed through a toll booth and the cops are on you like duck sauce on an egg roll.  And driving through town's like a citywide demolition derby--confined to a parking garage.This game is rate M for Mature: Violence, Adult Language, Adult Situations, Sexual Content.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2010"}

I am about 3 hours now into Doom, 5 hours into Doom 2 and about 6 hours into Doom 3 and if you're looking for a goodscare for Halloween this just might be what you're looking for.Graphics: Doom 1 and 2 are smoother but mostly the same monster textures are smoother though (doom 1 and 2) Doom 3 looks Fantastic with it's HD makeover and is so creepy compared to most games from this gen. 5 starsSound: excellent and exact in D1 and 2 Doom 3 really shines here I am talking sound effects that will set you up to be scared and you will jump, trust me. easily 5 starsGameplay: thankfully they tuned all THREE games to run perfectly off the dualshock which makes the game control without effort, also lots of options for gamma, and sensitivity for the speed for turning etc. 5 stars!Fun: after all these years Doom 3 still makes me jump and I love it. Doom 1 is as fun as I remember with all secrets right where they were in the original release. Doom 2 looks as good plus all hidden areas are still hidden well and the game plays perfectly Doom 3 is the perfect halloween scare game for me with it's Moody sounds and Creepy effects plus the Hd graphics. 5 stars!Overall: some long load times and slightly intrusive Game Saves (autosave)(sometimes the autosave takes you out of the moment and is annoying fortunately it's mainly before a cutscene or at the end of a level. these are about the only mar on an otherwise perfect Doom release package. Multiplayer is a blast and the single player is just as fun if not more fun then I had remembered.the graphical overhaul will have you on the edge of your seat since it really brought out the creepy atmosphere of this game. I'd recommend the Doom 3 BFG edition to anyone not just FPS fans. that's saying something. 5 stars for a perfect collection, possibly the best HD collection this year!if you're question is \"is it worth it?\"the answer is simple and easy \"Yes it is!\"UPDATE: it seems Doom 1 and Doom 2 have Online MP as well as offline split screen.I just found this out today as I began playing and got an invite froma friend, I was shocked we were co-op (ing) the campaign together. just too bad they Removed this option from Doom 3 but still a superb package of games.Help other customers find the most helpful reviewsWas this review helpful to you?

(Arizona State University) - See all my reviews= Fun:5.0 out of 5 starsThis review is from: Doom 3 BFG Edition (Video Game)A QUICK NOTE: First off, before I begin this review, I want to lay my cards out on the table. Doom 3 is one of my favorite games of all time, but unlike other PC gamers, I never was able to play it on PC. I originally owned the Xbox version (and only that version), and I have never played the original at all on any other platform. Unfortunately, this review will not compare this edition to the original PC games, because I have never owned any of them. I also do not even have my copy of Doom 3 any more. So basically, this review is written by someone who doesn't even own Doom 3 any more. Before I got this, the only Doom game I owned was Ultimate Doom, which I got for PC during this summer's Steam sale.So readers, please, PLEASE, don't go into this review expecting a comparison to the original PC games. I just felt I needed to be honest because I understand that people who already own the games, will want a look between the original games and the BFG Edition.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Eight years after it's initial release, Doom 3 is finally available for consoles in the form of the BFG Edition. I'll go out and state that this review will put the overall package over my personal opinions about the games themselves (although I will at least give my personal opinions on them throughout. After all, I love the Doom franchise). Besides, I suspect that if you are here, you are a Doom fan, right? Or at least have a great interest in the series! So let's break it down.* Both Doom 3 and Resurrection of Evil have been remastered with changes to the audio and visuals of Doom 3 and Resurrection of Evil.* HD Remastering and technical improvements are the main selling point id is pushing. This includes improved lighting, rendering, textures, and many more. Also, Doom 3: BFG Edition supports 3D TV.* On the Audio side, Doom 3: BFG Edition includes 5.1 surround sound.* The Doom: BFG Edition also includes Trophies/Achievements, as well as a new checkpoint save system for consoles. You can use a flashlight and your weapon gun at the same time.* The Lost Missions, a totally new, seven mission campaign with a whole new story.* Finally, Doom 3: BFG Edition includes the original Doom and Doom 2 as a bonus.THE GAMES THEMSELVES","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2013"}

It's unwieldy, poorly implemented and a pain to use, especially for fast-forwarding.Enter the PS3 Remote and...well it works like a remote should.  Set up is as easy as synching the bluetooth remote with the Playstation 3 and then, voila, you have the power of a remote in your hand.  Because it is bluetooth, it handily doesn't need to pick up and infrared sensor.  It just works, whether you're pointing at it, in another room or if you're outside your house.The remote has a ton of buttons, which is crazy and completely useless for most users who simply want to be able to watch a movie.  One thing that was interesting to note was that, for all of the buttons, there's not one for turning on and off the PS3.  That said, you can navigate the Crossbar to turn off the PS3 or you can simply hold down the PS button on the remote, like you would your controller, to turn it off.  Easy work around, but still a curious choice.Overall, I'm happy with the remote.  It does what it should, alleviates the need for draining a controller's battery and works like a remote should.  A good purchase, but I still think it should have been included with the unit.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2009"}

And it might be worth mentioning that it was a pleasant surprise. The world of 3D Dot Game Heroes recalls both the original Legend Of Zelda, but also reminds me of A Link To The Past in more ways than one. Take both of these games and pixelate them in a beautifually flashy way and you've got 3D Dot Game Heroes. The game also delivers up lots of easy AND lots of tough trophies; which makes this game insanely replayable. And the execution has a very serious sense of humor. The soundtrack rocks and the dungeons are brimming with puzzles fitting of the current gaming generation. Character creation is another major plus. You can easily create a character which looks like it primarily swims through the ground, but then jumps out of the ground when attacking, running, etc. It's a lot of fun to play around with. You can also change your character anytime you reboot into the game, take screenshots at any time, and so on. It's a blast to play. One thing I would note is that this isn't a complete Zelda knockoff. Swordplay, for example, is slightly different. In Zelda, you shoot a magical sword across the screen when your health is full. Here, however, your sword becomes gargantuan when your health is full. Also, you can swing the sword and then move the analog stick to actually slice the air in a particular direction. Once you master this art, the game really opens up. You can also spend money on upgrades for certain things much the way you can in modern day RPG's. This adds depth that will certainly be appreciated by anyone who likes these types of games. The only real drawback of this game for me was the length. Considering though that this is a game paying homage to the original Zelda, I wasn't expecting something that would take as much time to beat as most current era games do. But this does feel rather short nonetheless. Still, the replay value is high, this game could be enjoyed by both old and new gamers, and it's an experiencing I would gladly pay more than the asking price to have.

{"product_name":"B00D96BORK","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Fulkerson","summary":"A good choice if you're on a budget","reviewText":"Turtle Beach have launched three new variations of their Call Of Duty: Ghosts headphones, and the \"Shadow\" version is the lowest price available, currently at $100 MSRP. While the \"Phantom\" and \"Spectre\" versions will cost you more dough, they will come with more bells and whistles, so if you're looking to spend $100 for a pair of quality headphones that sound pretty darn good, these may be the right set for you.I have tested these with a PS3 and Xbox 360 set up, and both are serviceable and sounded fine through various games and tests. The setup is pretty self-explanatory, and they are more or less ready to go right out of the box with minimal hassle. I played the new Call of Duty, as well as Skyrim, Left 4 Dead, and Mass Effect 3 on the Xbox 360, and they actually sounded quite advanced for a headset at this price point. The ambient noise as well as gunfire, voices, and music were well-adjusted and balanced enough to really make a solid enhancement to the gameplay. Typically I have experienced worse luck on Xbox 360's with corded headphones than I do the PS3, but these sounded surprisingly good. I tested these on my PS3 with games Last Of Us, Bioshock Infinite, and Grand Theft Auto 5, and all sounded very nice. For 100 bucks, you can do a heck of a lot worse, and Turtle Beach's quality of craftsmanship comes through here.I always have the same complaints with video game headphones, be them made from Turtle Beach, Creative Soundlabs, Tritton, Monoprice, etc., and that is the cheaper you go, the less comfort you'll have, all while having a mountain of cords to deal with. These \"Shadow\"s are no different, and the amount of cords and wires included here mars the experience somewhat. With all the technology out there, video game headphones just need to be cordless, and affordable. Period. These \"Shadow\"s present quite the challenge in cord length, so if you plan on sitting far away from your console, you may want to think twice before purchasing these. I'm assuming that most people are aware of cord length before they purchase, so this may go without saying.I have also used the \"Spectre\" variation, and without going into too much detail on those here, the biggest difference between the two is comfort, and to me, that is a biggie. These headphones are pretty uncomfortable, and I wouldn't want to be wearing them for much longer than an hour at a time. They're cheap plastic with thin ear cups that don't make long periods of gaming too comfy. Again, you get what you pay for, but I feel this needs to be mentioned regardless of the price.In summation, for 100 dollars you can't do much better than these. With their relative cheapness comes the unsightly cords and rigid physical design, but sound-wise these are of quite a high quality. One thing I love about Turtle Beach headsets is they last forever, so if duration and affordability take precedence over comfort and design, I recommend these without hesitation. I would, however, urge buyers that, if you have a few more bucks to spend, check out the \"Spectre\" variation, or better yet, the \"Phantom\"!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2013"}

There are a wide variety of levels and though some are a bit more difficult than others, most are about the same difficulty.  If you play the \"Campaign\" mode of the game, it doesn't take very long to beat (I beat it after only about 2 1/2 hours). The main reason I play this game is so that I can play with my family.  Unlike the splitscreen version of HALO which places yourself against just one or two people, STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT gives you the option of placing your entire army against someone else's.  This is a lot of fun and is especially entertaining and challenging when playing the \"Conquest\" option (which gives players various bonuses depending on how well they played before).  In many ways, it's like a virtual galatic version of RISK.  The only major negative thing about the game are some of the graphics: for instance, when trying to get a better view of what is going on in the screen I might try to move my character around to get a better angle, but what often happens is that instead of a better angle all I get is a see-through view of my character's body and no view whatsoever.  Overall, this is a rather enjoyable game to play with other people and many STAR WARS fans will enjoy playing it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2006"}

You have to experience it for yourself. And I guess that there are few gamers that haven't played this before. Great conversion from N64 to 3DS. This game has lost none of its magical greatness on its journey from Nintendo 64 to Nintendo 3DS. On the contrary. Watching the sun set on Hyrule field is even more beautiful than it was before. Once you start this game you'll be completely absorbed by it. But I expected nothing less from a port of the greatest game ever. This is the only game I'll never get tired of completing over and over again. Incredible that so much gaming-joy can fit into such a tiny cartridge and such a tiny console. I recommend not exaggerating the 3D effect. Just barely tap it, and the game looks even better than it did on Nintendo 64. Control-wise the design of the 3DS isn't as good as the N64-controller was, so the battles when encountering stalfos (those skeleton-enemies) can actually be quite difficult. But you can't blame this game for the fact that the 3DS doesn't feel so good to hold as a regular game-pad. When you enter 1st person view you will be able to look around by rotating yourself while holding the 3DS in front of you. So in a way you are actually becoming Link, kind of. You really feel like you are the person standing there on Hyrule field. It's really incredible.If you have never heard of this game before, you need to know only 4 things:-It is the greatest videogame ever made-It has the best story ever seen in a videogame-It has the best music ever heard in a videogame-It is a 3D action adventure game with lots of hack and slash","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000FRS9II","reviewerName":"Gradient Vector Field \"subjectedtometal (dot)...","summary":"Post Apocalyptic Action","reviewText":"After hearing all kinds of rave remarks about this game, I figured it was high time my friend and I tried it out.  Gears of War basically just throws you into the middle of a war zone.  Other than the fact that we were fighting these weird creatures that attacked us from under the earth, my friend and I never really fully understood what was going on.Pros:Split Screen co-opAwesome world to exploreAssault Rifle with a ChainsawNav Point to help complete objectivesCons:Story line doesn't feel like it makes a lot of senseVehicle used is sort of clunkyThere are missions where you and your partner get separatedThis game is pretty intense and has non stop action throughout the game.  It has a lot of influences that I felt were kind of obvious.  The major influence that I think is there is Warhammer 40,000.  It feels like we're basically playing as the Space Marines because the way the people are drawn and their armor are very reminiscent of that universe.  The enemies seem to be lightly modeled after the Orks, but I think that is a loose interpretation.  Gears of War tries to include some elements of \"fear\", especially with the night scenes.  In that regard I think this was heavily influenced by \"Pitch Black\".  There are even flying creatures that tear you apart if you step into the darkness.  When you get to the factory area there are these creatures that scream loudly at you and I feel like those are taken right out of Half Life.  If you like a lot of these aspects you'll have great fun seeing them in a slightly different light in this game.One of the best aspects of this game is the fact that you can play split screen co-op.  The game handles this very well and it works a little different than Halo.  When your partner goes down it's up to you to hunt him down and pick him up.  This basically happens instantaneously, so there's no period where you have to \"patch him up\" like in Army of Two.  The only thing I didn't like was that there are multiple sections where you split up from your partner.  In these sections if one of you dies you have to restart that section.  This got kind of annoying, because the game can be a little disorienting at times.There aren't a large amount of weapons to choose from, or at least that's how it felt while I was playing.  There are two types of automatic weapons, a couple pistols, and a major destructive weapon that is useful for taking down some of the larger creatures and Berserkers.  However, having the chain saw attached to one of the assault rifles was genius!  That thing is so much fun to use in close quarters fighting.  There is also a vehicle you can use in the game, but only for limited runs.  It's an alright vehicle, I wish the weapons systems were a bit more useful other than shining light on those flying creatures.  It's a really neat vehicle and I wish we could have been able to use it a little more.  Also whenever you shined the light the vehicle would begin to power down because it had \"power issues\".  If you removed that and put a more useful gun it would be really fun.Despite the fact that I found this game fun, I found the overall storyline somewhat incoherent and it felt rather thrown together.  These creatures started coming out of holes in the ground and totally tore humanity apart.  I love the post apocalyptic world we're in.  The graphics, to me, look awesome and I loved exploring the world.  But part of our mission is to map these giant tunnels underground to help our military \"fight back\".  This made sense, but the sheer volume of tunnels was ridiculous.  Not to mention where'd the creatures come from?  I felt like I got no answers by the end of the game.  This is alright, there will be sequels, but it just feels weird to me.  Overall the battles do feel intensely cinematic in quality, which is what the developers were probably going for.Overall, I would definitely recommend this game, especially if you enjoy co-op games on the couch with your friends as much as I do.  The game isn't long in an epic scale, which is fine, I actually felt like it was just the right length.  Unlike Halo 3, which I felt, was way too short.  I'm also looking forward to seeing how they expand on this world in future releases.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2009"}

After playing through half of the missions, it didn't disappoint! The two analog sticks makes playing the game like on regular console, although I'm a bit slow to touch the screen to go over the barricade or toggling zoom of the gun's target scope. The graphics are impressive on a small screen. I'm really surprised to see smoke or fog moving in open areas. That's a testament to including advanced software logic, as well as such powerful portable console. The sound is very good. With a very good headset, I can hear solders talking and whispering (softly) on one or the other ear.There are 36 missions that will get unlocked in sequence when previous mission is completed. Sometimes other missions will get unlocked as well. The maps get re-used for different missions. Personal score is compared to those in the area, region, and global. For each mission I was encouraged to replay, get better, and move on to next level within the mission. It suggests best personnel for each mission, but I'm free to choose the character I want. The length of each mission is short enough where I can, at any time, take out Vita to play a bit. It's a nice alternative to the simple games found on smartphones (iPhone, Android).  So to me it has high replay value on a day-to-day basis.The online co-op allows me to either join in or create a public/private co-op, but I haven't had a chance to try. Same with high value targets. Will update this review when I spend sufficient time with them.But I really like the daily challenge. It's truly challenging! So challenging that I find I spend more time playing the daily challenge then playing the missions! As long as I don't leave the challenge, I can keep trying.

Only 2k has done something I havent seen in decades...a bugless release. It wasnt until entering tvhm on my 2nd character that I realized I have not had one single blip, glitch or bug in some 50+ hrs of gameplay. Mind boggling.Anyway on to the game, to call it an FPS or a shooter doesnt do it justice- this game is more like Diablo with Guns...but not that steaming pile of trash called Diablo 3- more like Diablo 2.The main campaign alone is meaty and takes you through a good portion of the world, but where this game shines (for me) is in multi play.If you're lucky you'll meet up with some people, and they'll take you to places in this game you had no idea existed. The game world is HUGE, really really huge.Easter eggs all over the place, loot galore the vehicles are improved. The skill trees allow for different builds and between them and the tons of relics, mods and gear there is no one 'uber' build, it's all about the drops you aquire.The dialoge in this game is hilarious, Scooter takes the cake, but everyone has some really funny lines.As for the loot- I dont even know how they generate it all but it's awesome, especially in TVHM. Grenades that split, home in on targets, bounce around, replenish health- Guns that ricochet bullets, or bullets that splinter into 6/7 shots, even weapons that do more dmg when thrown that when fired.My 1st two weeks I just spent leveling chars and learning weapons- since then I've been to areas in this game I didnt even know existed and fighting boss that take 10 minutes to drop with 4 lev 50s going full auto.I have never gotten so much out of $60 since Skyrim.This is a must have game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2012"}

It's a completely new chapter of the Onimusha legend, picking up 15 years after the original trilogy. Choose from 5 original playable characters as you embark on a new story, enshrouded in mystery and suspense. Stunning graphics, special effects and relentless, action-packed gameplay all combine to redefine this action epic.","reviewerName":"W. Scott Heitman","summary":"The Onimusha series finally blooms...","reviewText":"I've played through Onimusha 1&2.  I watched a friend beat the Onimusha 3.  They weren't bad games, but they weren't great either.  They seemed to lack some advances in the genre that had already been implemented by many other series.  Onimusha is the answer to all of these issues.  Dawn of Dreams is such a big improvement that I've been calling it \"Onimusha: Fixed\" among friends.The biggest aspect that has made the past Onimusha games seem archaic is the fixed camera.  It's the rare action game that can pull off a fixed camera these days.  Devil May Cry 3 and God of War manage to do so only because the depth of their combat systems means the player has little time to focus on a camera.  The onimushas have always been slower paced than these other 2 titles, so the fixed camera always felt claustrophobic- especially since backgrounds had a painted look rather than being rendered in 3d.  But that's in the past now; Dawn of Dreams features a fully controllable camera.  There are some places where the camera can't be manipulated, but these places are the exception rather than the rule, and they occur at places where camera use would be of little benefit.The first 3 Onimushas also played like a an action-rpg-lite.  Neither the action nor the rpg elements were terribly deep.  Beyond the challenge of pulling off countermoves, there wasn't much to do beyond mashing the square button constantly.  Sure, there were some minigames involving giving allies gifts, puzzle boxes, etc., but the meat of the gameplay could get stale after a while.  Here, too, Dawn of Dreams provides a solution.  On the action side, characters have a sizeable number of moves and special attacks...probably in the neighborhood of 15-20 different moves.  Oh, and did I say characterS?  Yeah, there are 5 playable characters.  In some games, that might mean 5 scoops of the same vanilla- not here.  The characters use roughly the same controls, but they play VERY differently.  I could try to describe this difference, but it's something that pretty much has to be experienced.  In addition, you typically use one character while another is fighting alongside you.  You can switch between these characters on the fly and issues commands to the character the computer is controlling.  This spices up the action a good bit.  So the action definitely works quite well.Then there's the improved rpg aspect.  In the other Onimushas, characters had 2-3 weapons that could be upgraded from time to time.  Dawn of Dreams allots 20-30 weapons to EACH character.  These weapons are all upgradeable and grant a variety of bonuses.  Also, the characters themselves level up.  Through leveling, the player can choose what skills to upgrade, which can unlock new moves.  Meanwhile, items can be combined to form accesories and weapons.  Taken together, the rpg aspects here are surprisingly satisfying.Dawn of Dreams is a LONG game for an actioner.  The main quest takes about 20 hours, and there's a lot of side stuff to do.  You can take characters to old levels to reach areas you couldn't get to with that character.  Most importantly, the Dark realm returns- and it's 100 levels long.  Plus, each character can find unique items in the realm.  To beat it all, you'd have to fight through 500 levels!  While this might have been tedious in past Onimusha games, the combat system is robust enough here that the dark realm is a blast.  I've already spent a good 6 hours (and quickly counting) on the dark realm alone.The other aspects of the game are well above par.  The soundtrack is enjoyable and the story is better than I would have expected.  Puzzle boxes return in slightly different form, but this is one part of the series I've always enjoyed, and this one continues that.  My only complaint is that the story could have felt truly EPIC had there been more cutscenes.  There ARE a lot of cutscenes, but much of the supporting story and character background is found only by reading unspoken dialog.  Furthermore, the large majority of the cutscenes are in-game engine.  I know pre-rendered stuff is expensive, but a game like this begs for beautiful cg treatment- the more, the better.  This should be taken as a very minor complaint, though- the story comes off quite well as is.Overall, Onimusha Dawn of Dreams is a gameplay tour de force that should please any action game fan.  Highly recommended","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2006"}

Smith \"Duster\"","summary":"Pokemon finally gets a facelift, and it looks darn good!","reviewText":"Like most people, I started back in the RED and BLUE days of Pokemon and each release after that has slowly become more of \"the same\" and I never bought anymore Pokemon games. After many years have passed I am now 22 years old and took an interest in these new Pokemon games after seeing the very sleek box art that seemed quite \"modern\" and updated to me. After seeing the updated graphics and noticing that the Pokemon all animate now made me want to buy this game because like I said, Pokemon has finally had a \"facelift.\"What can I say that you don't already know about Pokemon? Not much really, because I know if you are reading this then you know you probably want the game no matter what I say. I will tell you that as a gamer that may be \"too old\" for Pokemon this game is purely nostalgic. Just like popping RED or BLUE in your old fat brick of a gameboy all those years ago and not knowing whats going to happen. Every encounter with the wild Pokemon is a complete surprise just like it used to be. You have to learn all of the new Pokemon's elemental traits so you can build a great team capable of taking down a variety of different elemental types of Pokemon.And I hear that once you beat the main game, then the \"real\" game begins and you can catch every single Pokemon that has ever been created, so it will be really cool to see my old favorites in a new graphical style. Im not going to bother telling you about the story, because honestly I don't play these games for the story, I do it purely for the joy of discovering, catching, battling, and leveling up these little critters to watch them grow stronger and evolve. So if you are new to the Pokemon phenomenon or go all the way back to RED and BLUE days like me, rest assured you will fall in love for the first time or fall in love all over again as you start your journey to be the best Pokemon trainer you can be.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2011"}

It has great theme music and excellent graphics.  I really like how the levels were laid out in this game.  This game was very hard to me on the \"secret agent\" mode.  There were plenty of intense shootouts in this one.  I wanted to throw the towel in on levels 9 and 10.  I spent more than a week at least on both of those levels, lol.  The weapon selections were outstanding.  I didn't figure out toward the end that you could choose what combination of weapons you wanted for the begininng of each level. The reviews on Amazon gave this game somewhere in between a 3 and 4 rating, which I can understand.  I gave it a 4.5 out of 5.  The story isn't the greatest, but the intensity of the game makes up for it.  I am behind on games, so I can't compare it to a whole lot.  I popped in Halo 3 after this game, which I  like better due to the story. I will go back and play Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary when the price goes down.

I bought the Pulse Elite just because I didn't like the little 1 earplug headset that came with the PS4 and bluetooth is not added in yet. I was wearing the Pulse for about an hour before I went to turn the volume up and they started vibrating my head. I never knew they had this kind of bass technology for headphones.

I like games with action, but it would be great to try something new, and the Walking Dead is exactly what it is.

Playing as Spidey and being able to alternate between the classic and black costumes, you swing around New York City cracking heads and saving citizens, which is pretty much what we've been doing since Spider-Man 2.  However, what's different with Web of Shadows is that the game rarely becomes boring and the missions rarely become tedious to boot.  Also, the game's story is a surprising blast to play through.  The longer you play Web of Shadows, the more you'll get enthralled, particularly in its final acts where the symbiotes begin to wreak havoc.  The ability to (somewhat) choose your own path depending on your actions is a plus, and there's plenty of appearances from familiar faces on the sides of heroes and villains as well.  The only real flaws of Web of Shadows are technical ones.  There are some noticeable graphical glitches and sound hiccups, plus a few issues with the in-game camera.  Still, swinging around New York City has never been more fun or easy to do, and the game manages to stay entertaining from start to finish.

{"product_name":"B00000JRSB","reviewerName":"Anthony Peak","summary":"Still my favorite videogame of all time.","reviewText":"Whenever I'm asked what my favorite game of all time is, the answer is always rather clear: Final Fantasy VII. No game before it and no game since then has managed to pull me so deeply into the story and have me hanging on every word like this one did. The characters, the music, the graphics, the story... it's all golden.The characters are simply unforgettable. Cloud, Aeris, and Yuffie were my favorites of the bunch. Each character has such wonderful design, half realistic half cartoonish, full detailed backgrounds, and such personality and potential to develop that I enjoyed following everyone one of them.The music and graphics sticks in my mind like nothing else. They worked so well together. From simple cut scenes to the most glorious of FMV. And unlike today's games that throw long boring FMV in just for the sake of filling 2 DVDs, this game used FMV to make a point so poetically you couldn't help but feel like you just watched an epic film. To this day there's scenes that I cheer and nearly tear up over when I see them replayed. There were scenes that I would literally hold my breath through just in awe of not just the graphics... but the sound, the motion, the story unfolding so elegantly. Squaresoft has a knack for this, no doubt about it. This is the Lord of The Rings (film) of video games.I wish I could sit here and just ramble on and on about the beautiful story and the twists, turns, and major events, but obviously that would ruin it for any who still haven't played this masterpiece of a game. I see many, many people today who have never played a game like this and are simply enthralled by today's crop of PS2 RPG wanna-be's and it really irks me. They simply don't know what they've missed and 9 times of 10 simply don't care.I've probably played through this 30 some hour quest at least 3-5 times, and I enjoyed it every bit as much each time through. It may not have the 200 hours of today's games, but unlike today's games it's not freaking simulated boredom. It's 30 hours of FUN and story like you've never seen before.

Multiplayer options include deathmatch, saber-only deathmatch, and team capture the flag.","reviewerName":"Andrew C.","summary":"An elegant weapon for a more civilized day (4 1/2 stars)","reviewText":"This is the best Star Wars game I have played.  Except for a few missteps with level design and puzzles, this game is very engrossing.  The main story is about a jedi who has to rediscover his powers in order to deal with a dark jedi who is trying to take over the galaxy (I think).  It's a rather cliche tale, but one that works well in the Star Wars universe created in this game.Gameplay: I'll say this upfront--if this game did not include such excellent lightsabre combat and force powers, it would be a very average first-person shooter.  However, since the jedi abilities and signature weapon are showcased prominently throughout most of the game, Jedi Outcast stands above most games I've played.  Unlike the recent Star Wars movies (episodes I and II), where the lightsabre battles are great but there are not enough of them to save the movies from their mediocre scripts, Jedi Outcast really lives up to its goal of making the player feel like a jedi.  You'll have to get through the first five levels of the game in which you won't have your sabre or the force powers.  However, levels 6-24 are all about mastering the force and elegantly dismembering your opponents with some truly gorgeous swordplay.  I am not a big fan of shooter games, but I found this one fairly easy to learn.  There are a good variety of weapons, from laser rifles to bombs.  Nonetheless, you will probably be using the lightsabre most of the time, since it is so versatile.  The sword fights look very authentic and true to the Star Wars films.  You can switch between stances (strong, medium, or fast), deflect laser fire, throw your sabre, and use it in conjunction with force powers (like force grip and force push).  Even though you will probably find yourself frantically clicking the mouse and various keyboard bottons hoping that you can out-fence other jedi, the sabre fighting never looks awkward or mechanical, since the game finesses the motion of the lightsabre to make attacks look elegantly lethal.  I didn't intend to go on for so long about just the lightsabre aspect of the game, but I found this part to be very well implemented and entertaining all the way to the end.  The force powers are also well done, but you'll probably find yourself using only a few of the 8 available on a regular basis.  My favorites were force heal and force grip, but there are others like force speed, jump, pull, push, lightning, and mind trick.In addition to the lightsabres and force powers, the game includes a host of friendly and hostile individuals and creatures, including hordes of stormtroopers, a few species of aliens, a few dozen dark jedi (the best opponents), and a few familiar faces like Luke Skywalker and Lando Calrissian.  Generally well-done cut-scenes help advance the plot between levels.  Level design is good overall, but this game includes more than its fair share of places where you can get stuck looking for passages, switches, keys, and other things.  There are a lot of jumping sequences, several of which are tough.  I only had to use a walkthrough guide once to find a passageway in one of the early levels. However, in 45 hours of total gameplay, I spent at least 4-5 of those hours trying to figure out where various passages, doors, and switches were.  This will be frustrating to many gamers and is the main reason I can't give this game 5 stars.  Technically, the game is very stable, and I didn't experience a single crash or bug (which seems rare for games nowadays).Graphics: This is a very beautiful game.  Outdoor scenary is especially convincing, as is combat (particularly lightsabre duels).  Characters move realistically during the game, but they appear much stiffer and unpersuasive during cut-scenes.  The game looks like an authentic Star Wars world.Sound: No problems here.  All weapons sound like you would expect, from the sonic whiz of laser fire to the low humming of a lightsabre.  Ambience noises are appropriate where they appear, and the voice acting is good.  The familiar movie music greatly contributes to the Star Wars feel of the game.Overall, this game is a very good buy, especially at the current price.  It's engrossing, stable, and straightforward regarding controls.  Again, some people will be put off by some of the more tedious find-the-switch-door-passage-key-jump sequences which are generously sprinkled throughout the game.  However, if you can get pass these annoyances, Jedi Outcast is a real treat for Star Wars fans and others alike.Rating: 4.5 (out of 5 stars)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2004"}

Of course, I've never had to pay that, as I always buy my year of Live during sales (best score was a year for ~$25 after a coupon). If you know when to look, or where to look, and don't mind buying a year or two in advance, you really don't ever have to pay full retail.

I think of your reading this review and you can get these for under $125 then there are a must buy. In that price range these can't be beat. I've used a good amount of headphones for my PS3 and the sound great to me. I'm not an audiophile by any stretch and I don't really sound whore (using sound in a game to get a tactical advantage over your enemy) I does use headphones to keep my gaming private so the rest of my household doesn't have to listen to it.To me I think spending money on wireless headset is the way to go because I was fear pulling my console off-the-shelf because I forget my headphones are still on. And I like the freedom that comes from having wireless headphones and worth more of an investment over cabled headphones. Being able to get up and grab something from the fridge or go to the bathroom while still being able talk to your friends is a huge bonus. My brother has wired headphones to get up to go to the bathroom and the last I'll be will die starting a new round and he comes back and he's already been killed because we could warn him because his headphones were not. It's things like that that make me love wireless headphones (plus the fact that as a wheelchair user item rolling over the cables and ruining them somewhat faster).We had reiterated I think the sound of these is perfectly adequate and once they hit under $125 they will be the must-have affordable headphones for the PS3 and PS4.Thanks for reading!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002I0GX88","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"The game that really makes you feel like a superhero","reviewText":"The first Infamous game has been one of my favorite titles on the PS3 since I first got it.  Unlike most open world, \"sandbox\" style games that have come around this generation, Infamous wasn't so much about being able to interact with your environment, but more about how your environment can be used to make you feel like a complete badass.  Controlling Cole MacGrath, the main character of the series, was a revelatory experience.  There had never been another game where the most simple things, such as navigating from one place to another, was always an enjoyable experience.  Because Cole's evolving superpowers constantly enabled him to not only dispatch of his enemies quicker, but also gave him greater and more enjoyable freedom of movement, Infamous truly made you feel like you were a budding superhero slowly discovering your powers, and it was a thrilling experience.  The game wasn't without it flaws.  Empire City, the setting, wasn't the most stimulating environment to play around in, and there were a few issues with some finicky controls.Infamous 2, like its PS3 contemporary Uncharted 2, takes everything that was wrong with the first game and fixes it, while at the same time adds an entire set of game mechanics that works only for the better.  In Infamous 2, Cole leaves a destroyed Empire City for the southern port city of New Marais, modeled after real life New Orleans.  This environment, complete with its French Quarter, old cemeteries, outlying swamps, and massive cathedrals, is colorful, vivid, and a significantly more stimulating and enjoyable game world than Empire City was.  To my surprise, there was even a \"flood district\" a section of New Marais that was flooded and serves as an ode to real life Hurricane Katrina and its victims.  These sections of the game are handled with a perfect balance of sensitivity and smart political commentary.To complement this new environment, Cole MacGrath is given a wide range of new abilities, the most notable being a new and improved melee system that is so brutally satisfying, that it will have you trying to get in close to your enemies as much as possible to give them a good beat down with your cattle prod-esque electrical melee weapon known as the Amp.  The good/bad karma system returns, but is given a layer of depth by introducing two characters you can side with, one using ice weaponry, while the other uses fire.  As Cole moves towards good or evil karma, he is granted either ice or fire powers to augment his electricity, and the result is a new set of moves that not only add to Cole's offense, but also his ability to navigate the city.  The ability to rotate between different types of powers is also introduced, and encourages experimentation for the player to find an optimal set that suits his/her gaming style.  Overall, this is mechanically a much deeper game than the first, and the game is better off for it.And thankfully, Sucker Punch kept the same near-perfect control scheme from the first game that really is the centerpiece of what makes the Infamous series so great, while adding some small fixes.  Climbing up and down buildings isn't as twitchy as it was in the first game, and combat is even more satisfying that it already was, thanks to the aforementioned additions to Cole's offensive arsenal.  Even more so than Rocksteady's excellent Batman Arkham games, Infamous 2 really nails the feeling of letting the player take control of a truly powerful superhero.  Where as in the first game, you were gaining superpowers for the first time and experiencing the origin story, in Infamous 2 you take control of an already powerful , angry Cole MacGrath, and evolve him to the next level of superhero.  Infamous 2 is one of the most satisfying, purely enjoyable action game experiences of this console generation, and has cemented the Infamous series as my favorite PS3-exclusive franchise to debut on the console.  It surpasses the already-excellent first game in pretty much every dept. and is a must own game for anyone with a PS3.  I hope that Sucker Punch comes back to this franchise when the PS4 finally rolls around, as they've created one of the best controlling, most thrilling, and most enjoyable franchises in gaming today.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2012"}

A must have.","reviewText":"I don't think there is much I would change about this game. It improves upon the oblivion engine, and the story and environment are great. I did not play any of the previous fallout games, though I was familiar with them. There is plenty of side questing and exploring to do in this, and I thought the difficulty was just right. You could probably beat the game fairly quickly if you just followed the story quests, so I'd recommend exploring and completing the side quests. The VATS system offers a nice variety of FPS play and RPG play (as well as great cut scenes, you'll see what I mean when you play it). I haven't played any of the expansions, because personally I feel that there is enough game play here to warrant more than one play through (similar to oblivion). I would recommend this game to gamers of all types.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0038TT8QM","description":"","reviewerName":"genocidal_maniac","summary":"Half-baked improvements not very well thought out","reviewText":"The biggest problem for the civilization franchise is bloat.The early game is okay enough. you start with a few cities and a few units.The problem is that as time goes on, you gain more cities and more units.Before long, each turn takes half an hour. Your computer bogs down. the game forces you to watch every minor battle between ai forces. You have to provide commands for like 40 units. To take a city you need to move like 30 units.It becomes a huge drag.Civ V implements an ingenious solution: 1 unit, 1 tile. This is pretty smart. It makes smart placement more important than sheer numbers.But it isn't very well thought out.For one thing, there is no unit cap at all in the game. So you still get an advantage by pumping out units as opposed to finesse. And despite the best positioning, sheer numbers will still win.At its worst, then you have to move numerous troops around with a 1u1t system that just makes it cumbersome.The economic system has been tweaked again to reward smart city management as opposed to quantity of cities. This is done a little better. It does seem to gimp one of the tech trees though, liberty, since I've found that 3-4 cities is the most that can be had early game before running into unhappiness/gold loss.unhappiness by the way is your limit on power. If you experience unhappiness, your cities stop growing. At 10 unhappiness, your units lose 30% combat effectiveness.More cities and more citizens are more unhappy. To satisfy them, you need luxuries, buildings, and wonders. Luxuries are geographically isolated to certain areas, buildings and wonders take time to build.The roads system is much better. Previously, civ games incentivized you to build roads on every single tile. It was stupid. Here, roads cost 1 gold in maintinence, so you build them judiciously.The city-state is a good addition, but they are overpowered in my opinion. You gain substantial benefits from allying with them for a relatively low cost.The biggest problem with Civ though is that despite their best efforts, they haven't really fixed the late-game problem. Most civ games actually result in you winning like 66% of the way through and then the rest of the game is waiting for the win to happen. This is quite tedious.The addiction to these games really is a result of the mind trying to figure out the optimal formula for growth. So you might try to build a settler early, or improve this resource first, and so on, until you find a winning formula.and then you watch the formula unfold over several hours.Really, there is a better way to sate this \"itch.\"they're called RTS games. They are on a whole better balanced and less tedious. They are better thought out on a whole and more interesting. You play against humans who devise clever strategies against you. They do not bog down like civ does, and are a whole lot easier to control. Stick a fork in the series and teh genre on a whole. It's just not worth it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2012"}

Fight in tanks, jeeps, motorcycles, even a bomber.","reviewerName":"Rex Marksmanson \"HEYO!\"","summary":"An amazing predecessor to the original","reviewText":"As I stated in an earlier review \"Call Of Duty\" is one of the best First Person Shooters I have ever played, and the unquestioned best in the World War II sub-genre of FPS's.  So you could imagine my excitement when \"United Offensive\" was announced, a 13 mission single player expansion with revamped multiplayer features.  I was sure to pick it up the day it came out, and I haven't stopped playing it since.Let's start with the single player missions.  Right off the bat it's clear this expansion's campaign was intended for those who played through the original and were looking for a more prominent challenge.  Since I hate it when people reveal later missions in the game I wont tell you what to expect later on, I can however tell you this.  In the first mission you find yourself on patrol with members of the American 101st Airborne in the woods of Bastogne.  Bam, out of nowehre you're suddenly caught in the middle of a relentless German push foward, for those of you who may not be World War II buffs this is part of the infamous Battle Of The Bulge.All of the original elements of the inthralling single player from the first one are still here, the AI still responds well, both enemy and friendly.  You'll without a doubt find yourself barking out orders to your comrades as if they were standing right next to you, and your heart will race as you charge enemy positions in a bloody attempt to secure strategical areas.  As with the original you play through three campaigns as the Americans, British and Russian forces in different theaters of operation.  You may have seen previews in which you take control of a gun turret during a British bombing mission over Holand.  I can tell you now, this is without a doubt one of the most intense moments of the game, and it provides a nice break from the squad based infantry combat.  You'll also get to drive tanks in several missions as in the original, all of these missions are equally amazing as well, but as I promised I will reveal no more, you must find out for yourself.Now to confront the issue of the completly revamped multiplay.  I've been an online gamer for years, I've played everything from Warcraft II to mostly all of the Half Life modifications.  The original Call Of Duty's multiplayer was fun at best, but didn't provide a lasting quality, it was something you played every once and a while.  United Offensive is a much, much different story.  For starters the developers made better levels, complete with jeeps and tanks at your disposal.  This alone is amazing, I can't tell you how much fun I've playing with others in the short time this game has been out.  Nothing beats a tank push with 4 or 5 of your teammates, while the rest of the team advances on the flanks with jeeps and infantry.  All of the games new weapons, including the Flamethrower, are available for use, and this time around you can put the Bazooka to good use against an advancing enemy Panzer.  For those of you concerned about balancing issues fear not, the game is easy enough for new players (noobs) to pick up and provides enough of challenge for veterans to more than enjoy.  One of the key features is the ability to call in an airstrike on an enemy position with your binoculars, though to do this you must achieve a certain high score and also be one of the highest ranked members on your team.  Another great addition is new modes of gameplay such as base defense and capture the flag, both multiplayer classics now brought to the COD universe.  To call the multiplay for this game an improvement from the last would be an understatement, it almost feels like a different game.To sum it up the Call Of Duty team has done it again, and then some.  This expansion more than satisfied my hunger for a great expansion to an amazing game.  Keep your fingers crossed that this trend will be kept up because if it is we're looking at even more dropping games...no, no, even more jaw dropping experiences in the future.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2004"}

Is it the total concept of game, film, manga, and TV series?  Or one fourth of a game?  Or any of the above. The reason this is particularly perplexing is that of all of the above, the game it the only thing that falls a bit short of expectations.  It isn't at all bad, just 'ordinary.'While formed from the interesting concept of a virtual gaming world gone psychotic, what .hack//Infection really is a dungeon based adventure game comprised of hack-and-slash travels through levels to get treasure.  The classic RPG with a bit of a twist, it starts when Kite, a new player, is introduced to 'The World' by his friend Orca.  On their first outing to a dungeon, Orca is attacked by a mutated monster and permanently loses consciousness.  It is up to Kite, and the friends he makes to try to find out what is really going on.Script is pretty minimal, especially when compared to the story lines of FFX or Suikoden III.  Essentially, e-mails or board postings trigger events and supply the code names of playing fields and dungeons.  Kite assembles a team of three and goes to each location for information.  A fair amount of time is spent leveling up in order to be strong enough to accomplish the next task.  To facilitate this, the player can compose his own keywords or even have a playing field generated for him at random.  There is room for considerable variation, but the fields aren't really all that imaginative.Despite a pretty face, the game engine is dated, and the game interface is a bit inconsistent.  The same key doesn't always to the same thing.  And it can take a lot of controller actions to run a real time battle.  All in all, the game is entertaining, but not compelling.  Character design is excellent though.  Hopefully, future parts will extend playing capabilities.The accompanying film DVD is called .hack//Liminality (volume 1).  It is the story of Mai Minase, whose boyfriend is demonstrating 'The World' to her when they are attacked.  He too loses consciousness for the duration.  She meets Junichiro Tokuoka, who seems to have had something to do with the game originally, and is now investigating why people are permanently losing consciousness when they play.  I wish I could take more time in this review to discuss this DVD, because it is excellent.  An interesting plot, nicely drawn with interesting characters.  I can see buying the games just to get the film DVD's.Overall, the game is the weakest part of the .hack package.  But I don't want to give the impression that it is bad.  It simply doesn't live up to the overwhelming hype so far.  I found it quite playable as a traditional dungeons oriented game.  With three more chapters to go this could change in a flash, and I am too curious not to continue.  I think you will find this true for yourself as well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00008Z0HX","reviewerName":"Jim Bettis","summary":"Refreshing Cartoon-Style game that's worth the money!","reviewText":"I bought this game because of reviews I read on here. I was delighted to find it very entertaining. The latter levels near the end are a bit frustrating as you have to kill the bad guys and they are very hard to kill, while you aren't... But, it was still a lot of fun once I figured out how to play the game. The only real drawback I see in this game is the saves. You can quick save or save the game at any point. But, when you try to load the game, you always start at the beginning of the level and have to work your way back up to the spot you saved at. That can be a bit annoying... Still, I'd recommend this game to gamers. I LOVE FPS and this one was interesting and the cartoon art was excellent. The saves annoyed me because I tried to save after certain lengthy cut-scenes only to learn that the save was essentially worthless. I had to go through it all over again... I look forward to the follow-up to this game. I think most gamers would like this game... If it hadn't been for the flawe in the save game, I would've given this 5 stars...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2004"}

Keegan \"Keegs\"","summary":"Completely Epic from beginning to end!","reviewText":"This game is mind blowing. People who love action titles and some pretty clever puzzle solving will love this game! The game starts off an a huge high note with your first god encounter while on a huge sprawling titan that is climbing up a mountain. It is the biggest video game character I recall seeing in a game and it makes Kratos look like an ant.As for the gameplay, top notch in every measure. All the new moves play a huge roll in fleshing things out. The controls are as accurate as they can be. The gameplay is nearly the same with chaining combos but new weapons such as the ceberus gauntlets are fun to use. I won't go in any further detail on it. How you get weapons and certain items is pretty cool and crazy. The bosses you fight are designed very nice and the strategy to beat them are cool and each one very unique. It retains the same level up system via weapon upgrades through souls and the same feathers, eyes, and such to grow your health, magic, and item meter.The graphics are a sight to behold. Everything is scaled to huge measures. If you thought Uncharted 2 looked good, this game exceeds it! Everything from destroyed backdrops, beautiful animation, and such will have you in awe. The camera zooms and moves around better than most any movie. With that said, the voices are well done as well.Now I can go on and on but I shouldn't have to. This game is great from beginning to end. Even the very end is pretty climatic and the shocking end result of Kratos. Even after you beat it you will gain items to use on a second playthrough and their are challenges you can do. This is a must buy and will be one of the best games of the year. This game is an example of why the word epic exists!Note, as for the ultimate edition. I don't highly recommend it. Its cool but besides the pandora's box, there is only a small art book. The rest is downloadable stuff such as costumes, soundtrack, and such. For such an amazing game, they could have done more.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2010"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Elmo","summary":"Something Different","reviewText":"I have not played the first FEAR, but overall the game is pretty good.- Graphics are amazing on the PS3- Storyline is interesting- Voice overs match the character- Gameplay is smooth, transitions well from one level to the next","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2014"}

A follow up to the 2004 hitRed Dead Revolver, this game tells the story of former outlaw John Marston, taking players on a great adventure across the American frontier.","reviewerName":"Shaide","summary":"Wild Rom, wild west style","reviewText":"It's a wild romp through the final days of the western frontier.The game follows John Marston, a retired outlaw, Reluctant bounty hunter and wannabe rancher as he travels through New Austin and Mexico hunting down his former gang members. His travels take him to some diverse locations and in contact with some colorful characters.While in the game you will NEED money, for ammo as well as items that could prove useful, such as a bandanna to hide your identity or a bandolier to increase your ammo carry size. Luckily for you there are numberous ways to earn money in this game. You can hunt bounties, do ranch work, skin animals and sell the skins at the general store or of course rob people.The controls take a few minutes to get used to, especially on horseback, but once you are used to it, and comfortable with it you will love it!Some reviewers will say \"This game is basically grand theft auto IV, but set in the wild west.\"  Those people would also be wrong. Yes, there are similarities, This is true. That's to be expected considering it uses the same game engine. However the differences are multiple! For one thing, it uses a health system similar to the newer call of duty games. It also has a moral system to determine if you are a bad guy or a good guy. There's obviously no radio stations. It has the Dead Eye feature which basically is slow-mo while you take aim and  target multiple enemies. Lastly they employ an improved duck and cover combat feature, so you can shield yourself behind objects in the environment and poke out to fire off a few shots before returning to cover.Those are just a few MINOR differences. If anything, I would say the game is a cross between Fallout 3, GTAIV and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. The game takes all the best features and aspects of those 3 titles and blends them together really well to come out with this masterpiece.Another thing you might be interested in knowing is that the game is a sequel to another game titled \"Red Dead Revolver\". However, if you haven't played it, don't fret! Redemption is not a DIRECT sequel, more like a spiritual one. The stories don't really connect, so you don't have to worry about being lost in a plotline, or scratching your head in confusion, because an event being referred to is from a different game.Apart from being an incredible single player experience, it also has an Online multi-player feature. Most games either shine in their single player campaign or the multi-player aspect. Very few game titles manage to provide an enjoyable experience in both fields. However, Red Dead Redemption has managed just that.Bottom line: The game is visually stunning, with a fun story that will leave you begging for more! If you love sandbox games, shooters or Role-playing games you will no doubt love this game.Here's a tip for you though. If you think you have beaten this game, there's a chance you might not have REALLY beaten it. There's a point in the game, that really seems like the end but isn't really. To avoid any spoilers, just remember this: Most games have credits when they end. Red Dead Redemption is no different! If you haven't gotten the credits, then you haven't finished the game.So, if you are one of those people who didn't actually finish the game like you might have thought, and now just discovered that there's more of an ending than you actually experienced, and are now wondering how you access that bad-boy? The answer is quite simple really. Just do the stranger missions!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2010"}

I mean dont get me wrong; the new zones are beautiful, Huge, and are fun to quest in but unlike the previous expansion Wrath of the lich king, the quest mechanics seems to have taken a step back just like the new pvp battlegrounds (which i will discuss later). In Wrath it felt like the quest mechanics evolved as you had lots of vehicles and controlling some mob to get the quests done which was a welcome change of almost always and forever taking your sword or spells and killing mobs one-on-one. In Catacylsm these vehicles quests have been reduced greatly which felt like de-evolution to me.The same can be said for the two new pvp battle-grounds Twin Peaks and Battle of Gilneas. Instead of feeling 'new' and 'evolved' they are just re-done smaller maps of the orginal battlegrounds Warsong Gulch and Arathi basin. The open pvp zone Tol Barad as of now is poorly designed and is getting lots of negative comments on the forums. Pretty much if you are the attacker you can forget winning as the attackers have to capture and hold all basses while the defenders have to just hold one to win. So you can see how this can be huge issue for the side which is attacking and hopefully blizz will adjust this zone but as of now Tol Barad is just a pain for attackers. That being said still the new zones and quest-lines are story oriented and are fun as evident by the fact that I got my lvl 80 DK to lvl 85 already and is now in semi-retirement.In all if you are into leveling alts to re-expirience the orginal re-done world than this is a great expansion to relive the magic all over again. The orginal zones were just untouchable to me as I had quested in them God knows how many times before. However. for now I am having 'fun' again leveling two alts now and intend to get them to lvl 85 but unless the end-game becomes friendly to casual people like me; I plan to leave until the next expansion. Lots of time for Blizz to evaluate and adjust game mechanics though if past is of any bearing there end-game model doesnt change much; which is repeating dailies until boredom sets in, endless raiding, Arenas or rated battle-grounds to get any worthwhile gear.This is the reason I gave the game a 4 star overall rating even though I felt giving it a 3-star rating but my years & years of fun as well as enjoyment in playing the game through has also to factor in there somewhere. Though a great game till you reach end-game but once you reach lvl 85 than the game is over for people like me as based on my work/university I cannot set time for rading or doing rated battle-grounds to gear up which means that as time passes I become target practice for people who pvp at end-game. Ofcourse the regular battle-grounds still gives gear but that gear is always a season or two behind what people can get by arenas, rated battle-ground or raiding and you can never get any pvp weapons from regular honor rewards which pretty much means you have to buy ridiculously priced, older and still just average crafted weapons from auction house. This in my view leaves a huge gap between people who are into casual gameplay with limited time or days to play vs people who can log in daily with set times for raiding or arenas or rated battlgrounds.So in summary, if you are like me who likes leveling alts and enjoys pvp 'UNTIL lvl 85' than the game is good for you. However if you are casual player than be warry as this game really doesn't caters to casuals anymore at end-game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005ULXN","reviewerName":"jmpg","summary":"A memorable 10th Anniversary for Sonic","reviewText":"While this Gamecube installment is popular in its own right, I think it's more appropriate to begin with this game's TRUE source. Sega Dreamcast 2001: the 10th birthday of the little blue hero, Sonic. Sega needed an accompanying game that would cap off a decade for their flagship mascot. SONIC ADVENTURE 2, while not flawless, was still a title that left other games in the dust that same year.Whereas Nintendo EAD focuses their game development on depth and imagination, Sonic Team's main focus on games is getting into the heart of the action. That comes into full circle with this title. Sonic Adventure 2 is chock full of bursting energy, a game that's a pyrotechnical display of volley-inducing frenzy. The level design put into the courses is excellent, and showcases Sonic Team's action-oriented ingenuity at its best. Go play dynamic levels such as &quot;Green Forest&quot;, &quot;Radical Highway&quot;, &quot;Crazy Gadget&quot;, and &quot;Final Rush&quot;. Never before has Sonic Team combined exertion and structure so well in a Sonic game. The graphics are mesmerizing, even at break-neck speed. Bright, sharp, and ready to pounce your eyeballs. A technical improvement over the first Sonic Adventure, and one of the great final showcases for the Dreamcast's visual power.The music of the Sonic Adventure series is very overlooked. Platform game music continues its redundancy while Sega energizes it. Jun Senoue and other members of the Wavemaster team created a new image for the Sonic franchise with a bright sound that has inventive pop hooks and melodic rock-rooted riffery. They transcend all styles appropriately as well, from Jazz to HipHop to Big Band. It's like a big music carnival. The two Sonic Adventure soundtracks show the platform world that music is still a vibe among the genre.Sonic Adventure 2 still has standout flaws, so the fun factor gets 4 stars. There were no big leaps in improving the camera at all from the first Sonic Adventure, and the story mode is lacking compared to its predecessor. As for this Gamecube installment, the 4-star rating is even more appropriate. While there are extras, the &quot;Battle&quot; feature seems unnecessary and is more of a tack-on to &quot;update&quot; the game and its name. And most of all, this classic Dreamcast Sonic game just does not feel right on a Nintendo system. While the GC version is not bad by any stretch, be a part of history and try to get the original game for Dreamcast, if possible.SONIC ADVENTURE 2, in its true purest form, is a videogame for gamers. You can go about your corporate PS2 and XBox, or your online escapades on your beefed-up PC. However, nothing really beats the heart of a classic series' pinnacle whose only sole purpose was for you to have a blast.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-28-2004"}

It was a very fun game, and at the price it's listed now is an incredible bargain.I started off thinking I wanted to play a mage, since I usually prefer mages/sorcerers in my RPG's.  I did some experimenting and fell in love with the Finesse type character in this game (kind of a combination of a Ranger and an Assassin).  I found out I loved playing stealth style, with daggers, poison, and longbows.  I ended up maxxing out in strictly Finesse and never straying.  Which means that I will probably play it again after a while as a pure mage, since I'm still a fan of mages.Strengths of the game:- Gorgeous graphics- Intense action fights, but not difficult to master combat style at all- Great music and voice acting- Huge game with many many sidequests if you want to pursue them all (as I did)- An abundance of loot- Ability to craft your own weapons and armor and give them whatever name you want (which is surprisingly cool)- Save any time and any where you want to- Very forgiving system (if you regret a choice of ability points, you can visit a Fateweaver and change them)Potential negatives of the game (depends on your perspective):- Single player game, you are pretty much on your own (although it makes it satisfying to dominate that way)- On Normal difficulty setting, balance is good until late game, when you get super powerful and can crush enemies easilyYou can always change the difficulty level and make it harder if you want.  For the first part of the game, getting killed was a real possibility.  By the end, I was Superman.  YMMV.This is a well-polished, super well-done fantastic RPG action game that is huge and has fantastic combat.  It doesn't have the drama of some games with more intercharacter dialogue and interaction, but you may not care because it looks so fantastic and combat is so satisfying.

There are probably not a whole lot of people out there that would argue that fact.  However, there are probably a great deal of people out there wondering if they should get this if they already bought AA.  Simply put.......no.In a nutshell, the plot is simply \"Joker takes over Arkham Asylum and releases all sorts of baddies.  Batman tries to stop him.\"  The game hasn't changed much since it first came out and if you enjoyed AA almost a year ago, you can expect the exact same game this time around.  Nothing has really been revamped, altered, or changed up.  However, the biggest surprise for me was how well done the 3-D is.  While the glasses are little more than cardboard blue and reds from the past, somehow Darkworks/TrioViz managed to avoid the tinting that those glasses used to give.  It's still there a little bit, but at least the image isn't in blues, reds, and purples the whole time.  You can actually notice various shades.  Once your eyes relax, the image is clean and clear with very little in the realm of headaches or eyestrain.  However, it doesn't hurt to pause or stop every once in a while, take off the glasses, and give your eyes a rest.  Instead of being \"popping\" 3-D, it is more of a \"passive\" 3-D effect.  To clarify: In so many 3-D experiences the image comes out at you as if it might hit you, this 3-D effect is more like the TV is simply a window and the depth starts from the screen's edge.  Don't expect to try and dodge cheesy \"in your face\" moments.  There is depth, but it far more subtle.  For the gamers out there who wear glasses, fear not.  The 3-D specs still fit over glasses, although I am sure it looks about as cool paisley polyester tracksuits.  The passive 3-D has one big perk though, your friends can watch you play without the glasses and the 3-D \"double exposure\" look is minimal to non-existant.  However, for all its style, it still feels gimmicky.  Sure, it's cool, but I probably won't be playing through more than once with it turned on.The extra challenge maps are nice, but since anyone can download them for an extra 7 bucks...  Well, it doesn't really justify the price for older owners.  For those unfamiliar, the extra maps are \"Dem Bones\" (Scarecrow Challenge maps) and \"Crime Alley\" (um....do I really need to explain that one?).  The \"Play as the Joker\" maps are there as well.  Pretty much everything you could have added over the last few months is there on one disk.If you have been a holdout for Batman: Arkham Asylum, then this is well worth the price for the added 3-D and all challenge maps up to this point.  You should be buying this immediately.  For those people out there, this is a 5 star package.  For anyone who already owns/owned Arkham Asylum, then this product should probably be passed up.  Unless you feel like you MUST have the 3-D, spend the extra money and buy \"Dem Bones\" and \"Crime Alley\" off the PSN/XBL and save the rest forBatman Arkham Asylum 2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001UWGCW2","description":"Singularityis a first-person shooter developed by the legendary Raven Software and utilizing the power and flexibility of the Unreal 3 game engine.

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.PlayStation Network support including PlayStation Trophies.","reviewerName":"R.

{"product_name":"B00D96BMV8","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Fulkerson","summary":"Acceptable for the price","reviewText":"As of June 2014, this is probably the best all around pair of Xbox One headphones you can buy for the sound and price.  For 80 bucks you can't do much better, however, if you're at all picky about comfort with your headphones you'll need to think twice, and even three times, before you purchase these.Turtle Beach always performs above average when it comes to sound, and these are very good in that area.  The highs are clear, the lows are booming, and voices sound decent.  The microphone works just fine, and I was able to speak and be heard clearly.A big issue I always have with 21st century video game headphones is that they are still wired.  These headphones are sort of wired, with the headphones themselves plugging in to the controller itself which then sends a signal to the system.  Still wired, but nowhere near as cumbersome, so this is a very good sign for those who enjoy gaming with headphones.The other big sell point for me is comfort.  These headphones flat out stink in that department.  I wore these during a recent video gaming session and had to take them off after about 20 minutes.  That's not long for the serious gamer.  From what I can tell, the XO Sevens have foam padding and a more comfortable wearing experience for about 60 dollars more, and quite frankly, I'd pay the extra money for the comfort.  A decent sounding pair of headphones are rendered useless if they hurt to wear, and Turtle Beach really failed with the physical design of the headband with these phones.All in all, a good sounding pair of gaming headphones for the price, but WEAR these before you buy.  They really are that uncomfortable.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2014"}

Only not really.  Truth be told, I could never get into the series from day one because of the clunky controls.  I appreciated the step in the right direction with the original Tomb Raider but I regard it as a catalyst for what third person games are now as opposed to a great game.  The following games all had the same controls, but the gameplay devolved into the horrific Angel of Darkness.Now, we have Tomb Raider: Legends and man is it nice.  Having passed reigns to Crystal Dynamics, the creators of such games as Legacy of Kain and Soul Reaver, the gameplay was scrapped to create an entirely new property that, mostly, washes off any malingering stink.  In place of controls that are based on a grid system (creating improper jumping controls among other issues), the new movement feels fluid and is easily manipulated much like the new Prince of Persia games.Action takes the side seat as the game focuses mostly on Lara and tombs (what a novel concept).  When action does take place, Lara can easily lock onto a target and then switch from target to target via flicking the right analog stick.  It's pretty simplistic, but it is fun and easy to get into.  Sometimes, there are context driven situations where instead of shooting at an enemy, a possibility will open to shoot an exploding can or a precariously balanced ruin that will take out multiple foes.  While the gunplay isn't difficult, it does create some scenarios that feel like they would fit in perfectly in an action movie.The action is also broken up with some motorcycle based missions.  These mostly involve getting you from point A to point B, with plenty of chasing enemies in the middle.  Again, much like the combat, this isn't the focus of the game.  I won't go so far as some reviewers to say its needless, filler and poorly implemented, but I do think it could have been strengthened a bit more.  It makes sense, in the context of the game, to be driving.  It never feels tacked on.  However, if you're going to do it, you might as well make it as exciting as possible.All of this is dressing for what really counts: the Tombs.  They are really fun.  Figuring out how to get from point A to point C, with a step at point B, is most of the fun much like it is in Prince of Persia.  The game touts \"physics based puzzles\" and it's true.  But, I don't think the physics engine is all it's cracked up to be.  A lot of times, items don't feel like they have the weight they should.A story involving Lara's past and a search for a sword rounds out the action, providing a context for what you're doing.  It's pretty decent as far as these games go and of course can't live up to excellent stories like those found in Dreamfall, but it's okay.As far as value goes, you're spending about $60 for about 10 hours of gameplay.  That's a problem in my book, not because of the length (although I do prefer longer games), but because of the HUGE price differences between the systems.  If you're looking at just consoles, then yes I would recommend shelling the extra $10 for the 360 version over the others.  But, Xbox 360 games are costing us $10s more, blah blah HD age/next gen blah blah, but the game looks better on the PC, has better resolutions and doesn't have as much frame rate issues as the Xbox 360 version.  And its $20 cheaper.  So, if you have a computer top lay it, plug in a Xbox 360 controller into your PC and you have a game that's cheaper, plays just as well and looks better.  You tell me what the best deal is.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2006"}

Since its release there has been a graphical update to the game which will download as long as your xbox is connected to the internet. The game still looks great even compared to todays games and the sound is quite good also.The best thing about this game is the variety of things you can do. There is a main quest that you can jump into, but you aren't required to. You can choose to search through the towns for quest to participate in or just search the world of oblivion for items. Character customization is very in depth allowing you to create a very personalized character suited for the way you like to play. The quest are fun and varied and allow you to solve them in different ways most of the time.There are a few qualms I have with this game. One is that many of the main characters have the same voice. Another thing is that sometimes quests can get repetitive, but if you get sick of your current quest you can always just find another one. The game can also be a little glitchy in some places. For example, if you just of certain cliffs you can get stuck between rocks and be unable to move, forcing you to reload your game (fortunately you can save anywhere). Load times can also be a problem if you're of the impatient type. Overall, the good of this game overcomes any these issues.This is a game where you could easily throw lots of time into because of the huge ammount of possibilities. If you just follow the main quest the game could be beat relatively quickly, about 20 hours, but then you would miss out on a lot of fun of the game. If you've missed out on this game until now find a copy and pick it up. Its a good game that just about anyone can enjoy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2007"}

{"product_name":"B0000A09EP","description":"Join Mario and Luigi as they team up in a strange new land for an action-packed quest to retrieve Princess Peach's stolen voice.","reviewerName":"Sixto Limiac","summary":"Greatest GBA Game Yet","reviewText":"One word can actually encapsulate the overall execution of Mario and Luigi: Superstar Sage.  I hold the word with a dreamlike tone and utter, \"WOW.\"  With slobber and saliva dripping all over my gaming bib and onto my small GBA screen, I know gaming buffs around the world have rejoiced.  After the aged magic that was Super Mario RPG on the beloved SNES and Paper Mario on the N64, Nintendo resurrects the gaming legend once again.  Mario is known to travel in all types of gaming, from Mario Tennis to his true roots of platforming, but as far as his RPG entries are concerned, he never ceased to leave mouths hanging.  His third RPG graces the GBA and I couldn't be more happier since it proves to astound and innovate.  I find it, in every aspect, a rewarding treasure that is much needed in the overpopulated gaming stream.Sometimes the gaming audience needs to take a refreshing break from hammering their wrath on the bad guy attempting to raze the world.  Sometimes gamers need to release tension whether it'd be a hectic job or schedule, and play a lightly driven, amusing game.  And that's where this great RPG glows.  Offering a screwball plotline, this RPG is a refreshing way to start packing up for another multi-hour adventure.  The vile emperor Cackletta has left Princess Peach as a destructive siren, and the notorious Bowser will not grab her until she is cured.  Bower decides to aid Mario and Luigi and treat her, and once that is done, Bowser will fulfill his only purpose in his existence, which is to kidnap the Princess.  So what if the plot is not nerve-busting, the sense of humor welcomingly emanates to fill such a void.  There are a plethora of jokes that mock the Mario franchise itself.  I cracked at the inability of the locales who knew nothing of Luigi, but only the heroics of Mario.  Unlike tons of RPGs, your journey will not be impeded by a mass of dialogue, and when there is some you'll be wanting to read and listen to it develop.The gameplay is so solidly done that it is simply impossible to put the game down.  Many whine that the RPG genre has nothing new under the sun, but this game will make you more than eager to watch the RPG evolution, despite all the common transgressions.  The end results of the game is extraordinary, especially the hallmark gameplay.A hybrid of 2D Zelda on crack and traditional RPG battles, the game grinds both elements into an exquisite twist.  What makes it so different are the options bestowed before the player, both on the battle menu and while navigating dungeon play.  Battle menu aside, Mario and Luigi offers a unique gameplay experience that is extremely inventive.  Both brothers stay together, and each are able to be controlled.  They start off with simple actions, and as the player progresses through the game, both brothers develop abilities to use on  the environment.  Their moves vary, which in turn, access new areas in Beanbean Kingdom.  Each special move is hilarious in its own right, my favorite has to be Mario lighting Luigi's butt on fire, Luigi then rams his way through breakable things in the environment.  The creativity and hilarity booming in the game makes for an extremely hearty experience.The battle engine is wonderfully done.  Borrowing the idea from Super Mario RPG, the GBA installment also has the player timing his button pressing.  If done successfully, the heroes will dodge and counterattack enemy attacks.  With the ordinary choices like item on the menu, the real innovation lies with the single and Bros. attack.  Single attacking allows the player to jump and use an assortment of strikes, while Bros give way to a collective combo.  While leveling up my team, I felt nostalgia encroach upon me.  It enkindled both the Super Mario universe and the incredible reality that Mario is in again, in terrific RPG format.  There are also other elements in the gameplay that make this RPG worth the time, such as the novel power of moustaches!The atmosphere is velvety rich.  Closely matching the graphical nature of Yoshi's Island, another great game for the GBA, the screen is a fine lure into the Mario world.  The vibrant sprites of each character augment the gameplay and experience.  The cast of characters will summon back memories from past Mario games and not to mention new characters alike.  Animation is splendidly brimming with GBA quality all over it.  The environments which mirror all the regions that we've come to know on earth is layered exceedingly well on screen.  Helping to define the mood are the highly notable tunes.  Original nits and bits of classic sounds are back, remixed, and thrown with new catchy whiffs.  Its really surprising to listen to the variety of songs throughout the game.  As a double plus (newspeak), the cast uses their quirks and signature sounds.Do your gaming life a favor, remove yourself form the clich&eacute; of gaming titles and disappointments of this year, and get Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga.  Packing in appealing visuals, sound, and a variety of brilliant gameplay, an RPG hasn't felt this good for quite some time.  I'm particularly tired of graphical de force games that struggle to mirror Hollywood, especially the RPG genre.  It is a sure, safe bet to grab another game starring Mario, the one who probably started your gaming addiction altogether.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2003"}

So if it's a parent with a child, they can team up together and help each other out.Yes, there's single player, but to be honest it's multiplayer that is really a lot of fun. If anything single player is the way to train up your skills so that you can be good at multiplayer. With the online component so you can play with friends around the world, there's little excuse not to have some friendly team-based action!The only real downside is that to unlock new characters and karts you MUST play single player. Why?? Why not have it be something you can do in single or multi-player? I really love playing this with others and just don't enjoy playing it alone. It seems like a chore / grinding mission to have to sit down and \"force yourself\" to play alone just to get some extras.Still, some of these courses are just brilliant and I love playing them. The Wii controls are very intuitive for the racing, especially if you get the wheel add-on. You can use an old style controller too if you really have been hooked on those button combinations.All in all, an awesome game that they did very well for the Wii. Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2009"}

{"product_name":"B004UDB9SA","description":"","reviewerName":"ooocarl06","summary":"high hopes cut down very quickly","reviewText":"I don't write many reviews here on amazon, but this game moved me to do so. This review might just get shoved down to a point where no ones going to see it, but if just one person reads this instead of the reviews calling it amazing, my mission will be accomplished in saving SOMEONE their hard earned doughnow first and foremost, i've been playing resident evil since PS1, and its always been one of my favorite series. Hearing the premise of this game - set in the RE2 and RE3 time but from the stand point of umbrella operatives, i couldn't have been more excited. This is why i immediately put in my preorder and waited patiently thinking it would be a well spent 60 dollars, and i'm sad to say i was wrong. The games not a complete throw away, and a certain number of people are going to enjoy it (as is largely the case with any game). It does extend the storyline from an interesting perspective, but to me its more or less like someone slapped the amazing resident evil legacy onto an extremely below average third person shooter and thought that'd be ok. I love resident evil, but that doesn't mean i'll turn a blind eye and call a crummy game goodTheres a few key problems that entirely cripple this game. The atmosphere is entirely bland and boring, as are the characters. The atmosphere problem wouldn't be THAT big of a deal for your average third person shooter, the focus is on gun action and not whats around you, and thats well and good for a game thats always been a third person shooter. for resident evil, however, so much of the structure of the game is based around the superb tension thats built from the well thought out atmosphere that a longtime RE fan is likely going to feel that a huge part of the game is missing because the atmosphere basically only serves as a place for you to take cover and shoot at enemies in. From the beginning this was said to be an entire departure from a typical resident evil game, thats true, but spinoff or not, holding the name of a top notch game like resident evil means being held up to a certain standard, and for a horror based game, atmosphere is crucial. As for the characters, theres no particular development in any of them. ORC takes too much liberty in the fact that these are characters that already have a pre-established story to them, stories that were done very well in previous games. However with no additional compelling plot points to add to any characters, the entire storyline feels stagnant and the greatest novelty of having these characters in the game is the nostalgia that long time fans will surely get from it.AI is also a serious problem with this game, on part of both teammates and enemies. While there's no friendly fire damage (at least on normal difficulty), your teammates often walk through your line of sight which becomes obnoxious to say the least. They walk through laser-trip mines as if there was nothing there, and ultimately they die. a lot. I will say that this is instantly remedied by finding three friends to play with, but this is obviously not always an option, and a game shouldn't punish the gamer for not having three other friends that both own PS3s as well as this game. The enemy AI is brutally inconsistent, at times you're struggling to survive against one licker, and other times you mow down ten or twenty of them without breaking a sweat. more often than not, though, enemies are bullet catchers and provide no real challenge.The competitive multiplayer is possibly the only (brief) saving grace of RE:ORC. Different play modes offer some novel ideas, though most are just dressed up versions of the standard multiplayer modes you would find in most games (i.e. capture the flag and team deathmatch). This is where the perk system really finds its home. For example, using the recon type you have the option to use a perk that makes you disappear until shot. this is obviously great strategy when playing the capture the flag like mode biohazard. But the terrible AI once again cripples a good portion of the online play since zombies are still present in the online mode. So even if you tried to play only the competitive online aspects, you still have to deal with AI issues.I will also say that i enjoyed the large number of weapons available in this installment. Having 6 different characters with there own play styles was a nice idea, although i think it would have been nice to be able to employ more than one perk at a time. The experience system gives you something to keep working at, and experience points can be spent to buy new guns. These are all nice features to put in a game, but they are obviously nothing new to the videogame worldI hope that ultimately this review provides someone with a balanced view. If you still have an interest in this game, i would strongly suggest a rent, and if it does it for ya, then more power to ya. the idea of the storyline could have been great, and in my opinion it fell very short. The idea of creating a more fast paced third person perspective to resident evil had great potential to be an innovative move, but the game slips into all of the most stereotypical pitholes that third person shooters do. While there might be some fun to be had with competitive multiplayer, i would at least advise you against paying a full 60 dollars for it, because its SURELY not worth that...i guarantee you won't have to wait long for it to be MUCH cheaper.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYILE","description":"","summary":"An excellent open-world game with very few flaws!","reviewText":"Grand Theft Auto 5 most certainly lives up to its astounding hype and sets yet another boundary for open-world gaming. Grand Theft Auto over the years has garnered a tremendous amount of praise (and controversy) as the pinnacle of open-world gaming today. With its excellent story, characters, gameplay, and variety of things to do, GTA 5 will most indefinitely provide an enjoyable experience for any mature gamer.Grand Theft Auto 5's story is amazing, and matches, sometimes even surpasses, the quality of many of the finest Hollywood films. I won't go into too much detail, but the decision to have 3 main characters in the story served it very well, and the narrative is greatly enhanced by this trio. Each character is different in his own way, in nearly everything, from his motivations to his skills. As with any good open-world game, your decisions have a major impact on the story and you can really see that easily. The voice acting for all the characters is superb, and the dialogue is some of the finest that I've heard in a videogame. It keeps the game entertaining and interesting the whole way through, and you can be assured that there's many laugh-out-loud moments to be had. The entire story, along with its colorful cast of characters and vibrant dialogue, serves as a great social commentary on the America of today, and really provokes your thought.The gameplay of Grand Theft Auto 5 is fantastic, and is fun as the day is long. There's an astounding number of things that you can buy and do, ranging from purchasing a tank on the internet to playing darts at your local bar. All of these activities are presented to you in one way or another across the length of the storyline, and whether or not you choose to do many of these is entirely up to you. There's surely something here for everyone, and many of the unstructured things you can do are mostly the most fun. The gameplay, while very complex, is extremely easy to pick up, even for a relatively inexperienced newcomer to this genre as I was. Using your skills to make money, find stores, and buy things is extremely rewarding. Part of how much you'll enjoy this game is how much you're willing to work and immerse yourself in this world. If you're the type of person who just plays through the main missions and then quits, you'll still have a lot of fun with this game, but not anywhere near how much someone who takes their time to collect things, do the side missions, and just simply explore will. The game world is huge, and it will take you a very long time to explore all of it and discover all its secrets (if you're an avid Rockstar gamer, then here's some perspective: the map of GTA 5 is bigger than the maps of Red Dead Redemption, San Andreas, and GTA 4 combined, with some room still left to spare). As with any game as large as this, there are inevitably some bugs, but most of these are very hard to notice or very menial. However, there have been a few cases of game-breaking bugs. To give you an idea of how many things there are to do in this game, keep this in mind: I've played for over 40 hours total, and I'm barely above 75% done with game completion.GTA Online is an ambitious, humongous addition to this already-great game. In short, you can do anything in online that you can do in singleplayer, but with up to 16 friends at once. The entire map is available online, and new additional content is constantly being put out for free. Multiplayer will provide many more hours of entertainment and shenanigans to you, and the experience is enhanced so much more if you're playing with a few friends.In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto 5 is an exceptional game, and it's worth every penny. The singleplayer, with its excellent story, characters, and variety of things to do, along with the extensive multiplayer, will provide many, many hours of quality gameplay and entertainment for you. If you're a mature gamer who is willing to work hard, explore, and have fun, then this game is for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2013"}

The core gameplay is great, from the weapons to the destructible environments. The amount of unlockables seem like it will be plenty for the long haul. Visually....eh, it's not the greatest, but it gets the job done. There is just one thing I can't get over: the menus. Post-game, they are just the most useless, clunky collection of panels that I've ever seen. Can't change your weapons or outfit vehicles. Can't even back out. You just sit for close to a minute to then be greeted by yet another 25 seconds of waiting when you enter the actual game. In game menus are aggravating as well. Your weapons display no stats, so it's difficult to discern what benefit either has over the other, and changing them requires going in three clunky menus deep. Changing squads requires pausing plus several button presses when it could have been handled much easier. AND they take the ability to pause the game when showing your killer when every second you have to cycle through these ungodly menus is precious. I'm not one to nitpick, but I'd like to slap the team responsible for these awful menus Three Stooges style. But seriously, it's a lot of fun otherwise. And if your a player, plug those mics in.

McBeth \"PSN/XLive/Steam: DirkPittSpawn\"","summary":"All 4 Fun","reviewText":"__Ratchet and Clank: All 4 One__Overview: Ratchet, Clank, and the rest of the gang return but with a twist. This heavily COOP dependent game is a change of pace for the Insomniac platforming adventure type. Of course all the crazy weapons are there. It wouldn't be an Insomniac game without those, but instead of a rich single-player experience and story that you work your way though a couple of times to make sure that you don't miss anything, has been replaced by COOP (online and offline) and shorter missions that can be divided up into individual segments.Going Solo:You can, if you'd like, attempt the game on your own. I will say that it isn't that fun and eliminates what the game is all about. Plus it can be a little more difficult because the AI will only shoot and move with you, it won't anticipate or stray far. You can be any of the 4 characters and you will bring along 1 of the others on your back (kinda funny seeing Clank have Qwark on his back)Coop:As it was intended both the offline and online versions of this game play well and can be loads of fun with friends. I'd recommend offline since it'll be easier to coordinate and talk with the person(s) you're playing with, but the online isn't too bad. You might have to jump into a game mid-mission though. And that's where it can be problematic. You can request that the host restart the mission/segment, or you can wait until there's a savepoint that you can jump into the game at. The game difficulty does increase with more characters playing, but sometimes it's a fight between the 4 of you to gain bolts, kills, and critters; which are not shared among the group. Health is though.Replayability (High):You will probably want to play through the levels a number of times to get the different unlockables, critters, and bolts to purchase upgrades, weapons, etc. And once you have enough critters you can tackle the \"research labs\" to try and unlock the RYNO, by far the best R&C; weapon that has carried through the series. This time however it is *SPOILER ALERT* not just a weapon you carry around but a full armored suit *END OF SPOILER* The mission length can be a good thing, with them being not too long you can sit down for one and get through the entire thing and go off and do something else afterwards. I did like replaying missions over with new characters too.Recommendation/Summary:If you have been enjoying the R&C; series, chances are you'll enjoy this too. It's a change up from the norm, but the characters, crazy weapons, and gameplay elements are all there. If you have friends that enjoy the series as well, all the better to help you play through the game. Just be prepared to compete for bolts and at the end of each segment see how you compared (Bolt Master, N00B, the Pacifist, etc.)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2012"}

Stathoulopoulos \"nick9155\"","summary":"Solid shooter for the PS2 gets the job done","reviewText":"Return to Castle Wolfenstein is a thoroughly enjoyable first person shooter that falls between Medal of Honor and Resident Evil.I loved MoH Frontline, so I was looking for more WW II first person shooter action.  I was afraid the game would wallow in the occult element and resemble something like Resident Evil too much, but to my pleasant surprise, it did not.This is a solid game all around.  The shoot em up action is great, and the AI isn't bad at all as compared with some other games (particularly the newest Medal of Honor).Also, unlike Medal of Honor, there are tons of secrets in this game--countless hidden areas where you get bonuses that enable you to up your health, or ammo, for instance.  So it pays to play carefully and always look around for extra things to smash.It also carries a Mature rating, unlike the MoH series of the similar EA Bond shooters.  It's not the goriest, but it's certainly welcome.  There are plenty of authentic weapons, including the ubiquitous Thompson sub machine gun, the 1911 .45, the bazooka, sniper rifles, etc, etc.  There's even a Sten silenced sub machine gun that realistically overheats when fired too much.Much more so than the MoH games this game creates a lot of tension as you battle Nazis, German soldiers, and the undead and recently mutated.  You'll find yourself reloading just to time to kill a skeleton that comes back to life after several shots.  You'll cover yourself with grenades as you cycle through weapons and try to reserve ammo.I found this game pleasantly challenging but not too tough.  The ending, truth be told, was rather easy for a game of this type, but I thoroughly enjoyed it all the way through.  I would rank the 1 Player Mode as superior to Medal of Honor Rising Sun for a few reasons: it's tougher, it's bloody, it has more variety, and it's longer.Downside?  No multiplayers mode--a real shame.  Couple of cheesy bits, including the boot to the head capability and the jerky knife fighting, but these are very minor.This is definitely a recommended shooter for the PS2.  Combining WWII action and zombie action, it gets the job done.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2003"}

I played through it once when I got it, purchased the downloadable extra characters, and played through it again on the hardest level.  I had a blast.  I have been an X-men fan for as long as I can remember, so I played the game mostly with characters from the X-men universe (Wolverine, Storm, and Magneto are very good additions to your ultimate alliance).  So I can't speak for how well all the characters work in the game, but I can tell you there are A LOT of teams you can make and try out.If you played Marvel Ultimate Alliance 1, the general game play is the same: beat baddies, crack open crates, find hidden objects, level-up your characters.  There is an added \"Fusion\" combo power that uses two of your team members' powers to make an awesome bad-guy smashing attack.  Graphics have been upgraded from MUA1.  Great story with two diverging story arcs to play.I am not great at video games (generally speaking), and I hate jumping-at-precisely-timed-moments-to-avoid-bottomless-pits-only-to-fail-and-restart-the-whole-level genre, So I LOVED Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2. I play to relax and have fun not for frustration-induced stroke.  MUA2 is wonderful game that has challenges without headaches.  I loved it so much that I bought my brother a copy for Christmas (2009).Here is the big problem I have with Microsoft and Marvel about this game.  I have the downloadable characters, my brother does not and CAN NOT: after January 1st (2010) the DLC was no longer available on Xbox live.  So my brother and I can NEVER play this game together over xbox live because we do not have compatible versions of the game.

Pick a handful of players and they'll all offer a different story of how they got it done.Human Revolution goes back and forth between open-world style city \"hubs\" that contain various side quests and objectives, and more traditional missions that are structured more like FPS levels. There is good balance between the two. The levels are linear but sometimes challenging, reminding me of science fictionSplinter Cell(I played a stealth character), while the city hubs drop you into open environments that reward exploration and creative thinking. Throughout you play through a story dealing with conspiracies, shady corporations, genetic alterations, and more. Pretty cool stuff overall.If DE:HR has a weak spot, it's in the AWFUL boss battles. There are roughly four, and each of them breaks with the game's general feel by pretty much taking all semblance of choice out of the player's hand. Instead, they're straightforward \"shoot the guy until he is dead\" battles. They can be frustrating at the very least, but the worst thing is that they just don't FIT with the rest of the game.Overall, though, the game offers enough ways to tackle what it throws at you that as a player you feel a real stake in what you're doing and a sense of accomplishment when you do it. That also helps provide some replayability, since many missions, levels and aspects of the story can go in multiple directions.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003C1I0CO","reviewerName":"V. Berk","summary":"They got it!","reviewText":"You ever play a video game and it feels as if a childhood dream has come true?That was me when I first picked up Batman: Arkham Asylum in December, 2009.  Playing Batman: Arkham Asylum for the first time is an indescribable experience.  As someone who grew up on the 90's Batman: The Animated Series this game went above and beyond any and all expectations one could have ever placed on a superhero video game.  The writing was great, all the villains were there, the art direction was perfect, and above all else: it made me believe I was Batman.  It is that feeling that sets Batman: Arkham Asylum in the highest realm of video game greatness.At the start of the game you are immediately thrown into action.  After a security breach The Joker is loose in Arkham Asylum but rather than making a run for it the Clown Prince of Crime decides to take over the madhouse.  As Batman you must stop the Joker's nefarious schemes, but it isn't going to be easy.  Between you and Joker are some of the Caped Crusader's greatest goes: Bane, Scarecrow, Killer Croc, Harley Quinn, and Poison Ivy.  Each one of these supervillains wants a piece of you, and needless to say: it's going to be a bumpy night.Written by Batman veteran Paul Dini the story does a wonderful job capturing everything that makes the Batman universe great.  Each villain is given his/her moment to shine.  Perhaps best of these moments comes when Scarecrow's toxin recreates the death of Batman's parents.  The moment is chilling and hits all the right emotional notes.  This is dark stuff that Dini's team couldn't have gotten away with on the animated series and it results many moments that will surely be talked about amongst Bat-fans for years to come.Just as important as Dini's script is the reunion of many former Batman: The Animated Series voices.  For me there will never be a better voice for Batman and Joker than Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill.  Conroy's Batman is cool, threatening, and always in charge which plays perfectly off the livewire that is Hamill's Joker.  These two know exactly what they're doing whenever they voice these characters.  Hamill in particular is finally let loose and we get to see the Joker at his most gleefully sadistic.The developers at Rocksteady provide outstanding gameplay both in combat and in exploration.  Arkham Asylum's combat is almost rhythmic and whenever you pull off a finishing movie it just feels awesome.  Each of Batman's fighting moves makes the player feel like a bad ass as they work their way through crowds of armed thugs.  You also are given access to Batman's impressive arsenal of weapons.  Sneaking and swooping from building to building has never been more satisfying!  And once you've beaten the campaign's story you still have plenty of time to further hone your skills by collecting the Riddler's trophies and other odds and ends spread across the island.The greatest flaw of Arkham Asylum are its boss battles.  You get a lot of villains but most of the fights amount to: villain unleashes an army of henchmen and you beat them down.  Most disappointing of all is that after doing this multiple times throughout the game the end fight with Joker is only a repeat of this overused formula.  Poison Ivy is the game's stand out boss battle.  It has multiple phases, and although she also throws army of goons at you at least she is actively taking part in the fight unlike the other villains who just run off the corner as you beat up their thugs.  This doesn't ruin the game, but it is worth mentioning.At the end of the day Batman: Arkham Asylum is a masterpiece.  When looking back at the game we're looking at a perfect storm of talent.  . With Paul Dini, Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, and developer Rocksteady Batman: Arkham Asylum there came them makings of one of this generation's greatest games.  It doesn't matter if you're a fan of Batman or not if you haven't played this game you are missing out on something extraordinary.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2013"}

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone. To help you maximize the potential of this setup, two-player online and offline co-op modes ensure that you have options when picking a partner.Steel yourself Against the Harsh Reality of KijujuAn advanced version of Capcom's proprietary MT Framework game engine brings groundbreaking graphics and effects to Kijuju, the highly-developed environment where this game's action takes place. New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"Sigmund Freud","summary":"As a \"resident evil\" game it pretty much fails but...","reviewText":"If you've played all the older resident evil games 1-CV then this game is not for you and your probably don't like where series has ended up. RE4 was fantastic game that took the series somewhere it never thought it go, but it seems that Capcom played it safe and just took RE4 and repainted it, brought back fan favorite characters including a brand new character and added co-op and made a story which was suppose to be epic and detail the origins of the T-virus but falls flat with sub par dialogue in general the whole story feels rushed and a mess like it lost direction, the ending felt like a closure but at the same time unsatisfying. The controls surprisingly are unchanged from what you played in Re4 and it seems that Capcom can't grasp the idea that what worked in 4-5 years ago are old and dated and does nothing but hinder the player. Moving and shooting is the biggest gripe and although many re4 players will say it adds tension to the horror aspect, it doesn't work in this game where horror is obviously absent and Re5 in general is a  3rd action adventure and should be viewed as so. As it also has a cover system that unfortunately \"appears\" only where the developers placed it.Re5 on its own is great game and adds features that make the game have more replay value. This is to be the last RE game with action as Capcom not to long ago announced its going to return to the horror aspect. So for die hard RE fans this game is one you'll enjoy for the story(maybe)but remember horror in RE is not dead yet.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2010"}

Bound to the land, these creatures hold a key to a mystical power of revival--a power you must obtain to waken a loved one.Shadow of the Colossusis a majestic journey through ancient lands to seek out and destroy gigantic mythical beasts. With your trusty horse at your side, explore the spacious lands and unearth each Colossi. Armed with your wits, a sword, and a bow, use cunning and strategy to topple each behemoth.From the original developers of the critically acclaimed ICO, comes a masterpiece of an adventure.","reviewerName":"M. Donnelly","summary":"The Most Epic PS2 Game Ever?","reviewText":"Shadow of the Colossus has to be one of the most intriguing games I've ever played.  Scratch that, it is the MOST intriguing game.This can be a good thing or a bad thing, varying from one individual to the next.  However, in my case, the artistic nature of this game, alongside its \"narrative\", if you can call it that, is enough to call it the best game I've ever played on the Playstation 2 console.I truly do not wish to spoil any of this game, because every moment must be appreciated to the fullest.  The game focuses around a silent hero, with little information being presented about him.  Through the course of the game, you come to appreciate his motivation, but your task is essentially to destroy 16 Colossi. (plural of Colossus, for those who don't know)  These beasts are like nothing you've seen in any video game before, ever.  The concept is the same across all of them--find a way to scale them, and then use your sword to destroy them by attacking their very visible but not always so accessible weak spots, in the form of white glowing glyphs around the creatures' bodies.This task sounds easier than it is--the first of the colossi is simple enough, but as you progress, the difficulty as well as the scale of the creatures increase, and the challenge of figuring out how to approach each colossus is just as tricky as the task of implementing your plan is.  I don't want to say any more, but the feeling of beating a colossus after challenging bouts, deaths, or utter confusion is one of great joy.The game is very nontraditional in the sense that there are really no other characters in it.  It is just essentially you and your loyal horse, Agro.  Many have said it before, but I to this day I have not seen better animations than in this game, especially for the horse.  Some get discouraged by the controls, but it actually feels like it has weight and mass to it, like a real horse.  Additionally, controlling the protagonist can be tricky at first, but it feels very good after you adjust to it--it's a very different game from any other you've likely played, to say the least.The visuals are very impressive for the PS2 era of games.  I was at first very frustrated by the framerate, which admittedly does skip on occasion, but after I started to look at the level of detail in yourself, your horse, and the world around you, you really appreciate how much this game accomplished for its time.  The fur on the colossi is incredible, for a PS2 game, and though the graphics aren't on par with the current generation of consoles, this is the next best thing, in my opinion.Some find it very tough to \"get into\" this game.  There are no real interactions, except between you and your horse, for the most part.  Most of the story is not spelled out for you--instead it is \"understood\".  By this I mean that you as the player need to fill in the majority of it--the story is unclear for the very reason that it does not need to be specific to have an impact on the player's emotions.  There is a wonderful landscape and beautiful terrain to cross, which does take some time, so make sure you look around as you ride.  There is a \"hint\" button to find the next colossus, which is essentially holding your sword up and allowing reflected light to lead you to it.  Traversing the landscapes is something to appreciate, not something the developers wanted to torture you with, so remember to keep that in mind as you move in the game world.One thing to keep in mind is that Shadow of the Colossus is a VERY UNIQUE game.  It is NOT for everyone.  If you're looking for a hack-n-slash adventure game, you may prefer Zelda.  If you're looking for deep character development through interactions with NPCs, find a Final Fantasy.  But if you want a deep game, which takes some thought to really appreciate, this may be for you.  This is one of the only games I would ever consider calling \"art\" in the traditional sense, and I say that for a reason.I hope you all enjoy my favorite PS2 game based on this recommendation.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000035Y6N","reviewerName":"Strategos \"The Guardian of Time\"","summary":"It's about time","reviewText":"There are many who feel that Chrono Trigger is the greatest game ever made. Certainly it is one of the greatest RPGs ever made, in my own experience equaled only perhaps by Final Fantasy VII (never did care for any other Final Fantasy games). It's a rolicking-good-time for fans of adventure and sci-fi, and as RPGs go a whole lot of fun. More than that, the genius of its design and brilliance of its story is not debatable. It's legendary. Even better, it makes for a game that's fun!When I first started the game I was wondering exactly how the game would make me feel. I like the deep story of RPGs, but hate dungeon crawling, random battles, and that very irritating feeling of having absolutely no idea where to go next to get the story moving again. I need not have feared, though. Chrono trigger has no random battles, it's castles and dungeons are brief not every-lasting, and thankfully, you will always know where to go next.The story starts with you in your village on the day of the millenial fair, and you quickly meet a girl there and (using your friend's new teleportation machine) find the girl gone and yourself back in time trying to rescue a queen who has been kidnapped (and who your friend has been mistaken for because {surprise, surprise} she is the crown princess and the descent of that queen. You have some adventures come back to your time, get put on trial for kidnapping the princess, and see one of the greatest scenes in any videogame ever, as all your actions in the first hour of the game are played back as evidence against or for you. Eventually you get out of that situation (one way or another) and find yourself again traveling through time, only to find that the world was destroyed by a monster far in the future, unless you can stop it...The prologue is awesome but the main story of the game is really amazing. You have all the classic trapping of a great legend, from a hero turned into an animal, to an ancient sword that has to be reforged, to a princess and an unlikely hero out to save the world. That's enough to make a good game. What propels Chrono Trigger into greatness is the power the story is given by the strength of the characters and writing, and absolutely fantastic presentation and gameplay. The game is loaded with humor character, from the little girl accusing you of not rescuing her cat at the trial, to a tiny furry creature who is the master magician (and keeps popping up in different times doing everything from hiking on the mountain of monsters to playing rag-time on the piano in an inn), from the goblins who wonder why you just popped out of a time portal in their closet to the Frog who talks in noble Shakesparian and the cute robot you find in the future. There were so many times when I played this game and felt real joy in the moments it presented. When I first discovered the robot in the future and his theme played, I felt attached to him instantly (he's so cuuuute), and when the hero frog leapt off saying he had failed to protect the queen,  I felt so bad for him (he was really handy with sword and saved my bacon). That's the kind of thing that gets to you. I haven't felt that way about an RPG since Xenosaga's Cyborg said \"Call me Ziggy\", and Final Fantasy VII had girls asking a certain brooding hero whether he remembered his promise or would be their bodyguard.It cannot be overstated how much the lack of random battles, and the constant boss battles (which you will almost always win) increase the amount of fun you have with this game. The excellent battle system which highly encourages teamwork amoung your party keeps you constantly on your toes and nervous that you could lose the battle, and never gets tedious or frustrating. The graphics may be old-school, but that about as good sprite-based graphics get. The music is very atmospheric and catchy, and the main themes are just beautiful. The story twists and turns, and how you play can determine the way certain events unfold (the game has more than one ending and you can even play past the \"end\"). But above all, the story and characters are just impossible not to love if you like a good story. If you like RPGs and don't mind if they're a little old, you will LOVE this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2008"}

Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well.

You have many different weapons, spells, and items at your disposal, including swords, bows, and a giant hammer.  The fun never stops and the story never goes flat.  If you want a grand adventure, buy this game.  If you like this, play The Legend Of Zelda: Majora's Mask, but wait until you finish this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMB3","description":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timemay be the greatest single-player video game ever created in any genre. It's that good. Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide. WithThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Nintendo has come up with an all-consuming adventure title that will provide days of engrossing gameplay.--Eric FredricksonPros:Best single-player video gameFreedom to explore a rich, complex worldHelpful fairy guide gives hintsCharming, humorous, lighthearted, yet challengingCons:Some puzzles can be frustratingOnly one saved game per player--don't save when you're stuck!Much more fun with Rumble Pack","reviewerName":"Mark E.

{"product_name":"B00005ML10","description":"One of the most anticipated titles in PlayStation2 history absolutely  lives up to the hype.Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Libertyis the  follow-up to one of the most captivating and intelligent adventures on the original  PlayStation. Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M.

I read every article in every magazine, and drooled over every screenshot.  When it was finally released, I bought it the day it came out, and my expectations were exceeded.Amazingly, the gameplay has been improved over Metal Gear Solid.  With loads of new complex moves and animations, the controls are equally as simple and the characters are equally as fun to maneuver.  I was skeptical about the first-person mode (used primarily for aiming and shooting) at first, afraid the gameplay would lean too far towards tons of gunplay, but once I began to play I realized how well it fit with the stealth gameplay.The only aspect of this game that left me a little disappointed was the plot.  There are too many U-turns, especially towards the end, that it seems a bit too far-fetched.  The plot in its predecessor was the best ever in a videogame.  It was better than any movie I've ever seen as well.  And this is not to say the plot is horrible in this game; far from it.  It's quite enjoyable, there are just a few scenes I'd like to rework.  Still, the voice-acting is top-notch.Buy this game immediately, if you have not already.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2003"}

Join the Crusades as a Christian or Muslim empire and battle over the fate of the Holy Land. Raise mighty armies to crush your neighbors and conquer all of Europe and even the Americas to become the greatest power of the Middle Ages.","reviewerName":"Brian J. Mcmahon","summary":"Medieval 1 vs. Medieval 2","reviewText":"I'm going to rate the game by comparing Medieval 1 to Medieval 2. In Medieval 2, the number of starting factions you can play as has been drastically reduced. Apparently you can unlock other starting faction when you first win the game. The starting options have been changed, for instance the starting time period is fixed. The strategic map is beefed up in Medieval 2 with a 3D look and feel. The option to not watch AI movement speeds up the time waiting between rounds. There are options for AI assistance in managing cities and castles as well as assisting with units in battle.The strategic game in Medieval 2 is quite a bit more complex, but in many ways less tedious than Medieval 1. For one thing, you will find that your units fit withing castles and cities regardless of how developed they are. You will rarely have military units scattered all over the place, they will normally be clustered in cities or castles. Cities and castles have been seperated. Generally, cities are for money production and castles are for military production, but there is overlap with both. Aside from the princesses, diplomats, and priests, there are also merchant units that can move to resources scattered on the map and produce income from them. The diplomatic options are greatly expanded and can be an additional source of income by trading things like information or trade rights with other factions for money. Spies play a valuable role and the Pope can cause all sorts of headaches in Medieval 2 that were not part of Medieval 1.The tactical game has also changed dramatically. First of all you will fight far fewer battles. Second, you will fight even less in the open, most of your bigger fights will be sieges. In Medieval 1 you could usually avoid siege fights because your force of 2000 men would overwhelm a castle that was only able to hold a few hundred enemies. You could simply automatically resolve most sieges with very little fear. In Medieval 2, this has changed. You will need a spy to tell you what is inside a city, and a spy may also open the gates for you when the battle comes if you get lucky. If you don't know what is inside a city and you go to attack it, you may find that you have seriously underestimated and be forced to wait for reinforcments or even withdraw. Conducting sieges is a major part of the game that was possible with Medieval 1 but practically unnecessary.Other things that have been incorporated into Medieval 2 are missions or tasks from the Pope or a \"counsel\" of nobles. Ultimately you can ignore the missions but there can be consequences and lost rewards. The rewards can be very valuable. Sometimes the missions are too demanding because they will require doing something that is tough to accomplish at the time you receive it. The addition of the missions is welcome and will sometimes end up taking you in a direction where you might not have been sure what to do next.At this point the game is not without flaws. Sometimes your units will not respond properly during a battle. For that matter sometimes the AI units don't respond properly either, or so it would appear. I've seen units go back and forth or run at an angles towards an enemy formation and right past them, when they were ordered to attack. Cavalry units are particularly adept and speeding right past an enemy formation that is on the run, completely missing it. Enemy units will sometimes take a horrible pounding from missiles without moving, running, or charging. In one battle I had 3 or 4 archer units expend all arrows from hilltop safety on enemy missile and infantry forces. They just sat there and got reduced by half their strength over 5 minutes. There have also been a few crashes to the desktop here and there, usually right after a battle starts. Hopefully a patch will fix these relatively minor issues.The computer requirements have been stated by many as being too demanding. However, if you turn down the settings, the game will play pretty smoothly on 2 year old hardware at 1280x1024 resolution. I've got a large amount of RAM (2.5GB) which may help. But my video card is only an ATi X800 AGP and I have an old AMD XP 3200 processor. The game runs fine with the settings turned down.Overall, I give the game 4 of 5 stars. It is a worthy successor and contains far more depth than Medieval 1. It's not flawless, but definately worth playing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2006"}

How good was Tricky? It was the most addictive game I have ever played for the Playstation 2. My family's productivity dropped to almost nothing, as every member of my family would play the game for 5 hours straight if they could. And partially because of the tricks, partially because of the song, my family has a new definition of the word &quot;Tricky&quot; (it now means either nuclear cool or something that looks impossible but is doable if you've got mad skillz). The big question is then, does SSX 3 live up to the greatness of SSX Tricky?SSX 3 is a further evolution of the SSX gameplay style. While Tricky was a great game in it's own right, there were flaws. You could get stuck in a corner or in a particular spot. Sometimes you would land on your head because you got dis-oriented. And of course there were times when you could swear you landed the trick but maybe your timing was like a tenth of a second off, and so you fell on your face. I am overjoyed to say that all of these problems are pretty much gone. Your character is much more likely to land tricks without falling now. If you hit a rock or billboard you do NOT fall in mid-air and lose the trick you had done right before hitting it. If you get stuck, press select and you are instantly reset. And if you DO happen to fall, press square repeatedly and you get back up faster. And remember the frustration of some tracks litted with object for you to smack into (Aloha Ice Jam comes to mind)... well that's gone in favor of more &quot;organic&quot; tracks which give you a little more room. What does all this translate to gameplay-wise?Tricky wasn't about getting through the course. It was about landing insane tricks and pushing yourself as far and fast and high as possible. SSX 3 pushes even further in the right direction, because instead of falling and bumping into things and getting caught in a corner, you're doing more tricks.People  who loved Tricky won't feel alienated because all of the old riders are back (either from the get-go or in unlockable form), the old tricks are still here, and a lot of the tracks have a similar feel to the best from Tricky. There is simply more of what you love now. More tricks, more characters, more possible moves (handplants anyone?), and more clothes, gear, and boards (don't you love the fact that rider stats are no longer attached to boards, so you no longer have to use a sucky board to like the way it looks?).The graphics are better, featuring some awesome weather effects and lighting. The music has more of a techno-rock feel than before (which is fine by me). The controls are about the same as before, only they just FEEL a little better, a little smoother.You can play this game for five minutes or five hours. It's as addictive as your first game of tetris. The learning curve is easy, but this game is almost impossible to master. There's literally mountains of stuff to unlock and the game never gets boring. For fans of Tricky this is a must-buy. For people who love great games it's a must-buy. It's the greatest snowboarding game ever. It's bigger, cooler, prettier, and trickier than before. What more could anyone ask?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2004"}

Others might want to grab the demo, which is now available to see if they like the gameplay. The only minimal disappointments are a somewhat smaller world to explore versus Gothic 2 and a more twitch-based melee combat than I personally would like.  The graphics are pretty enough, but it will remind you of a game dating from pre Half-Life 2 generation of games.  Character animations are a little wooden and some environment textures are more blurry than they really should be in this day and age.  But I am being picky!  It really is a god sent game for those of us who like \"deep\" crpg's and a fairly open world to explore.  Just like Gothic 2, you will be asked to join a faction and at that point some quests are locked out until you replay the game and join a different faction.  So far, it is easily a B+ game.Folks who want games just like Oblivion or Fallout 3 should really download the demo since this game is hard: there's no baby-step leveling and super-easy combat here :)  If you go up against a bigger creature while exploring, there is no auto-leveling, and you will die instantly.  Kill a character before talking to him and you potentially lock yourself out of a quest forever.

For one, you can adjust the color of the LED backlighting for the keys. There's also a volume adjustment wheel, lockout key for gaming that disables the annoying Windows key, some audio controls, macro recording and macro buttons, built-in USB 2.0 port, and a headphone and mic jack for your headset or just your headphonesThe keyboard presents a few problems. The height adjustment legs, although designed very well since they fold open sideways and won't automatically collapse each time you push the keyboard forward, don't allow you to raise the keyboard to a comfortable angle. The keyboard sits too flat for my taste. All of the Dell USB keyboards we use at work and the ones I have at home sit about an inch higher at the forward part of the keyboard. I haven't compared the G110 with any other name brand keyboards, but the Dell USB keyboards are the typical ones included in any Dell desktop purchase - nothing special or fancy and can be purchased for $10 on eBay.The G110 keys do not provide enough tactile feedback for me, although they are very quiet and soft. I found this a bit disconcerting at first since I prefer some feedback when typing or playing FPS's. The \"F\" and \"J\" keys also do not have a very defined raised edge to help guide your index fingers. They could be made taller and wider.The keyboard layout is also unusual and difficult for me to get used to since the left part of the keyboard is occupied by the G keys and profile keys. I found myself automatically trying to hit M1 instead of Esc very frequently.The audio controls do not work with WinAmp which was disappointing since it would have been nice to be able to control this simple external MP3 player via the keyboard while playing a game. The audio controls worked with Windows Media Player.The backlighting has some quirks. There are only 3 basic colors to choose from: blue, purple, and red. There are some variations but they just make them dimmer. The red is the easiest to see clearly in the dark. I would have preferred a few other colors like white, yellow, green, or orange. The backlighting cut-outs aren't well aligned in some of the keys. On a few keys the light comes out partially through the translucent text but it isn't a big deal. My Dell Studio 1537 laptop has a backlit keyboard (white only), and has 2 brightness settings that work extremely well in the dark. I wish the G110 at least offered a more contrasting backlight so I could see the keys better at night.The USB and headset/mic jacks face away from the user, so it makes them difficult to access if your desk has a keyboard \"tray\" that slides out. If you keep your keyboard right on top of the desk, it shouldn't be a problem.Overall, the keyboard is a quality piece of equipment. There's room for improving the ergonomics and backlighting, like the use of higher contrast LEDs versus purple or blue for better readability or a higher height adjustment and a more effective layout. The whole point of backlighting is to allow the user to see the keys in dark or low-lit environments, which means the keys should be easily identified. In addition, more colors also allows better user customization. The overall quality is top notch, the keys feel very sturdy so you get your money's worth even if you just wanted a basic keyboard. However, the extras like the built-in USB port, headphone and mic jack, Windows key lockout, volume adjustment wheel and controls, and the backlighting are very handy. The macro buttons are just icing on the cake for WoW players and other gamers that rely on macros.Pros: Quality construction, slightly grippy texture on the keys, volume adjustment wheel, Windows key lockout, built-in USB 2.0 portCons: Backlighting isn't properly aligned for all of the keys, they could have included better color choices for use in the dark: white, yellow, green, etc... As-is, only red looks the sharpest and is the easiest to see. The height adjustment does not allow a high enough tilt for me.Overall: A solid 4 out of 5 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00004W4QJ","description":"Three years ago, gamers were introduced to Aya as she resigned from the  New York Police Department and enlisted as a NMC (neo-mitochondrion creature)  hunter for the shadowy government organization M.I.S.T., a secret agency of  monster slayers somewhere betweenGhostbustersandMen in Black.  Wherever there was a neo-mitochondrion outbreak, Aya and her team were on the  scene to put the boots to the mutants. From the outset, it's evident that  SquareSoft revamped the entire game to give gamers a better looking, sounding,  and (most importantly) playing experience.The game starts with Aya training in the agency's shooting gallery in Los  Angeles. Just as she begins to get in a groove, she is asked to look into some  strange happenings at the Akropolis Tower. When she arrives on the scene, an  explosive, full-motion video flashes across the screen and showcases the death  and carnage as Aya surveys the scene. Her entry into the Tower is where this RPG  begins.SquareSoft has kept some of the excellent elements of the weapons systems from  the firstParasite Evetitle, but went for an entirely new battle system.  Combat is delivered in real time and allows players to run, hide, and open fire.  Aya can tap into her parasitic powers and can unleash elemental, magic-based  attacks on the many foes she encounters. Ammunition is plentiful in the game and  there are plenty of entertaining weapons to choose from. Auto targeting and  involving puzzles are back, though the arrow-pointing interface for solving  these puzzles is really hard to operate.The cinematic mix of story and action is very well done, and the numerous  cutscenes do an excellent job of moving the pace along in a believable way.Even though the originalParasite Evehad its problems, SquareSoft has  pieced together an excellent sequel that will satisfy fans of the first game and  help create many new ones.--Todd MowattPros:New, real-time battle system is an improvement over firstParasite  EveGreat weapons and plentiful ammunitionGreat mix of story and actionCons:Clunky interface for solving puzzles","reviewerName":"Poo Poo Pooey","summary":"what the ...??","reviewText":"man this is a poor game i bought it, played it for an hour and thought this cant be it but it is... theres no voice acting so the atmosphere is cack and the battle system is really bad. a game like this relies on gut feeling and instincts, not to be told how much hp was taken off the player should not be told. The cut scenes are good and the camera at the beginning (i sold it after that) was reasonably good. This game just feels like a sub-par resident evil. Even the graphics are not upto resie standards the developers didnt use pre renders like capcom so the areas look ok at best. The enemies are reasonably well animated and look solid enough but dont provide the visual oomph that resie's deadites do. You shouild be able to see the flesh hanging off them but nope. Whats with the rpg elements too? Again it detracts from the atmosphere when you recieve bp or whatever from kills and use it to upgrade, it just doesnt work and feels tacked on. If they were goimg to do something like this then they could have ,made it at least a bit more in-depth like other rpgs.  There are many faults to this game and all add up to a below standard rpg/action type thing. not good at all.

I do like video games and was excited to try this one. Most of South Park's humor makes me cringe, however, this is a cool video game. The game I love to play on PS3 is Sky Rim. This game smacks heavily of that game in a goofy, spoofy sort of way, and it's fun, but even if it's about kids, it's definitely not a game for kids-there are a lot of shocking scenes that contain graphic shenanigans. A warning: the humor gets worse as the game continues so don't think your kids can sneak in and take a peek, you may give them a surprise they won't soon forget.You start off in the game as the new kid and you set forth to meet friends and to get the stick which has been stolen, back. As you travel around, you make friends and gather stuff. Your friends are seen on your Friend Page and it's a funny take on Facebook, but it works well to keep track of your new found buddies. As you travel through neighborhoods and stores and houses, you are given little quests and side quests that are fun. The stuff and weapons you collect and are often given, help with the turn based battle system which took me a while to get used to. I've never played a turn based fighting game, and at first I was irritated by it, but after a bit, when those nasty elves or rats or whatever enemies I came up against challenged me, I started to enjoy the battles. The chapters can be somewhat difficult, but whenever I get stuck, I just go on another side quest and get back to what I was stuck on later and usually have no problem. You have to level up to do some things and unlock places and get certain items. The game is neither too easy nor too hard. The controls do take some getting used to for completing certain actions.This game contains some serious adult themed comedy as portrayed in South Park. It has bad language and raunchiness throughout, that said, it's a fun game to explore and play-and remember, I am not even a fan of South Park but I think the pretty cool-I like the  music too. I can imagine people who love South Park will think this game is wonderful and will enjoy the characters and the missions you set forth to conquer-it's just like the show and you are the new kid in South Park.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2014"}

This game is no exception , from start to finish the game had me so enthralled in the story I just didn't want to stop playing..If you are one of those people that think this game is just a game of quick time events ( QTE ) you would be completely wrong.. You have to initiate the QTE .. The fighting machanics of this game can be easily compaired to the batman games , they are fast and fluid.. You will need to rely heavily on your blocking/shield , without it you will die very quickly. Once you get the block , stagger , and attack combonations down its pretty much smooth sailing from there on out.. Im not saying it's completely easy from there but everything is alot more managable after you get everything down. YOU WILL STILL DIE THROUGH OUT THE GAME !! You will run into hords of ememies that at some points seem overwhelming , but after you die a few times you will see the things you are doing wrong and correct it.The graphics are nothing but amazing in this game and simply something that could not be accomplished with the previous generation ( Xbox 360 , PS3 ) . Everything is just so detailed and beautiful to look at. I have found that after clearing an area of enemies I like to stop and just look around and appreciate the surroundings I am playing in..In my opinion this game is nearly flawless and deserves nothing less than a 5 out of 5.. Don't listen to the paid professional reviews , if you want a real honest and truthful review , just read the user reviews.. There have been so many times I have seen profesional reviews really trounce on a game and give it poor reviews but doesnt reflect the actual user reviews that are much higher. One of the worst reviews I have ever seen was by Adam Sessler from G4 tv reviewing Darksiders.. I can't remember exactly what score he gave it but he gave either a one or two star review.. That was a totally inacurate review of the game.Darksiders II Xbox 360Look at the actual user reviews. What I'm trying to tell you is to look for yourself and play the games you want instead of listening to the '\" professional \" reviews.. As a matter of fact Sessler even gave this game a bad review and even admitted in his review he didn't complete the game..On a final note , just pick up the game and play it if you are interested , it really is an excellent game and one that you will always remember.................................................................................................................................","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00503E8S2","description":"","reviewerName":"Andariel Halo \"Disillusioned Smark\"","summary":"Overall Letdown","reviewText":"Exactly why people would be so foolishly naive as to expect some groundbreaking new game from this, and then bitterly whine and complain on it in reviews, is beyond me.  You saw COD4: Modern Warfare.  You saw how little changed in COD: Modern Warfare 2.Honestly, I was in this mostly for the story.  It compelled me, and this is the concluding portion of it.  I don't care what people think about it or if they complain about things that have been done before or are clich&egrave;, I enjoyed it, and the story ultimately satisfied me, while leaving me with an empty, yet relieved feeling, much like the player character at the end of the very last mission.Everything is pretty much the same as in the previous game.  I don't care; it's what I expected and what I wanted.  If you wanted a totally new game, buy a different shooter.  Get Battlefield 3 if you want, and brag and strut and taunt MW3 fans all you want; just leave my game experience alone.Fanboyism?  No, I'm not.  I got legit criticisms about the game.  The music sucks (no Hans Zimmer return), some of the missions are ridiculous (3 people against an entire Somali militia), there aren't any compelling characters aside from Makarov, and there isn't enough emphasis placed on the whole WORLD WAR 3 aspect hyped in the trailers.  But it's still worth playing, and still exactly what I wanted.Edit:  The story.  SPOILERS be here.Compared to the raw, visceral experience of the previous two games (COD4 and MW2), this game had a very numbing effect on me.  Not the sense of \"We've seen it all before\" on our part, but a sense of \"We've done this all before\" on the part of the game company.What struck me hardest about the Modern Warfare series was how realistic it felt (50 foot snowspeeder jumps aside) and how it took old hat (Russians invade America) and made it feel horrifyingly new, helped along a great deal by Hans Zimmer's music.And adding to that realism was a sense of scope.  Things had a grand scale; events somewhere else affected the story involving you.  You felt as if the world was truly watching when America was attacked (both in MW and MW2) and when America attacked.There's no sense of that in this game.  The game opens with missions in New York... and ONLY in New York.  We don't even get a token glance at the fight in the rest of the east coast, a check-up on Washington or Sergeant Foley and such.  And as soon as you beat the missions in New York, suddenly the Russians are pulling out of America entirely.Perhaps the biggest sense of scope was with Makarov in the second game.  Like with Osama Bin Laden or any major terrorist leader, he was top priority, but he was NOT the end-all of the conflict.  The tagline for this game applied more perfectly for the previous one; \"It doesn't take the most powerful nations on Earth to create the next global conflict. Just the will of a single man.\"In Modern Warfare 2, this was absolute fact.  Makarov set up a masterful series of events leading to, literally World War III.  And by the end of the game, he'd created a juggernaut that had gone far beyond him as a man.  Soap and Price were left with the dismal realization that their only hope was to \"Find Makarov\" and... then what?  By that point, Makarov didn't matter anymore; no one person did.  The war was started, and a great host of individuals were involved.  The same way killing Bin Laden doesn't end the war in Afghanistan or Iraq, killing Makarov would not end World War III.And yet that sentiment and feeling is completely gone from this game.  One of the earliest missions of the games even sees the Russian president Vorchevsky negotiating for peace with the United States.  This and the events of that mission completely KILL the product's salepoint of WORLD WAR III---it's no longer a dismal, distressing shade of gray, with Russia going to war because America was found to have committed a massacre at the Zakhaev International Airport, a massacre actually committed by terrorists disguised as Americans, complete with an undercover soldier-turned-CIA agent unwittingly exposed, and his body left for the authorities to find and identify.Here, it's right back to simplistic black and white---Makarov bad, Everyone else good.  Americans and Russians still fight for most of the game, but you rest easy in the knowledge that it's not REALLY Russia; it's just Makarov in control of it all.  Makarov is no longer the catalyst causing the next international crisis; he IS the international crisis.  He takes the President hostage, and SOMEHOW manages to control all of Russia in the process.Compared with the last game, it went too far with regards to Makarov.  He went from being the instigating force to THE force.  The nearest equivalent I can think of would be if Gavrilo Princip, the anarchist who assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand and started the Great War, had kidnapped the Kaiser and taken control of all of Germany, and started personally directing the war.It's just not as good, and the entire story suffers as a result.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2011"}

First off, lemme just say that I haven't gotten into the Single Player mode. If you want to know about that, read other reviews. Plus, this is the first COD game I ever actually played, so I'm not sure how accurate this review may be for you if you are one to be a COD fan.Anyway, I had always known that COD: Modern Warfare 3 was one of the most overrated things ever, but I never actually known that to the fullest extent, because, of course, I hadn't played it. So I decided to do just that.The game was a freaking mess.While the graphics were pretty good, they just aren't really full of life, and they are talked about too much as being \"the best/most realistic graphics ever\". You can't even tell where an enemy is unless you either (a) die, (b) see him right in front of you, or (c) see them on the radar while they are firing their guns (Which may as well go back to \"a\").As for the sound department....All you'll hear are gun sounds. No enemy footsteps. I desperately tried to find enemies around. There was a radar at the top-left corner of the screen, so I thought I'd use that for my advantage. BOY was I wrong. My opponents somehow pop up out of nowhere without appearing on the radar! I was killed before I realized it. Every. Single. Time. You die way too easily in this, unless you're an obsessed professional.And on top of that, chances are you will encounter players that love to talk trash for some reason. The first time I played, there was some random guy insulting me repeatedly. Fortunately, not all servers are like that, but since you can't pick the servers you go into, you'll never know if you'll end up playing with trolls or not. I know this isn't the game's fault, but it's no less moronic and distracting, especially when the insults are aimed directly at you.Overall, you are so much better off not buying this crap. I didn't even buy the game, and I should probably demand for a refund. And to just think - People paid SIXTY bucks for this golden turd. I haven't played another COD game, but I'm pretty sure I won't come back to THIS series anytime soon. Stick with Team Fortress 2. That game, as a whole, is free (on Steam).

{"product_name":"B001CWXAP2","description":"","reviewerName":"Enjolras","summary":"Initial thoughts: doesn't meet KOTOR's standards","reviewText":"I loved KOTOR and was thrilled when I first heard The Old Republic came out. I recently got it and so far I've been disappointed. I know, there's hundreds of hours to the game, but I thought I'd share some initial thoughts and write a review I wish I'd read before purchasing it.STORYI got the game primarily because I loved KOTOR's story. Unfortunately, after playing SWTOR for hours, I still don't see any signs of a compelling story. Where KOTOR immediately threw you into a compelling story (flee the Endar Spire, save Bastila!), in SWTOR five hours on you're still going around the Jedi Temple grounds killing local monsters with no sense of the wider story.This is really problematic because there aren't any compelling characters to accompany you on your quest in the beginning. Within 5 hours of KOTOR, you had already met Carth Onasi, Mission Vao, and Big Z (and Bastila and Canderous Ordo, depending on how long you took). By contrast, I just found the droid T-7. This makes the game feel extremely lonely as there are no characters by my side and therefore little dialogue.I'm sure as the game progresses there will be more characters and a richer story. But I feel like I'm playing the game more out of duty and in the hope that it gets better rather than because I can't wait to find out how the story unfolds.GAMEPLAYThe lack of a story would matter somewhat less if the gameplay were more exciting. Again, most of the missions are just going around killing enemies. There's little of the sort of interactive, story-based missions that made KOTOR feel like such an open world. The only one I've encountered so far, the forbidden romance between the two Jedi, was pretty short and almost perfunctory. Maybe the story will get deeper, but as a mission it seems like an aside rather than a mission quest that develops the character.The control interface isn't bad. The attacks are all arrayed on a display at the bottom and other displays allow you to see your inventory and map live during gameplay. However, SWTOR doesn't have an in-game tutorial which means the learning curve is a bit steeper.I have no interest in most of the MMO features and don't play games to make friends online, so I can't comment on how those work.GRAPHICSSo far, from what I've seen the graphics are almost worse than KOTOR's! Yes, the characters are more rounded and have more polygons. Yes, the textures are probably better. But the art direction is just a horrible fit for Star Wars. The worlds come across as shallow corridors rather than wondrous environments. You don't get the sense of stepping into a real world, like you do on Taris or Dantooine in KOTOR. The lighting in SWTOR is a bit overwhelming and too bright, not really reflecting the subtleties of sunlight. Also, the grass doesn't seem to move when you walk, unlike the fields in KOTOR's Dantooine.The characters are even worse. They look goofy. The hair almost never looks quite right. It looks like everybody is wearing a toupee. My character has an odd way of running, lifting his legs up and slightly outwards, almost as if he has a wedgie (by contrast, KOTOR's characters were great to look at from behind when running). Some of the more important non-playable characters look alright, such as the Jedi Masters on the Council, but overall I just can't take most of the characters seriously because of the art.SOUNDWhile many have commended the voice acting, I've found it a bit lackluster. Admittedly, that's probably more due to the lackluster characters than the acting ability itself. Nonetheless, I have yet to hear a really memorable voice that really defines a character. No gruff Canderous, no bossy Bastila - basically, everybody I've met has the same old flat voice.Sadly, the game has overall been a disappointment. It seems Bioware was more interested in making an MMO than making a worthy successor to KOTOR. What made KOTOR work was the combination of memorable characters and exciting story. I couldn't wait to keep play. By contrast, SWTOR so far lacks both. I know, I know, it's a big game, I've only played the Jedi class, and it will grow. Still, it's the game's job to get me excited, not my job to defend the game. I'll keep playing and give it a chance, but more out of obligation and the hope that it will get better than because I'm genuinely excited.I'll revise my review once I play more.UPDATE (02/27/2012):I'm at level 18 now and the game is starting to pick up. Still not a really compelling story, but at least there are Sith and a broader plot. Also, it seems like there's more going on now than simply hacking away at human enemies. I'd revise my initial review to 2.5 stars, but most of what I wrote still stands.UPDATE (03/10/2012):I'm at level 22 now but I just got frustrated with the game and decided to cancel my subscription. After all that time playing, I still feel like the game didn't have enough story. I just got sick of going around killing nameless villains for no real payoff. While I could see the story starting to take shape, it was pretty boring and didn't seem particularly well thought out. I'd rather just play KOTOR again and reexperience a true masterpiece.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2012"}

The NFS franchise has done it again. They've managed to go beyond their expectations and deliver the racing game of its time. Some people are eagerly anticipating Gran Tourismo 4, but I've always preferred the NFS games.There are major improvements that were both a relief and a milestone at the same time. First is the graphics. Crisp, clear and a lot of definition. It makes Underground 1 look like a PS1 game. Then there's the gameplay. There's a lot more variety with cars, modifications and tracks. The free roaming is a great idea too (although not completely original). Also, as you would expect, there's a bunch of side stuff you can do, like doing photo shoots, challenge races, hidden races and of course, trade ins and mods. Also, returning to the franchise is the replay feature.I don't do online gaming, so I can't comment on that aspect.Now here's the part where I explain why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. As I said before, the free roaming feature is cool. Also, it can be a bit annoying at times. You have to drive all over to do anything, including entering races, doing mods and also swiching cars. Sometimes a shop and/or race will be clear on the other side of the map. The GPS tracking system is the saving grace here, but sometimes you can't activate it and then it becomes a real pain. My other major gripe is the trade ins. On Underground 1, if you traded cars, you would still keep all of your custom parts. Well, not in Underground 2.

While some levels emphasize pure action, others require you to puzzle your way out of the mazes and illusions. If you find the hidden key in Star World, you'll gain access to the extremely challenging Special World, which has its own hidden secrets.Mario and Luigi can jump up and down pipes, climb vines, swim, and toss Koopa shells. Yoshi the dinosaur can spit eggs, munch, and climb with his ever-helpful tongue. Cool touches include spinning platforms, forced-scrolling levels, and great attacks such as the spin jump. Mario and Yoshi fly with the aid of a unique feather, shoot fireballs when equipped with a special flower, and can even raise cute baby Yoshis. Each boss poses a unique challenge. Cross-eyed Lemmy Koopa likes to play hide-and-seek in pipes, while Iggy Koopa prefers to battle on a giant Koopa shell floating on a lava lake.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Super Mario World is a nice treat.","reviewText":"One of the greatest SNES games of all time comes to the GBA in this re-release. Super Mario World for some actually came with the Super Nintendo so I've no doubt people have played it before.  It's still a classic years later and not much really holds it down.The graphics are about the same as they were on the SNES.  Some of them look smoother and more lavish than they did before. Other than that there is no real different that you'd take direct notice to in the graphics of this game.  The game moves at faster speeds as well, but again nothing you won't remember from the original SNES release.The gameplay is also more or less the same.  A few differences are clear, such as the game is now only one player and not two.  You still select levels that you want to go to.  If it has a yellow mark there is only one exit and therefore the level is straight forward.  If the mark is red that means there is more than one exit in a level.  This allows more exploration than that of Super Mario Brothers 3.  You'll find many different ways to go through levels, eventually finding all 96 exits.I'm assuming we all know the power-ups but let's review. The super mushroom of course turns a small Mario into Super Mario.  The flower gives him flower power and the feather lets him and smack people with his cape.  Mario can also exececute spin jumps to kill enemies.  Simple gameplay that hasn't changed much from previous Mario games.My con with the gameplay is that the game has been toned down and made easier.  Things that would normally kill you in one hit rather you were big or small (Such as the spikes in Castle 6) no longer do that.  Also, I remember in the SNES version that when you were hit by an enemy while you were Flower or Cape Mario, you were instantly small again.  In this one if you have a feather or  flower power up then you instantly go back to Super Mario and then you'll have to be hit again to go back to small Mario.  Amazingly enough that one thing brings the difficulty of the game down greatly.  There are power ups in every other box.The story in this is that Bowswer has kidnapped Princess Toadstool and Yoshi's friends.  Each world has a castle that you must destroy by defeating the castle boss. Defeating the boss rescues one of Yoshi's friends.  Once you find all of Yoshi's friends you can take the battle to Bowser himself.Mario World is a rather large game.  There is no one set path to complete this game in.  It's possible to complete the game after finding as littls as 12 exits if you're good enough. That's because there are warps in certain worlds that take you to others with little hassle.Oh yeah the original Mario Bros. is on this one but if you have the first Mario Advance or any other one you'll probably ignore this one.To sum it all up, Mario World is a Mario game worth playing. You'll find yourself playing it again and again and the 96 exits will keep you busy for a while.  Great game! Worth the buy if you don't have it on SNES.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2003"}
{"product_name":"B004FS8LYK","description":"","reviewerName":"Matthew Wiltshire","summary":"Tomb Raider is a fluid, fun, and very atmospheric action adventure game","reviewText":"Tomb Raider is an action-adventure game very similar to Uncharted, but less scripted, more gritty and atmospheric, and more focused on exploration.Lara Croft is the best female lead I&#8217;ve played in a game. She isn&#8217;t a female for the sake of being a female and the gameplay is the best suggestion as to why this is such a breath of fresh air. The fluidity of the game is unmatched. She is nimble, quick, graceful, and resourceful all of which explain how she is able to accomplish what she does especially during frenetic firefights and crumbling environments.  Using the bow never got dull for one second. The climbing isn&#8217;t tiresome or tedious like Uncharted nor does it seem to suffer from too much &#8220;convenient ledge syndrome&#8221; since the environment is so well integrated.It feels as if the designers first crafted the island then the rest of the game. It is integrated so well. Games like Uncharted feel like the environments are molded to what is supposed to happen in the game. It&#8217;s not like most games where you land in a giant empty room and know there is going to be a huge firefight. Additionally, the graphics are beautiful and the framerate on the PS3 holds very well.The game&#8217;s dark and moody atmosphere is done well and the story is completely unpredictable. This kept me on edge. I really felt the high stakes. The game has a great leveling system. I actually wanted to explore so I could upgrade the weapons. Another positive is the nice menus. Lastly, the game starts off quickly and never lets go.I have a few complaints. First, the story could have used a better supporting cast. The quick time events are awful and some are the type where they randomly pop out of nowhere and if you don&#8217;t hit them then you die. The game could have used a few more hours. It did seem slightly short.Tomb Raider is one of the biggest surprises and although it has a few minor faults, it is one of my favorite games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2014"}

Martin","summary":"Too much driving!","reviewText":"Mafia II has many good points but unfortunately it comes along at a time where huge open world games have just gotten too big and the game falls in to that trap. I did more driving in this game than actual missions.Mafia II takes place in the late 1940's in to the 1950's with the gamer playing the character of Vito. Vito returns home from World War II to find his family deeply in debt and himself without a job. So, under the advice of his buddy Joe Barbaro, Vito joins up with one of the mob families in Empire Bay (modeled on New York City and seemingly parts of Chicago too) in order to earn enough cash to pay his family's debts.The rest of the game consists of basically the same types of killing/robbing/chasing missions gamers have become familiar with during the Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row games as well as the original Mafia game. There's not really anything new in terms of game play. The graphics are good and the cars are pretty accurately modeled on their real life 1950's counterparts. Some of the cars handle horribly in high speed chases so you'll need to learn which car to heist if you need to get away from the cops quickly and effectively.I didn't enjoy this game as much because after about half of the game I just got tired of so much driving. The world isn't as big as Liberty City but it felt like I was always driving halfway across the city for each mission. The fact that by halfway through the game I just didn't like Vito any more didn't help matters either. Also, don't expect to be able to do much in the game world other than the story missions. Most of the buildings aren't interactive like they are in Liberty City.  Lastly, the ending of the game is really poor. There just didn't feel like any closure to Vito's story at all.If you like GTA/Saints Row type games, or if you played the original Mafia and liked it, you'll probably like this game too. Because there aren't any side quests or any real reason to even go in to the few buildings that you can go in to, I finished the game in about 12 hours.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2010"}

{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"Charlie Spivey \"Gamer\"","summary":"WOW!!!! A WINNER!!!!","reviewText":"I had already played through Uncharted: Drakes Fortune twice. I was doubtful that the follow up would be as good, but enjoyable. Well, although, I have only about 2 hours of gameplay thus far, I can assure you, that the next adventure is not only as good, but better. For those who have not experienced the first one, I would highly recommend you do so, to really get an appreciation of Uncharted 2. I have seen reports of people whose PS3 apparantly overheated. Yes it really does use the GPU to it's fullest and most of the PS3's were the first generation consoles (Nov. '06). My guess is that over the years there has been a build up of dust inside and a can of compressed air should help that out. There are a number of cut scenes at the beginning of the game that may upset some as well as some Flashback things that will ultimately bring you to the present, with a knowledge of how you came to be where you are. The only advice here is to be patient and let the game unfold. Hopefully, this is the new Sony Playstation franchise. Nathan, Elena, and Sully are back for yet another adventure.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0086V5V9A","description":"","reviewerName":"007 \"cmyth007\"","summary":"VERY well done, significant improvements.","reviewText":"Let me start off by saying that I've been playing the Splinter Cell (SC) series for a lot of years. While some fans have been put off by the changes over the years, I haven't minded them as much. I really enjoyed the last game, and loved the coop element of Conviction. I was very happy to see them continue with that option, but in a much more fully realized way.To start off, the controls are much better this time around. There are a lot of weapons as well, including: pistols, shotguns, snipers, SMG's and assault rifles. On top of that you have specialty weapons, gadgets and suits. Each and every one of them can be upgraded with improvements that are persistent through all types of game play. So there are a lot of things to spend your money on, which you earn by completing missions, challenges and objectives. You can even upgrade your HQ, a specialized cargo plane with cutting edge tech that helps you out with additional equipment and mission assistance.The one thing I haven't seen as an improvement is the mark and execute system. Although I enjoyed it in Conviction, I was under the impression that it was improved on to allow more fluidity. So far it seems the same as it was in the last game, except that your execute meter can be filled up with more than just hand to hand attacks. Maybe I'm missing something on this, and if I am I hope someone will point it out.Levels are big--much bigger and less linear than Conviction, offering a wide variety of methods for Sam to play through. I was very impressed with this and look forward to playing through the levels multiple times in different ways. And bravo for making virtually every level playable on coop.The DEVS brought back spies vs. Mercs, which is the multiplayer mode and fan favorite that was missing in the last installment. Kudos again for listening to fans. But they didn't just bring it back, they made improvements. Now you can have mixed teams of spies and mercs on the same side, which I'm sure is going to offer a very fun game mechanic. The one thing I don't know is if you can all be on one side and play against bots, or if you can only play against human players. I forgot to look when I played earlier, so hopefully someone can fill me in on this. If they do offer that option, I will be back to bump up my score to five stars.There was a problem installing the disks, so I hope this helps some of you. There are two disks with the game, but you have to install them in a very specific way. Install the first disk normally. Then put in the second disk but do NOT install it. Boot the game from the second disk and it will ask you if you want to install the High Definition texture pack. Say yes and it will install just fine. If you install the second disk the same way as the first, it will get hung up when installing the HD pack and won't work. Do it the way I mentioned and it'll work flawlessly.Like many of you, I miss the iconic voice of Michael Ironsides. He will always be Sam Fisher to me, but I also understand why they made the decision they did. They were doing the voice capture along with the motion capture, and Michael isn't the young man he used to be. But it pays off in terms of animation. Sam's movements and hand to hand fighting are gorgeous and some of his takedowns are sweet.Overall this game is a half step back to the more stealth based type of game play. Sam can't take as many shots as in Conviction, so many old-school fans are likely to enjoy the increased emphasis on stealthy. With the large levels and so many ways to get through them, you can expect some serious time in this game. The first full level after the intro mission took me about 50 minutes and I went through it far faster than I would have if I was going for the ghost or panther playstyle. I didn't time the rest of the levels, but they were pretty lengthy as well. I believe there are fourteen levels, give or take. I forgot to make a final count when I finished. Either way that is a pretty long game that will keep you busy for a long, long time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-23-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0086V5V9A","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"Very fun, but it has its flaws","reviewText":"I have always been a Splinter Cell fan, since getting the first one for Christmas many years ago.  Since then, whenever a Splinter Cell game came out, I would always make it a priority to get it.  I have been fairly impressed with Splinter Cell games up until Double Agent, which was virtual unplayable for me on the 360, and just ok on the regular XBOX. Conviction was the first Splinter Cell game I didn't buy because I didn't like how the game just seemed dumbed down from previous Splinter Cell titles.I recently heard about Splinter Cell Blacklist and suspecting it would be dumbed down too, I didn't pay it much attention, however luck would have it that I was able to get this game with no cost to me, so I decided to try it out since I had nothing to lose.  I have put many hours on this game already, and while there are still some aspects I don't like, it is still a very fun game to play.I never played Conviction other than the Demo, so I have no idea how and if it ties into this game, but in this game Sam Fisher must stop the terrorist organization known as the Engineers who are carrying out various terror attacks against the U.S. as long as their demands are not met.This is a very difficult review to write because while its fun to play, there are a few things about the game I really do not like.  Because overall I do like this game, I will start with the good.The Good=========Graphics:Graphics are great in this game.  Prior to getting to play this game, I was prompted to install an \"HD Texture Pack\" which is included on the 2nd CD. (This game is two CD'S).  This is optional but the game lets you know it improves the visual experience of the game.  I decided to go through with the 3+ GB install which took about an hour.  When it was finally completed I was satisfied with the resultsStory line:As with all the other Splinter Cell games I've played, the story telling is very good so far.  If you liked past Splinter Cell games, you will feel right at home with this one as well.Gadgets:Sam as access to an arsenal of weapons and cool gadgets.  My favorite gadget is the sticky camera which you can use to watch enemies from a far and lure them in with noise.  Once they get close you can choose to put them to sleep with sleeping gas, or detonate the camera and kill them instantly.  I use this camera on annoying dogs and it has saved me on many occasions.Stealth:I love stealth games and they are a nice break from your mindless shoot em up games that are out these days.  Of course you don't have to go stealth, but being that you are always outnumbered it may be your best bet most of the time.Length:One big problem I have had with games in the past is the short length.  Most games these days can be completed with in a few hours, but this doesn't seem to be the case with SC:Blacklist.  There is just so much stuff to do with optional missions you can do, I really believe I will be satisfied with the length once I finally beat the game.  I have already logged about 12 hours with this game and I am just starting my 3rd campaign mission.  I suspect a lot of my time was spent replaying sections I kept dying on due to playing on \"Realistic\" difficulty, but I think even without the restarts, the game length will be much better than my recent experiences with games.Multplayer:Though I haven't actually tried multiplayer yet, it seems like it can be very fun working together with another Splinter Cell fan who understands the aspects of stealth and more importantly working together as a team.  Some missions in the game can only be completed with co-op play, and I really would like to try those levels as more and more people get this game.The Bad=========The following reasons are way I gave this game 3 stars instead of 4No Manual saves:Again, I don't know why every game manufacturer is moving away from manual saves.  I ran into this issue with BioShock Infinite and God of War Ascension.  The exclusion of manual saves means one thing, you will have to play many sections over and over and over again.  There are very few things more frustrating than spending nearly a half hour trying to get by one section, only to be killed 5 feet from the next save point.  This happens to me on way too many occasions with this game forcing me to do sections I have already completed.  The lack of manual saves is an automatic one star deduction.Controls:The games controls leave a lot to be desired because like I experienced with my brief time with SC:Conviction, you have less control over what you want Sam to do.  This is partly because the \"A\" button basically does everything.  The issue with this is that you literally have to be facing a certain way for \"A\" to do what you want.  This causes many cases in which Sam does one thing when you want to do something completely different.  For example, I was on one board and I was standing right by a door, a light switch and a pipe from the ceiling.  What I wanted to do, was to peek under the door, so I had to move the thumb stick so the \"Peek under\" prompt came up, but at the last second the prompt switched to \"Open door\" so by the time I pressed the \"A\" button, Sam opened the door with two enemies inside.  I immediately tried to position Sam to close the door before I was spotted, but I couldn't do it in time, so my next option was to try to jump on on the pipe.  So I'm moving Sam around for the \"Jump\" prompt to come up and it does, but again at the last second the prompt changes to \"Turn on light\" so instead of jumping Sam turns the light on.  I end up getting spotted and the mission is over; so I have to start the level all over again.  I was stuck on this one level for many hours not only because I'm playing on \"Realistic\" difficulty but because the controls are not that intuitive; especially not in situations that require you to make split second decisions.Kinect voice recognition:In theory you can use your Kinect to attract guards by saying \"Hey you\", but strangely while you can attract guards at anytime by pressing the back button, you can only use Kinect to attract guards when the prompt comes up.  This inconsistency is annoying.  Also annoying with the Kinect feature is that many times guards automatically hear you as soon as the Kinect \"Hey you\" prompt comes up without me even saying anything.  I can only guess that the Kinect sensor is picking up background noise and registering it as a voice command.  Next time I play I'm going to disconnect the Kinect sensor because it is basically useless.The Weird=========While it does not affect my rating in any way, I would like to mention that Sam Fisher looks quite different from he did in previous titles, and is no longer voiced by Michael Ironside.  He as a character looks a little weird; while he is definitely graying, his body type and facial structure make him appear younger than I remember him in the last couple of Splinter Cell titles I have played.  It doesn't really bother me, it is just different.  His new voice takes a bit getting used to as well, but it doesn't really detract from the overall game play.Conclusion==========All in all this is a good game and in fact I can't wait to get home to play it some more, but my issues with the game are huge issues for me and really hurt a game that could have been great. I could probably deal with the lack of manual saves if it wasn't for the finicky controls, and alternatively I could probably deal with the finicky controls if it wasn't for the lack of manual saves.  I will more that likely end up completing this game, but the jury is still out if I will play through it again when I'm done.This review will more than likely be updated as I progress further into the game, but for now I'm giving it 3 stars overall, with a fun factor of 4.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2013"}

This was one game where stealth was key as you took out targets quietly and quickly to achieve your objective. Now the latest offering from ubisoft is called Splinter Cell: Blacklist but is this a mission that you will want to go on?The game puts you back into the role as Sam Fisher as a group of terrorists calling themselves the engineers has struck a military installation on the island of Guam. They have released a broadcast demanding that the United States pull back all of their troops or they are going to start going off of a blacklist cutting off America's food and fuel. It is up to Sam Fisher and his elite team to find out who the engineers are and put a stop to this new threat.With a few leads to go on you and your team are put on board one of the latest aircraft that is simply known as the paladin. This plane has the latest technology onboard that can analyze tons of data and can take you to various destinations throughout the world. Missions can take place anywhere from on American soil (such as Pittsburgh and the Yucatan in Mexico) to overseas (such as London and Estonia).The way that you take on every mission is important as there are three different types of play styles the game recognizes. You can take out your enemies quickly and quietly but without lethal force in Ghost mode, take them out quickly and quietly but using lethal force in Panther mode or just go loud with the Assault mode leaving no one left behind. You will have access to some of the most cutting edge gear on the planet including a new item called the tri-rotor. What this little drone does is that it can maneuver places that Sam cannot go, is whisper quiet so it cannot be picked up by enemies and shoots sticky-shocker projectiles that can incapacitate enemies. You will need to complete these missions efficiently as you get money from each successful mission and you can use this to purchase new gear, upgrade your gear and even upgrade the paladin as well.Splinter Cell: Blacklist has an engaging storyline, great game mechanics and delivers an experience that has never been offered before.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2013"}

The most annoying is getting use to how to shoot the ball, It's far too overly complicated and it sort of takes the fun out of playing. The graphics are sort of disappointing and could have been much better. The animations (such as a close up of a coach or player standing around) are a little disappointing as well. I absolutely hate the menu layout for this game. I don't like how every time someone changes a team, Both sides do a quick flash of someone changing their team despite you not changing your's. The AI in this game are ok at times but poor at others.I have to admit though, I play this game with my brother and we have a ton of fun whenever we manage to get a basket in.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2013"}

Than I saw this item on Amazon as well as a few other models, at first I wasn't sure which one to get but after checking most of the reviews on the different models I felt this one was the best for my problem.  The transfer cable works pretty easy you have one slot that goes over the old Xbox 360 hard drive slot and than the other end is a usb plug which you just put into anyone of the usb ports on the new slim 360.  After about half a minute you'll get a pop up box on the t.v. screen asking if you want to transfer from the hard drive to the slim 360 console's hard drive or vice-versa,  after your done the old Xbox 360 hard drive is empty of all data which if you have a friend or someone you know who need a hard drive then you can resale the hard drive to them.  The one question remains though after you're done you pretty much don't need this item so much unless you have another old xbox 360 hard drive and have to do this again,  and since you can't use this cable on the 2.5. hard drives that the slim 360 is using what use do you really have for the transfer cable now.  So while it is useful for at most a onetime deal is it worth this price?,  thatI can't really answer after seeing all the bad reviews for the other transfer cables that were going for $4.00 dollars I think at the end it's basically going to be up to the buyer.  So yes this cable does work very easily for what you need but I would wait to see is the price goes down just a little more but considering this comes from Microsoft I wouldn't hold my breathe....","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2011"}

It can be really easy to complete the mission and not know where to \"turn in\". This can lead to some frustration. I had to defeat one boss twice because of this, so be careful here.

It's also a lot of fun and simplistically unique. Usually we see Shooter elements added to an RPG, when there are plenty of people (such as myself) who would prefer a great shooter with some RPG elements instead. And that's what this game provides. It looks and plays like nothing else out there. And, as there are some RPG elements going on here, your character just feels more and more powerful every time you play. Thankfully, the game also keeps the drawn out talks and cut scenes to a minimum and presents them, instead, in the form of activity (always a plus). But there were a few areas where this game fell short for me, which keeps me from honestly being able to call it a 5 star game. Firstly, there's the split-screen coop. I was crestfallen to find that the split-screen was vertical instead of horizontal. This made everything about the coop campaign painful. You already have a very limited range of view in a first person game, without having half of that peripheral taken away. It was too easy to get lost on screen and anytime you had to read something you'd find yourself toggling the controller back and forth to show you the part of the screen that didn't fit. The map was also a disappointment. Sounds a bit nitpicky I'm sure, but since you have to do so much running from place to place in this game (which is another drawback), the map should simplify your trips. But too often it was difficult to get my bearings. And I have dealt with a great many less-than-spectacular maps before. So trust that this is a valid complaint. I didn't like that you couldn't pick things up simply by running over them. I understand WHY you can't, because you sometimes need to leave things behind for the other player (if playing 2 player), but it was still annoying. First you would reload, THEN you'd pick up the objects; often resulting in near-deaths. Another issue was the timing of things throughout the game. I hate games in which objects disappear if you don't pick them up in a certain amount of time. Sadly, that's what you should expect to find here. Certain abilities (such as your jump) were pretty gimmicky. But that didn't really take away from the experience the way it would in most other games. If you can accept these imperfections, then you will likely find that this game is worth owning. There is enough replay value and online multiplayer to keep you enjoying it long after you've beaten it. It won't be for everyone. But most people will find something to love here.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2011"}

{"product_name":"B003O6KWZK","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Cooper","summary":"Questionable Additions/Removals That Deter From Longstanding Strengths","reviewText":"Twisted Metal (2012) is based on a great franchise with excellent core gameplay.  However, this newest release tries to apply an assortment of mode variations (taken from FPS and racing games) with questionable results.Instead of being able to choose from a macabre cast of characters (as in past titles) you find yourself tied to (3) players: Sweettooth, Mr.Grimm, and Dollface (which are unlocked in that order).  Each character has (3) 2-3 min movies that blend live-action and CGI to great effect, even though the middle cinematic is partially relegated to flashbacks from the original video.Combat and vehicle handling are tight.  Weapons are varied and mostly balanced, and the helicopter Talon is actually pretty fun to use.  As a result, online play can be enjoyable if you select the right matches and modes. However, in an attempt to add variety, the modes too often stray from what is fun.Once vehicles have been unlocked by a character's gang they can be used during other matches. It seems kind of odd to use Sweettooth on Mr.Grimm's motorcycle, or to drive Shadow with Dollface - but that's what you'll find. (Axel is only playable as DLC).  The good part is that you can use your favorite car in almost every level.  However, the PROBLEM is that the new level designs almost force you to select certain cars to proceed in single player or be competitive online.Ultimately, you end up choosing what works best for certain scenarios and less of who you would LIKE to play as.  Twisted Metal was always a car combat game built around single elimination death matches.  The new game changes that, and not necessarily for the better.  On the rooftops there will be an inordinate number of people using the helicopter Talon.Likewise, in checkpoint races everyone will choose Kamikaze or Crimson Fury (paint variations of the fastest vehicle). Here you must beat your opponents to certain destinations without missing too many gates.  The problem is that this is NOT Mario Kart, or Blur where weapons will knock people off the track.  In those games, any vehicle has a CHANCE to win.  In this game Crimson Fury or Kamikaze will ALWAYS win.  Unless you choose one or the other, you have absolutely no chance of winning.  Missles and even special moves (with the exception of the magnet) will never knock the cars off of their path.  In addition, going through checkpoints replenishes health.Cage Matches force you to do battle in certain sections of a level surrounded by lighted green grids.  If you stay outside the grid for too long, you take damage.  The problem is that vehicles with less health/shields will usually die if you are not concentrating on making your way back into the \"cage\" at EVERY given moment.  Less shields = more damage = death if you get lost enroute.  I finally beat these levels with Mr. Grimm, but only because his special move does an insane amount of damage once you charge it up (160) and I killed each car with two direct hits and no misses.  This does NOT work online with skilled players.  Most people end up selecting the same tougher vehicles.Other levels have Juggernaut trucks that endlessly respawn enemies.  You must either destroy them and all the other vehicles on the map, or continue killing cars until you have reached a quota.  This is more frustrating than fun, since it offers little opportunity to search levels for new weapons or ammo.  Instead, you must destroy everything as quickly as possible and hope your vehicle spawns in a good location.Throughout the 18 levels or so of single player there are only 2-3 REAL deathmatch battles.  Ultimately this is where I feel most disappointed.  Twisted Metal is NOT a FPS.  Capture the flag (with gang leaders you return to a missle launcher), races, and cage matches really do not do the game mechanics justice.  Combine that with a limited number of characters and cinematics, and I feel somewhat let down.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------OVERALL:So, all in all - the core mechanics are still great. Graphics have low textures, but are still manageable. The 9 cinematics are well done (although more would have been welcome), and the helicopter is a decent addition to gameplay.Yet aside from VERY SPECIFIC online modes, a lot of this game just isn't as fun as previous entries.  The bottom line is that most of the new modes do not work in context. I wish this had been a game that played to the strengths of the series without trying to revolutionize the core gameplay.Twisted Metal is probably still a game worth buying, but I ABSOLUTELY recommend waiting until the price goes below $30.7.5/10","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2012"}

My heart warms every time I run into a familiar place from the first game and then I have to try and remember how I solved that particular puzzle. The AI is pretty brain dead. Who knew bears couldn't climb stairs? But still, turning corners and not knowing if their are wolves about to spring out at you, creates a lot of suspense that the first game had. And the graphics are just beautiful. The PS2 still has a lot of fight left in her!Tomb Raider Legends had a lot of great elements that I missed in this game and I hope they will continue with that in the next Tomb Raider. But this is a remake of the first and I understand a lot of the choices they made.The controls are pretty good. I can now jump to where I want to jump and not die like I did so many times in TR1. The problem is really with the camera which is sort of confusing because it was so good in Legends. Often times, the camera is way too close to Lara and you can't see if there are enemies after you. You have to constantly adjust it. It's a little annoying but nothing that would keep me from absoutely loving this game!Graphics: 5.0Sound: 5.0Controls: 4.0Fun Factor: 5.0","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2007"}

If I have the system, I purchase the game within a few days or weeks of it's release. Sure the fundamentals of the game are the same, but generally there's enough new additions to the game to make the new purchases all worthwhile.With that in mind, I was eager to pick up City Folk. I'd loved the stuff that had come out on the GameCube & the DS, so I figured that I'd fall just as much in love with the Wii version. Well... after playing it off & on, I came to one conclusion: while the game was interesting, it was just much more fun to play this on the DS & GameCube. Granted, this version has a few new tricks such as being able to go to the city & a few new characters to meet. But there were just a few things that I thought got in the way of gameplay.It was strange getting used to playing with the new remote of the Wii. It made it a lot harder to position my character to move things about in the house or pick up or use my tools. After a while practice made it easier, but it was still a pain to get used to. The same thing goes for writing letters- letter writing is sort of a dull task to do now.The worst thing I've come in contact with so far though, is that the grass gets worn down depending on how frequently your character walks across it. If you were to run across the grass, it'll wear it down even faster. Since there's no quick & easy way to get the grass BACK, this makes for a huge pain- especially since there's stuff in the game that's grass dependent. I can understand that this is to make the game more realistic, but it's just something that is pretty much a pain in the tuckus. You can supposedly plant lots of flowers that will help the grass come back, but come on... not all players want to spend hours maintaining their towns- they want to PLAY! (My house is a great example of that- my mom & sister don't mind spending time maintaining everything, but my niece & I just want to get out there & play around.)Overall, this is something I'd recommend for most AC fans. For the newbies, this game will be illuminating- they'll more than likely love it. For the AC fans though, we won't find much new stuff here. It'll be mostly for the novelties.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2009"}
