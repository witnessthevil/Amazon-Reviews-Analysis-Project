{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Wertz \"Imautobot\"","summary":"Good, bad, and occasionally graphic!","reviewText":"For those who loved the GTA series, L.A. Noire has got to be a taste of something familiar.  But that's not always a good thing.  The characters and cars handle about as good as a drunk guy pushing an overloaded wheelbarrow over a grease covered hockey rink.  Now that I've got the biggest negative out of the way, we can move onto more positive territory.The story is pretty solid.  You play Cole Phelps, a war \"hero\" who returns home to work his way through the ranks of the LAPD, and maybe find some absolution for things he took part in overseas.  Phelps seems like a really decent human being, but as time progresses, you begin to realize he's as flawed as anyone.  Actually, as I neared the end of the game I'd completely lost respect for him.  His personal choices, the ones the player cannot control, are what upset me.  I'd developed some level of affection for his straight-shooter type of character, but over time quickly realized that he's almost as pathetic as his crooked partner Roy.Interrogation is a tricky aspect of this game, and I'm not sure I ever really understood how it was supposed to work.  In my experience, people are either lying or telling the truth, the game adds the \"doubt\" option, which is really a curve ball that screws the whole thing up.  Honest people will look you in the eye, and those lying or holding back won't.  If you choose \"Lie\" instead of \"Doubt\" or vice versa (when they aren't looking you in the eye), you have a 50% chance of getting it right, but it's really frustrating when you choose wrong.  Ideally you'd like to be able to save prior to an interrogation, so you can restart if the questioning goes wrong.  Unfortunately L.A. Noire picks it's own save locations, and that never works in your favor.The game rewards good choices with \"intuition\" points which can help you with interrogations or clue finding.  But earning those points in sufficient quantity means engaging in side missions which you'll hear over the car radio (only when you're driving).  I realize this was an attempt to make the game longer and more engaging, but it's more frustrating than anything.  The side missions often entail driving or running, which as I previously mentioned, is very difficult to execute flawlessly.  Moreover, the cover mechanic is dangerous.  You might assume cover around a corner, and while trying to disengage cover and move to different cover, I often found my character confused about his direction.  He'd often step out of cover, into fire, run in a circle and end up where he started, slightly more injured than when he started.  I found that frustrating, but remotely tolerable because my desire to see the games conclusion encouraged me to press on.For people like me who hate how the cars handle you can almost always avoid driving by making your partner drive for you.  However if the mission involves a car chase, you will be forced to drive.  Thankfully, if it seems like you don't have any idea what you're supposed to do in those chases, you're partner will almost certainly give you a clue by suggesting you run someone off the road, or get along side them so they can shoot out the tires.As you scour crime scenes you will discover clues by walking around almost aimlessly.  This becomes very discouraging for the player.  The only way you know you've found a clue is that the controller will vibrate and you'll hear a piano key when you step over a clue.  And as if it wasn't frustrating enough, the developers threw in items which will trigger the vibration which aren't clues at all.  A classic example is beer bottles.  I can't tell you how many random beer bottles I picked up which turned out to be nothing.  I wish the developers would have just made clues obvious by having them glow like items in Bioshock, but I suppose doing so would have voided half the reason for collecting \"intuition\" points.  The frustration aspect of this was ignorable until I got to Rancho Escondido.  By that point in the game you're working in Arson, and someone torched an entire development called Rancho Escondido.  I literally spent 20 minutes walking around this whole development and never found the clue I was looking for.  As it turns out, there is only 1 clue in this whole place, which is almost a needle in a haystack unless you know what you're looking for.  Hint, observing where your partner goes will help you find the only clue.I'm not sure it's a flaw in the story, but it seems more often than not that people who are most likely innocent end up running from the police for almost no reason.  It happens so often it's almost comical.  It's like an average person engaging in a high speed pursuit because they had 1 unpaid parking ticket.  Ultimately this causes you to suspect them of the greater crime, and that is not always a good thing.  By the way, I love how my partner always tells me to go after them suspect, while doing nothing to aide me in the apprehension.L.A. Noire is a great name for this game.  As the name would imply, it's very dark, and doesn't hold any despicable aspect back.  You will find several dead, totally naked, women in the pursuit of the Black Dalia, something which could very well be a first in mainstream gaming.  You also encounter a couple seedy characters that are pedophiles and seem rather unashamed of that.  I realize as a real life detective these things might seem common place, but as a civilian more or less thrown into this world, I found it unsettling, and sick.  I'm somewhat torn about whether I approve of these real world issues because it's not a stretch from reality, or that I want to crawl back into my comfortable suburban life and not think about the sick underbelly of society.  Because whether it's 1947 or 2011, these things do happen.The character faces in L.A. Noire is where is where the game really shines.  It's a technological achievement that should not go unnoticed.  But by the same token, I feel moderately duped.  Having seen how they scanned the faces, in a production trailer, I was a little disappointed at how degraded the end product looked compared to the performance.  It's one of those subtle things that only those who have a keen eye will notice.  But over time, it seemed as though the characters had this moving 2D image simply painted on a 3D face, maybe I just became too critical as the game progressed.  And to be totally fair, they clearly didn't try to compress that data too much since the game takes up a whopping 3 DVD's (Xbox version).By the time you reach the end of the game, you begin to realize that many of the crimes you've investigated may have resulted in you going after the wrong guy.  Now whether or not the \"wrong guy\" was convicted is not always known, it still weighs on your conscious as if you'd personally sent an innocent man to prison.  And as you come to the conclusion of each case and realize how many questions you asked incorrectly, you really begin to doubt the success of the outcome.  So despite its flaws I will be revisiting L.A. Noire with a walkthrough so I can see how much I messed up when I was trusting my gut.Is L.A. Noire a good game?  Yes.  Is it award worthy?  Yes.  Is it flawed? Yes.  But all told, this has been an interesting and emotional experience.  The story pulls you in, and you quickly develop feelings for certain characters, and as with real relationships, those feelings mutate over time as you get to know them better.  Perhaps it's a testament to the story teller's craft that the characters are not cookie cutter.  They are flawed, and despite their artificial nature, they are made human by those flaws.Last words, buy it, but don't play it with your children.  This one's not for the kiddies.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"OoAK","summary":"Refreshing","reviewText":"As you probably noticed by now by reviews, this game definitely isn't for everyone. The Rockstar label made alot of people expect Grand Theft Auto or Red Dead Redemption with a new skin. This is pretty far from those expectations, which will definitely turn alot of people away. A game market saturated with high action first person shooters and over the top visuals and gameplay, this game will be quick to be labeled \"slow\" or \"boring\". So, if you're looking for something like that keeps your heart at 1000bpm, do not buy this game. This game is slow paced with limited action, and requires somewhat good observation skills. This game relies on the fairly good story, fantastic motion capturing, and good acting performances to get you hooked. The Xbox 360 version of this does include 3 discs, which some wish to complain about, but this is also a pretty long storied game so if you can't get up to change a disc every 8 or so hours, then you need a new hobby. But the multiple discs also tells you how big this game really is. Once you start it up and see how seriously good this game looks, you'll understand. It feels alot like an interactive movie at times with how good the motion capturing for the characters are. Another thing is, playing this on Xbox 360, i'd highly recommend installing the game on your hard drive or a flash stick to help with minor framerate issues. Another downside most seem to have is, there isn't really any replay value, other than maybe getting 100% achievements. But, again that's why it's good that this game is as long as it is. Also, i'm not really a fan of multiplayer for games like this, so the game being focused on the single player experience is a plus for me, I wish more games were still like this today.Overall, if you're looking for something truly different, not just the same game you've played countless times just in a different location, then I do recommend trying this out. I'd really like to see them expand on this game with a sequel in the future.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2011"}
{"product_name":"B006WQR3GA","description":"","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"A New Fan to the Series","reviewText":"As the title of my review suggests, I'm new to the XCOM series and Enemy Unknown has been an excellent introduction into the alien-smashing real-time strategy franchise. I'm not sure how it's possible that I've never played or worse, heard of this series but if previous entries in the series are anywhere near as good as this title then I might have to go back and pick up previous titles for my legacy systems.XCOM: Enemy Unknown comes from Firaxis Games. As in Sid Meier. This studio has some major chops in the strategy genre and has produced some incredible games not the least of which includes the Civilization series.So first things first, yes this is a turn based strategy game. I'm not exactly a huge fan of the genre and outside of Final Fantasy tactics the vast majority of my RTS'ing has taken place on my PC. Replacing a keyboard and mouse with a controller is always a daunting task - even more so with genres like RTS. But the guys at Firaxis have done the console proud! There are times where I did find myself missing the flexibility and customization that comes with a keyboard and mouse but overall you couldn't really ask for more out of the controller integration.The basic premise of the game is this (Spoiler Free): you're put in command of the XCOM (Extraterrestrial Combat Unit). You're essentially a god-like commander that controls everything from individual unit commands ie: movement, attack, defend; to more complicated tasks of resource allocation, research and development, engineering; to which hot-zones around the world you'll defend at the expense of others. The game is set in the \"real world\" with some deviations where needed. You start out by picking your zone to build your XCOM home-base - North America, South America, EU or Africa. Each has distinct pro's and con's. Starting out in North America might net you more resources at the beginning but a lower monthly stipend for example.When you're not directing troops against the alien invaders you'll be at your bunker HQ allocating precious resources to gain the upper hand in combat. There is a lot to do here... You can capture alien technology or even aliens on the battlefield and then invest in interrogations and R&D; recruit and train troops, invest in capital projects such as satellite uplinks, foundries, labs, energy plants and more. There is a ton of depth to this aspect of the game and honestly it quickly became my favorite aspect of the game, even more so than the combat action itself.Troops gain levels (in the form of rank) and experience the more they fight. A troop will climb the rung from \"squaddie\" to Lt. Colonel and unlock a slew of bonuses and abilities along the way. You can invest in research projects to improve guns and ammo, scopes, body armor and a whole lot more. To counteract a player having nothing but super-soldiers the game features permanent death for troops that are killed in battle. So likely you'll have a steady stream of new faces rotating into the lineup. Initially I wasn't such a big fan of the injury or KIA system (troops can be knocked out of commission if injured in battle for a set period of days to recuperate) but it adds the right amount of tension to the game. Battles tend to play out a little slower as you have major consequences for sloppy, haphazard movement.Graphics are what I'd call acceptable. They're not bleeding edge but they're not terrible either. The game is built on the Unreal Engine 3 so expect the familiar sheen to the graphics. Troops slightly resemble the Tonka-truck physique of Gears of War characters but with less detail. You're able to customize your troops on a basic level: hair, color, and later equipment.So why not 5-stars?There are some hiccups in the game. The camera can be wonky. Especially having to use the D-pad to rotate the camera in set 45 increments. There are situations where you'll just have to accept a less than ideal vantage. There are a few glitches that I ran into that required restarting my X360 as well. Also, as much fun as this game is it can get extremely repetitive. I was absolutely hooked on the title at first but then slowed down a bit and started playing a few missions at a time. I think it would've been great for Firaxis to mix things up a little bit more especially with the cutscenes that constantly repeat over and over again.Overall though I'm definitely a new fan to this series and recommend this title!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00BMFIXT2","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Wiles Parker","summary":"Great Addition to the Series","reviewText":"I haven't played Assassin's Creed since the first game, which I still need to complete, but I do really enjoy this fourth outing nonetheless. A lot of what I liked about the first game holds true for this newest addition to the series. Black Flag shows some growth both visually and with gameplay and story. The sailing bits are actually really interesting once you figure out the controls. Potentially frustrating at first, yes, but overall it makes a nice change from the running about completing the usual tasks. The hunting parts aren't particularly challenging, but make upgrading the character more interesting and add a few different things to do in each location.  If you're going to have a pirate setting, then the main character needs to do pirate things including sailing ships, getting into naval battles, and plundering.  It makes the whole open world feel that much more open and intriguing.The story is actually really interesting, taking what looks like it's going to be the usual pirate fare and turning it into something else. There's still pirates and the main character is a pirate but also is trying to be assassin. I'm still early in the game, but have found the story sections to be as interesting to watch as playing through the various areas.  Even the Abstergo sections that are outside the main storyline are intriguing enough to not be totally dull.  This is the type of story that feels like there is more and more to uncover as you play for both the main sections and the sideline quests.Since I missed II and III, I cannot compare to those, but I will say that skipping from I to IV hasn't been a problem. The controls are still pretty much the same as the ones I'm familiar with and the gameplay is definitely better. The graphics are still great, so it looks nice visually. I would certainly suggest this game to fans of the series and fans of open world gaming.  Seriously, sailing is a really great way to get from place to place and the different battles you can get into are sort of amazing to beat.  There's plenty to keep going with for days just on the main quests.  Adding all the side quests just draws out the fun. Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is a lot of fun and challenging enough to be interesting without feeling like a complete rehash of what's come before.  Get it if you love the series because it is definitely worth it.  Hard to put down, for sure.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00CQ7CIMS","description":"","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Luigi Alone","reviewText":"When it has came down to Luigi, he had been more or less been known as Mario's sidekick, than having recognition on his own as a remarkable part of the Mario universe. That showed well with Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon for the Nintendo 3DS. But with the Nintendo Wii U, there has not been yet one definitive game as there had shown from the original Nintendo Wii, with s many greats. When New Super Mario Brothers U came out for the system last year, it failed to really get the recognition of past Mario games. Now with the Wii U going into its second year, there is a deeper hope for newer games to ignite. But Nintendo had finally decided to do something to celebrate Luigi alone with his 30th anniversary as a character in the Nintendo universe of games. But it might be a strong celebration.New Super Luigi U is actually a add-on game that works if you have bought New Super Mario Brothers U, which places Luigi against the clutches of Bowser and his Koopa kids all in a race to try and save Princess Peach. The game itself doesn't actually split itself into its own adventure from New Super Mario Brothers U. The graphics handles as well nicely, but the control is simple and doesn't have more than did before. It could've added a little more by adding the Wii's Nunchuck control into the game for better control, something the original game failed to ignite in. The only absolute plus in the game is playing the game with Nabbit, a foolish side-villain that you had to tag in the original game for added adventure. Here Nabbit is a great beginners' character as he is completely invincible to attacks, except falling into pits and getting burnt by lava. He really is a great addition to the Mario universe and a good character. The overall use here of Luigi and Toads do not add much fun and depth to the play.Overall, I did not get much fun out of New Super Luigi U from what I could've gotten out of New Super Mario Brothers U. This is a add-on that you would have to have New Super Mario Brothers U in order to play this game, which was originally for this when Nintendo offered it as a downloadable game for the Wii U earlier this year. But overall, it is fairly good but not what I had wanted for a Luigi game. I would definitely pass this game up overall, and just wait down the road for New Super Mario 3D World, it looked more like a challenge to play worth its money.Graphics: B-Sound: BControl: C+Fun & Enjoyment: C for solo play; C 1/2+ for multiplayerOverall: C+","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2013"}

This game came with high expectations after the stellar second game in the series.  For the most part it lived up to these in my opinion even though it took some risks with the format.This game uses what is called the Trinity system in which you have essentially 3 main characters.  In my opinion this was a great concept because you see similar events through the eyes of each main character.  Later in the game as all characters come together it basically starts playing like the earlier versions.The battle system is slightly different in this version as well.  Instead of choosing actions for each of the six characters, 2 characters act as a team.  So you only input 3 choices.  For the most part this works, although boss fights can be challenging, because only 1 member in the team can use a rune.  Instead of blasting a hard boss with 6 runes a turn, you are only allowed 3.The graphics and music are acceptable, but not outstanding.  I will say however that the opening CG has very beautiful music.  It still rates as one of the best intros to a game in my opinion.The main draw to this game is the story and the fun of trying to find the 108 characters in the game.  The castle building is still fun and the minigames at the castle are also enjoyable.  If you find all 108 you are awarded a very nice bonus at the end of the game.While I think Suikoden 2 and 5 are superior to this one overall, this is still and excellent game.  Get this game now while you can still find it for an affordable price.  Both 1 and 2 in series sell for an insane amount of money.Hope you enjoy the game","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2009"}

I have played Borderlands, Skyrim, BioShock 1 & 2, Mass Effect 2 & 3, and Red Dead Redemption, and this game is every bit as fun as those are. The controls are easy to learn, and I didn't find it too difficult or too easy. It's actually a pretty simple game, and I consider myself a slightly above average gamer. If you die, you won't find yourself backtracking too much because you start out very close to where you died, and there aren't any penalties for dying. You can save your game at anytime and anywhere. I'm a husband, father, and work full time, so hopping on for a quick 20-30 minutes is no problem. About the only negative comments I can make about this collection would be the DLC took about an hour to download, and sometimes it was a little difficult to figure out where I needed to go or what I needed to do to continue with the mission I was on. Other than that, it was a blast to play! Super glad I bought this, and I was hesitant about it, but it's absolutely worth the $30!! You get two great games and a ton of DLC. The Festival Of Blood DLC is like a vampire mini game that plays just like the regular games, and has a nice twist to it. inFAMOUS is on one blue ray disk and inFAMOUS 2 on another blue ray disk, and everything else is downloaded via a code voucher. I would say that inFAMOUS and inFAMOUS 2 are going to take about 15-20 hours each to complete and Festival Of Blood about 5 hours to complete. So that is 35-45 hours of gaming and fun for a reasonable price.

Things get worse at night as a demon world attempts to merge itself with our own. This is the premise of the story as Harry Mason navigates his way through this errily bizzare town that his hauntingly a lot like something only the most twisted and bizar mind could create. Resident Evil has its shock moments, but regardless of what anyone might tell you, for a real scare the original Silent Hill is the game to play. This is hands down the creepiest game, and while it has few of the zombie jumping through the window sort of scares there is a great deal of darkness, and erie sounds to compensate. This is a different kind of horror than RE, a game that bares no resemblance to this original master piece with the exception of the irritating control style, but thats where the similarities end. RE relies on catching you off guard, SH requires you to constantly be on guard and plays on your paranoia the entire time, especially with the radio. While RE comes off as a fun B-movie SH comes off as the darkest dream you don't want to remember, which makes it a worthwhile experience well worth the money.It also features some of the finest FMV sequences to grace the PS1, topping the work of Final Fantasy VIII. The in game graphics leave a lot to be desired though. This is another game I would like to see remade for GCN, however Konami has taken a very stubborn anti-GCN stance, the likelyhood that this will happen is slim.As with most Survival Horror titles this game packs an awkward control style that is even more devistating to the overal game than the RE control because the camera moves as though it were stalking you, a cool effect that is hindered by the horrible control set up, a problem that was adjusted in the PS2/Xbox sequel \"Restless Dreams\". Aside from this complaint the game is brilliant and every horror fan should pick this title up. However, this game is NOT for kids, nor is it for the weak in stomach and faint of heart. It takes a strongh stomach and even stronger will power to get through this game. I don't care how strong you think you are this game will scare you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00006LEMX","description":"Looking for a new obsession to keep you up nights? Let me introduce you to Hotsuma, the main character inShinobi, the much anticipated new action-adventure game from Sega. Fans of the original 2-D game have been waiting seven years for the next installment, and won't be disappointed by this energetic 3-D game for PS2.The premise hasn't changed much--kill bad guys, kill more bad guys, kill a boss, move on to the next level. You, Hotsuma, are the leader of the Oboro clan. As your clansmen are destroyed, you set out to avenge their deaths by slashing hellspawn and enemy ninjas to death with your powerful sword, Akujiki. As you move through game levels, Akujiki comes alive with power, absorbing the souls of those you kill--and turning against you if you don't keep him well fed. The basic moves--run, jump, slash--are easy to learn, but with each level you must master difficult combos to defeat trickier enemies. Moving quickly and attacking instinctively is essential to killing fast and furiously--each kill gives your sword more power, while each moment of hesitation makes your weapon impatient for blood.Shinobi, at heart, is a souped-up arcade game with awesome graphics. The anime-style cutscenes woven around the slice-and-dice sequences provide an interesting story, but one that doesn't relate very directly with your job on the streets of postapocalyptic Tokyo. Your moves are cool though--spinning in midair to collect coins that will unlock secret levels, killing three ninjas with a flash of Akujiki, zipping around so fast that a shadow of your ghost remains.

You all saw the commercial; now reap the benefits that it's finally out.  One of Sega's oldest and under-appreciated franchises returns on the PS2 in 3D.  Those familiar with Shinobi will be surprised to find out that this Shinobi is not the Joe Musashi of the past, but a new ninja named Hotsuma of the Oboro clan.  Shinobi starts again in a new direction and with a new character.  But the classic game play of the past titles is retained, this time in glorious 3D.A 3D Action platform game, Shinobi is heavy on action.  Like 90% action, all the time.  The other 10% is cinemas and platform skills.  No running around looking for a key to open a door, this game is fast and furious.  Unlike the Shinobi's of old, your primary weapon is your sword and not the shuriken. You have a cursed enchanted sword that grows stronger with every enemy cut down, and thirsts for blood...if you don't satisfy its thirst; it soon feeds off your own life.  The shuriken still remains, and is used to stun enemies at long range...of course, the multiple shuriken toss while flipping is present, but in 3D.  Ninja magic is here as well, and you can now run along walls and stick to them like Spiderman.Graphics are sharp and look great, and the game moves very smoothly.  There is a hint of the jaggies once in awhile, but for the most part, the textures are great.  Sound is spot on, and music is reminiscent of the Shinobi style music of games past.  One of the coolest features of the game is in the combat, as you can dispatch enemies with Tate (pronounced Tah-tay).  If you have 4 or more enemies, and dispatch them all within a certain time period of each other, a very cool sequence awaits you.  All the enemies are \"frozen\" and while Hotsuma sheaths his sword, they fall apart in pieces. It's hard to describe, but you must see it in action to appreciate it.  Trust me, you will want to dispatch them in Tate after you do it once.  In this sense, and the soul feeding of the defeated enemies and style dispatching of enemies reminds me of Devil May Cry.  And that's a good thing.The story is told through CG sequences and looks great.  Extras abound, including the chance to use Joe Musashi once you unlock him!  Sega and Shinobi are back!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2002"}
{"product_name":"B004CDBP9G","description":"","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Furiouser and Furiouser","reviewText":"If you're a fan of the original American McGee's Alice, then one thing that might most convince you to give Madness Returns a try should be the fact that right now, the PS3 version comes with a code you can key in to download the original American McGee's Alice for the PS3.  I'd recently revived my PC copy and played through it (works perfectly on Windows 7) and can say that the downloadable version of the original is very close to the PC.Now, where the sequel is concerned, you need to be aware of one important thing:  consoles have changed a lot since the original Alice, and Madness Returns is more a reflection of those changes than it is a straight successor to the original.  This title is gorgeous, whimsical, dark, and creatively styled like the original, but the gameplay is far closer to a God of War or Jak & Daxter style fighting/platform game.  Camera movements are occasionally limited, melee is somewhat automatic, and Alice dashes left and right across, around, and over her foes during the heat of battle.  Gone are some of the original weapons, but in their place are some fairly creative ones:  for example, early on you get a pepper grinder that acts as a sort of minigun.  Thankfully, these weapons do lend themselves to creativity as well:  for example, a timed explosive Alice can drop on the map can also be used to distract opponents, and Alice has the ability to occasionally deflect an incoming attack and bounce it back at the enemy.  Alice's leap is now more of a \"float, twirl, and glide\" that can be stretched across three presses of the jump button.  And as you go, you collect teeth as currency, that you can trade in for upgrades to your weapons.I was very skeptical about the fact that the storyline for Madness Returns is essentially a re-do of the original, but to American McGee's credit, he pulls it off well.  In the first game, Alice defeated her surivor's guilt over the fire that killed her family.  As we begin Madness Returns, we see that her life has been fairly awful since then, and the old doubts that nagged her have slowly returned.  If you're the kind of player who likes to dig around for secrets, there are many \"hidden memories\" you can uncover that will reveal details about Alice's past.  All of them tell you something about the events surrounding her life, and some of them are very revealing about the fire that took away everyone she loved.  While the gameplay entirely exists inside Alice's head in a Wonderland that has once again fallen into disrepair, there are points in the game where reality intrudes, and we wander the streets of London looking for backstory.  This is probably the game's only flaw:  soaring and shooting and solving puzzles tends to make it hard to be dropped into a minimally-accessible, dull gray map with no powers, just the ability to walk, talk, and look around.  You can also expect to see many familiar faces from the first game, though for almost all of them things have become very, very different.There are some maddening console shortcomings to Alice.  Timed puzzles that require you to sprint to a location, drop into \"aiming mode\", and fire a weapon tend to take multiple tries.  Floating and landing can fail miserably, sending you soaring over the mark.  The use of \"checkpoints\" can sometimes mean repeating a long, irritating platforming sequence entirely, again and again.  Auto-targeting can change its mind on you if your camera angle moves during battle, and sometimes combo moves can fall flat by going after the wrong opponent.  If not for these niggling annoyances, this would be a 5-star game.The team at EA who worked on Madness Returns deserve tons of praise for their creativity.  Each level has a theme, from a watery undersea \"fish and pirates\" to a gorgeous Colonial British take on Asia.  With each level, Alice changes outfits, too:  if you enjoy the clothes you will love her undersea \"luminescent lantern-fish\" outfit, the colorful kimono-like dress, plus the classic look and the \"goth girl\".  Parts of every level are invisible--where \"getting small\" was a one-time event in the original, it's a regular thing you do to spot hidden items, platforms and pathways, and can be accomplished with the touch of a button.  This feature can also light up graffiti-like clues to help you through the level and point the way to secrets.  Last, there are some entertaining breaks from the ordinary, with side-scrolling shooter segments and a few 2D platforming \"dream-within-a-dream\" sections that look like Okami and play like Paper Mario.If you're a fan of the original Alice and have played some console games today, chances are you'll be pleased with Madness Returns.  If you're new to the Alice series, then consider this a great opportunity to enjoy a creative--if at times frustrating--take on the Alice in Wonderland stories, and take advantage of your chance to pull down the original along with it.  With luck, both will make you happy, and maybe even a little mad...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2011"}

The only thing that may be better are the graphics(may be!)  If you have already played WWE games before, get ready to re-learn controls one more time as they have revamped them.  Many striking moves will get reversed often by a cheap AI.  Even at the EASY and sliders in your favor, it will happen at high-rate, making an arcade experience almost non-existent.  Of course some will say that \"I suck,\" but hey, if you are new to the franchise, there will be a punishing learning curve.

There were too many reviews of the last game that were annoyed at how &#34;boring&#34; it was and how much reading it required.The story takes place years after the first one, and includes the basic idea of a group of people being kidnapped and thrown into a game that requires working together and puzzle solving to escape alive. This game looks much better, but is much less violent and has much less of a menacing feel.Unlike the last, you do not have to start all over to get the various endings- there is a branch save system that allows you to &#34;jump&#34; in time to the last decision. And to unlock more endings, and break locks on storylines, you have to do just that. It's much like reading a choose your own adventure book as a child, sticking bookmarks in at every choice, and then going back and trying them later- but easier because it is in order and with just a touch of the screen.I personally found the story to be less scary, less dark, and less tense, but the puzzles to be mostly more enjoyable and of course, the graphics are improved and more anime inspired than graphic novel inspired. I didn't have the same sense of terror unraveling the story and endings.Pros:*The new anime inspired style is just as good as the old graphic novel inspired style.*The puzzles now have hints, easy/regular settings, and fewer are math based.*You don't have to restart the game to get all of the endings or take new paths. There is a touch screen chart that shows you which paths you have taken, what has unlocked, and what still needs to be unlocked. In order!Cons:*The story is less intense and less dark.*The time travel/&#34;time jump&#34; angle can be kind of confusing as they explain it.*The main conclusion is kind of out of this world, sad, and disappointing in how unrealistic it is.In summary, the creators improved the ease of getting all of the endings and added in the new features of requiring you to complete more than one story to unlock locks that prevent you from continuing. Choosing each choice from the chart of choices allows you to keep all of them straight. That part is 100% improved. However, the story feels less intense and dark. Still worth buying.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2013"}
{"product_name":"B003ZCH7DI","description":"","reviewerName":"MisterMusicFan","summary":"Kirby's weirdly wonderful patchwork world","reviewText":"Kirby's Epic Yarn, the first Kirby platformer on a non-handheld console in 10 years, is a different and slightly off-kilter but mostly welcome addition to the Kirby universe. What may be a bit of a turnoff at first is that it is one of the first Kirby games to be void of Kirby's two trademarks: inhaling foes and copying abilities. These were two of the key components to what defined Kirby and what made his games unique and memorable. Kirby's Epic Yarn still maintains its fun factor, but excluding those traits robs the game of some distinct Kirby-ness.This time around, Kirby gets sucked into Patch Land, a world where everything is made of yarn and cloth (incorporated into every minute detail of the gameplay), giving the game a very striking aesthetic feel. In this world, Kirby meets Prince Fluff, a blue fellow who strongly resembles Kirby himself. Prince Fluff is a playable character in co-op mode, which is an available option for the entirety of the game, allowing each level to be completed with either 1 or 2 players.Both Kirby and Prince Fluff play exactly the same, wielding a yarn whip as a weapon that can both unravel and destroy enemies or roll them up into projectiles. They can also dash by transforming into cars and float gently to the ground by changing into parachutes. The game is controlled like a basic 2D platformer, requiring the player to hold the Wii Remote sideways, using 2 to jump, 1 to attack , and so on. Several aspects of the game are alarmingly similar to New Super Mario Bros. Wii, particularly in co-op mode.Although Kirby is unable to copy abilities in this game, both he and Prince Fluff can use Metamortexes to transform into various objects. The Metamortexes can change you into an enormous tank, a dolphin, a UFO capable of using long-range electrical attacks, and even a train which can follow tracks you `draw' yourself by pointing the Wii Remote. These transformations, many of which drastically change up the control method and gameplay, are by far responsible for some of the most exciting and innovative in-game moments.Kirby's Epic Yarn has been accused of being overly simplistic and easy; while it's true beating the game is no overwhelming feat, there are certainly more challenging aspects, some more prominent depending on whether the game is being played with 1 or 2 players. In addition, completists have the task of collecting the trio of treasures hidden in each stage, which can be used to decorate an apartment awarded to the heroes at the beginning of the game, and also unlock hidden stages if they're all collected.Part of what may be inciting the simplicity criticisms is the fact that Kirby never actually `dies' or loses any lives in this game. Instead, when he is struck by an enemy or falls off an edge, he is rescued by a yarn angel, brought backward several steps, and loses several of the beads he'd collected. This is no devastating penalty, since the beads are merely collected throughout stages like coins and don't really seem to add up to any spectacular goal. You'll receive a different medal at the end of the stage depending on how many beads you collected, but only the quantity of beads you collect during boss battles really add up to anything relevant (you can unlock additional hidden stages in this way).The Wii rarely prides itself in being visually impressive, and Kirby's Epic Yarn isn't necessarily any different, given that many of its characters and backgrounds are essentially outlines. However, the game manages to create a vividly colorful, playful atmosphere, and a surprising amount of attention is paid to minor details; Kirby reacts to standing on edges, and enemies behave and move differently depending on where they are and what's being done to them. The yarn motif may seem wonky at first, but they follow the theme to a tee and somehow make it engaging and make it work. Granted, hopefully Nintendo won't use this bizarrely recurring trend of creating cartoony landscapes for the sake of theme (Paper Mario, Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker, this game, etc.) as an excuse to continually keep things graphically limited.Overall, the game's a pretty solid 9/10; the transformations are unique, the boss battles are exciting, and the soundtrack and visuals are silky smooth. The woven patchwork world offers lots to explore, and has some reminiscence to the bewitching childlike universe of Little Big Planet. Kirby's Epic Yarn may end up being something of an acquired taste for many in the long run, but like most Kirby games, it is an entertaining, engaging, flashy, and of course super-cute Nintendo title.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2010"}

And this is coming from someone who spent over 100 hours on it and beat the game on Inferno with my Wizard so I've given the game more than its fair chance.The first couple of times of beating the game are very fun, especially with friends, I will hand it to Blizzard. The art is nice, the music is not bad, and the environments are somewhat interesting.Then you reach the brick wall that is known as Inferno (the hardest difficulty) and you realize what Blizzard has been planning all along.The mobs in Inferno suddenly become godlike and all your gear becomes instantly obsolete. Elites and even regular mobs will kick your ass unless you upgrade your very quickly.To make matters worse the game PUNISHES YOU for playing co-op on Inferno, the already disgustingly difficult mobs become near godly and unless you and your friends are supremely geared it's going to be an excruciating exercise in futility.Problem is that 95% of the loot you get in Inferno is literally garbage, so bad that even the NPC vendors will be reluctant to accept them. Magic find increases the chances of getting yellow items, but chances are they are still crap.There are far too many possible attributes during item rolls, so as a result you will almost always get items which make no sense whatsoever (example: Wizard hat with Strength, or Barbarian sword with Intelligence, etc.) and weapons in Act 4 of Inferno with 200 DPS. It's infuriating.It is so bad that when I killed Diablo on Inferno he dropped only blues, and not just any blues but TERRIBLE blues, stuff so bad you wouldn't even use it on Hell difficulty.So you're thinking to yourself, WHY WHY WHY would they do this?! Why make the mobs so difficult and the gear so bad?!?!WELL LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE REACH THE GOAL OF BLIZZARD'S GAME DESIGN IN DIABLO 3: THE REAL MONEY AUCTION HOUSE!!!As stated Inferno is so ridiculously difficult and the loot generally so bad that the ONLY WAY to progress is to use the Auction House.I only managed to beat the game by bidding low gold on items and shopping intelligently, but it took wayyyy longer than it should have. Not only this, I was BASICALLY FORCED TO USE THE AUCTION HOUSE TO BEAT THE GAME.Trust me this isn't just unique to me because I suck, 90% of my friends gave up at Inferno Act 1, those that stayed have had no choice but to use the Auction House as well. The game isn't skill dependent, it is only gear based.PROBLEM IS that the gold prices of items have flown through the roof due to inflation, botters, and exploiters. So expect to see any half decent weapon for at least 10 million gold, which is no small amount of money.So a lot of people have resorted to using the Real Money Auction House and it's absolute chaos. I've seen people spending over $500 (yes real cash) on a SINGLE ITEM, a virtual item folks that will probably be obsolete in the next patch or expansion.I personally don't believe in spending real money on video game items (especially absurd amounts like stated above) but to each his own.-----So I really can't help but feel like the entire game was designed to revolve around the Real Money Auction House. The difficulty is absurd at inferno, many of the bosses are basically gear-checks (can only be beaten with certain amounts of DPS) and the loot is so bad that you have no choice but to use the Auction House.This game is a money grab, it's pay to win, and I'm not sticking around for when they implement Player vs. Player where it's going to be the battle of the credit cards.I will admit that I got more than my money's worth and it was fun at times, but this franchise has been ruined and this is by FAR the worst Blizzard game I have ever played. I will not remember this fondly like I do Diablo 2 or the Starcraft Series.SHAME ON YOU BLIZZARD, THIS GAME IS A SCAM4/10","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"Da Jester","summary":"My First Game in this Series, and well, it was pretty good.","reviewText":"To get this out of the way, Diablo 3 was just shy of a perfect score for the obvious reason. It's an issue that has probably been the basis for all of this game's reviews on Amazon.com, but one more time... I don't care what Blizzard Entertainment explains for this DRM approach, it's a very strange and aggravating decision for a dungeon crawl action RPG. A majority of classic Diablo and Diablo 2 players are strict and have every right to be on this issue; always online to play a single player game is in truth moronic.After that hump, on to the review!Please note that this reviewer was not a dedicated Diablo 2 player. I played it back then for almost 2 hours and I hated the bland and stiff combat animations. I was more of an RTS PC gamer in the past from loving Warcraft III and Starcraft. One year sober from World of Warcraft, I gave Diablo 3 a try thanks to my friends  on battle.net convincing me to play it.  77 hours later and at the time was still logging in to play with either my 53 Wizard on Hell Difficulty or my 36 Barbarian on nightmare Difficulty. Diablo 3 was fun as hell even with the irony of that statement. Character and combat animations be it melee to spell casting or other strange combinations, are all unique. Watching your character wreck havoc on enemies and the environment are visually entertaining. This game is very M-Rated as soon as you attack your first enemy. Things get more gory as you can expect from a Diablo game. The more your round up and kill, the more body parts and blood splatters everywhere so you will be trying to get the perfect skill set to demolish and to survive. So what if the graphics look like 2007's standards? It's about the smash, loot, level game play that Diablo is famous for. As soon as the loot drops from elites or bosses in the game, this is where your focus goes towards. The higher the level, the better chances for new gear and weapons. Strangely the always online issue did become a convenience as players are able join with other players and friends almost immediately. The only problem is when battle.net is down for maintenance or IT issues. Right now I prefer to play Diablo 3 with a buddy than by myself especially on the harder difficulties.There are other short comings with Diablo 3 that I would like to point out though besides the main one. Two are what I expected to be in Diablo 3 thanks to playing Runic game's, Torchlight.* Firstly, The skill system is strange and constricted. You have a total of 6 button slots to map your characters abilities. When you have all six, you'll wish you had more for those really helpful abilities you swapped out for those dire moments in harder difficulties. Annoyingly though switching runes for your abilities have a delay for some really dumb reason.* Secondly, the companions are a bit disappointing. They can't help you with loot storage or sell your crap items for you. You have to  head back into town via town portal or waygates to sell almost every hour. They are a bit chatty, but nothing near as annoying as Dragon's Dogma.* Third, crafting can be a chore with that minimal reward. it's bad enough when you discover rare items only to reveal them worthless, you will craft many weapons and pieces of armor and be just as disappointed. But when you get one worth a damn, it's like a gift from the gods.* Fourth, the story/campaign progression is a little clich&eacute; and linear. Although the BADASS CGI cinematics and other dialogue situations are Blizzard showing off another \"tour de force\" of really good storytelling,  you will be pressing spacebar or ESC to just skip them after you finish the normal difficulty.* Fifth, the main bosses are disappointingly easy compared to the trash elite or rare  enemies you encounter. The higher the difficulty, the harder (almost keyboard smashing cursing out loud) they become. Make sure when you log out of Diablo 3, you do it back in town.But like all Blizzard games, there is always room for improvement. I'm expecting lots of hot-fix and content patches in the future because Blizzard does know how to keep player bases content. (Seriously, stop giving me that look, you know it's true). Announced PVP is on the way for the patient. The only people who will have issues or give the 3 or below star ratings are the die-hard Diablo 2 fans who probably were still playing prior to D3's release. This game will probably never be near as the \"gift from god to nerds\" as they want it to be, but frankly it was worth the price to me for the first 4 times I did all 4 acts. The only real competition for this game in the action RPG genre will be Torchlight II. I suggest own both of them regardless if you love action RPGs because so far they are both fun to own.* (updated) I now have one character in Inferno and one almost 60 in Hell difficulty, and I pretty much stopped and moved on. Playing the same ACTS I've done twice has now become boring. The fact that the rare elite packs almost one shotting you each time you encounter them, just starts to lose its excitement. The \"out of time\" debuff boss elites now have really killed the enjoyment. The RMAH is pretty ridiculous. I made it to ACT II after struggling and learning new tactics and farming gear, and I am bored. I don't' have the initiative to want to play anymore pretty much.  The game to me was worth the $60 price tag as I put in 100+ hours in Diablo 3. I may re-install to try out PVP with my friends.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2012"}

Having played both of the main previous iterations (I passed over the handheld side games, however) I wasn't sure what to think of this one before I played it, especially considering that AC 2 only came out about a year or so ago. In the end, it does a pretty good job of what it set out to do, but it'd be a stretch to say it did a great job.One of the biggest improvements over AC2 is that, like in the first game, you can replay *every* mission, not just the side missions. Of course, this makes it all the more curious why Ubisoft STILL hasn't updated the second game to allow for replays. A great innovation in the mission structure is the \"full sync\" feature. This time, to get the maximum out of a mission, a certain sub-objective must be met, which can vary from taking no damage to remaining undetected to using a certain weapon to kill the target. This is definitely a great innovation, although the fact that failing this means restarting the ENTIRE mission is an automatic docking of one star. Even if the sub-objective is failed after the last checkpoint and you reload, it's still failed. I didn't let that slide with Grand Theft Auto 4 or Mirror's Edge, so it'd be hypocritical to ignore that flaw with this game. With one glaring exception, I did enjoy trying to get full sync with the Leonardo's weapons missions (anyone who's played the game most likely knows which mission I did not enjoy; rhymes with \"the bank mission.\") There is no reason why we should have to keep on retrying the same mission from scratch and having to completely redo everything that we have already successfully accomplished just to get to the one part that tests our ability to do the full sync requirement. The aforementioned mission is a prime example of this. Also, replaying a mission doesn't allow you to keep a treasure chest if you exit the replay. For some reason, you can keep a feather or a flag you collected, but not a treasure chest.Some other minor gripes include the fact that courtesans still automatically break off to distract guards, even when you need them around to distract another set of guards. Why Ubi couldn't be bothered to fix this problem is beyond me. And what I like to call the \"What the H are you DOING, Ezio?\" problem still plagues this game in full force. This usually manifests itself when you're trying to escape the guard, and instead of running through a doorway, Ezio instead runs up the side of the doorway, even though no path exists. Three games running, and this problem still crops up! Sometimes music will play for a mission, then restarting it means the music is gone.The story doesn't feel as inspired, either; it feels similar to an expansion pack's storyline as compared to the main game. This is at least partly due to the fact that early on in the game, a key ally is killed off, rather needlessly at that. A lot less dialogue this time around, too. It's almost as if Ubisoft decided that the minimalist approach to character development used in almost the entire middle and end game of AC2 was the best way to go with this game. Obviously, the whole concept that assassins are truly this noble, enlightened group of saviors meant to protect us from the evil Templars is just as ridiculous as the Da Vinci Code (search History Versus Da Vinci Code) and the hidden blade isn't based on any real weapon, but the story world is still interesting. It's just that the story itself in this game felt a little bland.But there's plenty to love about this installment. For one, the crossbow is a nice addition. As it makes killing unaware guards far easier, and because that was one major obstacle both games had to complete a mission undetected, I only have good things to say about this weapon. And if you don't like the crossbow, then don't use it. The game's not putting a gun to your head and forcing you to use this weapon, and there are plenty of other guard-killing items at your disposal. In fact, don't even buy it. You don't get it from the start of the game; you buy it at a weapon's shop. Poison can now be used as a projectile as well, so it's actually useful this time around. And while not necessary a must-have, Leonardo's final innovation does come in handy for missions where falling a great distance is a part of the mission, but to get full sync you must take no damage. And those who remember the end of the first game likely remember thinking \"Well, okay, so what happens now?\" The ending for this game will also instill that feeling, along with a healthy dose of \"What the hell did I just do?\" It's one of those things that you won't likely see coming until 10 seconds AFTER it's too late to do anything about it. Kind of the same feeling you get when playing Jade Empire and the major plot twist is about to happen, and all you can do is sit back and watch. Also, do Subject 16's puzzles; it's worth the time spent. Speaking of time spent, this is definitely a completionist's dream, as there is more than plenty to do in Rome, from renovating the city to hiring new assassin recruits, to helping out the friendly courtesans, to assassinating minor targets to collecting stuff; there's no reason to just stick with the main storyline. Although, another major disappointment in this area is that two unlockable capes, both of which are very difficult to come by, both do the exact same thing; lower notoriety to 0%. Why one couldn't be full notoriety and the other 0 notoriety is beyond me. I enjoyed having the Auditore cape in AC2 and retrying the side missions to see how much more of a challenge it'd be to have every guard notice me almost immediately.So this game is definitely for the fans of the series, although people who didn't like the second game for whatever the reason probably won't find much to like this time around either, as it does for the most part feel like an extension of the second game, whether that's a good or bad thing. It seems like that's largely what the developers were going for; to give us another dose of the series while the next iteration is being made, and to that end they do succeed. It's not perfect, but it does an admirable job of what it set out to do. The one and only thing that I do miss from the original game is that when a target was killed from the first Assassin's Creed, each kill had a true purpose. Like in the second game, this is more about just finding and killing the person. You don't take the time to learn more about the target before going in to make the kill, you simply find them and kill them. While I don't miss the STRUCTURE of how you gained information on your target in the first game, it wouldn't be a bad thing to have the concept put in. It should just be a lot less repetitive.In any case, the good outweighs the bad, hence the 3 stars. The full sync requirement loses one by itself, and the other complaints combine into another negative star, so 5 stars minus 2 equals 3.Addendum: Just finished the DLC package \"The Da Vinci Disappearance,\" and I can see why it got so many mediocre reviews. It's not that it's bad, it's just not very good. The gameplay is standard fare for the Assassin's Creed games, which in itself isn't a bad thing, but it doesn't tread new ground or have any big reveals save for the end, which history buffs will smack themselves in the head upon viewing. I get the whole higher powers leaving clues for man to find thing, but there is the slight logical problem that standardized longitude wouldn't be invented for almost another 400 years. Notice I used the word \"invented.\" Latitude of course was always standardized, given that the equator is always the same, but the same cannot be said for longitude. It wasn't until 1884 that the Prime Meridian was established, and that was subjective in itself - Greenwich was picked as the point of reference for 0 degrees longitude because it was the largest seaport yet used in its time. (And like many other things, it was determined by rich fat cats.) So if the course of historical events were different and the PM would have been instead established in, say, Rome, or if Spain never lost its major naval influence and the PM would have been selected for its port, for example, then the same coordinates would be in a whole different area.But the main problem I had with spending $10 on this DLC is the simple fact that the story was very threadbare. Also, the fact that the final mission's full sync requirement is to take no damage - unquestionably the single most frustrating requirement, and especially for this mission - didn't help. It bothers me all the more because I've seen just how engaging the story can be when the writers strive to make a good story, so this lackluster effort is all the more disappointing. Mediocrity is mediocrity whether the game is great or otherwise. But, Revelations is right around the corner, so I am cautiously optimistic that this will be the game that outshines the others.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002I0GEXM","description":"","reviewerName":"Matthew Erwin","summary":"Almost Epic Mickey","reviewText":"\"This game is so close.\"This is the thought that continued to fly through my head as I played Epic Mickey.  Honestly, Epic Mickey is a victim to two years of hype more than anything, well that and its abysmal camera, but we will get to that.Most anyone intersted in this game knows the story by now.  Yensid (right) created a world where Disney's forgotten works have a place to live, even though they aren't being used anymore.  Mickey accidentally spills ink and paint thinner all over this world and creates an evil blot and damages the world greatly.  Later, Mickey is pulled into what is now known as the Wasteland.It starts with a Mad Scientist getting ready to literally plunge Mickey's heart out, but Oswald the Lucky Rabbit saves him.  Mickey meets Gus the Gremlin who helps you through that first section with serves as a tutorial on the controls and the paint/thin element of the game.  Also note this Nintendo.  Gus basically plays the Navi of this game, and Gus isn't annoying.  See?  It can be done, please do so with Skyward Sword.Mickey has a magic paintbrush that can create as well as destroy.  B creates, Z uses thinner to erase the world piece by piece.  The mechanic is almost limitless and works well.  I won't spoil all the surprises, but early on you will create and remove gears for platforms, make rocks disappear and a variety of other interesting things.You chase Oswald through a number of early worlds, saving other Gremlins (or not) and performing tasks for them.  Most familiar of course being the Small World Ride.Which brings us to the games problems.  First it relies wholly too much on fetch quests to artificially lengthen the game.  At one point you reach Main Street and have to get several items prior to leaving the area.  This requires you to basically criss cross across the town several times over talking to different characters.  It is annoying to say the least.Second problem, which has been harped on by everyone is the abysmal camera.  Luckily, the Epic Mickey team realized it was awful and put in a manual control scheme, however, that is little solace when making tough jumps onto moving planes above a lake of thinner.  At one point, I made that jump and it looked like someone has dropped the camera.  Needless to say, I wound up missing the jump and starting again.Finally, for all of its hype, it is an awfully linear game.  It plays more like a cross between Zelda and Mario than something truly epic and new.  Each world is filled with large arenas that have multiple things to do.  You basically methodically complete each room until you reach the end boss.  This isn't necessarily bad, but you should be expecting it.  I was not.But the positives outweigh the negatives.The game is just beautiful.  The world is fleshed out and you can tell great love was put into this game by people who love Disney.  Little things like the remade \"Partners\" statue from the parks will get the Disney lovers (like myself) smiling.  But overall, the art direction is just amazing.  And while the 2D \"projector\" stages may seem a bit incongruous in the game, they look and play beautiful.Furthermore, the story is as good as any on the Wii right now.  It is Disney and it comes with Disney quality.  What struck me about the story is its sadness.  Mickey has a long discussion with Clarabelle the Cow early in the game and it is heartwrenching.  It is a story of loss and redemption.  A story of memory and longing.  It is a true experience, told through great cut scenes (though bizarrely unvoiced).Finally, the decision engine works well.  There is no \"right and wrong\" as many decision engine games have had.  There is only what you want to do.  Not only does it affect the ending, but it affects the gameplay.  If you help Little Pete early for example, he will give you a treasure trove before you fight the Clock Tower.  It feels organic and it works.Epic Mickey is awfully close to being a great game, but in the end, it winds up being a very good one.  There are spots that will bore you and others that will make you scream in frustration.  But overall, the game will give you that same warm feeling that seeing a great Disney movie will.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2010"}

I am a fan of the first two but after hearing all the ambitions from developers about the third title I was extremely excited for this release. That may be the reason I am so disappointed this time. We will start with the cons and then hit the pros since everyone so far is raving about this game and buyers need another perspective.Cons -- I don't know why but for some reason Lionhead studios always thinks features are more important then game play. This is not true. Having 1 button as your attack, Strong Attack, Sweeping attack and BLOCK is craziness. Especially when the title is essentially a hack and slash RPG. I can't tell you how frustrating it is trying to block in a group of 15 enemies with the same button as attack. You are better off just rolling around and attacking. I can't believe someone on the development team didn't speak up and get this fixed.- Interactions with NPC's has always been a fable staple and its no different in III. Dance, Shake Hands, Burp rinse and repeat 100 times. Its mind numbingly boring and really you get nothing of worth out of it. Of course since its Fable you get the option to flirt, wed or sleep with any NPC in the game. Who cares, if you are that interested in intercourse find a live person to do it with. I have more important things to do with my gaming time then find imaginary dates. And since you only have 6-7 positive interactions it gets boring very fast.- Story I'm about 7 hours in so I'll update this part of the review but as of now it is a Dragon Age Clone. Hero must find allies to stop the evil King. Been there done that. I realize that this changes about half way through the game so there is still hope but as of right now I'm not impressed. After Fable 2's horrid story there was much anticipation from Lionhead to concentrate on this aspect of the game. I really hope they come through in the end.-Those Damn Jobs are back. I realize receiving gold from Quests is so 1995 but the mind numbing jobs are irritating. Want to buy a house, shop or maybe an outfit. Go Press X,A,X 100 times in minigames and you might have enough. In fable 2 you at least worked towards a new \"Job Level\" In this game you unlock them with hard earned experience. That's an insult.Positives- Its still the same old fun Fable. The reason I've always liked the franchise is it reminds me of playing a cartoon. Its more funny then serious. Sure the world is in danger and your toon has horns from being evil but it still makes you laugh out loud with its comic relief.- DLC already. I bought the game from amazon and between the preorder bonus from them, the bonus for buying new and an already available xbox live download weapons pack I have already installed nearly 500MB of extra content. Too cool.- Secrets and Rewards.  I happen to be the kind of player that if I see a path not on the game directed trail I have to follow it to see where it goes. Fable always rewards players for going off the beaten trail. Its nice to find Silver Keys and Hidden Chests that make you feel like you are rewarded for not just following the story. It increases the amount of time you get with the game and lets you explore the world for yourself.OK So this last one is a positive that may take some getting use to but I love it. NO Start Menu. Now every time you press start you are transported into a virtual menu bar. At first it seems tedious but after getting use to it, it makes you want other games to have the same thing. Go to a dressing room to change clothes or the armory to change weapons. Pretty cool feature.So with that I have to add that I will probably play fable 3 at least two or 3 times. I already find myself wishing I would have made different decisions. Its not a bad game at all but as a huge fable fan and waiting for this game by reading developer notes and comments I was hoping for so much more. If you are a fable fan this IS A MUST OWN. If you haven't experience Fable before this is still the title to try you just may wish to rent it first to see if its your style.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000ZKA0J6","description":"","reviewerName":"Edward \"war02orc\"","summary":"Excellent addition: Here are the facts","reviewText":"I know there is a huge debate over this game, so I will keep this as short as possible and just provide the facts.The original StarCraft had a total of 30 missions (across all races), with a handful of cinemas thrown in for good measure.  This game has 29 missions (yes, there are 29, and I can't say more without spoiling the game) for the Terrans, with quite a few cinemas to help tell the story.Terrans are the only playable race in the campaign, all races are available in online play.  The other 2 races will come as expansions.The quality of this game is through the roof.  The graphics, sound, and gameplay are all finely tuned.  Blizzard's mantra of \"It's ready when it's ready\" wins again.You will be required to register this game with [...] on install.  Some have stated that you need to \"re-register\" periodically, but  I tend to doubt that given that WoW runs on the same system and has never asked me to \"re-register.\"  You can play without [...] if you choose the guest account, but your data won't be transferred to your online account if you play this way.The chat system interfaces with Blizzard's RealID system, so you can message your friends on your RealID list regardless of what game they are in (of course as long as the game supports the RealID system, right now only WoW and SC2 support it).The gameplay is faster.  A lot faster.  This is largely because the tech tree has been seriously tweaked to allow you to upgrade your units faster, and partially because of some decreased cost of some units.  That may sound like a bad thing, but really it works quite well and is much more entertaining.  There is also the option to purchase upgrades in between missions (they do NOT carry over to online) to enhance your troops, or you can hire mercenaries (elite units).What are you getting for $[...]?  An absolutely awesome game that is 1/3 of the total content.  Make no mistake, this has the content and the play length to be called by itself a stand-alone game (more akin to part 1 of a trilogy).  It is NOT 1/3 of a game as some profess.  The other 2 parts to this trilogy will cover the Zerg and Protoss campaigns.  This part contains several challenge levels to prepare you for online combat in addition to the campaign, and there are tons of achievements for those that want replay value.And the ending? Yes, I have finished it and I think you will be shocked at how the Terran campaign ends.  Hell, you'll probably be shocked at the twists the story takes during the campaign.  If you loved the original StarCraft and it's expansion, you will love this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2010"}

You should better buy this on Nov. 18th!!","reviewText":"I played this game at Dragons Den at the Cross County Mall in New York (yeah!). Although it was the Japanese version, it was still awesome. This game starts off with some really cool FMV's and then it says &quot;Press Start!&quot; You press start and there is a picture of a Mansion and a picture of Professor E. Gadd, (the crazy scientist) for options. You click on the mansion and the game shows Luigi walking toward the mansion, looking at his map. You go inside with only your flashlight. You go to the second floor and try to open both doors. They are both locked. You go back downstairs and a key falls from the sky. (wtf?) You bring it back upstairs and open the door in the middle. Then you see Professor E. Gadd trying to catch a orange ghost with the Polguster 3000 (the vacuum)and it gets away. He gives it to you and sends you in the training room. Go to the middle water pump and press A on it. A ghost comes out behind you and it's your first encounter with a ghost. You flash it with you flashlight for one second and a purple circle with a number 10. Hold the R trigger and you will suck it in with your vacuum. Hold down R and chase it with the control stick. You need to be really good, this requires a lot of hand/eye coordination. You have to do this a couple of times. He will take you back to his room, and choose the second choice (I don't know what it said). You will go back to the main entrance of the mansion with Toad crying. Talk to him, and he'll say that he brought Mario with him and he got lost. He will also ask you to save your data on your Memory Card 59 (available on Amazon.com for 14.99). Then your adventure begins. You better get this game! It's awesome, just like I described it. I hope you like this review. It's more like a walkthrough!

{"product_name":"B0016BVYAM","summary":"FIFTEEN BOTTLES OF ADAM ON THE WALL...","reviewText":"(I think I am having a very strong instance of deja-vu...We have we been here before, haven't we?)Now, I want to make it clear from the start that this is primarily a Warning Review, focusing on little or non advertised facts on BIOSHOCK 2. Nevertheless, my points on the game design and gameplay follow. But first things first:FACT 1 (UNDISCLOSED):The game requires Internet Connection to install and play because it HAS TO BE ACTIVATED. This is nowhere to be found in the Amazon product description so be warned, you will not be able to install and play this game on a PC that cannot access the internet. This is more serious than it seems (please read on).FACT 2 (LITTLE ADVERTISED):BIOSHOCK 2 requires you to setup an OnLine WindowsLIVE Account in order to save the game, claim achievements and auto-update. However, similarly toFallout 3, it is also possible to create and use an OffLine WindowLIVE account. So, this is not a major worry - unless achievements is important for your enjoyment of course. In that case, you will have to be OnLine to play even a Single-Player session.FACT 3 (UNDISCLOSED):This game comes with an INSTALLATION LIMIT. Some would argue that a limit of fifteen installations is large enough for anyone. I, on the other hand, would argue that the length of the chain is of little importance, as long it stays attached to one's leg. Any limit on the number of installations makes BIOSHOCK 2 a rent-a-game. For good reason.The ACTIVATION REQUIREMENT together with the LIMITED INSTALLATIONS mean that the copy of this game that you paid full price for, well,...never actually becomes yours. The possibility of you replaying the game in the future depends on both the survival of the publisher and its willingness to allow you to so some years down the road (both major uncertainties). And, no, I very much doubt that failing corporations will have the decency and the resources - not to mention the legal rights - to develop and release an Activation-Requirement-Removal patch. The usual practice is to pull the plug and disappear into the night.The really insulting part is that all this is done for no reason whatsoever! If \"more installations are available upon request\" what is exactly their purpose in the first place? Why pay for the activation servers and the phone service to give out activations upon request for ever - when you could have had a game with no Activation Limits to begin with?And the first person who tries to answer that by using the phrase \"to fight-piracy\", first get me a tissue because I am laughing to tears and, secondly, please simply google to find out how that fight is going.Most game developers/publishers (from THQ and KALYPSO to UBISOFT and EA) have realized that asking your customers to jump through hoops only for the privilege of ...buying and using your product is not the way to earn neither their trust nor their hard-earned money. Especially during a recession.So what they did was scale back on any intrusive, draconian and (possibly) illegal forms of DRM. All except 2K GAMES and some former soviet game developers that is. Protecting one's investment and labor is only fair. Insulting your customers and stealing back the product you just sold to them in not.Now, if anyone still cares: I tried the game on a friend's computer and it is ...not very good either. It is not even as good as the originalBioShock.Apparently the graphics have been left to age on their own - and have done so ungracefully. Max out the details and see the...pixels upclose and personal staring back at you! (Before anyone asks: WinXP on INTEL i7 920, nVIDIA GTX260 and 3GB of RAM).The water/dry-land transitions have been hastily slapped together (swirling bubbles but no changing level of water in my faceplate?).The guns are slow, hold annoyingly little ammo and are either too powerful or too hard to aim. And that is not the worst part either.The worst part is that playing Big Daddy is a cumbersome chore! You move like crusted molasses, jump (and land) like a pig that ate too many beans and have the faceplate almost constantly obscuring your view.If venturing into the ocean floor impressed you, well, think again: you can be directed to walk around but you cannot shoot while outside Rapture.All in all, a mediocre game that is definitely NOT worth its DRM trouble!My advice: wait until the price matches the product.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2010"}

I understand that giving a product a bad rating because  of say, issues with the delivery, or the packaging (issues that might definitely impact your enjoyment of a product but are not inherent to it)is akin to throwing a temper tantrum.But the client download, the patching and troubleshooting any issues are all part of the inherent MMO experience. I'm comparing this to previous experiences with  Rift, WoW, LOTRO, Tera, Neverwinter and SWTOR- all have had some issues at one point or another, none which brought the installation or update process to a full stop.What's most frustrating to me is that per FF14's forums, this technical issue is 'Resolved', yet there are new threads, as recent as 10 days old, same exact issue. (If anyone is interested in troubleshooting, the issue is, patcher starts, goes for 90 seconds or so, starts dropping mbps DRAMATICALLY, errors out with the error codes on the subject line- already tried making the boot folder not read only, it doesn't stick.

The realistic environment features real-time weather and light changes that effect the game play for a remarkably immersive experience.Explore an Entire TownThe town of Bright Falls is 100 square kilometers, and players will be able to roam through this incredibly detailed area any way they like, roaming the town or wandering out to the lakes, forest, satellite towns, and more. The game gives the player goals, but how he chooses to go about completing them is up to him. Clues are scattered throughout the town, and solving mysteries will require players to pay close attention to the little details.Intense CombatIn addition to solving puzzles and exploration, the game also pushes players into serious action and combat; when night comes, creatures will take their best shots at Alan, and you'll have to be quick with strategy as well as weapons to beat them back.Alan Wake presents an unusual and new gaming experience that features a riveting, multi-layered story while giving the player the ability to freely roam a giant environment. It supports Dolby Digital sound.","reviewerName":"Pikminfan \"bobsworld3\"","summary":"Good-but definitely room for improvement","reviewText":"Alan Wake for the Xbox 360 is best described as \"good-not great\".  The game starts off pretty slow and seems repetitive and even a little pointless at first, but sticking with it pays off as the later half of the game really draws you in.Control for the most part is fairly tight but there's something distinctly \"wonky\" about the way Alan moves-especially when he jumps.  It doesn't take anything away from the game mind you but visually it's a bit off putting.  There's also a strange drop shadow on Alan for the majority of the game, like a not-so-subtle black glow that looks unnatural, out of place and to be perfectly blunt, \"ugly\".  I'm only mentioning this here because it's really an odd choice to me given the rest of the game's stunning and polished graphics.  It just looks at odds with the rest of the game's visual style.The majority of the play through is very satisfying.  The combination of zapping your enemies with light to make them vulnerable, then polishing them off with your gun is very fun.  The game could use a bit more variety in the enemy types though.  I kept thinking given the locale in and around a national park-it would've been nice to take down a bear or some other darkness possessed animal to break the monotony of shooting countless humanoid \"The Taken\".  No such luck though.  There are birds I suppose (annoying ones at that) but that's about it.  Essentially there are only three types of enemies you fight in the entire game.  The driving sections are a welcome diversion and help to break things up a bit-but not quite enough I'm afraid.  More variety would've definitely helped.While we're on the subject of enemies, it's a bit disappointing that fallen enemies don't leave \"droppers\" behind.  I think the game would've benefited IMMENSELY if your fallen foes left behind bits of health, ammunition, batteries and etc.  When you think about it, this game really gives you no incentive to actually kill your enemies.  A big percentage of the time (if there's light anywhere nearby) you can just run away from them.  Where's the fun in that?One thing Alan Wake excels at though is its story telling.  The game can boast one of the best (albeit slightly convoluted) stories ever told in this format.  This game could easily make the jump to blockbuster film.  Like a great continuing television show or a really well written movie-Alan Wake's story really draws you in.  Despite this however, I still tend to prefer playing games rather than watching them.  Since I knew that Alan Wake was more of a cinematic game to begin with though-it's hard to fault it for this.  Sometimes the cinemas seem to drag on for too long though and walking around inside of buildings looking for mundane objects to move the story along gets a bit tedious.  \"Go talk to Alice.  Okay now go turn on the generator because she's afraid of the dark.  Okay now go make a double decker sandwich and a smoothie and sit on the couch and smoke a cigar.\"  Okay, I made that last part up- but you get the general idea.As a package I definitely recommend at least one play though of Alan Wake.  Overall, it's a pretty solid game.  There's definitely room for improvement though.  Hopefully a sequel will give us more variety and fix some of the other minor issues.  There really is a good game here, but one which never quite achieved greatness.  Now that the story is set up and the game play mechanics are in place, I think a sequel could be the game to achieve that greatness.  As a final note-I also liked the fact that Alan Wake is not too terribly difficult of a game that the average player can't complete it and see how the story ends.  I commend the makers of the game for this.  (I hate getting to a final boss only only to find the level of difficulty suddenly ramped up to ridiculousness merely because it's the final boss)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2010"}

I was glued to the tv from the minute i put it in. This was one of the funest games ive ever played. I didnt play the first one cause i heard it was repetitive, and was skeptical about picking up this one. First the controls are pretty good. They just take some time to get used to. Sometimes your guy seems sluggish though but thats just a little flaw.  The story line is good and there is a lot of area to explore. The side missions can get a little repetitive because there just doing the same thing in different citys. You dont have to do all of them though. I think they should of made the game a little more difficult. All you have to do is block and counter everytime, and just attack the big guards with your wrist knife. I think ive died one time in an actual fight the other times it was from falling off buildings. The graphics are really nice and it plays out well. There are a couple of flaws but nothing you will notice. I have 2 sequenses left before i finish the game and have enjoyed every minute of it.

When I started the arkham series I had just completed Skyrim and was looking for something that I could play that was a little less....time consuming and addictive....fortunately the arkham series was anything but.Arkham City is hands down one of the best adventure games I have ever played...if not the best. I'm not a huge adventure type gamer but I have played a few of the Uncharted's and I would consider Dante's Inferno and the God of War series in that adventure genre. Arkham City hands down beats those games easily.Story 9/10Wow...This story is great. Batman is dieing and you have to find a cure...but you also need a cure for the Joker. You have a main story that you can follow but the game continuously throws little sidequests here and there at you that you HAVE to complete. Others you don't necessarily have to but you are pretty much heartless if you don't. My only complaint is that the main story seemed short. I wanted this game to go on for quite some time. Fortunately, after I finished the main campaign, I still have a bunch of sidequests and riddler stuff to do. This is one of the few games that I honestly see myself playing for a while...even though I've finished the main story. I hope there is a sequel (I'm sure there will be). Did anyone see that ending coming? I doubt it.Gameplay 9.5/10They took the gameplay right out of Arkham Asylum and improved it. The fighting in this game seemed much more fluid and intense. Also, much more difficult. Sure..in AA you had the standard punching bag, punching bag w/ gun, and punching bag w/ shock stick or pipe. But in AC you have all of the above...plus armored punching bags, punching bags w/ riot shields, w/ knives or broken bottles, grenades, rocket launchers...everything. Just amazing really. The DLC to play as catwoman where she has her own missions and such is an interesting twist as well. Very nice change of pace fighter. My only knock on the gameplay is the shear amount of riddler challenges there are. 400!!!! Really? I like the new types of challenges that are now available (with the remote control batarangs you have to fly around and the electrical things you have to charge up and what not) but seriously 400? I mean when you go into detective mode while outside, all you see are dang question marks all over the place. But hey...I have to have something to complain about don't I?Characters 10/10Seriously. How can I grade this anything else. We have my favorite super hero of all time. We have some of the best super villains/anti heroes of all time. And we have the classic voice actors and everything else that is batman. All the characters are portrayed perfectly (granted...mad hatter was a little over the top). They could have done more with two-face but I can overlook that. Just simply great all around with the characters.Overall 9.5/10This game is definitely worth a look. If you are a batman fan...at all..in the least amount. You owe yourself a playthrough of AA and AC. IMO AC is the better game but I can see where AA fits a lot of people's preferences better. Nevertheless...both great games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2012"}

The main characters girl is slain/kidnapped. It is seriously nothing but a rehash. Yawn.Secondly, while i liked the 'summoned monsters' better than the previous games magic system, the entire weapon/armor set up was tedious.To get more and better gear you have to slaughter thousands of enemies AND steal from all of them. And some enemies will take minutes, if not hours, to learn how to steal from. Also, money is completely worthless in this game. Why bother even putting it in then?Also, this game is pretty huge when compared to older Castlevanias but it is empty and totally devoid of atmosphere.For a 3D game it sure is flat. There really is no need for a jump button in this game as there are only about 2-3 times in the game where you actually have to jump up a ledge.The great atmosphere, individuality of the levels, jumping puzzles, and tremendous musical score is all GONE from Lament of Innocence.Still, the game is pretty fun and easy going.. without any difficulties and puzzles. Its also almost entirely linear compared to other Castlevanias...So if you want a terrific gothic action/adventure pick up Devil May Cry 3.

There is no other word to describe this. If you enjoyed Spider-Man 2 the game, imagine it multiplied by 100. The city is bigger, but that isn't the most impressive thing. You no longer have to get a certain amount of points to progress to the next chapter like you had to do in the second game. There are no chapters. Instead, you go to the map and choose which mission you want to do, and each mission is different but always involves saving people, and that is always fun. Also, there are times when crime will break out while you are swinging, and as Spider-Man, it is your job to stop it! All of these things makes the game last longer, and also makes it a little more real.Needless to say, the graphics for the game are excellent. I don't know how they compare to other systems, but for X-Box 360, they beat any version of the previous Spider-Man games when it comes to what it looks like as well. The city looks beautiful and Spidey looks cool during the story and swinging through the streets. Which brings me to another different aspect to this game that is a cool addition. During parts of some stories, you actually get to act it out instead of just watching. You get to participate! This is done by pushing the A button, and the X for example during the fight sequences when it tells you to. If you mess up, no worries, it gives you as many chances as you need to finally get the timing and sequence right.Overall, this game is just fun. From side missions such as defusing bombs or giving a ride to MJ through the city as she tells you how much she is having fun, this game just beats any other Spidey game so far. It has a lot to offer, and you will enjoy this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2007"}

Rather than feature usual Metal Gear character Solid Snake MGR:R stars the cyborg ninja Raiden, the katana-wielding ally of Solid Snake.  Initially, you control him in his \"White\" form, which was based on his appearance in Guns of the Patriots, where he is depicted as wearing white armor.  At a certain point in the game he switches to the more powerful \"Black\" cyborg armor variant.The game takes place four years after the events in Guns of the Patriots as Raiden is working for Maverick Enterprises as a mercenary in order to raise money for his family.  He assists in training troops as well as various private security missions guarding VIPs.  The protagonist in the game is the rival Desperado Enterprises, a company involved in terrorist attacks.  Their leader named Sundowner, kidnaps a man that Raiden was protecting.  Raiden tries to rescue the man but is too late and the man is killed while Raiden is defeated by one of Desperado's top operatives.  It is then that Raiden is outfitted with his more powerful black armor so he can seek his revenge against Desperado and its army of robots and cyborgs.  Ultimately he will face off against the \"Winds of Destruction\", i.e. your various bosses with pitched battles that take place in large, open areas.Besides the main character the other major change is that MGR:R is a pure hack-n-slash action game as opposed to the typical Metal Gear stealth play.  The game introduces a cutting system that is used much like your typical shooter.  You have an aiming reticle in order to target the weak spots on an opponent, such as gaps in their armor, or on items like pillars you can cut in order to collapse parts of building on enemies.  This mode, referred to as \"blade mode\" also has a time-slowing function like the bullet-time ability of Max Payne.  This gives you the opportunity to line up your aiming reticle and map out your attacks for precision hits.  This results in some truly fearsome attacks as you chop and dismember limbs and heads in a slow-motion dance of death.  Blade mode can also be utilizes as a defensive strategy to deflect incoming missile attacks.  This all adds up to being able to pull off a variety stylized multi-hit combos which are enormously satisfying.Blade mode also garners Raiden much needed energy as well as the ability to take the enemy's weapons, ammo, and other items. The deft cyborg ninja shows off his other skills with a Ninja Dash that increases his speed and climbing ability which comes in quite handy when setting up your enemies for an ambush attack.  There's also a \"Ripper Mode\" which can be obtained in the game which is a short term power-up that can be used in conjunction with Blade mode to make you a devastating killing machine.At the end of each level you will be rewarded with a specific amount of points depending your performance during the level and will receive a grade, with the highest being \"S\". These points allow you to purchase upgrades for Raiden's equipment.Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is a fairly short game at maybe 6 - 8 hours tops but that period is filled with non-stop, button-mashing, combo delivering excitement.  The combat and control system is so smooth and natural that you'll barely have time to notice the game's weak points.  But I will mention them anyway...These include ultimately an ordinary storyline that fails to draw you in.  Yes it's fun to whirl your blades through legions of enemies but it's even better when there's a strong story to back-up the action.  There's also some camera issues that can mess with your orientation but overall MGR: R is a fun and addictive diversion to the usual Metal Gear gameplay.Tim Janson Mania Entertainment ([...])","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXLQC","description":"","reviewerName":"C. H. Mauricio","summary":"The best \"4.5 out of 10\" game you'll ever play.","reviewText":"Resident Evil 4 united the fans with its bold new direction. Resident Evil 5 drew the division among the fans. Now, with Resident Evil 6, a declaration of war has been announced and both sides are now much like Northern Ireland. Many franchises this generation have gone through so many changes. Changes that defy what the previous generation(s) has set in order to stay relevant. Whether it be Grand Theft Auto, Final Fantasy, and the poster child of them all, Resident Evil, the changes set forth with these brand new iterations test the dedication of older fans while embracing a new crowd. A crowd who's into games such as multiplayer online shooters. A crowd with less tolerance to obscure old games. And a crowd that has the buying power that companies such as CAPCOM see as a much needed resource to keep afloat.At the expense of all these are of course, a certain group of old fans. Veterans who grew up with the classic Resident Evil games. Veterans who knew this series as a franchise that is more about putting in quick frights, some tension, and running away from becoming zombie food. It is this same fan base that unfortunately, are stuck in the past. Their nostalgia is clouding the truth. What do you mean? Well, allow me to explain. A common complaint about the status of the Resident Evil franchise among this now minor, yet loud vocal group, is that the games have lost their survival horror roots. While in reality, they are supporting a form of gameplay that is no longer relevant in today's video games. You can't make a survival horror game anymore with strange controls played through static pre-rendered (or polygonal as in Code Veronica's case) backgrounds. Room by room puzzles which make little sense and constant backtracking through load screen after load screen of watching doors open is old, dated, un viable game design nowadays. Throw in a game like that in this modern era, watch your sales tank.Along with the complaints about Resident Evil games no longer are about survival horror and has turned into an action game. Again, their nostalgia has clouded the truth. Resident Evil, has always been an action-centric game of survival horror. Even back in 1999, when a little game called Silent Hill came out, contrasting views about the first three Resident Evil games versus the original Silent Hill came to the conclusion that Resident Evil was far more action oriented than Akira Yamaoka's psychological thriller. Also, ticked off fans, may I remind of phrases such as Battle Mode, Extreme Battle, The Mercenaries, these are bonus modes that you unlocked in various Resident Evil games and they are all focused on combat action. What were the most coveted secrets that you unlocked in Resident Evil? Why infinite ammo of course! Infinite Rocket Launchers, infinite Gatling guns, infinite Magnum bullets. So you can blast your way through the campaign and kill all zombie and monster that gets in your way.Finally, I would like to point out that in Japan, the Resident Evil games are known as BIOHAZARD over there. Think about this. The first Resident Evil game had an isolated viral outbreak on a mansion complex in the middle of nowhere. Evil pharmecutical corporation creates a virus that turns bio organic beings such as humans and animals into bio organic weapons or in short B.O.W.s. The sequel and its follow up has this virus spread on to a city. Evil company is eventually dissolved but the threat from bio organic weaponry has continued thanks to terrorist organizations going underground and releasing more terror into the world. Resident Evil, or BIOHAZARD as it is known in Japan has always been a series about bio organic weapons and the group of people who are willing to stop them from eliminating mankind. It started in isolation, and has since become a global threat, a natural progression.Thus where Resident Evil 6 or as it is known in Japan, BIOHAZARD 6 continues the struggle against the threat of bio terrorism continues. A brand new strain of virus has been released under the name C-Virus and it is up to series veterans Chris Redfield, Leon Kennedy, along with new faces Jake Mueller, Helena Harper, Piers Nivans, and a returning character Sherry Birkin (the youngest survivor of the 1998 Raccoon City outbreak) to stop and uncover the malicious plans of the re-organized Neo-Umbrella from wiping out humanity. It is the largest cast ever ensembled in franchise history and they are all playable from the start. The game is the most ambitious Resident Evil game by featuring well over 20 hours of story campaign content that is divided on to four separate and distinct but intertwining storylines. Each of the four campaigns are divided into 5 chapters with each lasting from an 1 hour to 1 and a half hours to complete. To put this in perspective, one campaign in Resident Evil 6 is roughly 70% of the entirety of Resident Evil 5. This is completely unprecedented considering the length of most action games nowadays that last a good 6-8 hours to complete and rely upon multiplayer modes to extend the replay value. ON top of these campaigns, you have a multitude of multiplayer options that range from co-op split screen or online for three of the four main campaigns, Agent Hunt which enables players to take the role of the enemy and try to disrupt one's story mode experience, and the ever so popular The Mercenaries return once more which has you killing zombies and racking up as much points as possible with a minimal time limit. Resident Evil 6 is a complete experience in its current state but Capcom plans to add even more extras. For a game priced at 60 bucks, this one is full of content pound for pound. A rarity in this day and age.With the amount of content RE 6 offers, is any of it actually good? There are a few quirks that get in the way of the fun and feel cheap but I'll get to them later. The gameplay in RE 6 has taken the principles set by RE 4 and modernizing them while still retaining trademarks of the series. Some of the trademarks are as mentioned, the story and the whole lore of the series such as mutations which no other games can pull off as good as this franchise. Other RE related materials still present are the usage of herbs to heal yourself. Leon's campaign in particular feels like Resident Evil 2 in the beginning where he witnesses the destruction of yet another small American town.Gameplay in particular spruced up some of the quirks from RE 5. For instance you can walk while aiming and shooting at the same time (which admittedly have been used since The Mercs 3D on the 3DS), but now appearing for the first time on a properly numbered sequel. Movement in general has seen some improvement this time where you no longer feel like you are controlling a tank. The range of motion that the characters display are far more convincing now. Melee has been tweaked up to be more useful (just like in RE 4). In RE's 4 & 5, you would first shoot an enemy on a certain limb which will have them react in a certain way. During this reaction, you get close to the enemy then initiate a melee attack. Now, pressing the R1 button while not aiming will initiate a melee attack which you can use to take an enemy down. Another way of taking out foes is using the brand new quick shot maneuver which is a critical shot more powerful than the standard shot. It can be used for almost all weapons in the game and is a great technique against mutated foes. Initiating a quick shot will put an enemy on a daze which you can in turn use a melee attack to finish them off. Now all of this melee and quick shot business may sound like overpowering yourself but all of this is governed by a stamina gauge to ensure that you have to take breaks from using them. It's a nuanced system and in order to use it effectively, you should mix up your battle styles especially during heated moments of battle. Skill buffs return here however you can't upgrade individual weapons. Instead you are assigned skill slots that can be changed to suit certain situations. You'll be grinding for skill points so you can increase traits such as firearm power, defense, and etc. Ideally, you'll want to create two or three preset skills that you interchange in between to fit situations. For example, during standard runs, you'll want to focus on a skill set with firearm, item drop increase, and melee attacks. However, when you reach the next room with a boss encounter, you may want to switch to a preset that has increased defense, improved medic recovery, and increased firearm (skills can be repeated in between presets which is nice) to deal with a boss. It's a flexible system that caters to any player's style of play.The overall nature of the gameplay is that it is very linear and not much in terms of exploration and deviation from the proper path. Considering the game's total length it's not such a bad thing. The game has a reliance on moving you from one set-piece stage to another. Resident Evil 4 introduced this and they took it to the next level with RE 6. The game feels like a blockbuster movie in this aspect which can be a complete turn off for some. But because of the game's intertwining stories, some events are admittedly identical between the campaigns. It isn't a game killer at all. However, some moments of this game will frustrate you in the name of cheap deaths and to artificially create unnecessary difficulty. One particular event deals with Jake's campaign on the second chapter. The stage is set on a mountain and will have you looking for three USB-like devices that needs to be recovered. Blinding snowstorms will limit your visibility and enemies with snipers have god-like accuracy only serve to irritate the player not cause a terrifying sense of urgency. The snipers in general can be cheap little bastards and they will test your nerves. A certain time sensitive chase sequence during the final stage for the Chris campaign can also be frustrating in the name of cheap deaths. Quick time events, or QTEs are over used in this game and will test your patience with their ridiculousness. Some of the event scenes will require you to kick start an engine or use C4 explosives require you to press a certain button at a certain time. These are strange and ridiculous game design and can bring your enjoyment down a bit for as long as they last.Resident Evil 6 runs on the now old Resident Evil 5 engine. Because the game is so huge, separate teams at Capcom were employed to create the look of the game. The result overall looks quite nice and with high production values were used for the cinematics. However, chapter 3 for Chris' campaign looks absolutely horrid and must have been rushed to finish the game this early. But in the end, Resident Evil 6 is a nice looking game overall. The voice acting is superb and deliver their lines well.Resident Evil 6 is a larger than life installment for this beloved franchise. It does stumble in a few aspects because of its ambitious nature with questionable game designs here and there. But that alone does not hurt this game to low scores unlike the way some \"professional\" critics have reviewed it. It's by default my favorite game in the franchise now because it offers so much in terms of replayability and content. I've been with this franchise since the very beginning and have supported its multiple changes throughout the years. With four distinct campaigns, a plethora of post-game replay value, and long length, Resident Evil 6 gets 4 out of 5 stars from me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2012"}

The game was the very first to incorporate Nintendo's Rumple Pak, a force-feedback device that let's players feel each and every vibration at hand.In the game, you play Fox McCloud, a young determined fighter pilot who is sent on several missions to destroy Andross, a inane, mad genius that demands full control of the Lylat system.

The game also has a fierce battle level, for up to 4 players, where you shoot down your fellow squadron leaders, Peppy, Falco, and Slippy.It took nearly two years for other companies to develop the feel of the game, the exact same way Nintendo did with Starfox 64.

Rowell \"Stumpy\"","summary":"What could have been.","reviewText":"This game quite possibly could have been a contender for game of the year for 2010.  It appears as though this game was rushed to release, not because of bugs but the simple fact that so much potential wasn't realized.  There is so much more that could have been done with this title.  It appears that the game was as complete as the publishers had intended(no updates almost 3 years after release) but they just failed to capitalize on what this game could have been.  Still that being said it was a fun game to play.  Just wish some of the story lines could have been deeper.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00503E9FY","description":"","reviewerName":"stevie","summary":"As generic as the black figure on the cover","reviewText":"Call of Duty is the most overrated franchise today. There is just no other way of saying it. I don't even care about all the fanboys who may send me angry messages. I was actually looking forward to this game. I thought modern warfare 3 would at least be a fun rental. It does not take too long too realize nothing special is happening here.Firstly, it is very hard for me to rate this game. There are a number of ways you can do this. For one, it is virtually unchanged from the last game. Its the same run and gun style. No new gameplay elements. This could either be good or bad depending on your preference. The only thing i noticed different (other than the story) was that some rifles have two scopes and you can switch between them. This was handy. However, I can't remember if Modern Warfare 2 had this. Still, thats the only thing I can recall thats different.For some reason, the graphics seem to be worse in this one than in modern warfare 2. I have not played MW 2 since it first came out and graphics have changed since two years ago. In the first level, when you first wake up from an attack, you have this amazing view of the New York skyline. It looks about as real as it ever could in a game. And your squad member reviving you looks real to . Then, when you start playing, everything looks kinda hazy. I don't know if this was a port or not, but the textures looked off. Everything just had a weird grey color palette. The streets and buildings especially looked a little crusty. Overall, the colors had a washed look to them. Again, maybe it did in MW 2, but the polish was not as good as other games out now (Uncharted 3).The game itself is very unexciting. It was barely interesting enough to keep playing. I finished it so I could write this review in good faith. Fortunately, or unfortunately, this game took me only 4 hours and 40 minutes to beat on normal. Yes, that is it. Afterwards, the game asks if you want to go into spec ops. You have no choice so I pressed ok. I quit out and noticed that it said my campaign was only 51% complete? I don't know what there trying to pull here. Spec Ops is definitely not campaign. I never played spec ops last time so I'm not sure I understand their setup. But the game itself is way short. A bummer if you are into COD. I myself did not mind, but this definitely subtracts from the game. The game is an endless assault on the senses.  A nonstop barrage of bullets and dirt mucking up the screen. There will be a few moments where you will die and just have no honest clue where the bad guys are. Apparently, COD is still the only game around that is a shooter, but has no cover system whatsoever. It is non stop ducking and just barely ooching yourself around corners to spot the endless waves of bad guys. Fortunately, you can just hit L1 real quick and you will snap to the nearest enemy. At first this sounds cheesy, but its much needed as there are tons of guys. The game itself is extremely linear. I can't believe that Uncharted gets a bad rap for being linear. In COD, there is only one path all the time. Sometimes there may be a box or rail that is slightly off to the side, maybe its on the side of a building, but you cannot jump over it if it is not directly in your pre-designed path. At least in Uncharted, you can scurry up buildings. Even gears lets you climbs on stuff and every other game. Left for dead? You can climb on cars and roofs. None of this in COD unless it is part of the path. This is literally the most linear game in existence.Story? Gotta find Makarov. The terrorist from the last game. All story is told during audio dialogue in the loading screens. You are always rushed into the level, usually by something chaotic happening or you sneak in partially and everything goes to crap. The game gives you no time to take in what is going on. The whole scope of the game is lost because it moves so fast. Basically, WW3 is happening, but it just feels like a sequence of random battles and explosions. There is almost no logic for any of the plot points. Just nod your head and shoot. At one point, you are trying to rescue the Russian presidents captured daughter. You are just not fast enough and she is taken away again. Meanwhile, you learn (as captain price learns to) that a source has found they took the girl to a Russian mine in Siberia. I think you were in Germany before. I guess there's no reason why it couldn't be a mine, but its just another rushed explanation for your next destination. This game could be longer if you could actually find the Intel yourself. This never happens. Every technicality is handled expediently off screen, creating an atmosphere where there is no sense of space or travel. You merely just appear in new locations after every level. Most of these occur throughout Europe, but every place looks the same because they are all pre-destroyed. You would never feel like you were in France if they did't put the Eiffel tower in there. Everything else is a bunch of rubble and half destroyed buildings. Another complaint is that there is no destructible objects in this game except some wooden posts.In summary, this COD is at best a rehash of MW 2. The multiplayer is the same thing. The single player is almost the same except for some new set pieces. The guns sound almost all the same. I was shocked when I picked up an AK 47. It sounded like a staple gun. They have an unpleasant \"clackity\" sound to them. They are missing a loud cracking and low booming sound a gun should make. Even some of the silenced weapons sound off. Also, there is almost no recoil on any of the weapons, making the guns feel almost exactly alike. A pistol has the same recoils as a sniper rifle.....I could go on. If you want a quick shoot em up game. Look no further. I will be returning my copy to redbox tomorrow.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2011"}

Along his journey, he gets caught up in the war of an uncharted planet, but in the end, he learns the terrible untold secret about the world and himself.","reviewerName":"Brian Seiler","summary":"A Noble Effort","reviewText":"Okay--I'll admit that I just finished this game not twenty minutes ago and my perceptions may be colored, but I have to say that I'm a little disappointed in this title.  It's not that it's not a solid console role playing game--it's just that I was expecting a lot more from this than I actually got.To start off, I will say that this game is above average in most respects.  The graphics are decent (though not great by any means, and particularly not by Square standards)--the world is colorful and the character models, which occasionally a little too sharp and angular, behave realistically in most cases.  The FMV sequences and sound leave something to be desired, though.  The FMV is very sparsely distributed through the game, and tends to be a little hard to follow, particularly the space sequences, as the ships designs are almost pointlessly complex and make it difficult to get your bearings.  The sound is normally quite good, but for some inexplicable reason the developers left the voice work in mono in all the various speaker modes, mitigating the otherwise solid surround effects.The game itself can be extremely entertaining, particularly for fans of classic style role playing games.  There's a lot here to do, even after the end of the game (three dungeons rather than the customary singleton for Tri-Ace).  Unfortunately, the game doesn't give you a choice about doing some of the things.  I'll be honest--I don't like item creation.  I find it boring and complex for little or no reason.  I didn't like that I was forced to engage in it just to get by, and I think it detracts from the overall value of character development when a designer makes the strength of the items your characters are walking around with more important than their actual character statistics.The story, like all the other aspects of the game, has its high points and its low points.  To its credit, the plot is deeper than most video game stories and involving, particularly in the early bits.  To its detriment, near the end it becomes pointlessly complicated, comes near to committing the common Final Fantasy sin (you never see the final boss until you fight him), recent games and movies render the story somewhat hackneyed, and ultimately the ending left me feeling somewhat unfulfilled.  If I put in seventy hours of my life, the game should bloody well resolve some of the emotional baggage that it leaves you with, rather than dropping off like that.  It's worth noting that there are fully ten different variations on the ending that you can see, but unfortunately the fact that the thing takes about an hour to play out (most of which is in-game cinematics) serves as a serious impediment to actually seeing all of those endings.On the plus side, the game eliminates random encounters (long one of my least favorite elements of role playing games) and implements a very interesting, if crudely articulated combat engine.On the whole, the game was certainly GOOD, as far as games go, but in the end I'm left wondering whether it was worth the time that I put in.  It's a good game if you've got the time to play it and nothing better to do, but with all of the other top flight titles out this season, I find it hard to recommend this one ahead of them.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2004"}

{"product_name":"B008CP6RUW","description":"","reviewerName":"Icebergtech","summary":"Playing this game is also like watching a movie","reviewText":"Playing this Game is also like watching a movie, every 5 minutes or so there will be a cut scene.  also opening doors or falling into a hole is cinematic so it makes you feel part of the game.  Also as your playing the game the other characters that are with you in the adventure talk along the way so it doesn't get boring with just shooting and getting to cover.  again with this game there is a lot of climbing and the puzzle challenges are either easy or average.  again the game will give you a hint if you get stuck.This game has 100 Treasure to be found so for those people that say there's not enough exploring there wrong.I would say its worth playing uncharted 3 a second time to get the rest of the trophies which are not hard to get and to find the treasure and experience the story again.  There's also co-op which allows you to play split screen or with other people which are the same chapters as the campaign  but slightly different story and a little more challenging.  There's also multiplayer.  Its just like every other game, you run around a map trying to kill the enemies.In my opinion I enjoyed Uncharted 2 more than Uncharted 3. Not sure what it is but maybe its the flow of the game and the creativity.  Uncharted 2 is simply a well made game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00005YTYJ","description":"WithGrand Theft Auto III, Rockstar proves that not all  developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games.  This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular  predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any  criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the  local population for their money (or weapons), make time with  prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking  more structure can embark on dozens of plot-driven missions or steal  cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and go on vigilante  missions. Grab a cab and play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi.  Take a fire truck and earn money putting out fires. The game just never  gets boring.As in real life, there are consequences for your criminality. As your  random acts of mayhem mount up, the police start hounding you,  eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you  continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily  the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are  packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every  category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump  trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically  when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific  detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic,  pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing.  Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine  different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a  monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages  to get everything right.--T.

The characters are as cute as can be (even the bad guys).  The stealth, smack, and swipe action is endlessly engaging, bolstered by a variety of mini-games for a change of pace.And did I mention that this game is gut-bustingly funny?  I just encountered the scene where Sly's partner in crime, the exuberant pink hippo Murray, gets disguised as a kimono-wearing Geisha girl and is called upon to entertain a tough crowd of the wily tiger crime boss's wild boar guards.This was as funny as any scene I've ever run upon in any video game, and I was actually sorry that I had to concentrate on the musical notes proceeding along a staff at the bottom of the screen to play the music rhythm mini-game, when I wanted to watch Murray's antics and their effect on his audience, including Sly's playable ancestor Rioichi.The only slight negatives I've noticed so far are an occasional problem pointing the camera where you'd like and some pokey, though not oppressive, load times.  Otherwise it's all good, including the precise controls and intuitive game play.Why are there so few 3D platformers like this these days?  What a welcome relief this game provides from all the usual bloody first-person shooters and gory zombie survival games!At any rate, let us hope this is not the last we will see of Sly and his buddies Murray and Bentley the turtle, or that we will have to wait a number of years before the dashing racoon and his goofy gang reappear to charm gamers of all ages.HIGHLY recommended!UPDATE: Aargh -- just an hour or two after I wrote this glowing review, I was confronted with a really difficult boss battle that had me scurrying to the Sly Cooper forums for help.

I'll start with the gameplay.Single Player: In general I would say it's about average for this type of game.  By average I mean the game play and controls are good, just nothing revolutionary.  Sometimes it gets a little repetitive in spots but all in all a worthy effort.  Using the proton pack is fun but loses a little bit of the fun as you use it so much sometimes.Multiplayer: Good fun with your buddies or other online people.  There are modes such as: Survive - survive waves of ghosts, Destruction - basically wreak havok and destroy these ghost container thingies, and Ghost Trapping - Basically trap as many ghosts as you can in the time you have.  There are the typical \"gun power ups\" you can earn along with new costumes, etc.  There are weapon spawn points which are helpful so you can shoot different types of projectiles at the ghosts.  Overall this is a pretty fun multiplayer but again nothing revolutionary.As for the story, voice acting, cut scenes:  The voice acting is super cool.  I mean you just can't beat having the REAL voices of the ghostbusters as you play through the game.  It really makes you feel like it's the real deal.  The story is well written with the dialogue containing the usual witty banter you've come to expect from the Ghostbusters movies.  I thought the cut scenes were well done, actually a little better than I expected.  The voices, story and overall ambiance of this game really give it that extra polish that other games sometimes lack.I would say the gameplay is about 3 to 3.5 stars but the great voice acting and story convinced me to rate this as a 4 star game.  Considering most games based on movies are not very good this was a pleasant surprise.  If you are a big Ghostbusters fan definitely pick this game up as the voice acting and story alone will bring back great memories.  If not or you are on the fence you might consider renting this game first to see if you enjoy it enough to drop the cash on it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2009"}

With how things are being patched daily for the server bugs it could be awhile.  I would give it 3 months and it should be up to par for what the game should have been on launch day.

As a single player game it is pretty good.  Install it, type in the key, and go.  Just don't look for any updates.  I installed on windows 7 64-bit and there were apparently 64-bit executables so it runs native.Pros:No crashes.  This is one of the most stable games I have played in years.  Not one crash yet.  I played 20 hours straight over the weekend, and no problems at all, no crashes, no FPS slowdowns, no sound issues, nothing.  Makes me happy to have a game that finally works like it should.Delivers on what it says.  It is a Dungeon crawl.  You do simple quests, get rewards, you know the drill.  So it gives what it says it will.Easy travel back and forth.  These are multiple ways to get where you want to be so no long runs anywhere unless you want to.Simplified build methods.  You augment your armor and weapons in a couple different ways.  I suggest going on line for some tips on how to craft/sell items.  Makes your game play better.Different warrior types.  There are different classes that offer very different gameplay.  So you can pick what you like best.Cons:Little replay value that I can see.  The maps are not random as far as I can tell so once you have lived a map that is pretty much it.  A new character sees old places.Final thoughts:No risk with this one.  If you have the time, the price is right.Hail Flavius!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2010"}

It was the beginning of a new era- the Cold War.October 16, 1962. The President of the United States received word   that the Soviet Union had deployed nuclear missiles in Cuba. The world    trembled in fear as the prospect of nuclear war loomed ever closer.   After days of tense negotiations, the Soviets finally agreed on the 28th   to withdraw their missiles from Cuban soil. With the resolution of this   incident, later to be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, it    seemed that humanity had survived yet another threat to its existence.However, there was a secret condition in the deal that put an end to   the crisis. Nokolai Stepanovich Sokolov, a Soviet scientist who had   defected    to the West, was to be sent back to the Soviet Union. The U.S.   government agreed to this stipulation, and returned Sokolov back to his   native    land. Little did they know that Sokolov was to be the designer of a   nightmarish weapon. Now, with Sokolov back in their hands, the Soviets    are ready to resume its development. If this weapon is completed, it   will mark the beginning of a new age of fear.August 1964. Realizing at last the urgency of the situation, the CIA   forms a plan to recapture Sokolov. They dispatch the covert FOX unit    to Sokolov's research facility, located to the south of the great   Soviet fortress of Groznyj Grad. Led by former SAS member Major Zero,   FOX is a    next-generation special-forces unit that operates both as a   specialized combat group and as a covert intelligence outfit. The FOX   unit's modus    operandi is to send a single agent, backed by radio support from afar,   into enemy territory to carry out solo sneaking missions.August 24.

InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor.

Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy.

When I was offered the opportunity to test and review a demo version of the game prior to release date I accepted immediately; as a fan ofPlaystation 3 The Beatles: Rock Band - Software OnlyandGuitar Hero World Tour Band Bundle for PlayStation 3games, I was very interested in seeing what Activision had done with the DJ Hero game.Before starting with the details, as other Vine reviewers have pointed out, this review is written from a demo kit, turntable is wired opposite to the wireless retail version so I can't really make a statement about connectivity between the controller and the console. Also the demo included only 3 songs to play with.Being a music lover, the demo was fun to play, it appropriately combines music from different eras in quite interesting DJ remixes, by doing this, Activision is obviously trying to ensure that whoever plays this game, either and adult or a youngster will enjoy remixing their music. In researching the web for the complete track list I could confirm artists from Weezer, , Rihanna, and No Doubt to David Bowie, Rick James and Queen are included. The selection of the tracks to remix seems wide and interesting. Also, it's been announced that downloadable content for the game will be available from day one after this is released. I played this with a nephew and he absolutely loved it (now he doesn't know if he wants this orAssassin's Creed IIfor Christmas)The controls were a little bit tricky at the beginning (and as stated before, I am familiar with the Guitar Hero and Rock Band games) but once you get the hang of it, it is really great to mix the songs in the turntable, you have to pay attention and be quick. While the controller may be different, the logic of the playability is similar to the 'Guitar Hero' games in the sense that you have to hit the buttons accordingly with what you see onscreen. Also important to note, the turntable can be adjusted for left handed players. Assuming the controller I played with is the same as the retail version (but wireless), the turntable is nice looking and of quality. One thing I could not test is that I understand that guitar controllers can also be used to play this game(in something called \"DJ vs Guitar\" mode), the problem I had is that the two guitars I own are for PS3 so I can't really tell how that would work.The game looks and plays great and I can't wait to get the retail version, it looks like another promising franchise has arrived!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2009"}

However, in the back of my mind I always knew I would end up with this game one way or another.  When I saw my local game shop had one last copy of this for $49, I had to buy it.  It was cvompletely worth the purchase.Metroid Prime 1 + 2 were among the best GameCube titles ever in my opinion, so those were my two main drives at buying this.  It also includes the third game, which is exceptionally awesome as well.  The controls from the third game (which is a Wii-exclusive) carry back to the first two games.  The implementation of motion controls for this game is immaculate.  There's only a few moments where I felt like it'd be better to use the GameCube controller like 'back in the day', but I quickly got over it as I found myself digging deeper into the game (once again).Also coming back for this, is the multiplayer mode from Metroid Prime 2.  Basically, you and three of your friends can grab a remote and nunchuck each and shoot at each other.  It's very fun, however it'd probably be worth constantly checking back on if there were some form of Nintendo Wi-Fi connection compatibility.  So you cannot take the multiplayer online, which is kinda sad seeing as how everyone else seems to be bringing retro gaming online.What else can I say?  Hmm... the game comes in a very heavy-duty metal case, with a plastic slip-cover.  Inside the case is the game, an instruction book (not a manual, or a booklet even, this thing is quite seriously a book.  Probably the thickest instruction manual I've ever seen!), an art booklet, and of course the usual Nintendo inserts.Aside from the lack of online modes, my only complaint (which doesn't really affect me) is that this was discontinued.  Now the price of this game will probably skyrocket because people are greedy and think that because a game isn't in print it means we'll pay outrageous prices for a game disc.The sad thing is, it'd still be worth it.  This is the most incredible deal you could find in Wii gaming, not for the price but for the content.

I remember testing it out at Funcoland. At the time there was much talk about it and it seemed like an interesting game. Convinced, I picked it up and brought it home. I must say the novelty of this game wears off quickly. You play as a character named Ashly Riot who is set out to rescue his partner who is trapped at the hands of a madman named Sydney.The game is dark and very depressing. You stay in one basic dungeon for a majority of the game. It's 2009 and I pulled the game out to play it again. Unlike Final Fantasy 8 that came before it, this game has not aged well at all. The game isn't too beautiful artistically, and you feel as though the designers did not put much energy into the game. Not to mention that part of the team that did final Fantasy 8 worked on this project. It just seems as though the game was lazily created. The plot doesn't move you at all to continue the game, it's a basic hero fights villian and save the girl story.The turning points of the game are the fighting system which allows you to strike select areas on your enemies body. This at the time was new and innovative, but not verywell executed seeing as it makes little difference with the risk meter involved. The risk meter is a gauge that increases as you fight your oppenents. As the gauge fills up,your chance to hit goes way down. This really is a down point of the game as it is not necessary and makes the game more difficult that it needs to be.The overall game itself is pretty boring to say the least. The aptmosphere is again in a dark dungeon the entire game, which gets tiresome and becomes an eyesore. Mainly because you feel as though your in the same area the entire game. Vagrant Story could of had much potential, but its repetitive gameplay and aptmosphere leave this one bitting the dust.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00004U5VF","description":"The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.--Jeff Gerstmann--Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

In the past, you'd see the cut-scenes of a game and then be disappointed by the actual blocky characters you had to move around. With Tekken Tag Tournament on the PS2, the characters are fluidly smooth, the backgrounds are INCREDIBLE and the combinations of moves for each character both reflect the personality of the fighter and are executed flawlessly on the screen.The Tag Tournament aspect might seem distracting before you've tried it, but in the game it adds another entire strategic layer to how you play. You can choose two players who have opposite skill sets, so that you choose which one to kill off your opponents with. Or, you can choose with matching skills so that you continue to hammer on your foes with a certain style of play.Even better, certain combinations of characters can do a special tag move, so that one player does something on his/her way 'out' and the other character finishes the move while coming into the arena. Very, very cool!And those graphics! Your characters can wear different outfits. The fire in the torches looks like REAL fire - one of the hardest things to do on a computer. The leaves on the ground actually scatter when you slam your enemy into the floor.Definitely a game to get if you enjoy fighting games at all, and one which will knock the socks off of your friends when they see it on your TV!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2001"}

How many dozens of Medal of Honor games are there?  I've only played Spearhead, Frontline, and Airborne.  I didn't expect this one to emerge as one of the best I've played.Having not played the first Call of Duty, I can only say that Call of Duty 2 has been the most immersive, realistic, and overall most fun with the most lasting appeal of any World War II game I've played, a place previously held only by Medal of Honor: Spearhead.The lasting value of the game is very clearly in the multiplayer, with a small selection of creative and highly entertaining maps with spectacular designs which make it both easy and difficult to win, depending on any factor from quality of your enemies, to your own mood or condition.Those without multiplayer miss out on a big part of the game, but the single player missions in themself are a highly entertaining part which lasts over a dozen long-winded missions guaranteed to keep you busy for hours.  From the streetfighting at Stalingrad, to tank combat in Tunisia, to the visceral, bloody invasion of France and Germany, you play either a Russian Private, a British Lieutenant or a British Sergeant in the 7th Armoured Division, or an American participating in D-Day.Action happens in a flash, and you can't always tell the difference between friend and foe in the heat of combat, but they are distinctive enough that a moment's hesitation can be the saving grace by which you kill an opponent rather than lose for killing a friend.  Depending on difficulty level, you can take more hits than a man should, or be slain easier than sugar in coffee.For multiplayer, despite the fact that each map has only two sides to be played (German vs American, German vs British, German vs Russian), their weapons are for the most part evenly balanced, or even identical, with a few tweaks and bonuses and extras on each side, which balance out in the end.  While the Germans have the best and easiest to handle machine gun, the Americans have the superior sniper rifle scope, and the faster base rifle, or while the Russians have the fastest and most bullet-heavy machine guns, their sniper scopes are actually inferior to German ones, and they lack the snow camoflauge German troops have.With some of the best graphics, most realistic physics and location damage, and grittiest single player battlefield campaigns, this is certainly one of the best World War II first person shooters yet out there.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00009WAUK","description":"You can almost hear the collective drooling of RPG and Game Boy fans worldwide. As the inaugural Nintendo/Square reunion title,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancehas a lot to live up to--and it does, spectacularly!The long heralded Final Fantasy series has enjoyed a number of spin-offs and sequels. Using the familiar character types and classes of the Final Fantasy series, but with a wholly original storyline,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancecreates an immersive world of strategic combat and conquest.Snow JobWhile most fantasy games favor romantic landscapes,Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceslyly starts out in a plain-vanilla suburb. Players assume the role of young Marche Radiuju in the humble burg of St. Ivalice.A snowball fight introduces the characters and sets the groundwork for future battles. After a brief (but chilly) skirmish, Marche heads home to visit his younger brother.Marche MadnessSoon after, Marche's friends drop by to show him an ancient book of mysterious origins. After failing to translate the text properly, Marche's friends leave for the evening. After a wistful slumber, Marche awakens and realizes he isn't in Ivalice anymore... or is he?Alone in a foreign land, Marche quickly comes under the care of a helpful creature known as a Moogle. It doesn't take much to convince Marche to adopt a lucrative career as a mercenary.Gangs of IvaliceA quick stop at the town inn introduces Marche to his new gang. A motley crew at best, your associates include low-level monks, mages, archers, and soldiers. The only hope you have of finding your way home is to turn your ragtag group of misfits into a finely tuned fighting force.Begin your tour of duty by chatting up the local barkeep. He'll clue you in to interesting news bits, rumors, and job opportunities. Due to your severe lack of experience, early quests are little more than errands.As you gain experience and reputation, your job options grow as well as the rewards. You can also send one of your crew members on side missions for extra swag. You cannot use these members in your regular quests until they return from their mission.Rules of EngagementWhether your quest is to fetch rare herbs or escort the local nobleman, you can always expect bad company. The battlefield is set up from an isometric 3D viewpoint, allowing clear view of every character in play.At the start of a match, you must choose which members of your gang you wish to take into battle with you. You have a clear view of the enemies before choosing, so try to match your lineup to your opposition.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceintroduces an innovative law system to the series. During every battle, an impartial judge decrees specific rules, such as banning poison attacks or physical attacks. The judges' unpredictability requires players to keep a well-rounded group of characters at all times.Technically, you can break the combat laws, but it is generally not recommended. Even if you win the battle, any of your characters who breaks a law is whisked away to prison. They can only be released after paying a hefty fine.Fantasy FightingThe battlefield is set up like a 3D chessboard, with elevations and terrain types. In each turn, a character can move a specific number of spaces and perform a single action, such as attack or using an item.Most strategy games employ either real-time or turn-based action.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceemploys a speed-based system that is somewhere in-between.Characters still take turns to move and perform actions, but these are based on each character's individual speed ratings. Nimble characters like rogues and ninjas are usually the first characters to go and can usually move farther than other characters. The downside is that faster characters typically lack strong armor and health stats.Subtle details such as terrain type and attack proximity can have a direct affect on your ability to hit an enemy. Attacking an enemy from behind or the side will yield much higher hit percentages than head-on attacks.Job FairWhat you do off the battlefield is arguably more important than what you do on it. Thanks to a stable economy, your characters can usually change job classes once they gain enough experience.Need a little more magic in your life? Try turning one of your grunts into a mage. There are more than 30 different job classes available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.Even in far-off fantasy lands, commercialism is a way of life. You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll end up spending your hard-earned greenbacks on shiny new stuff. Weapons and armor serve not only to boost your stats, but also grant special abilities to specific character types and species.While one sword might grant tremendous attack points, a seemingly lesser sword may give its wielder access to a special attack that can tip the scales in your favor. Thanks to the law system, one should never get too attached to a single piece of equipment.Face ValueGorgeous character illustrations and 2D sprites harken back to Square's 16-bit glory days. Each of the shops, inns, towns, and fields is superbly detailed, with subtle background animations.Final Fantasy Tactics Advancemaintains the series' stellar rep for technically and visually brilliant summon attacks.Uniquely,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancefeatures three separate display settings, depending on whether you're playing on the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, or the Game Boy Player. Each setting offers different levels of brightness, contrast, and saturation to appease even the most fickle of gamers.The only thing that can rival the on-screen wonders is the audio candy. It is no surprise why Square Enix's soundtracks are the most sought-after in the video game community.Lasting PowerNeedless to say, there are hours upon hours of gameplay packed into this tiny little cartridge. Square Enix has done a tremendous job in creating an easily accessible yet incredibly deep gameplay experience.

Instead this is in the same format as the amazing Tactics Ogre (GBA) game, where it is a speed based strategy / RPG. This is not a sequel to Tactics Ogre, but it does use the same system, which is you are a commander of a band of do-gooders, called a \"clan.\" Your clan can consist of dozens of members and to gain gold, you must visit pubs at towns and take on missions. The missions have different plots but they are all basically traveled to a place and defeat all of the enemies or a boss.  This is one of the most realistic role-playing games in existence, because with a normal RPG, you wander the countryside looking for a battle, when you find it, you have a choice, fight, use magic or run. With Ogre Tactics, when you battle you see an entire landscape of a battle area, trees you can hide behind, mountains, water and so on. Where you must then control each character of your army (up to six can be in a battle at a time). Control them to move, fight, use spells, special abilities, items, and use real battle tactics! Maneuver a character behind an enemy and have them stab the enemy in the back! Have your archers take the high ground and bombard the enemy with arrows or you can fight the enemy head on! There are dozens of weapons, spells with dazzling graphics, armor and so on to equip to characters of your clan. The reason why I am calling members of your clan  \"characters\" is because there are several character classes and races. There are classes such as knights, soldiers, magicians, clerics, archers, thieves, ninjas, beast tamers, dragon tamers, musket men and more. The races vary from humans, fairies, mermaids, moggles, lizard-like people and beasts such as antoids, griffins, dragons and giant hounds. Throughout the game randomly people will ask to join your clan. What is really nice about this game is to mix things up it has dispatch missions where it requires you send out someone of your clan for a few days to do the mission themselves. You do not see their action, but they come back successful or not. Another nice twist of the game is that there are rival clans to compete against and turf wars. For each battle you control in the game there are different rules for each area you battle in, rules such as no blinding, or ganging up. If a character dies during combat he is only \"knocked out\" until the battle is won, however there is also an impartial referee to carry out these rules, if you break a rule you get a warning, the second time you are thrown in prison for a penalty of a few days (so that person cannot compete in the present battle or any others while in prison). The story in this game is not as strong as it is thick, because of its endless twists and turns to the story. Each twist adds a new depth to the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2003"}

However, after Soul Calibur II, the series seems to have lost its way and lost focus. Soul Calibur IV is in many ways a victim of that lost focus.The core mechanics remain roughly the same. Each character has a different weapon, ranging from axes to swords to staves. Each character has different moves that are based on a combination of vertical and horizontal-based attacks. There's also a system of parrying and dodging, as well as traditional guarding. In previous games, the system was fun and balanced, allowing for fast-paced but highly technical fights. However, in Soul Calibur IV, while the basic system has been carried over, in a lot of places it feels much less technical and much more like \"hit them with the same attacks that you know work\". One specific example of this is Mitsurugi's standard one-two vertical combo, which hits fast enough that if you catch someone in it, they won't be able to counter with any move because it hits so fast that it interrupts any move they try. I have literally been part of a battle online that consisted of my opponent and me (both Mitsurugi) either attacking with that move or guarding against it and hoping for a lucky parry so that it would be our turn to attack with that move. It's also possible to get a \"Ring Out\" by knocking the enemy out of the arena, but in SC4 this option feels really cheap - what's supposed to be a detailed swordfight quickly becomes \"who can throw the opponent out first\" due to SC4's poorly handled physics. In one team match, I won consecutive battles by simply standing near the edge and using the same throw any time a new challenger appeared on screen.The major new game mechanic introduced for SC4 is the \"Critical Finish\" mode. Both fighters in a match have a \"soul gauge\" that increases when they hit their opponent and decreases when they guard against enemy attacks. When a character's soul gauge decreases enough, they go through a \"soul crush\", which is a short window for the other player to perform a Critical Finish. The Critical Finish is an instant-kill attack; however, the shortness of the life bars and the rarity of finding someone who guards enough to actually lose their soul gauge means that it's not an over-spammed attack that gets used all the time, but rather a way to finish off a long and difficult battle with a tide-turning attack. In most cases, it's usually easier to just kill an opponent than to try to hit them while they guard enough times to cause them to lose their soul gauge. In addition to the Critical Finish, the other new game mechanic is breakable armor. Each character has three \"segments\" - high, middle, and low. Repeated attacks to an area will break off the upper layer of armor on that area (leaving undergarments intact, of course) and make that area more vulnerable. It doesn't really add much to the game, and as a game mechanic feels kind of useless.There are a few new characters in the game. Hilde is the only real \"new\" Soul Calibur character; she's a female knight with a neat fighting style that uses both a sword and a spear, and she's fun to play as. Raphael's adopted daughter Amy returns from SC3, where she was a guest character; she uses a style similar to the Rapier style from SC3. There are also 2 guest characters from Star Wars in each game - both game modes have The Apprentice from the upcoming \"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed\", the PS3 version has Darth Vader, and the XBOX 360 version has Master Yoda. Vader and Yoda are both decent characters, but The Apprentice is ridiculously overpowered, possessing one of the highest speeds in the game as well as high damage and force powers. When encountered in arcade mode, he is far more difficult to defeat than any other character in the game, and it's even worse when someone picks him in online mode. Finally, there are five characters guest-designed by prominent Japanese artists. None of these have a unique style; each simply takes the style of an established character and uses their own unique weapons. These include a dual-sword Samurai woman, a club-wielding ogre girl, and a bizarre moon person. None of them are particularly well-designed, though, and they're not even that fun to play. They don't even have the unique styles of the Star Wars characters to make up for it. All in all, the new characters for this game, other than Hilde, feel like wastes of time and space.There are a couple different modes for single-player. The basic story mode consists of going through five fights against various opponents. The new mode used in most of SC4's single player game types is a tag-team mode, where if you have multiple characters on your team, you can swap them out in the middle of a battle and let the swapped-out character regenerate health. In story mode, you're usually fighting teams of 3 enemies, and depending on the character you play as, you may get allies of your own. The story mode is much shorter due to the fact that there are multiple enemies in each fight. In addition to story mode, there's also a more traditional arcade mode where you fight eight single enemies in a row; this more resembles the single-player mode of previous Soul Calibur games. The other new single-player mode is the Tower of Lost Souls. This is a mode where you go through floors of a tower, two or three at a time. Each set of floors has a different \"gimmick\" and a different boss; for example, one set of floors has a \"clown\" or \"harlequin\" gimmick, while another has a \"knight\" gimmick. There is a secret goal on each floor that is hinted at when you start the floor; completing this objective unlocks a new piece of clothing for use in creating characters.The multiplayer modes in this game took the largest hit. In previous SC games, there were a wide variety of match styles and gameplay styles that could be used for multiplayer. In SC4, the two styles are limited to a regular match, with or without bonuses provided by equipping different weapons and items. The team-based system used for single player does not get used for multiplayer, despite its prominence in the single-player mode. The new addition for multiplayer is online mode, which functions the same as regular versus mode in that it only has two modes. The online mechanics are, at least, smooth and relatively problem-free, if a bit simple. There are levels in online play, but unlike games like Halo 3 and Metal Gear Online, it's not an average of how good a player you are, but rather a tally of how many times you've won (like an RPG). It's possible to look for a player within your level range, but it doesn't really matter that much, since levels have nothing to do with ability. The game plays smoothly if your connection is four or five bars, but starts to lag insufferably at 3 bars and lower.Create-a-Character is in many ways the heart of this game's unlockable content. Creating a character has been simplified and improved in many ways. The unique Create-a-Character styles from SC3 have been removed, so every CaC now uses a regular fighter's style (however, you don't have to go unlocking styles like you did in SC3, either). Another addition in creating a character is physique customization. It's possible to determine how muscular a character is and how much physique they have. For men, a high physique means that they are bulky and wide-chested, while a low physique means they are thin and scrawny. For women, a high physique means that they are busty and curvy, and a low physique means that they are thin and flat. The difference between the extremes is clear and easy to see (something that's fairly rare for this type of \"sliding bar adjustment\"), and it's neat that they let you change it. There's a variety of faces and voices, but it seems like there's too many \"extremes\" (really young faces and voices, really old faces and voices) and not enough average stuff. There's 8 faces for males and 8 for females, but two of each are really young and two of each are really old, which really means there's 4 average faces for males and 4 average faces for females. The same goes for voices, as well, except that the personalities of each voice are also very different. The hairstyles, at least, are relatively diverse and cover a wide range of styles, short and long. Supposedly, there's an alignment system in SC4 that changes how good/evil your character is (or, at least, there's different endings in story mode where a custom character will either claim Soul Calibur, Soul Edge, or both, depending on his or her alignment), but unlike SC3 it's not visible, and the voices don't change either. I had a character who had a kindly voice and only said kind things, but who still claimed Soul Edge (the evil sword) in the end.The clothes for Create a Character deserve special mention. The only nice-looking clothes in the game is the armor, which is all intricately designed and looks really fantastic. However, a lot of basic clothes that would make sense in the game - for example, a set of tights that covers the whole body, so that the armor isn't just sitting on bare skin - aren't actually in the game. It seems like the costume creators spread themselves too thin; while there's only a few armor sets for female characters, there are at least four uniforms that are just there to be goofy - a maid uniform, a waitress uniform, a stewardess uniform, and a nurse uniform. None of these make sense in the game's context; they're just there so you can play dress-up. Furthermore, there are only two ways to unlock new clothes - either by going through the Tower of Souls (and unlocking only a single piece of clothing per floor) or by getting \"honors\", SCIV's version of achievements, which range from simple tasks like \"beat story mode\" to more complex ones like \"land 10,000 total attacks on an opponent\". In SC3, it was enough to go through the strategy-like sub-mode to unlock new clothes; in SC4, it feels a lot more limited, and since Create-a-Character is one of the most emphasized modes in the game, it feels really unusual.Customizing a character also adds stat bonuses and skills. For this reason, you can customize regular characters with Create-a-Character, too. You can either add items and change weapons for their default costumes (to give them stat increases) or you can give them their own costume made up from Create-a-Character parts, though for whatever reason you can't use their \"normal\" hairstyle and have to use their 2P hairstyle (or any of the other create-a-character hairstyles) if you want to customize them. Different clothes in the game provide different bonuses, either to stats (attack, defense, and health) or to skill points. Skill points are used to assign skills of various categories, ranging from things like \"automatic guard impact\" or \"automatic unblockable attack\" that will randomly aid you in battle, to \"health drain\" that sucks health out of enemies and gives it to you, to skills that increase your stats when fighting enemies of a certain gender or alignment. The skills and stats are kind of neat, but they also affect the character-creation process, when you feel like you have to buy stuff that gives good stats, instead of just getting stuff that looks neat. Thankfully, in versus mode (regular and online) there is an option to play the game without any stat modifiers or skills, which means that you can just have fights between characters without worrying about that stuff.The graphics in this game are really good - as mentioned, the armor in particular looks really nice. The costumes for the main characters have gotten a bit more ridiculous in most cases, but the new character, Hilde, has a really neat set of armor, and the create-a-character option allow for a lot of good armor choices as well. While the other clothes look okay, only the armor and the weapons really show off the game's graphics, with their reflective properties and intricate detailing. The game's backgrounds are pretty good, as well, but nothing particularly noteworthy or epic like some of the stages from SC2 and SC3. The audio is decent, but there's nothing really worth pointing out in terms of music or voicing.As a whole, Soul Calibur 4 is a disappointment that can be fun, but for the most part isn't. SC4 took all the complaints about SC3 and made them worse, and lost most of the things that made the series fun in SC1 and SC2. A lot of the systems and gameplay modes are really poorly handled. The only really fun thing in the game is messing with create-a-character, but despite the physique customization options, the incredibly limited number of faces, voices, and clothing sets kind of puts a damper on the whole experience. Really, it feels like SC4 is trying to do too many things at once, and isn't accomplishing any of them. If the game consisted wholly of a more fleshed-out character maker and a multiplayer game with some more game types, it might be better. As it is, though, Soul Calibur 4 only deserves a 7/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0050SZE2G","description":"","reviewerName":"AeroEngineer","summary":"Great Lengthy Game, Worth the money!","reviewText":"This game is a great installment of the FC world, stunning open world gameplay and setting, varied missions and side missions and some interesting story elements. I'd recommend it too because it's a good value for the inflated \"opening day(month)\" prices of just about every piece of entertainment out there. It will last longer than a more restricted linear type of game.I honestly don't really remember the previous FC stories but the story here is OK, nothing amazing or too believable but not a train wreck. The main players voice makes him seem not at all like what he actually does in the game. A little too emo sounding to me, and the characters are all from Santa Monica btw. Elements I liked were the dream sequences that stand out and are generally pretty neat to watch/play. The story does have some pretty ugly parts to it but this is to be expected in the vein of FC2.The animals are great in this game, the aggressive ones will attack you and kill you if you are not vigilant including tigers,crocs,bears,snakes,sharks, etc. I find the human character models to be quite good in the world, better than during the cutscenes to me. Vehicles are varied and realistic, wish they would have different camera angles(swingman) for when driving though. It is really a pain having no peripheral vision while driving. All the vehicles usable by you are land or sea based no flying. They do have delivery side missions that are timed if that is something you want to do.What I didn't like was when the game forces you to play a certain way like stealth or fail and button mashing sequences. Kinda goes against the open ended gameplay elsewhere. But thankfully these sequences are not common in the main missions. Some of the menus are a pain to deal with like when you want to switch weapons you initially can only hold 1 weapon so to switch you have to go to a store or a hideout even if you own more than one weapon. Once you craft more weapon slots it's not a big deal since you can hold 4 shooting weapons and switch on the spot.As far as rig needed I have an older mid range one and on mostly high settings at 1680x1050 it's smooth throughout. Win7, 4GB RAM, HD6950, Q6600.Overall this is a great game that is recommended. It's a great value since it's open world with many regular missions and many more side missions as well as just simple exploring of a pretty big world.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SZE2G","description":"","reviewerName":"I Haz Ps3 And X Bawks And PC","summary":"Only a few times a year.","reviewText":"Only a few times a year does a game like this come out. 2012 saw a lot of big games, although only a few held up. I played quite a few of these amazing games in 2012. Borderlands 2, The Walking Dead, Mass Efffect 3, Halo 4, XCOM, etc - but Far Cry 3 really stood out. I'm not saying it was the best, but man - it was good. The story is awesome. There are a few rocky points where you wish you could make decisions for you character and you cringe at what he's about to do. Jason's (your character) voice takes a little while to get used to as well. It's really soft, I don't understand why they chose such a light-hearted voice for a college kid. He sounds like a high school history teacher, not the young/crazy guy he's supposed to be.The game is long and filled with side-missions. I didn't do them, but if you're into that there's probably an extra 5+ hours in side missions. The hunting, gathering, etc is never necessary - but makes the game a lot more fun. You can get new weapon holsters to carry several guns at once, or you can be lazy and stick with 1 or 2 guns. You can take back radio towers. (Climbing them was always amazing, I think they implemented them just as an excuse to show off their world from a high vantage point.) These radio towers unlock new weapons for reduced or free prices.Honestly I could go on about the game, but I'm going to stop. I liked it more than Skyrim, because I actually got into the story and there wasn't an overwhelming amount of stuff to do. There was plenty to do, but I could also see an end. The gameplay mechanics are near-perfect, the story is engrossing, the world is intriguing and beautiful, the characters are AMAZING, and the game is overall extremely fun. My first playthrough took over 20 hours.Oh and the part where (minor spoiler) you are burning the weed crops and the Skrillex song starts playing is one of my all time favorite moments in gaming - and I've played a LOT of games.NOTE: The game is hard to run on higher settings - I have a GTX 680 and preferred playing without anti-aliasing on at all. Although everything else was maxed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2013"}

I will admit, I get frustrated easily with new things..especially something totally foreign to me like playing a guitar. I also get frustrated with things like new video games that are complex at all. I grew up playing Asteroids and Ms Pac Man :) so there was no \"Now what do I do? What spell do I use? Where do I need to go next in the game? How do I win at this?\" etc. So, ultimately I think that if you (or the person you want to buy this for...) loves Xbox video games AND has patience to learn guitar, and an interest in it...then this could be a perfect marriage!! If you are not into gaming, and don't pwn at things like Rockband etc, then I really think this will just frustrate you as it did me. My son, who LOVES Rockband, Xbox gaming (he's 15) and has more patience than I do...really thinks this could be the best way for teens and gamers to learn how to play. He found it interesting and educational and fun. But he's already back to shooters because he doesn't have a true interest in learning an instrument yet. I think this goes to his own history of playing Rockband guitars which is actually nothing like playing a real one. I know this is kind of a weird review, but I thought our deeper thoughts on this might help some folks make a decision if this is right for them.Sheri Gill","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2011"}

The name should conjure forth in a player's memory countless hours of \"One more turn\", how much coffee the human body can consume, and the true meaning of the word \"Addiction\".I poured more time into Civ2 than I have *ever* put into any other game, hands down. To this day I find myself playing it for hours at a time...the game is perfect, has seemingly infinite replayability, and is a blast in multiplayer. So when Civilization III was slated to come out I was beside myself with joy. I was an almost daily visitor to the game's website, inputting my own questions alongside the other thousands of fans.But how do you explain this game? To really understand the problem, one must look at both the inherent pros and cons of the game itself. In my humble opinion Sid got some things dead right, things that really do add to a game like this. And others it's like he forgot (God forgive me for saying this about a computer gaming legend like this) and got completely backwards.In it's favor Civ 3 is very pretty to look at for a game of it's type. Animated units run across the landscape and terrain has a fresh and real feel to it. Another plus to the game is the addition of borders. I love it when I can take over a rival city bloodlessly and intact. And it offers incentive to throw production into buildings that otherwise might be sidelined in favor of military applications: Libraries and the like. The research tree makes a little more sense than it did in Civ 2, but I'll be the first to tell ya that I miss the old one a lot more. I keep hitting Philosophy and expecting to get a free advance, and when nothing happens I can't hide my disappointment. The animated battles are nice to watch, and I like the addition of levels of experience for your troops, ie \"Veteran\" and \"Elite\".  The end of the game, as I watch my Civlization's borders expand on the overview area, I can't help but think back to that turn and say \"I remember that!\", when certain events happen or Wonders are built. These are all great things about this game to me, and it's one of the reasons that I continue to try to win at it.But the whole effort is hamstrung by some rather critical problems, ones that I'm surprised the gaming community doesn't seem to want to acknowledge, and those that do do it reluctantly. Here's some examples...- Units are horribly unbalanced. This has gotten a little better with the latest patches, but the fact remains that a guy wielding a sword should be NO match for a guy firing a rifle. It's frustrating to see advanced units fall before Medieval weapons...it makes no sense. I could forgive the game every single fault it had, if not for this single problem.- I have played, and played, and played. And yet I cannot seem to advance beyond Industrial Age despite the outrageous amount of time and effort I put into expansion and science research. I do not know what the American F-15 Special Unit looks or plays like. Nor the German Panzer. These will probably remain mysteries to me for as long as I play the game, and that bothers me. Civ 2 rewarded the player who put the most time and effort into Science by giving them technological edge over rivals and enemies. This, along with the unit imbalances mentioned above, seriously hamper the entire experience for me. Someone write me and tell me they've at least *seen* a Spaceship without cheating. I want to know if it's possible.- Diplomacy is a mixed bag. It starts out civil enough when dealing with other Civs, but I cannot see the sense in Hiawatha demanding that I give him World Maps, Money, and my latest Scientific Discovery, just so I can get useless World Maps in return. World Maps + 200 Gold + Printing Press does NOT equal World Maps, no matter how much of the globe he possesses.- The Corruption thing is a little out of whack. What incentive do I have to expand my empire when I know that my fringe colonies will never be able to build anything because they'll always have just one production shield? And yes I'm a Democracy, with a Police Station, Courthouse, Roads, and a Harbor. It makes me not want to expand because it's almost too much trouble.As I said, I could let the game slide by with 4 stars if the unit imbalance issue was corrected, but even after all these patches I still can't get over the fact that a Veteran Swordman can take down an Elite Rifle unit while only taking 1 hit.Star Control 3.

Im convinced it would not matter what EA put in this game some would find something to gripe about and pick to death. I have played some people online before and the main problem i see with most is they have no idea how to really play football. They live in the days where 2 plays would win u a game on offense and defense. Now we have AI in these games and though not always perfect somewhat stops these 2 play champions and they dont like it so they pick everything else to death. This game looks better the gamplay is overall smoother and faster,not as tight controls and the audible system changed and the control is a little awkward now. They could have left the kicking meter like it was but that can be overcome. This is not the best Madden ever made I like last year's better but its still worth having and playing. I'm not gonna sit here and pick to death something that is no more than 2k let me do this why doesnt Madden I'm mad and this game is horrible. The people with those kind of reviews need to get out of sega genesis mode and play football with some AI.&lt;2 play champs> Ha!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2010"}
{"product_name":"B004EVWYYG","description":"","reviewerName":"Adrian Cooper \"That Guy from Venus. :D\"","summary":"\"Snivy! I choose you!!\" 5 stars.","reviewText":"March 14th, 2011Now listen up. I've played all of the original series handheld Pokemon RPGs at least once excluding Diamond, Platinum and the remakes of Gold and Silver versions as well as a few spin-offs and well--it's super, super safe to say that none of them come close to this game but the original Gold and Silver games since a lot of what was included in them were quite innovative for the series. YES, I give Pokemon White, Pokemon Gold and Pokemon Silver all 10's, but this game just can't be touched in any which way.I must first seriously WARN you though: if you are even a remote Pokemon fan you WILL get addicted to these versions. There's simply so much to do, so much to remember that it all can be truly fun yet also overwhelming. But I'd like to think it's overwhelming with goodness! Simply put, this game will keep you busy for hours upon hours. I've had this game for exactly 8 days and it's safe to say that I beat the main story in 6. It was just THAT insanely immersive.Like they've been doing since Ruby and Sapphire (my least favorite entries in the series by the way), you can pick either a young boy or a cute girl in the beginning of your journey. Whatever your preference is doesn't really matter because it doesn't change the core game play. You also start your adventure, from the get-go, with your two best friends, blond-haired Bianca and serious-minded Cheren. They are two very different souls but during your journey I'm sure you will love at least one of them (if not both). And a HUGE plus is that they travel with you during your adventure. No, they don't hold your hand like what Misty and Brock were to Ash in the original (and best) cartoons, but they will be accompanying you from time to time, checking up on you and meeting up for Pokemon battles occasionally. Not to mention, sometimes they give you hints on where to go next.I know it's not new to the series (I believe it started with Diamond and Pearl) but this is the first time that I actually got to trade and battle online with a Pokemon game. It's very addicting mind you and you just might \"catch 'em all\" this way. Eventually. There are over 600 Pokemon after all. You can trade and battle with people from numerous places around the world and the burn and desire to do it often will definitely be there. I can't say enough about this feature. Also, there are others, but I haven't accessed them all yet. Just battling and trading.I'll make this part short but very sweet. The music, more often than not, is well--\"epic\" for the series in a simply uncomplicated way (I know, I hate when I oversee that word too, but hey--I only used it one time in this whole review!). You will find yourself *seriously* humming at least one of these themes before the game is over.Lastly, I'm gonna \"touch\" on the story. This is one of the huge factors that makes the game what it really is. If you're not a story person and don't really care what's going on, then it might not phase you much. Hell--you might not want to pick this up because this game has a story. Yes, this memoir is so emotional at times that you really can't help but feel sucked in and invested in it all. I'm not gonna go into any real details since I'm sure you know the basics about everything from Team Plasma and the in-betweens by now. Don't wanna make this WAAAAY longer than it has to be.Final thought: If you are even a moderate Pokemon fan, then you NEED to do yourself and your heart a favor and pick up a copy of Pokemon Black or White. Honestly, I hadn't read up much about them so when it came down to it, I picked White for two reasons: because the legendary Pokemon Zekrom looked 5x as cool as Reshiram but I also knew that if my favorite cousin was to get back into the series like I did, he would most definitely need (NOT WANT) the Black version, just 'cause it's black--one of his favorite colors (and maybe more personal reasons, who knows?).I usually stray from making really long-winded reviews, but I had SO much to say and besides, this game totally deserves it! In fact, I'm kinda thinking it's my new favorite game ever! Just know that a rating of 10 is not handed out easily by me.+Nice yet simple graphics stay true to the series+Mostly great music+Unova is and feels completely new with all new Pokemon to see until you beat the Elite Four+Best friends join you on your adventure+Great starters+Most Pokemon are cute or cool (unlike most in Ruby/Sapphire)+Engaging, emotional story+Online battling and trading is a breeze (and fun!)+Touch screen is well-implemented (but somewhat optional)+EXTREMELY FUN-Pokemon overall seem to have less experience points to give compared to the older versions (remembers the very first battle against your foe of any game played would result in an instant level up if you won against your opponent the first time--not so here)-Rotation battles are simply awful-May be too addicting for the tastes of someOverall rating--> 10/10 (or 5 stars)You can also find the original review (all mine) at gamespot.com under the name Darksongbird","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2011"}

Drawing inspiration from classical military conflicts of the 20th century, Killzone demonstrates a unique graphical style that captures the grit and realism of intense military warfare.","reviewerName":"Maria Marienthal","summary":"This Zone is made for Killing.","reviewText":"This is the best FPS exclusive to the PS2 that one can buy.  By far the best.  But is that saying very much?Alright, I know I gave it 4 stars; that's because it is a very intense, very addictive game.  Also, it has very many positive points, such as its high-speed action, well set atmosphere, and the panic inducing screaming that is always going on.Now this was no Halo killer, for this game had its flaws.  The graphics were not up to snuff with the latest PS2 releases, the audio fuzzes out, and the AI is...well...not smart.There were a couple of things missing too.  Having them would have made the game a bit extra special.The good points:  No PS2 exclusive FPS has the speed and fluidity of this game.  Finally, a run-and-gun that the system needed.  While pretty much all the other games were either pretty slow and calculating, or just plain bad, Killzone keeps the action alive constnatly.  It's linear setup keeps things moving right along as you jog from place to place, riddling your opponents with lots of  nice anmmunition.Also a good point is the atmosphere.  Few games have developed surroundings quite like this.  The destruction and the grime is so extensive that it simply makes you wonder...did little pixelated people really ever actualy inhabit this place?  The color scheme  is so bleak that it alone delivers a sense of hopelessness and the feeling that someone...something with glowing orange eyes is watching you.  Even the wind sounds, yes, the wind contributes to this.  The few things mentioned and many other little aspects all add to the environmental tension, and it is nice.Finally, although it gets annoying by the end of the game, everyone, I mean EVERYONE is screaming during gunfights.  The confusions that is heard over the gunfire is also key to the environment, as you the player know that the enemy is losing it just as much as you are.Alright...the bad newsThe graphics the graphics the graphics!!!!!!  Sometimes things just disappear and you can see through them, causing a bit of confusion, especially for the first time through the game.  If your TV has a very dark contrast, at some points it might be incredibly difficult to deal with whenever this problem happens.  The deaths that take place seem to happen in a total of 3 frames, and when characters die, they twist and contort in ways that...well...only jellyfish can.In addition, with all of the shouting, weaponfire, and machinery noise, sometimes the audio shuts off.  About 2/3 of my way into the game, my weapons stopped making noise.  This was a bit awkward.  Also, sometimes when your allies talk, the audio is so fuzzy that it becomes diffcult to understand them during or after a gunfight, especially one with lots of explosions.Also a flaw, the AI is not smart.  They will keep charging twoards you even if you're firing away at the heads; and it gets worse.  Alright so when I was playing in the final zone, as I descended a ladder, I landed directly behind an opponent.  Standing in front of him, facing me, was another one of his partners.  Neither came after me.  I was able to ascend the ladder again and pitch a grenade in their direction.  In any other game, I would have been long dead.Some stuff that was missing:There were no vehicles to commandeer.  Driving is never a bad thing.The weapons selection was somewhat limited.  Only about 10 weapons max were available.The multiplayer is less than mediocre.  The environments are horribly small and take you in circles...a lot.Overall, this game was very good.  But it had some flaws from keeping it from being great and deserving of a perfect 5 out of 5.  I found out that the initial perspective release date of this  game was Winter of 2005, but it came out just over a year earlier.  Even six more months of development could have fixed the flaws in this game.  Unfortunlately it was released to compete with Halo 2, and it didn't exactly compare.Good news though, the ending was very much left open for a sequel!!! :)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2004"}

It resembles the modern Castlvania games too much, but not in a good way. The writer has a difficult time getting me interested in the development of the story. In other words, I feel so indifferent towards the characters I wish not to help them but leave them be. Another thing I find very frustrating with this game is that the camera will turn you around when you enter a new location. For example, if you are heading North, once you are in the new area you are facing South or any other random direction. The confusion lies in this doesn't happen all the time. As a result, it makes you disoriented when you know clearly in your head where you are supposed to go. The map is also a bit misleading. At times, it shows a closed up area that I am able to go through. Sigh! I was totally captivated by the graphics when I played the demo.

Whereas the former was at times fun but other times frustrating, Dead Space is just top-of-the-line from head to toe. Everything about the game feels perfectly balanced and even small nitpick worthy issues can't stop it from being an exhilarating ride...at least during the first time.Story: In the near future, such ships exist called \"planet crackers\" which essentially grab gigantic chunks out of planets and mine them for resources and minerals. When the top ship, the USG Ishimura, goes silent and no contact can be made, in comes Isaac Clarke, an engineer sent in to what they think is just a communication equipment problem. Get in, fix, get out except the ship's crew has changed and not for the better as they're disgusting and deformed creatures hell bent on seeing you dead, often in the most gruesome manner possible.There's really only 2 complaints I can level at Dead Space's story: one, we're told to sympathize with Isaac thanks to a sidestory involving his girlfriend Nicole only Isaac doesn't say a single word throughout the entire story and makes him a bit more autonomous and hard to sympathize with. The second is that the game is essentially a glorified fetch quest only instead of collecting items, you're fixing stuff. Literally every chapter you'll receive reports from either Kendra or Hammond, your shipmates, that something on the ship needs to be fixed lest something bad happen. A chapter where your completely cut off from everybody would've heightened the tension and made you go \"now what?\" but otherwise, you're just errand boy. However thanks to the graphics and the pacing, you'll be quite hooked into the story.Graphics: What makes Dead Space such an immersive and effective game is the graphics since the ship just FEELS possible, as if this thing can actually exist. It's a lot more effective when you take into account the layout, lighting, various facilities and levels and everything from detail in the environments, the gore effects and especially that one part during chapter 4 involving the bridge makes you go \"holy ****\". Larger detail is lost more farther away things are and bodies on the floor have a weird ragdoll quality and it's not uncommon to start shuffling bodies with your feet like they're mannequins.Sound/Music: Equally impressive is the sound mix from the roars, screeches, pipes and cans dropping from...somewhere, this is the game to have if you have surround sound as the sound mix will easily make you paranoid about everything. The voice acting is one of those functional types where no one really excels in their roles but they don't stand out in the awfulness either. Primarily the voice acting comes from Kendra and Hammond who do good jobs for your voice characters. All that's heard from Isaac is his yells during hits, breathing when he runs and being in air vacuums.Gameplay: The first big thing Dead Space does is have no HUD displays anywhere on screen, well at least typical ones. There's no Halo-esque radar or ammo counter or a shield meter in the old-fashioned sense but rather everything's on Isaac's body. His health is a bar that runs up his spine separated into segments, his Statis (slow motion for specific things such as enemies or equipment) is a half-circle while ammo counters are displayed on top of the weapon in a display. Even cutscenes and character meetings don't have a separate cutscene but either come through holographic projections or brief moments where camera shows an action from somewhere else. This helps with the game and makes one wonder why most game designers don't use it more.Instead of traditional weaponry a la shotguns and assault rifles, Isaac carries engineer-type equipment from plasma cutters to rippers and the equipment feels like what one would use in their fixing duties so it's nice that they're functional for killing some beasts. The core of the game is to dismember your enemy, essentially take them apart piece by piece. Take their legs off and make em crawl or take their arms away and leave them attackless. Of course knowing how best to dismember is key since some actually change should you do something and screw you over even more. But with flamethrowers, pulse rifles and melee attacks at your disposal, you're more than well-equipped and that's what makes the game work: it's not difficult per se a la Ninja Gaiden but rather it's an even matchup. You against them and not feel handicapped by anything.With kinesis which acts similar to Half-Life 2's gravity gun where you can grab distant objects or move big things you couldn't otherwise move, there's also the aforementioned stasis which temporarily slows time down for an enemy which is fun since it's for a specific enemy so the annoying one can be slowed while you deal with the lesser types at full speed. Another of the more funner aspects is zero G. Just aim and if you can jump, you'll go flying which'll get you either on the ceiling, walls and all over. It's incredibly fun and having an enemy flying at you is a bit intense. The segments where there's no air are also great since the sound is drastically cut down save for muffled gunfire and yelling from Isaac.My one complaint is that the game isn't as amazing the second time since it becomes a bit more predictable. \"Oh, this is where I get ambushed so better go this way and do that\" and since some of the achievements are most definately multiple playthroughs needed, it doesn't make it chore-like but it drags it down ever so slightly. Whereas Mirror's Edge frequently had great moments mixed in with completely off-the-rails segments and gameplay moments, there's very little that breaks Dead Space. It's not \"scary\" per se and won't make you lose sleep but it's an intense ride.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2009"}

The voice acting is also well done.The control is ok except when you use some of the weapons.  You get used to it after a while but at first, you'll die a lot.One thing everyone should know is that this game IS NOT for kids.  If you have a 5 year old kid, get Pac Man World 2 or something else. This game has MATURE subject matter.  There is a lot of blood, violence, and sex.  No nudity but there is prostitues.  You can see the car shake and then if you feel like it, kill them afterwards, and get you're money back.  You can just walk to any person, take out a bat and beat them to death.  Cops can come but they'll be no more when you can just shoot a rocket at them.  Teens from 14/15+ should be able to play because by then they SHOULD know right from wrong.But, even though it has extreem violence, this game is still fun.  And any adult who likes to play videogames should check this game out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2002"}

Nevertheless, with so many classic from Nintendo, Atari, Sega, and others to add on. For Sega to add on this nostalgia, they put their classic mascot that really franchised a dynamic level for Sega, Sonic The Hedgehog. Arguably, the blue character has been in some magnificent video games predicaments and mazes. Arguably, he was a true giant during the Genesis days. Sadly, Sega was never able to rebound in the video game wars after the Genesis. Still, the Sonic days still come and go.The Sonic Mega Collection, is a collection of seven great Sonic games from the Genesis days: Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3, Sonic Spinball, Sonic 3D Blast, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, and Sonic & Knuckles, as well as 5 hidden games to add on. The games from those 2D days were just completely outrageous and still filled with fast speeds and excitement. The games still remain as addictive as they did then, but a little more. The collection also includes 5 hidden games: Flicky, Blue Sphere, Rishtar, as well as the 2 lock-on games that were added on to Sonic & Knuckles, that put Knuckles into the game, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Knuckles in Sonic 2.The games were each remastered beautifully, without any flaws or detail missing from the Genesis days. The game also includes some extras as well, including the old Sonic comics that were issued from the mid 90's, well over 300 issues of them. Not only that, you see some trailers from clips from different games including Sonic CD, which was overlooked for this collection, as well as a video about the making of Sonic The Hedgehog. All in all this is truly a game for the record books. Sega has done this time & time again with their own systems, Saturn, Dreamcast, and the PC, but the graphics are crisper here, and the gameplay control is just as simple as it was during the Genesis days.I'm just surprised this kind of collection hasn't been issued on any other console whether it is Playstation 2, Xbox, or the Game Boy Advance. Still, if you have missed the Genesis days from then, you get a second chane here with Sonic The Hedgehog, Knuckles, Tails, and the rest of the gang here on the Gamecube. Sonic Mega Collection is one well worth the twenty bucks spent.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2004"}
{"product_name":"B004NRN5EO","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Prepare to Die","reviewText":"A couple of years ago a game called Demon's Souls came around and was met with surprising praise.  The reputation of Demon's Souls was that it was a ridiculously hard game.  Those who played it and survived were quite passionate about the game.  While those frustrated with it were equally passionate.  Regardless Demon's Souls became a success.  Dark Souls serves to be the spiritual successor.  And it makes one thing clear right off the bat.  You will die.  Several times.  And it's not exaggerating that.You'll begin the game by creating your character and choosing between an assortment of classes.  Each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  While initially it's important to keep this in mind because of how the different stats vary, you'll eventually find enough equipment and items to really experiment with the class.  But for the beginning this is your chance to figure out just how you want to play Dark Souls.  You can be a well rounded warrior for instance or you can start off as a tank of a Knight... or a heavy hitting bandit or evasive thief.  Or, if you're really gutsy you could choose to be deprived at the start where things ramp up considerably in the beginning.After that you'll awaken in an asylum.  There isn't much story given to you at the start of Dark Souls.  What becomes obvious, however, is that you're playing a very different kind of dungeon crawler.  Dark Souls has a small tutorial where you'll be able to learn the basics of combat.  And you'll definitely want to take this time to read the messages scrawled about and learn the mechanics of the game.  Because it's not long after that Dark Souls cuts you lose and you're on your own.  And for the most part combat strings itself together really well.  In several games the goal is about hacking and slashing through a ton of your opponents without much regard to what your doing.  This approach will get you killed in Dark Souls.  Combat is surprisingly strategic.  It isn't just about landing blows but learning how to effectively dodge, strife, block, parry and go for the counter attack.  Each of the game's various enemies have different approaches to them and different strategies.  The game is incredibly challenging but it adds on newer challenges at a decent enough pace.The game is, however, unapologetic about it's difficulty.  Whenever you complete a specific area or down a boss you'll feel more accomplished than you've ever felt.  And the rewards are usually worth it.  You will find yourself in moments where you may have to grind.  Each time you defeat enemies you gain souls which go toward leveling up your class.  If you should die, you'll lose all your souls, though.  You can easily continue, though, and if you manage to make it to your corpse before you die again you can regain all the souls you've lost.The good news is that not everything done in Dark Souls has to be done alone.  You can invite others into your world to help you.  But more than that, Dark Souls utilizes a fantastic online component that most games don't offer (except for Demon's Souls).  The first is that you can view apparitions of other players who may have tackled specific tasks.  You can see what happened to them just the same.  The other aspect that's nice is that you can leave messages to other players.  Warning them of upcoming threats or giving them tips.  You can also rate how helpful they were giving them a longer time to be around.  The point is that it is a community effort.  All you need to experience this is an online connection.  Playing Dark Souls in offline mode makes the game a daunting one to play through.  You won't get many of those helpful tips and you won't see any spirits of players who have already been where you are.  The online aspect of Dark Souls is easily the best part about it.  Especially because after the first small dungeon, the game pretty much lets you loose and doesn't offer to really teach you anything beyond that.  You're at a point where you'll either be learning on your own or relying on other players to help you along the way.It all comes together really well.  The strategic combat and the way the online works make Dark Souls feel like a one of a kind game.  The only major downside is that so many gamers may just find it to be too difficult.  If you're an easily frustrated gamer, Dark Souls may not be for you.  You'll find yourself dying several times.  The bosses hit unusually hard and if you don't take the right approach to the right enemy they'll do you in easily.  Some areas also feel like trial and error.  If you don't take the hints you're given to heart, Dark Souls is going to punish you several times.  The good news is that once you really figure out what your doing the challenge becomes less mitigating.  But you'll die several times before this happens.  And just when you master taking down a certain enemy, the game introduces you to new ones.  Of course the end result is that you feel like you actually accomplished something the further you get.  Dark Souls just requires patience and meticulous strategy to get through.There are other things that make the game difficult as well.  Everything about it is treated as though you are online.  This means that you can still be attacked by enemies even if you're in the menu.  You can't really \"pause\" the game, you can only find specific safe havens away from combat such as bonfires which serve as checkpoints where you can rest and heal up as well as level up or your character.  Another aspect that can add to the difficulty is that other players can \"invade\" your game and engage you in combat.  The good news is that the game tries its best to balance things.  Often times you'll be invaded by someone of your own level.  And you usually have a chance to escape from them.  The emphasis, however, is definitely on helping out other players rather than competing against them.Dark Souls is also a gorgeous game.  In fact, from a production standpoint it's hard to really find any fault with the game.  The environments are detailed and varied.  The atmosphere is always setting the right tone, and best of all the music compliments it all brilliantly.  There is also a lot of great voice acting to accompany things.  It's a gorgeous game all around.The difficulty might be a bit much for some gamers, but those who undertake the challenge and meet it head on are in for a treat.  It's a well crafted game that offers up an experience unlike anything else you've seen.  If you're looking for a decent challenge then Dark Souls is the game for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2011"}

I purchased this game two days ago, and yes, I beat it in two sittings. The missions are so immersive, the controls are wonderful and the gameplay is simply addicting. One of my favorite things about this game is the careful attention to the plot. I was a bit worried that the video game would be a watered down version of the PG-13 film... I was very wrong. Certain levels in this game put you right into the muderous shoes of Darth Vader, killing everything that comes between you and your goals, while others put you in the shoes of the hero Obi Wan.As far as graphics, well, these rate at about a 6.5 to 7.0 right now in 2007, but for that generation of games they rate an easy 8.0. The game is moderately long, (the story mode takes about 6 or 7 hours) but there is so much replayability that story mode doesn't even put a knick in the potential gameplay.Overall this is a must buy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2007"}

It was pretty good. Although the main gameplay is mainly more focused on action this time around , it still has some platforming, and a lot of variety. The story starts out with ratchet , clank , and big al (from the first and third games)all set out to find a certain hero named captain starshield, that has been missing for a long time. They hear he was last seen at a region of the galaxy called the shadow sector. They set out to find him , and when they get to the shadow sector ,their ship is attacked by a gruop of robots , and they are brought to a certain space station . Here, Ratchet is forced to compete in an illegal combat sport called dreadzone.This is an arena-style show were captured heroes fight different enemies and complete various challenges in order to win their freedom . This sport is headed by a man called gleeman vox, who is the founder of the show.To make sure that Ratchet and Clank don't escape, deadlock collars are put around their necks. These are deadly devices, that will explode if they become uncooperative, try to escape, or do anything that is against the rules. So Ratchet is forced to compete in this show, until he and clank can find a way to escape.Now, there are a few changes to the game . First, it is focused more on action this time around , although there are still some platforming challenges here and there, so don't be discouraged . Secondly , Clank will not be on Ratchet's back anymore , and you won't get to control him . But don't worry , he will still be in the game .He will function as you mission control engineer , which monitors your progress through Dreadzone , and you'll still get to interact with him a lot .Also , as compensation for Clank's \"loss\", you will get two combat bots that will fight alongside you. These things are great , and their AI is great , so they'll make any stupid mistakes that will really annoy you. they have about 3 different weapons, that they'll use of their own accord (don't worry about this , as they choose them pretty wisely , and not just randomly and in a stupid way ). They also have 1 special attack that's very strong , and they can use it when it's available , and they use it only when you command them to. besides that, they also have about 5 gadgets that you can tell them to use whenever you need to . Their gadgets are really cool , and they are things like creating a defensive shield aroung you or the other bot when you're completing a certain task , or throwing an EMP grenade at electronic devices to shut them down (However, you'll only get to use these gadgets at certain points, like in the previous games.)You can also customize your bots with different heads and paint jobs.The weapons have also undergone a big change. This time you only have 10 weapons, but they are customizable. You can add tons of different mods to them . There are two types of mods:alpha mods , and omega mods.the omega mods add special qualities to your weapon , like the morph mod ,which turns enemies into animals, the insanity mod, which causes enemies to attack each other, and the naplam mod, which creats big pools of lava with each shot.The alpha mods just improve your weapons' performance, and they improve things like the ammo capacity of a weapon , the rate of fire of a weapon , etc.Co-op mode has also been added , and you'll be able to play the entire story mode with a friend.  This friend will replace your combat bots, and both you and he will have all the gadgets that your robots have. Speaking of multiplayer , versus mode and online mode have also returned. The vs. multiplayer inculdes 5 different mods , one of them being conquest mode, which is an improved mode of siege from the third game. Here , you have to capture more nodes than the opposing team , and if you hold a node long enough , you can get upgrades for it.The only downside to this game is that some people might not like the fact that it is focused more on action this time , although that didn't bother me.Overall this is a fun game , with lots of variety , great graphics,good weapon upgrading system, and great multiplayer modes.You can even choose the difficulty level , ranging from 1-5. I recommend this game to anyone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2005"}

In order to truly take advantage of Dreamcast's capabilities, we recommend outfitting the controller with a Jump Pack and a Visual Memory Unit.

{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"R. McAdams","summary":"Good, not great -- but not bad either","reviewText":"We played the game non-stop on legendary until complete last weekend.  Here is my review:Campaign co-op is possible, but if you have more than 2 people, you cannot play split-screen, or LAN, you'll have to play online.  What that meant for my 3-person crew, was 3 TVs, 3 XBOXs, and 3 copies of the game, in order for us all to be in the same room, sharing pizza, and having fun in person.Online multiplayer in standard \"forge\" mode is the same as it ever was. Slayer, death-match, oddball, etc.The new Spartan-Ops mode is a PHENOMENAL promise, and if they manage to pull it off, it will set the bar for years to come for online multiplayer.  My crew and I have already completed both of the 2 chapters on offer, and they are fun, and fit right into our weekly gaming nights seamlessly.Overall, the game is fun, the campaign picks up right where we left off with the Chief and Cortana, and it is a decent adventure with some heaping amounts of back-story finally filled in.  Bonus points if you have been reading the books, because they use that canon in the game. I DID NOT care for the ending, and I am hoping that Halo 5 will change what happened with some sort of comic-book hero resolution to what happened (I am trying not to spoil it, so I am being vague) -- but I am also told I am overly sentimental.Final thoughts: the game is still a bit buggy.  I personally died about 4 times in the campaign mode due to doors closing on me and just killing me. Additionally, the game is arbitrary about when it will warp you to the rest of the players, depending on the distance you are away from them. Some sort of a gauge on how much distance you have left before you warp (or warp others) would be nice.  The game also is frustratingly non-obvious in some areas, with no clear objective (besides survive). Finally, we have encountered a glitch in the online Spartan-Ops where our game blacked out like the chapter had completed, but the game didn't actually end -- we had to end the game and re-do it, to get it to complete correctly.Overall, the game is a 5 star effort, with a 4 star result, and that is high praise indeed for a studio picking up the mantle of a legend such as Bungie.4 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2012"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

Featuring real-life historical battles like Pearl Harbor and Guadalcanal, over 20 authentic WWII weapons, highly intelligent enemies, and a heroic cast of characters that fight on your side from level to level,Medal of Honor: Rising Sundelivers the standard-setting experience for all action games.","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Worst MoH game next to Airborne","reviewText":"The Good: World War II movie clips are interesting, you can use cheat codes, new arsenal of weapons, fun opening levelThe Bad: Wonky controls, terrible AI, boring gameplay, horrid framerate, ugly visuals, an overall lack of polishPearl Harbor was one of the worst terrorist attacks on the US, and was what got us involved in World War II. EA decided to leave the frontlines of Europe and head to Hawaii at Pearl Harbor and into the Japanese and Philippine frontlines. It's a nice change of scenery, especially back in the day when WWII shooters were coming out nearly every day. The problem is, Rising Sun is a reskin of Frontline with the lack of polish, detail, and just doesn't feel complete. Rising Sun needed about 6 months more of development before being anything remotely decent. What we have here is a sluggish, boring, and mediocre shooter, probably one of the worst shooters of 2003.The game actually starts out pretty nicely. The bombing of Pearl Harbor feels epic in this game, you are just a nobody sailor who gets woken up by the bombings. After you see the poorly pre-rendered cut scene you start controlling your guy and it feels very similar to Frontline, too similar. Right off the bat you realize the control issues haven't changed. The aiming is really sensitive and finicky, there's no iron sights aiming, and the controls just suck still. Once you run around the boat trying to escape you notice you can save at checkpoints. This is actually one of the only two major issues that were fixed from Frontline. The missions are very long and you no longer have to start at the beginning of every level when you die.Once you get out you notice the framerate is worse than Frontline. The FPS drops into single digits often and it actually affects gameplay. Trying to shoot someone when the game is chugging along at 5 frames a second is nearly impossible. It doesn't help that the aiming is already wonky. The change of pace in the beginning using the turret on the boat and shooting down planes is fun, I also have to mention that the only great part of Rising Sun is the music. Medal of Honor has a fantastic score across all the WWII games, but Rising Sun needs more than that to save it.Once you start the next level you realize the game is just so bad. The level design is abysmal with confusing mazes, it was cute for EA to try to make you feel like you have multiple paths but you really don't. It just makes things more confusing. There are also secondary hidden objectives this time around but they are nearly impossible to figure out, hell even the regular objectives are hard to figure out. Items don't flash so you can't tel if it's part of the scenery or something you need to interact with. Most of the time you just get lucky when a prompt comes up on screen when you pass something.I like the new selection of weapons, the shotgun, Type 99, Sten MKII, and a few other Pacific Theatre weapons. That's probably the only other great change from Frontline, but the guns control so horribly that you won't care. The most annoying part of Rising Sun is the forced and failed implementation of stealth. During one of the last few levels you get recruited into the OSS and have to infiltrate a Japanese summit at a hotel. The game gives you the Welrod which is a one shot silenced pistol. Sure that's fine, but Rising Sun wasn't built for stealth. I shot the first few people silently then all of a sudden I was being attacked. I had to run around the whole level with just a pistol and the Welrod. Not very fun. The hints say to stick to the shadows and stay in the column areas. Yeah sure what shadows? The stealth is just completely broken, but at least healing items give you more health so the game is a bit easier in that regard.Let's finally talk about graphics, the game is butt ugly, even uglier than Frontline. During the jungle levels the devs just put a flat texture of a forest on the walls. Yeah good jobs you lazy jerks. The game is just ugly and is so unpolished. The events in the game are so unbelievable that it's hard to think that these things actually happened. Did I mention there's still no blood? The last thing to go is the terrible AI. The friendly AI just stands there while they're being shot and completely ignore enemies, the multiplayer is also as boring as ever.Rising Sun sold millions of copies, but couldn't live up to the previous games quality. With ugly graphics, horrible framerate, terrible AI, bad level design and various other issues, Rising Sun stands as one of the worst games in the series.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000BWZY7Q","reviewerName":"Nona","summary":"Solid expansion pack and MMO","reviewText":"This is the first expansion pack to the incredibly popular online game \"World of Warcraft\", or \"WoW\", which is required to use this product.  As far as MMO expansion packs go, Blizzard really focuses on quality, not quantity, which is great, both in terms of making the game experience enjoyable, as well as not trying to get as much money from their customers as possible.This expansion introduced many substantial changes in the mechanics of WoW, so if you quit the game before BC (Burning Crusade) was released and are looking to return, quite a bit will be different.  Many of these changes were for the better; for example, the introduction of competitive  pvp arenas has revitalized and greatly increased the quality of pvp (there are even some WoW pvp tournaments for money now).  Like any MMO, the very end-game content is still often bugged, unbalanced, or improperly tuned, but these problems are really only experienced by less than 1% of the player base.  What makes WoW and BC so great is the sheer variety of polished content there is to experience.  The properly tested content is lots of fun, and many people will tell you that this game, like many MMOs, is very addictive.  Whether that's good or bad I'll leave for you to decide.So why only four stars, instead of five?  For me, the greatest drawback of this game is the dramatic shift in the style of this game when you reach the maximum level (currently, level 70).  Up until level 70, it's possible to enjoy all the content by yourself, or casually in pick up groups of five.  But at level 70, content becomes very group-oriented, which can come as a surprise to many people, and finding a regular group of reasonably skilled and dedicated players becomes more important.  If you want to experience the end-game raid content (for groups of 10 or 25 players), then this becomes absolutely essential.  Unfortunately, Blizzard does not offer great guild support, either in-game or on its websites, which can make experiencing end-game raid content difficult and possibly even frustrating for many people.  As a result, the depth of gameplay which you can only experience in organized, large groups, can be unnecessarily difficult for many players to see first-hand.Nevertheless, there's still plenty to do and enjoy in this game.  If you're new to WoW, odds are it will take you anywhere from 300 - 700 hours of gameplay to reach the maximum level, so it's probably still worth the money to buy WoW/BC if you're new.  World of Warcraft will keep you plenty busy, and it'll give you the chance to spend lots of quality time with your friends, or give you the chance to meet many new friends online.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2007"}

It has been nearly a year though since the Wii was launched with The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess as the main attraction, but many die hard fans have been anxious for a game that has delivered the appeal of Super Mario 64 from Mario's hay day. Although Super Mario Sunshine was also a fun game for the Nintendo Gamecube, it just didn't deliver as well as the Nintendo 64 classic had proven. But, Mario has proven his strength earlier this year on the Wii with gems like Super Paper Mario & Mario Party 8 which both worked well as great buys for the Nintendo system, but this is the one that reaches to the stratosphere.Super Mario Galaxy for the Nintendo Wii, brings in the big guns, as Mario does whatever it takes to save Princess Toadstool a.k.a. Peach from the clutches of Bowser. This time around, Mario takes to the sky to help him in his quest. Along the way, Mario has to collect star bits, which can help him beat enemies and bosses of all kinds, from the classics like Thwomps and goombas, to bigger than life boss battles like a vulgar spider who shoots venom at you, and even a mecha robot that fires bullet bills at you from all different angles.There are also a few new features here that Mario shines through as well in the game, like specialty suits like the bee suit, which transforms Mario into a bumble bee, that can make mario fly through the Honeycomb stage, where he can collect coins and stars from each of the levels. There is also the boo suit, where Mario can actually become the ghostly menace, Boo in the haunted house level to help him enter ghostly portals that Mario couldn't normally enter, but it also can make the other Boo ghosts quickly fall in love with Mario in the blink of an eye. There are also some returns of classic items to use as well like the Fire Flower, and a new ice flower that Mario could use to freeze his foes on ice.The graphics in the game are absolutely breathtaking and appeal well to the Wii's eyes, while the music is simplistic and elequent to the ears of Mario fans, especially as he surfs the galaxy. The control is also very simple to manuver, and stays mainly relevant to the palms of the Wii remote and nunchucks' hands. You can also use the Wii remote to help you grapple onto trees and meteors that can help you launch from one platform to another, and you can also use to help you collect star bits, and perform new attacks like the spin move. There is also a new co-op mode where for the first time, two people can play, as you can use another player to help you collect star bits, to help you along your quest, and defeat tougher foes like a giant octopus in the lava, and even giant goombas that are beyond the heights of the world.All in all, what I love about Super Mario Galaxy is that it is everything Wii owners have wanted in a great game, and more. It is a definite must buy for the Wii that is sure to bring a lot of excitement into die hard Mario fans. This is one game that really brings out the heart at being the best of what the Nintendo Wii has delivered, and that has still shown to die hard Mario fans of all ages. I absolutely recommend it as a great buy on a star-spectacular scale.Graphics: ASound: A+Control: A-Fun & Enjoyment: AOverall: A","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2007"}

It is clearly marketed towards a younger audience and being a mature (and what some consider a \"hardcore\") gamer, I didn't think this game was up my alley at all.  I was wrong.This game, what some would call Diablo for kids, is a tried an true formula made accessible for all audiences with goofy humor, fun and quirky characters and an accessible difficulty and learning curve.  The game is essentially a co-op dungeon crawling loot fest with on-the-fly swappable characters.  That last sentence might seem like gamer-speak and it somewhat is.  More basically the game is set up on a series of missions which are different locations to conquer and treasures to find with characters being easily changed out without having to go through hoops to do so.  And it includes local 2 player play.  It's a fun formula when do well and it is done well here.What makes this iteration unique is the character swapping mechanic - instead of going into the menu system you place different figurines on the electronic pedestal and instantly that character shows up on screen. In practice it is really neat.  The best part is that that character's information, levels gained, gold acquired, etc, stays programmed on that plastic figurine.  So when you take it to a friends, all that hard work you've put into the character travels with you, and vice versa, the levels gained at your friends come back to your game.That's not all, the figures are all interchangeable between different versions of the game.  So you can play on the PS3 at your house, the 360 at a friends and the Wii at anothers and it all works. Ingenious.Which brings us to the downside of the game.  Again, the figurines - they're not cheap.  At roughly $8 per figure, or $21 for a three pack, you can easily spend more on figures than you do on the actual game/starter pack.  Not only that the game encourages you to buy the other figures by including teaser elements for the other characters as well as locked areas of the game if you don't have a character of a specific element.  The starter pack contains 3 elemental figures of the 8 available types.  Simply to finish all areas you will need an additional 5 figures which will run you over $40.Finally the game isn't perfect itself, we've discovered glitches in the game causing it to freeze/crash and lose all progress in a level.  Frustrating, but not game ending.In summary, the game is a great family game and easily played and enjoyed from the most casual to the most hardcore of players.  I would love to give this game 5 stars but the cost of the extra characters and the game freezing glitches knock a star off.  Still, for those knowing what they are getting into, a lot of fun awaits with Skylanders.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2012"}

It has a long story campaign to play.  Lots and lots of different different game modes to suit anyone's tastes.  This game fits anyone's skill level.  Whether you're a beginner or a lethal gearhead, you'll find a place in this game.  For all those people who are intimidated by the elite human gamers and who are slaughtered in games like Modern Warfare or Battlefield, Gears offers Horde mode, Beast mode, co-op mode (in both story and other game modes), and bots in any multiplayer mode.  In all these modes, you play alongside your human friends to survive against the computer players.  It's really an all-for-one, one-for-all mentality and it's a great time for all.  If you're a stud, you can reign death on the enemies while protecting your friends while if you're inexperienced, you can still dish out damage while under protection of your friends.  The ability to have bots in any multiplayer mode also allows you to learn how to play these modes without the same duress as facing human players.  Very few games allow bots in multiplayer matches but Gears does.  Then when you're ready to venture out to the bloody battlefields, you'll feel more prepared.Also, it is very easy for your friends to drop in and out of the game at any time.  A great thing is host migration now exists so if the host quits out of the game, players are no longer dumped to the lobby.  It migrates to another host so that everyone can keep gaming.There is just so much content and variety in this game.  The sheer amount of content makes this game feel so much larger than other shooters.  No 6-hour campaign and a handful of game modes in Gears!The graphics are just beautiful.  Screenshots and Youtube do not do this game justice.  When you're on a night map, you look up at the sky with the moon beaming soft moonlight through the church tressel.  Beautiful.  When you're on a dusty map and the sand storm starts to roll in which you can see coming from the distance and then which envelops you in blinding dust.

Dead Space was almost dead in the water.  The original game and concept was to be a prison ship where, to my understanding, you would be fighting prisoners while trying to escape.  After a script rewrite, as something thought a horror game would be better, we now have one of the best horror games of all time (in my opinion).Gameplay: If you do not know what dead space is about instead of watching videos or spoiling the game by reading a faq / walkthrough , all you need to know is you are Isaac Clarke. An engineer sent with a bunch of people to fix a busted up comm's array on a \"planet cracker\" .  A ship designed to rip planets apart to salvage valuable resources.  Your landing goes.. a bit wrong lets just say and from that point on keep your door locked and the lights on.  This game specializes in jump scares and old school horror (like resident evil). Harder the difficulty, the more impossible the game feels.  The gameplay doesn't get old, as you collect schematics for new weapons, power nodes for upgrades(adding an RPG element), dual fire modes and actually rewards you for being a good aim or at least learning the weak spots on enemies.  The controls (for PS3 at least) are positioned well and allows you to make multiple actions w/o much effort.Sound/Story: The sound is surreal.  Amazing... It does a perfect job of making you paranoid, scared and feel claustrophobic.  Voice acting is very good and believable.  The story is great!  On first playthrough you might find it has a few holes in it but do enough side exploring and find some hidden vids/text document files and those holes will be filled.  The storyline is pretty unique and you will feel like Isaac the entire time -- trying to put the pieces together to figure out just what happen on the IshimuraGraphics/Presentation: The game looks great.  720p (1080p if you force it).  The levels are very creepy and set a scary, dark tone. You will traverse the Ishimura(spelling?) in an attempt to flee the nightmare you walked into.  Zero Gravity rooms, moving in the vacuum of space, tight corridors, rooms with no lights etc.  The game does a very good job of making every chapter feel like an entire new place despite being stuck on board the spaceship. Image wandering through a tight hall with the sole light flickering.. odd writing on the walls and a strange sound rattling in the rafters above that sound like footsteps.. makes you think something is watching you. Perhaps something is --Length/Replay: You can get a good 8-10 hrs on EASY out of the game.  If you are good enough might be able to cut that down to 6-7hrs. Impossible will make you almost cry especially if you play it how the game intended (no DLC and only using the Plasma cutter).  By beating the game on any difficulty you unlock \"impossible\" which can be selected from the new game menu right after saving a game plus file (or you can load a game plus file then start a new game).  I've played through the game 4 times already.  While the scare factor is almost all but gone for me the gameplay keeps me coming back!Summary of \"cons\" I have for this game (with positive re-enforcement)- DLC tends to ruin the game.  Did an impossible run with the Tank suit and Heavy Dmg weapons.  Was not a lot of fun killing enemies in 2 hits.  [Best bet if you are going for a true experience, play the game on HARD with your first playthough and do a Plasma Pistol only run.  Can always then do an \"easy\" game and use that to unlock trophies/have fun.- Not so much a con but well a mechanic flaw in the game.  Some 'ammo' is pre-set in the game. The rest is randomly chosen from what weapons you have available to use with priority given to what you have on your character [basically if you only have a plasma cutter 90% of the ammo in the game will be plasma rounds.  This leads to an insane surplus and takes away from the horror experience.  Equip 4 weapons so that you always have 'low' ammo.  Makes every shot count then.. but again.. this is OPTIONAL]Overall Score: 98%A must have for any Action / survival horror / sci-fi gamer.

Randall","summary":"Worthy, if lesser, successor to the original","reviewText":"In 2002, Nintendo unveiled a game of such vision, complexity, and stunning visual detail that it shook the gaming world to its core.  In a time when Xbox and Playstation 2 games were running away with the market and widely considered to be far superior to anything Nintendo put out, this game rose above it all to become one of the most popular console games of the past decade and even achieving the coveted title of GameSpot Magazine's 2002 \"Game of the Year\" honor (for ALL platforms, not just Nintendo).  That revolutionary game was \"METROID PRIME\".Two years later, the time has come for the much-anticipated sequel to that seminal video game.  Just this past November, \"Metroid Prime 2: Echoes\" hit the market just in time to quell the hunger of Samus Aran fans nationwide who had their appetites hopelessly whetted by its predecessor.  With all this pressure of having to live up to the standard set by \"Metroid Prime\", the burning question becomes, \"How well does `...Echoes' stand up?\"  While not being quite mold-breaker of the original, \"Metroid Prime 2: Echoes\" holds up quite well.The story, in brief, leads Samus, our intrepid bounty hunter, to the planet, Aether.  Initially in pursuit of a quarry, Samus ends up involved in a much deeper and far more dangerous struggle as Aether struggles with a rift torn in time that has torn the planet between two dimensions, light and dark.  It is up to Samus to travel between the two dimensions to recover the stolen energies that caused the rift and to close the rift for good.  All the while, she is followed and mocked by an adversary who looks very familiar.The true strength of \"...Echoes\" is in its stunning graphics, which even surpass the incredible visuals of \"Metroid Prime\".  The attention to detail is so great and realism so present that the player feels more like a part of this game than in any that have come before.  The concept of traveling between the Light and Dark Aether worlds, while initially difficult to adjust to, proves to be a tremendous asset because is forces the player to adopt different strategies based on which realm Samus is in (i.e. the atmosphere on Dark Aether is poisonous and Samus can only seek shelter within small fields of light crystals).  The degree of challenge is right up there with the previous game and conclusion of the final battle leaves one feeling quite satisfied. The addition of light and dark crystal weapons, while not very practical, are also a nice touch.Alas, there are some weaknesses to \"...Echoes\" that leave it a step below the original.  One of the most glaring is how it seems that some missions are just plain tedious and take forever to accomplish, despite not involving a high degree of challenge.  The beauty of \"Metroid Prime\" was that even random explorations of the various aspects of Chozo provided a visual treat that created a very robust gaming experience.  \"...Echoes\" has more of a bare-bones feel to it that leaves the player just wanting to rush from one mission to the next to finish the game as quickly as possible, instead of taking in the full experience.  This pattern continues with a number of the enemies and bosses that are faced.  Defeating them seems more like a chore than a challenge.The overall structure of the game feels a bit more out of focus than in the original.  The maps overlap and confuse much more than they help (a marked difference from the first when the maps were an tremendous help).  In addition, the dearth of save stations through the game proves exceptionally frustrating when a player has to go way out of their way to save the game or risk losing all their progress by forgoing it and losing a life in a tedious manner later on.This quibbles aside, \"Metroid Prime 2: Echoes\" still stands strong next to its older brethren and more than leaves the diehard Samus Aran fan's appetite whetted for future installments.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2005"}

Martin","summary":"An Insightful Sci-fi Classic!","reviewText":"Deus Ex: Human Revolution is an excellent game with a superb story that bridges the gap in game style between some of the most prominent titles of the FPS-RPG and FPS genre like Half-Life, Bioshock, and perhaps Mass Effect.The game will tell an epic story of the development of a new \"disruptive technology\" entering society, and the reaction of a variety of different mysterious social groups to this phenomena through ambient storytelling methods one might expect from the Half-Life franchise, character dialog reminiscent of the Mass Effect franchise, and beautiful cutscenes seasoned with one of the most captivating soundtracks of the last ten years, all within the context of an open world FPS-RPG.While the game resides within an open world, I was thankful for the game's HUD/radar augmentations that help guide you through the world from objective to objective to keep you on track for those who aren't interested in tediously exploring every nook and cranny of the Deus Ex universe along the way. Also, while the game is open-world, I felt like the game was relatively content-dense compared to games that purportedly offer an open-world experience, but do so by watering down actual game and story content in order to increase overall gameplay time without adding much to the overall experience (like Fallout 3).The only complaints I could make about this game include the lack of ability to fully-interact with some characters in the world (like strippers, as you can in the open-world offered by Grand Theft Auto), and a general lack of space in the character's inventory. These issues are very minor, and will not hinder delivery and enjoyment of the game's magnificent story. Lack of inventory space is an issue easily mitigated by upgrades available in the game, but remains a persistent problem throughout the game even given the upgrades.Perhaps the most conclusive and lasting evidence of the classic nature of the game will be its ability to provoke the timely exploration of thought-provoking ideas relevent to our world and the near-future, and entry into a thoughtful mental state provoked by a combination of the nature of the soundtrack, the depiction and experience of a world gleaming with prescient displays of near-future disruptive technologies and the game's masterful story that surrounds them.EDIT: The game worked flawlessly with Steam, and I was able to easily register the game with Steam and proceed to enjoy the game, along with the benefits of Steam integration. Controller support was also excellent, with full compatibility for the Xbox 360 controller for PC.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-02-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"B.L.","summary":"Remarkable","reviewText":"Edit: I wanted to say this at the top for better visibility... I STRONGLY recommend looking into the two-factor authentication options that are available whenever you read this. Also, avoid buying gold from the 3rd party companies. These companies are absolutely rampant in hacking accounts and causing problems in all MMORPGs lately, and taking a few minutes to secure your account can save you a lot of trouble down the line.Edit 2: Another important point, be careful exactly where you buy. There have been some stories of people buying the game from random sources, only to find out that the person they bought from then went back to the company and asked for a refund of their original purchase, which then invalidated the activation key. I don't know all of the details of what's going on, but in a 'better safe than sorry' sense, you'll probably want to stick to buying from companies that you feel very comfortable trusting.I'm writing from the perspective of someone who's both played MMORPGs and done design work related to them (though nothing related to ArenaNet or the Guild Wars franchise ever, I have no ties to them other than having been given a chance to play for review purposes). I'm mostly commenting here on the philosophy ArenaNet brought to building GW2, because the details of the mechanics are going to change over time. Understanding the goals of the developers, though, tells you a lot more about whether the style and priorities of the game are going to be something you'll be interested in and perhaps want to stick with playing for years to come.What is really remarkable about GW2 is how unapologetically not World of Warcraft it is. WoW is an amazingly successful game, and it has a lot of fantastic qualities that have virtually become the standards of the genre. GW2 makes some very different decisions and sets its own priorities, and the result will be great for some players and frustrating for others.The PvE realm of things is very cooperative. Having multiple people jump in on kills, quests, and gathering nodes does no harm at all. If you hated having to deal with people going out of their way to make your gaming experience unpleasant in other MMOs, that would be a great reason to give GW2 a try.The PvP end of the game is remarkably accessible. Everyone who enters into PvP is automatically treated as max level with appropriate stats, abilities, and gear. Plenty of room to just jump in and have fun with it without having to slog through the questing content if fighting other people is the only thing you really enjoy.They seem to have wanted to get away from numbers as a form of progression. Leveling doesn't matter anywhere near as much as it does in other games because you scale to the local content if your real level is too high for it. When you advance your end-game gear you get stuff that looks different but isn't really different in how it functions. The scaling makes it very easy to play with friends without having to stress out about making sure that you have characters of about the same level.The world design is absolutely gorgeous. The game world is incredibly huge and includes a ton of plot, though the quality of said plot is a bit uneven.The main thing that I would suggest keeping in mind when deciding if you want to play GW2 is that the developers seem to have mainly wanted to create a game that would let you come and go as you please. You can log in and be perfectly capable of participating in various activities almost immediately. The way that they handle progression means that it's not a game where everyone else is getting more powerful around you all the time. You can take a couple of weeks off when you want a break and come back to a game where you are still just as strong as you were, instead of effectively getting weaker because everyone else kept going and you didn't.On the other hand, if what drives you in a game is that constant fight for progression and supremacy, you'll probably feel bored and unfulfilled before long in GW2.On the whole, you can absolutely get your money's worth in entertainment out of this game. Its cost is pretty typical as games go, it has a gigantic amount of content, and there's no ongoing subscription fee to pressure you to play constantly to try to get your money's worth out of it. It doesn't have the gear-treadmill PvE endgame, though, and that's going to bore a lot of people who play MMORPGs seriously for the PvE and raiding. Its approach is really fantastic for certain types of players, but there are also people for whom it's just not going to work (or, some people will probably wander in and play a little whenever there's a lull between content releases on other games).One thing that I would STRONGLY recommend is looking into the \"two-factor authentication\" options described on the company's website. This basically means an extra way of proving that you are really you in addition to your user name/password. For example, it can ask your user name and password, then also ask that you give it a numerical code that is generated (with complicated math you don't need to worry about) by a Google app you can install on a smart phone. It is a very good idea to set this kind of thing up because account hacking is a huge problem in MMORPG games and this kind of technology tremendously reduces the chances that you will suffer from it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2012"}

There isn't much in the way of instant gratification, you earn what you get. There are tons of areas to explore and things to see. The world itself is very interesting, even going through the world alone is a treat. A change from the last Guild War is that this story carries some semblance of a single player type story. You can walk around, talk and get quest alone. So you don't have to wait around in a lobby until you have enough players to roll on a dungeon. Its not something to make or break the game, but it will appeal to a certain number of players and that is good. The leveling system is a little different. In PvE places your character's level will change to that of the nearest creatures as to prevent a challenge despite you normally being over powered. The same happens in PvE levels. Good ideas, but it doesn't do anything about the gear being used. But at least they tried to balance the floor somewhat. For those that loved the first game, this is plenty of improvement but with a similar feel. For those who have never played is a good place to drop in and give it a go.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2013"}

Color me impressed.  I can see why it got such rave reviews.  I'm not much of a fan of super hero games (so thank goodness my wife bought it for me, because I wouldn't have purchased it myself), but now I think I know why.  Usually, games based on super heroes don't make you really feel like you're playing said super hero.  This game does.  From the detective work, to the combat, to the exploration, Arkham City really makes you feel like you are Batman.The story includes so many famous villains from Batman's history, and the plot is picking up nicely so far.  The RPG elements are welcomed.  Earning experience from fighting enemies and leveling up gadgets and combat skills is implemented perfectly.  The Gamepad is used to an impressive extent since it's a port from the other two systems.  The map and menu functions are very helpful, and using the scan mode when performing detective work is really cool since you see the area through the Gamepad; it's as if you are literally standing in the room or area as Batman.The more I play the game the more I enjoy it.

New features since VF 3 include breakable walls, more detailed backrounds, 2 new characters, and the removal of the evade button. However, there are features missing from VF 4 that hinder it from becoming a true classic in my opinion. First, there are no individual endings for the characters...where's the incentive to beat the game? Also, compared to Tekken 4 the controls seem stiff and stubborn. VF 4 is intended for those who take their fighting games seriously. The Virtua Fighter series has been long regarded as the expert's fighting game, and for good reason. Even though the button layout seems simple (punch, kick, and guard), learning and implementing all the attacks/reversals for each character takes dedication. So if you insist on having every little detail of the game balanced and refined, Virtua Fighter 4 is for you.

This is quite possibly MK at its best.  At least in the last few years.  I am not a huge fighting game fan since they tend to get old fast.  You play through a couple times and then it collects dust.  The single player mode is pretty much that.  Kombo Challenge (which is really only fun and useful to pick up some new moves), Arcade which is isn't packing anything new, and Story Mode which, while fun, is rather short and after one time through on each side, is spent.  The Freefall and Freeform Kombat modes are quite possibly the best tweak I have seen made to this franchise and is really a fun, over-the-top addition to any battle.  The chance to fight as The Joker though, was the selling point for me.  Midway did not disappoint.  The \"super-powerless\" characters are no pushovers and the moves of all characters are VERY true to their comic book persona.  Combine that with 1080 graphics and awesome sound, you have a well made game that just can't overcome the flaws so many fighting games have...........the replayability of the game on your own, but one that with friends(online and same-console) will keep the blood flying for hours.Online is fun, albeit challenging at times.  The biggest gripe I had was the times I played online seemed to lag quite a bit.  I would be fighting and then suddenly four of their moves would show up at once.  I also had a fight stopped when I wound up in a wall with no way out.The same console multiplay is where I have worn this game out.  I love playing against my friends at home on the same deck and this game delivers fun, fluid, and frantic battles.  I have even found myself getting creative with some home-made combos.  Make a note.......I have NEVER enjoyed a fighting game so much as to experiment with my own combos.  For me, this has made MK v DC worth the price of admission.All in all a VERY solid game.  I'd like to see some DLC in the form of alternate costumes, additional characters, arenas, or game modes to keep it fresh.  While the roster is not small, it does seem to need a little something extra after playing hundreds of multiplayer battles.  Perhaps a four-player tag fight?In short, if you got some friends you want to go head to head with, this game is a satisfying 4 stars and will do the trick for any MK fan.  If you are home alone with no internet on your PS3 and no friends to play this with you......you may want to rent this game.

Wow! A very pleasant surprise! True HD all round! Excellent bang for your buck, due to the integrated Blu-ray player. Watching Blu-ray movies on my PS3 is as much of a shock and awe experience as going from a black and white tv to a color Tv. It was like an epiphany! It is THAT big of a difference from a regular DVD! I expected a little extra clarity and instead was blown away. It makes movies far more immersive and renders action scenes with such clarity you will be left sitting on the edge of your seat with your jaw dropping. Yes, it is that impressive. Best of all, the games are also true High Definition. PS3 beats XBOX 360 and Wii hands down for graphics (and sound)! Sony rocks! I can't wait for more games to become available. I'm just itching to play \"Final Fantasy\" on this thing! Till then, \"Dark Kingdom\" is keeping me happily occupied.I highly recommend registering (free) online as soon as you get a PS3 60GB console, and you will find yourself able to hook into the PS3 games online store, where you will be able to download all kinds of free game demos (the Gran Turismo HD Concept game is available free online for a limited time and is incredible, both in graphics and in handling. If it is a demo (?) it is huge, since I have been playing it for days and it hasn't cut me off yet!). And you can also get very cheap smaller games such as Sudoku etc (ranging between $5.99 and $9.99). Nice, inexpensive HD additions to your PS3 library! What a wonderful ToyStore!Going online really does open up a whole new world, even if you aren't interested in playing with other folks there. And the 60GB PS3 hooks up to the internet wirelessly and downloads stuff directly to the hard-drive effortlessly. Just click YES!Even my music CD's and mp3's sound better coming out of the PS3 as compared to my old DVD player. PS3 really generates awesome sound! I am still happily surprised about that, since I love good sound. The games sound awesome too! This console will leave you with a permanent smile on your face, guaranteed!Accesories worth investing in, in my opinion, are(1): (a) Component Video Cable (plus optical cable for sound), or (b) HDMI cable, depending on your TV's/ stereo receiver's capabilities (the console only comes with a regular, cheap composite av cable which really sucks for such a high tech unit... pretty useless). Tsk tsk, Sony!(2): a Remote Control for the Blu-ray movies. The remote I got works with bluetooth technology and is the best remote I've ever had, since you don't have to point it at anything. You don't even have to be in the same room (hehe). It is a very sweet remote. And makes watching your DVD's easy, with all the \"pause\", \"Fastforward\", \"etc.\" features you may desire.(3) A front projector. That's what I have been using (onto a 10ft by 10 ft. wall), and because of the excellent HD graphics from the PS3, the picture is clear and sharp as can be, with wonderful resolution and brightness. Just thought I'd mention that for those who have a projector and are wondering if PS3 games will work well on a larger screen like that. YES they will! Finally, I can play on the big screen (PS2 games didn't have a high enough resolution etc. to work well with the projector). If you are looking for a good projector, I recommend Mitsubishi DLP (with HDMI) models. Ours is an older model (two years old) with Component Cable capability, but without HDMI, so I won't recommend that model specifically, but I must say we have been very happy with it, and it has worked flawlessly. Even the bulb seems to last long past its due. Seems very well designed, at a reasonable price.PS3 is going to carry us through the next few years of technological advances quite seamlessly, I believe. In other words, it's going to be a long time before this baby is outdated. WOW! I am still in shock. Many thanks to my dear hubby for surprising me with this gift for my birthday. And the surprises with this console keep coming, as I discover more features all the time. It is so much more than a game console! Thanks to Sony too, for blowing all the other consoles out of the water and off the face of the earth!!! (in my humble opinion)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2007"}

It's addictive. I keep halfway hoping that one of the kids will borrow it and then lose it. I seem to have a problem.I remember when bejeweled came out and I played it non-stop for like 2 days. Then I got annoyed because you'd run out of moves and the game would be over and you'd have to start all over again. There may have even been a few choice four-letter words flying about.This is quite a little \"twist\" on the original. Instead of sliding two jewels around, you rotate four of them. There are bombs and locks and countdowns and other things to get in your way, so you may be setting up a move and have to go deal with the ticking time bomb before coming back to your set up.There are several things I like better than the original Bejeweled. The most important is that you can make moves that don't result in a clear. This is great for setting up moves, as I said, but also great because you aren't kicked off the game just because you ran out of moves. I also like the challenge of having some bombs and things that need \"immediate\" attention, it makes the game play more dynamic and fun.I LOVE the Zen mode. One of the things that annoys me about this game is the classic mode doesn't save your level. So, if you do die, you have to start all the way over at level 1. This is fine if you are only a level 5, but if you are at level 15... very annoying. When that happens, I just go into Zen mode for a while because I'm too busy pouting. An unlock key or something would be useful - or a true save point. Something.The challenges are great. This is where you have to clear X number of jewels in one move or something like that. Also fun is the blitz mode, where you basically just go as fast as you can to get as many points as you can.I also realized after the first day that you don't have to use the stylus (yay!). I was getting annoyed with it, and figured out you could use the regular keypad. Much more to my liking and I don't hit the wrong jewel on accident.For puzzle games fans, this is a definite must-buy. If you are a major Bejeweled fan, give it a few tries before getting annoyed with it. It's quite the adjustment from the original.I'm giving this 4 stars. It loses one simply because you cannot truly save a game in classic mode. And that, well, that annoys me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2010"}

It forces the player to think ahead and time your turns as precisely as you can.  The game doesn't forgive people for having knee jerk reactions.  You might actually have to plan out some of your attacks.  That being said, I do agree it would have been better to enable the analog sticks as an option.  As a whole, the game is still good.

{"product_name":"B006VB2UMI","description":"","reviewerName":"D. Brady","summary":"The best on current gen","reviewText":"The new Madden is not perfect, but it blows everything that has come out on the current generation of consoles out of the water. There are a TON of changes this year, that make it feel like a totally new game. I'm a fan of the franchise, I admittedly buy it every year, and this is the best iteration of it probably since 2005.The new engine adds a lot I think. I know some people complain about the ragdoll effect, which is valid,but seemingly cosmetic. Anyone complaining is missing the point on how the Infinity Engine changes the game for the better. The runners run smoother, the animations aren't canned anymore, and player control is at an all-time high. Gone are the days of starting a juke move with a RB, only to have him shuffle out of bounds with no control over it. Gang tackles FINALLY work. Knocking a player off balance effects the play in front of you. Runners (including QB sneaks) push from the back of the pile and squeeze in gaps instead of just running into the back of the center. WR can have the ball jarred loose in the air by CB's. All of this is the new engine at work, and if it means a few goofy pile ups on replays, I'm all for the new system.The connected careers mode is pretty cool. I have created a custom player and plan on playing thru his career. The concept is cool, and I like the idea that the league you're in doesn't stop because your one player retired. I want to play around with it some more before I develop my full opinion, but so far so good.The new presentation elements are great. Nance and Simms in the booth are great. No more dumb rap songs and unrealistic pregame scenarios. Yes its not perfect, but it at least makes you feel like you're playing an NFL game, and not something else with Gus Johnson's canned commentary over every game. The new menus are slick and responsive, and navigating the game has never been easier. Big points here.Overall I recomment the new Madden. It is not a perfect game, but the improvements brought in this year are leaps and bounds over prior years. I don't feel like I'm playing this canned football game, where the outcome of every play was determined before I snapped the ball. Its challenging, balanced and different.Pros:Infinity Engine adds a lot to gameplay, gone are the days of canned animationsConnected careers is a fresh take on the franchise modePresentation elements are a very welcome changeIts challenging and balanced feeling. You can't just lob over the top anymore. It takes the right play and the right execution to get the big play.Cons:Graphics are good in some places, and kind of smoothed over and blurry in others. It doesn't detract much from the experience thoughThe ragdoll effect is noticeable, but the Infinity Engine works where it counts, in gameplayI really loved doing fantasy drafts for franchise in the past. I think they took it out, which is disappointing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000056KDW","description":"After making a name for himself with horror classics such asThe  Damnation Gamenovel,The Books of Bloodshort-story collection, and  the feature filmsHellraiserandCandyman, Clive Barker has slowly  moved away from the horror genre toward more fantasy-centric work. Barker hasn't  completely forgotten about his first love, however, andClive Barker's  Undying, a first-person action game from Electronic Arts and DreamWorks  Interactive, beautifully captures the type of horrors that populated Barker's  earliest works. And not only is this game genuinely frightening, it's also a lot  of fun to play.Cast against the backdrop of Ireland in the year 1923,Undyingfollows  Patrick Galloway, an investigator of the paranormal. Galloway has been summoned  to Ireland by his old war buddy Jeremiah Covenant to put an end to the strange  occurrences at the Covenant family estate. What Galloway finds is a house of  horrors that is populated with Jeremiah's dead siblings (and other ghastly  creatures), all of whom want to snuff out Jeremiah so they can complete a spell  cast when they were children.Graphically,Undyingis first rate. TheUnreal Tournamentgraphics  engine has been used to great effect and the result is amazing character models  and environments. The haunted mansion is suitably dark, with wispy draperies and  macabre paintings. The estate's grounds are a mix of lush Irish countryside and  crumbling ruins, all set against vivid skies.Pretty pictures aside, the most impressive thing aboutUndyingis its  atmosphere--this game is flat-out scary. Every element of the game, be it the  gothic architecture, eerie story, great weather effects including rain and  lightning, or amazing sound effects, perfectly complement each other. The result  is a gameplay experience that rivals theResident Evilseries in terms of  generating sheer terror in the player.The great atmosphere isn'tUndying's only innovation--it also features a  very cool two-handed attack system. Most action games saddle the player with an  attack system where one hand controls all the weapons and the other hand does  nothing. InUndying, the left hand (and left mouse button) controls the  standard weapons, such as the pistol and shotgun, while the right hand (and  right mouse button) casts spells. This is a great gameplay device and ensures  the action stays at a frantic pace.Of all the spells in the game, the coolest is the Scrye spell. When cast, it  lets the player see and hear past events--some of which are quite  horrific--and  occasionally it shows you how to progress beyond a certain level. This help can  come in the form of highlighting certain objects or unveiling a portal, but  whatever the method it is a very well-designed gameplay element.The only real complaints withUndyinginvolve the long loading times  between levels and the system requirements, but even those aren't enough to  derail this excellent--and terrifying--action game.--Kilmic RobbinsPros:Very, very creepyAmazing sound effectsExcellent graphicsSlick controlsCons:Long loading timesStory is a little convoluted","reviewerName":"bunnyrabbit4","summary":"Great Atmosphere and fun if you like to jump..and Jump...and","reviewText":"Pros: 1.

{"product_name":"B003O6E620","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Gordon","summary":"Surprisingly good, if shallow, Ratchet and Clank Entry","reviewText":"While this particular entry in Sony's Ratchet and Clank series has gotten some negative press from both long-time fans, as well as those who only played and enjoyed the prior 2 PS3 entries, it turns out it's not a bad game at all.  In fact, its old-school feel is rather endearing.  That being said, it helps to adjust your expectations before going in.Unlike the first 3 Ratchet and Clank PS2 games, or the \"Tools of Destruction\" and \"Crack in Time\" entries for the PS3, this game is much more linear in design, and is broken into discrete levels with a set path.  In addition, the vast majority of this game takes place on the same planet, with 2 additional locations at the beginning and somewhere after the middle of the game, as opposed to multiple planets across a galaxy.  The camera is fixed, and set fairly far away from the characters, although this is for a reason: the game is a cooperative game.  Even if you are playing this alone, there will be a computer-guided second player character.  And while there are multiple weapons, they are fewer in number than prior installments.  The game also sees a return to strictly autoaiming, as opposed to the Gears of War-inspired \"over the shoulder\" aiming option in the prior PS3 games.The good news is that, despite all these changes, the game is actually pretty fun, in an old-fashioned, almost 16-bit era way.  Despite there being only 3 planets in the game, there's a pretty good variety of environments across the game, and the emphasis on vivid color that the series is known for overall is on display here.  Most importantly, the game is well paced in terms of action.  While not a particularly long game, it seems like the time spent counts.  To be honest, I felt \"A Crack in Time\" was a bit of a letdown, as it felt like the content was stretched too thin in favor of trying to provide \"oh, wow, look at that!\" moments, a la Call of Duty.  Here, there are still some of those moments (at the risk of spoiling things, you get to take control of a titanic robot at one point), but the time in-between them is good, meat and potatoes gameplay, as opposed to feeling like an obligatory after-thought.  You might be zipping along on a jetpack in a 2D section in huge caverns, navigating among asteroids to get to a moon, sliding down a frozen arctic slope, guiding a raft, or jumping among crumbling platforms on floating islands.  The gunplay may feel simplified, but there's plenty of it.  In some ways, it's a bit reminiscent of the first Ratchet and Clank game, with its to-the-point charm.That's not to say this game doesn't have flaws.  The ammo system in this game isn't quite up to snuff, and the auto-aiming can sometime give the player a lot of grief.  Plus, the focus on co-op sort of forces the game to behave a certain way, and accomodate the need to keep all characters (there can be up to 4 players at one time) on screen.  And of course, the simplified focus means that this game, while definitely replayable, is simply not as deep as many of us would have wanted it to be.  That being said, this is a much better \"side-story\" entry than the PS2's \"Ratchet: Deadlocked\", which veered way too far afield from the franchise's core appeal.  If you can accept it for what it does, as opposed to what it doesn't do, All-4-One is actually a pretty good, if not particularly deep, action game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00005ME7X","description":"Originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System,Dragon  Warrior IIIis a Game Boy Color port of one of the all-time classic  role-playing games. The game reunites two of Japan's greatest RPG talents in Yuji  Horii (story and game) and Akira Toriyama (character design). Toriyama is also  known as the creator of the immensely popular Dragon Ball cartoons and comics. A  prequel to the first two games in the series,DWIIIcasts you as the  child of a great hero who must defeat an evil demon. New additions to the port  include improved graphics, new minigames, new items, and a better translation of  the original Japanese dialogue.The game starts off with a personality test that loosely determines how other  characters will react to you. Gameplay is standard RPG fare: exploring, building  experience levels, acquiring allies, gaining weapons, and ultimately going after  a large monster. There are some interesting minigames to mix things up. The  Monster Medals feature adds a collectible aspect to the game. Monsters may leave  medals behind after you defeat them. Some monsters only appear during certain  times of the day. Getting all the medals unlocks a secret dungeon. You can trade  medals via link cable to make things easier. Most RPG fans will love this game,  but those raised on modern RPGs might find its combat a bit tedious. This game  is compatible with Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance only.--Raymond M.  PadillaPros:Classic gameplayExcellent monster and character designBetween 40 to 60 hours of playCons:Battles can get repetitiveA few character classes borderline on uselessGraphics appear dark on Game Boy Advance","reviewerName":"Talduras","summary":"A Classic Game in an Under-Appreciated Series.","reviewText":"First off, let it be known that I have played the initial release of this game when it was on the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System).  It was the first truely great RPG I have ever had the fortune to play, keeping in mind that I'd played Dragon Warrior 1 before that (not a fan of 1 vs 1 combat) and that I don't really consider Legend of Zelda an RPG (Action/Adventure in my book).  The game was long, fun, and an amazingly deep in story for a game that old.  Only problem is it was a rental and I didn't get to finish it (I was on the last battle too).Fast forward 11 years...I bought a copy of this game on Amazon.com Marketplace for the GBC, since I knew I'd enjoy it again.  That was truer than I expected.The core gameplay is all here, so any fans of the NES version will love this one as much, if not more.  Like most Japanese RPGs, the combat is turn-based and consists of standard fantasy elements.  Swords, magic, and several monsters to fight (including the well known slimes, who always feel the need to grin despite the fact that you'll run them through).  What amazes me is the amount of tactics involved in battles compared to other recent RPGs, such as the Final Fantasy games.  The FF games rarely give you a run for your money in standard fight (perhaps with the exception of FF4), but with DW3 almost any battle has the potential to go horribly wrong, making you struggle to win.  Most notable is when status effects are involved.  Sometimes you'll find that your entire party has been put to sleep by a spell, or someone can be paralyzed, or a monster will boost their defense.  Each of these has a counter, but sometimes you'll run into the bad luck of having it happen to the wrong person or that you didn't plan ahead of time with the right items to remove the effect.  Running is always an option, but you take your chances with this, as a failed run will leave you open to more damage.The graphics are much improved.  This is the first game in the series I've seen with animated sprites for the enemies, and those are amazingly fluid.  The rest of the graphics are improved as well, and make it seem almost SNES quality at times.  The amount of items is greatly expanded, and item management is a lot easier thanks to a bag shared by the party that you can put everything in (you won't have access to those items during combat, though).  Plus, there are several bonus touches, like a mini-game called Pachisi where you can earn bonus items (and most of them are pretty good items at that, like weapons), as well as two bonus dungeons, though unlocking the second one is a rather painful process requiring you to collect 144 unique monster medals... and those rarely appear after finishing of a monster.If you've never heard of the series, and you're a fan of turn-based battles, this game is certainly a worthy introduction to the series.  You'll wonder why this game series hasn't gotten huge sales numbers anywhere except Japan.  Even more so if you've had the chance to play DWIV","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2004"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E6NE","description":"","reviewerName":"Sloopydrew","summary":"In the end, it's Just Another Shooter","reviewText":"Only a couple of hours into BioShock Infinite, I made a post saying the art design was second to none, the story was compelling, etc. After finishing the game I'd still stand by all of that (only not as enthusiastically). I'd also stand by my statement that caused so much controversy -- the gameplay in BioShock Infinite is mediocre.Here's why(if you haven't completed the game yet, you may want to scroll down to the \"END SPOILERS\" section to read the rest of the spoiler-free review):SPOILERS(including end battle spoilers)The gameplay is limited like an FPS from the early 90s or a generic military shooter (Call of Duty) from this century. There's nothing to do, gameplay-wise, but shoot. And shoot. And shoot some more. Yes, you get to combine vigor/plasmids/whatever-the-kids-are-calling-it-these-days, and that's fun for a couple of hours but you find the most powerful combo and basically upgrade it to full and stick with it. Same with the weapons.Then, after an incredibly awesome Shantytown section and revolution section the game stops even trying to be something more and becomes Just Another Shooter. Wave after wave of bad guys. Pretty much non-stop from the section where you have to find the 3 tears to the end. And then there's that end.Oh, that end ...Until the end section the game is INSANELY easy (on Medium settings, which is how I always play through a game the first time, as story is at least as important to me as the challenge -- which is why I save the hardest difficulties for last). Then the end puts you in that airship which is at first simply monotonous and then devolves into something awful. You finally get to the top deck (I laughed when -- after an hour of non-stop shooting, Elizabeth says, \"Only 3 more decks\") and everyone and their mother is shooting at the power core thing to take it down. It's total overkill.There's nearly as many bad guys to fight in the airship and around the airship than there was the rest of the game. Again, total overkill and all art goes out the window and a generic FPS takes its place. Sure, you can call in Big Bird, but Big Deal? No wonder Infinite didn't have multiplayer -- it didn't need it -- the last third of the game is nothing but multiplayer you play offline. Waves of enemies and shooting and swearing -- just without the fifteen-year-old boys swearing at their mommies over a headset.ENDSPOILERSAnyway, I'd still this game a 5 out of 10 for the art design. But gameplay wise? It's no better than a 3 out of 10 (and that's being generous). The much hyped skylines were a useless gimmick to stop people from noticing this was Just Another Shooter(TM).I have literally never been this disappointed with a game. I loved the first BioShock. I thought the second was decent (with FAR better gameplay mechanics and variety than Infinite). The third was pretty and had some compelling ideas that reminded me of debates I was involved in back in college. Nothing that thought-provoking, but despite what Ken Levine and eager-to-please critics claimed, this is just a game, after-all (too bad that I, like so many, wanted it to be something more).BioShock Infinite isn't revolutionary. The first half makes you think it MAY be, but in the end, it ends up being no more than a mediocre shooter that drags on at least two hours too long and runs out of ideas 2/3rds of the way through (if that). A game with the potential of being a game-changer (pun intended) ends up being nothing more than a bore. A shame.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0044SA734","description":"","reviewerName":"Maek","summary":"I'm sold!","reviewText":"In a world where we have Elder Scrolls or the equally fabulous Dragon Age from Bioware, is there room for another high fantasy RPG?The answer is a resounding YES.  With a game studio founded by former major league baseball pitcher Curt Schilling, Kindoms of Amalur:  Reckoning (KAR) is an immensely detailed world.  The game guide is about as thick as Skyrim's and the wide variety of class choices and skills are there as well.Your character awakens in a pile of corpses only to realize that his/her existence is owed to the Gnomes' creation of the Well of Souls...and you are their first success.  Although everyone else in this world has Fate interweaved with their being in an almost Calvinsitic pre-determined sense, your character's first Fate-reading reveals that your Destiny is open.  With your origin and blank slate of Fate a mystery, you journey forth and examine your own mystery as well as go out and find your own purpose in this world.  You can cast spells, become a rogue, a fighter, etc., or become a hybrid of all these.  Personally, I'm following a fighter/mage path and selecting my \"Destiny\" according to my mood (since you are \"fateless.\").How does the gameplay fare?  Well, conversations are similar to Bioware's conversation wheel scheme.  Skills and perks follow Elder Scroll's scheme, albeit a somewhat watered down version of it.  Where I find a siginifcant difference, however, is combat.  Imagine a combat scheme that is a hybrid of Elder Scrolls and God of War.  Yes, I said God of War.  You start out with a basic move of swinging your sword about with a variant of holding down the attack button after your first attack to perform a vicious upper-handed blade strike.  As you develop your character, you'll be able to unlock additional combat moves for devastating effect.  Other weapons, like daggers, move a lot faster and the combat style requires you to rethink your attack strategies.  You also can wield shields, bow and arrow, etc. as well as staves and other magical items to wield fire, ice, lightning, etc.  It's one thing about this game that I like above Elder Scrolls; combat FEELS like I'm delivering blows rather than the \"floaty sword swing\" that I find in Elder Scrolls.  I'm not knocking Elder Scrolls, mind you; I love Elder Scrolls immensely, but I find the combat scheme in KAR a great deal more satisfying, eliciting an \"ooooo\" when I manage to great a devastating blow in.Artistically, KAR is stunning.  Todd McFarlane's name is shown on the label and his artistic influence shows quite strongly.  It's extremely colorful and creatures are vastly different from one another.  Lighting and particle effects are beautiful and the framerate doesn't appear to be impacted by the visual feast on the PS3.  Entering an inn, I'm greeted with warm colors and a fireplace.  I can only imagine that the PC version is even more impressive.  However, for a PS3 title, kudos to the developers for creating a smooth-running gorgeous game.  This is in stark contrast to Skyrim which seems washed out, cold, and barren.  That said, Skyrim fits its setting; the Nords are SUPPOSED to be living in such a place.  However, KAR has me running back to it sooner simply because this is a world teeming with life...life that I would love to preserve through adventuring.This is a pretty watered down review, but I welcome any questions via comments.  I'm having a great time with this game and I think that you would be proud to have this beside Dragon Age and Elder Scrolls on your shelf.-- Edit 4/23/2012 --Twenty hours into the game and I've barely scratched the surface.  I find myself enjoying the side quests and faction quests immensely and I'm taking full advantage of both to build my character up.  It's amazingly fun and addictive; I just completed the House of Ballads faction quest and the Fae race is truly created around a concept that we find alien.  They are not simply a race that looks different; they embody a culture and history that is based on repetitive pre-destined stories...but something has gone awry.  I won't spoil it; however, you can bet that your character impacts a lot of what happens in this world...you're more special than you know.  Great high fantasy!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000087L4E","description":"Infiltrate deep into the Third Reich to battle the horrific super-soldiers, zombies and mutants forged in an unearthly experiment.","reviewerName":"Micheal Hunt","summary":"Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Operation Failure","reviewText":"I admit, I'm not really all that interested in first person shooter, so I don't play Medal of Honor or any of those games, but I was a huge fan of the original Wolfenstein games that came out centuries ago, and I am also a big fan of Duke Nukem games, even Golden Eye on 64 etc... so don't let my lack of interest in many first person shooters make you think I am just being nostalgic.This game didn't make me feel like I was returning to Wolfenstein at all. Sure, the original was a bunch of pixels and mazes with nazi's to kill and dogs coming at you, but the feel of this game doesn't feel the same at all. I felt more like I was in some movie starring Jason Stathman as he is sent in to kill nazi's and protect India Jones as he looks for ancient treasure. The first thing I noticed the moment I started playing was the computer AI is horribly programmed. The first nazi I come by ran right up to me, past me, then ran behind me somewhere, like he was looking for a good place to sit down to take aim, and before he could, he was shot dead. Then I noticed things around the place that is there for no reason. I come across some motorbikes, they make noises... do they do anything? No, can you ride them? No. Can you blow them up? No. Why are they there? At least in Duke Nukem games if a useless object is there, say when I found the Delorean from Back To The Future, in Time To Kill (or Land of the babes? one of the two) Duke quote's Biff Tannen and says, \"Hello, McFly, Anyone home?\", it's pointless, but none the less humorous. Where Activision trying to copy that by just adding random things trying to be funny? Or did someone just say, \"euhh, there's too much wall, put a bike in-front of it.\"The second thing I really don't like about this game is the controls. They work OK for what they are, but what they lack is any control over aiming where you want to shoot. A lock onto enemy button would have been nice, or at least auto aim or something, because I don't know how tired I got of coming down stairs and someone is shooting me, and I have to look down in order to shoot them... it sounds like something you could get used to, but it feels like you are armed with a sling shot, while a mouse is running frantically between your legs in circles as you try to look down and maneuver around in circles yourself trying to get a lock on them. That's another thing... you only need to hit an enemy close enough to kill them, don't worry about aiming for bodies or head shots, just fart in their general direction and they will eventually smell it.In the original Wolfenstien there was a tonne of great array you could choose from. In this one, there is barely a decent weapon to be found. Most of them are hand guns, sniper rifles and single shot pistols. There is only a couple of machine guns, most of which are semi-automatics, and from what I can tell, only one decent rapid firing machine gun. However, there is no big cool gun... the original version of this game you had a cool mini-gun, why wouldn't that be included in the sequel? Maybe they wanted to go a bit more realistic, as it is supposed to be set in the 1940's or so, but hey, they had bazookas, hand grenades, molotov cocktails and what not back then too... couldn't those have been integrated with the artillery of this game? God, anything to just blow up a bunch of people at once would have been nice. Maybe that's just Duke's thing, I dunno, but this game needed more, MUCH more.The levels all seem too alike. Do you really need 10 levels per episode or the same damn thing over and over and over again? Your mission, find something, get out. Don't get killed. Next mission, find something, get out, don't get killed. And so on, and so on, and so on, and so on... YAWNNNNNNNNNNNN.What else surprises me about this game is there is no cheats. None without a action replay device or something. Now, before you say something about real gamers don't need cheats, let me remind you, Wolfenstein was pretty much the inventor of God Mode. Remember that name? Whether you would use it or not, why would you make a sequel like this and not include what made the original so damn popular in the first place? Come on, how many of you played the original and never once used God Mode??? Or the All Weapons cheat, or even the All Keys cheat??? Come on, raise your hand. How could they forgot to include these things in this version?I only got through about 20 levels of this game before I packed it in out of boredom or having to do the same thing over and over and over again. I really don't care how the game ends. Obviously Statham and Indy beat the bad guys, the proof lies in history, because the Nazi's where all taken out when Luke Skywalker blew up the Death Star II.The last thing is the sound, or should I say sounds. The sound of weapons and everything is fine, but the sounds of the Nazi's is what puts me off. They all speak perfect English! One of the coolest things of the original game was the sounds of the Nazi's saying things you had no idea what, unless you spoke German, but come on, why do they all speak English and say, \"There he is, get him\"... not even in a German accent???One last thing, it's not a biggie... but remember the cute pitbulls in the original? I would have liked to see them return and come running after me for a bullet to the forehead... unless they are somewhere later in the game, they don't make a return. Damn FCC and PETA. Cruelty to animals in the real world is wrong, but in video games it should be OK. It's not like anyone who played Mario Bros went out and stomped on a turtle and kicked his shell into a sewer pipe.____Overall____Gameplay  : 3/5Story  : 2/5Grahpics  : 2/5Controls  : 3/5Sound  : 2/5Replay V  : 0/5Extras  : 0/5________________Total  | 1.7","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2013"}

Also it is part of a disappointing trend where the sequel was worse than the original.  If you haven't played the original go buy that one instead, it is cheaper and better in EVERY way.The CGI cutscenes are worse this go round, the character costumes you unlock are fewer and far uglier.  You can no longer micromanage items for each character but have to choose 3 items for your team as overall boosters, to the point where it doesn't even matter what you equip and you just don't care.The only better thing in this game is spiderman's fighting animation, everything else took 5 or more steps back.

Fox \"billfy\"","summary":"PS2 vs. GameCube the ultimate test.","reviewText":"Other reviews have gone into what a great game THPS3 is, I think it is too, so I'll let them tell you how great it is, I'm going to compare the two major versions available (PC &amp; PSX versions excluded)I bought THPS3 for GameCube as a test: The next time a game comes out for both PS2 and GameCube, which one do I buy?  The answer: It depends.The most noticable difference between the PS2 and the GameCue version of this game is that there is no online play for the GameCube version, but it isn't like that matters since neither system has released their online adaptors yet.  So until Sony and Nintendo have their network adaptors (who cares about dial-up) on store shelves (or in my case, in Amazon warehouses) it is a moot point.GameCube advantages: Faster Framerate (for smoother motions) slightly better graphics (nothing to really scream about though), and it also wins out in the same battle N64 won over PSX... better 3-D environment.  In other words you don't end up seeing through sections of walls, or having it appear that the camera is now located inside of your character revealing the empty reverse of his hollow body.  Sure, this does not occur nearly as much as it did in PSX games, but it still happens.PS2 advantages: well, there is only one that I have found.  Lip balances!  On occasion with the GameCube version, when you try to grind on a surface you may instead end up doing some anti-gravitational lip balance.  Now this wouldn't bother me so much if it weren't for the fact that when it happens, the camera angle tends to shake (jitter) uncontrolably.  This may just be a bug in the game, hopefully it is not a GameCube thing that is going to occur in other games.Me, I'm keeping my GameCube version and selling the PS2 version to a friend, but that does not mean that I am going to buy a GameCube version over a PS2 version.  If a PS2 version comes out with better options, I'm getting the PS2 version.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2001"}

What I can tell you however (in the humble opinion of a dedicated PC gamer for 15 years), is that Half Life 2 is the the most mind blowing game I've ever played.I was at E3 with my pyscho gaming buddy cleaning the Pizza flavored drool off his chin when we got a preview of HL2.  Like most, I counted the days, cursed Valve and Sierra for delay after delay, put all my faith and hope into Doom 3, was underwhelmed, went back to playing Desert Combat...basically went insane with anticipation.In the brief moments before firing up HL2 for the first time, I was hopeful, but expecting to be dissapointed.And I was.Really, no multi-player!  I'm one of those that have an absolute allergy to single-player games.  Small beads of angry sweat began to form on my back...But I soldiered on, and in:10 minutes I was impressed,at 30 minutes I was completely immersed,at 1 hour chills were running up and down my spine, and occasional girlish yelps of horror began emanating from my pitch dark office......by the third hour I came to the conclusion that HL2 was/is the most impressive game software I've ever had the privilege of living in.  Some highlights:1.  The engine is truly revolutionary.  Doom 3 has a darn good engine, HL2 in my opinion is vastly better.  Indoor AND outdoor environments are near photo-realistic (I have a 3.2GHZ w/ 1GB RAM), the physics are jaw-dropping AND deeply integrated into the play of the game, texture and lighting, faces, water, you name it, this engine is now The Standard.2.  Vehicles.  Well, not only do they have them, they're really fun to operate (or be chased by as the case may be).3.  The Gravity Gun.  This weapon comes later in the game, and in my humble opinion, is easily the most fun weapon I've ever used.  Picking up and throwing items, using it to activate latent elements of the environment (often as weapons) is unbelievably fun.  Which brings me to:4.  Humor.  This game has some really funny moments.  I almost busted a gut when I ran out of heavy/sharp things to fire at zombified creatures that were teaming up on me in close quarters.  I desperately pulled over a large can of paint, fired, and splattered huge gobs of white paint all over their (now more upset) faces.  I died, but I died laughing.  And finally:5.  Immersion.  The screams were obvious signs of immersion, but beyond that, I noticed myself making facial expressions of anger, empathy, anticipation...all throughout the game I found myself genuinely caring.  That's a first for me.I really could go on and on, but I can't, literally, I fear that dawn isn't far from my window and I'd like to pretend that I myself won't be a zombie tomorrow.Enjoy,Christian HunterSanta Barbara, California","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2004"}

I fell in love with the first part right away. The second part was even better, in certain respects. Like the first game, part 2 has a great(at times confusing)story,WAY better graphics, smarter enemies, greater challenges, and even better music.This game is nearly perfect except for a few minor \"glitches\", but overall the game rules.I love games with stories, especially if they're a bit lengthy. The bad thing is that some of the stories/cut-scenes in the game are TOO long and pointless: like Rose's annoying constant Codec conversations with Raiden about dates and [stuff] like that; and that extremely long and pointless talk that Raiden has with Arsenal Gear's AI system near the end of the game.One more thing that kind of bugs me about the game is this: Why in the world did the dudes who created this game replace Solid Snake with a woosy and girly little tenderfoot like Raiden?! Solid Snake is definitely my all time favorite character of the game.Because of that this game really deserves a 4 and a half,but it's closer to a 5 than a 3. At least you can be Snake for a little bit in the beginning; and at least Raiden's skills are just as good as Snake's. Although the story gets VERY confusing at times, it was even better than the first game's story. That whole thing with Liquid Snake's return from the grave and the organization called the Patriots who have more power than the president was really great. Overall, this game is fantastic. I just hope the next one is just as good as the previous ones. I also hope that Solid Snake is more playable in the next game. (and the guys in charge of making the game really shouldn't have let Vamp kill Emma; I really kind of liked her).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2002"}

I'll talk about 5 aspects of the game, graphics, gameplay, story, controls, and voicing.Graphics, you'll first notice, are unbelievable. They are stunning. They are crisp and crystal clear. Metal Gear Solid is really pushing the Ps2 to its limits. There's not much to say, they are near perfect. Graphics 5/5.Gameplay, is good. It offers a great game if you like watching cutseen after cutseen. Come on, is MGS a movie or a game? Yeah, cutseens roll the story along fine, but there are to many and they are to long. You'll finish watching a cutseen just to walk ten feet and find yourself in another cutseen. Some conversations, like ones between Rose and Raiden, are absolutly meaningless. Gameplay gets a 4/5.Story, well its Metal Gear, what do you expect. It starts out interesting and understandable. But, as you progress it gets weird. There are alot of twists, in it, that really will keep you stunned. Story 5/5Controls is probably where the game could have used some work. You eventually get used to them but they do take practice. Maybe its because of the camera that gets in your way, that messes up the controls. I wish Konami could have done a camera like the one in Resident Evil Dead Aim. Controls 3.5/5Voice acting is almost perfect. It matches up with the motion of the mouth and looks good too. Its just that sometimes during the Codec the voices get ahead of the motions of the mouth. But thats it. Voicing 4/5Over all Metal Gear Solid SoL is a very worthwhile game. It has an engaging story, lots of shoot em' up action, and eye popping graphics. This is a must buy for any Ps2 owner.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2003"}
{"product_name":"B001989B4S","reviewerName":"Dredded Deuce \"Dredded Panthyr\"","summary":"The Game Mechanics Improved but the entertainment factors has not.","reviewText":"Fight Night Round 4What can I say?  It's another rendition of one of the best boxing games hands down. If you played the previous incarnation that came out 4 years ago, it's relatively easy to pick this up and jump right in.So, why did I give this game 2 stars? Because I know a lot of you are going to think I have lost my mind when you see this but when you think about how much time EA has had to improve this title over the last one and when you really see the failed opportunities that EA had to improve this over UFC OUTSIDE of the ring mechanics you will really understand my low score.I would dare say if you have forgotten, grab part 3 and play it again.Now, while I think EA took a step in the right direction with some of the fight mechanics (glancing blows count stamina meter counts for more). I think in a lot of the technical aspects the game has languished or took a step back.EA has the licence to ESPN and really has yet to take advantage of it (and just in boxing but in most of their sports games... They still haevnt learn the lessons from NFL2K5 of how to immerse people into a sports game!!). Please turn off the rerun of the 2 minutes of ESPN Sports Radio!! If I want to know what's going on, I can stream it from my PC!  I really would like to see an in game pre fight show or something to hype the bout you are about to fight.Another thing I really would love to have seen added would be some kind of rivalry or rematch mode during the Legacy Mode where you and another boxer have a series of matches to prove the best boxer like how mny times did Frazier and Ali fight or classic matches like Sugar ray and Roberto Duran? I mean yes, other fighters will challenege you from time to time but without the added hype behind it, it doesn't feel like much. You do get extra gear from the wins you rack up during the game but it really doesn't feel like you are doing much in Legacy mode except fighting to unlock stuff. Again, there feels like so much more could have been done for legacy mode but it falls short.Also another gripe I have is that the create a boxer mode is not(and has never really been) as robust as most fighting games (UFC and WWE anyone?).  I could get more into it if I could create a fighter that I like as opposed to feeling limited to the templates given.Even still if you feel a bit lazy, you can check out EAs online gallery and download a few or even try uploading a pic of yourself and try out creating a pugilist using your mug.Now in the ring, again, if you have played the last fight night, you can jump right into it and punch away.  This time around glancing blows count and thankfully EA didn't go out of thier way to make them apparent but you can tell even better the nuances of when you hit somebody full on vs a punch that lacks power. You can also still swtich your stance, throw haymakers and so forth as long as you remember how to control your character.  This is probably the only part of the game that has improved.The announcing team is pretty good altho after 5 or 6 fights some of the comments get repetitive.Last gripe is not really a big one considering real life considerations but the roster seems more to be inclusive of real life current boxers and not a lot past greats unless you have the time to create them with the blase palate. And even some of the ones included don't translate very well considering how hard the hardware pushes this game to look as graphically superb as the last one. Even so...some of the boxers lack personality...it's almost as if you feel like they just stuck a bag with human skin in front of you to beat around a bit.To a point I can almost understand why some people who have been behind boxing for years are gravitating to UFC...gaming and in real life.Outside of all of this, if you have enjoyed the Fight Night series, this is a no brainer to pick up but with the 4 years that it had to really take a huge leap...it only took a hop.It's not the in ring issues that is the problem with this series, it's the out of the ring stuff (and EA not fully using the ESPN licence) that is lacking that keeps this title back.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2009"}

Episodes I to III come to life -- and you can become a part of the story!","reviewerName":"GameraRocks \"captpicardfan\"","summary":"Really Fun That's A Must Have For Fans","reviewText":"The game is great. You play through Episode I, II and III, so if you don't want any of Episode III spoiled, don't play this until you see the movie first because this game gives away some important things.This game appeals to all. It appeals to the young and old. It's basically the characters, ships, and some of the background are made of LEGO, but while you play, you forget all of that and it feels like an action-packed Star Wars game.In each Episode, you play the most famous scenes from each movie, like the first level of the game is when Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are on the ship as the room fills with gas. And it does so, all the way to the last level on Episode III with Obi-Wan's fight with Anakin (like I said, don't play if you don't want anything spoiled). There is action galore in this game, if you're not fighting with lightsabers or guns, you are on a ship shooting down enemy troops in space.There are 30 characters in this game that can be unlocked, some are unlocked in the game and some you have to buy with this little LEGO pieces that you pick up during the game. The characters that are unlocked can be used in the real game. In the menu before you start to play the game, you get the choice of either playing in Story Mode, which is the movie version and everything is move correct. Or you can play Free Mode, and that lets you play any of the levels you have already beaten with any of the characters you have unlocked. For example, you can play Jango Fett in Episode I.The graphics of the game are incredible, with humor added in between. The background is at times beautiful and very well done with LEGO fighting on it. There are FMVs after and before each level that are like what you see on the movies, except they are LEGO which is fun to watch, they add jokes as well that doesn't hurt the game but added to. For example, when the battle droids come to attack Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan on the first level, Qui-Gon's saber comes on easy, but Obi-Wan has trouble and has to hit it before his blue blade appears. It has small things like that are just kinda cute to see and doesn't hurt anything at all.When you first start the game, you are in a caf&eacute;. It's the caf&eacute; that Obi-Wan met his alien friend at on Episode II. Here you can buy new characters, small extras and enter passwords if you have them. To start to play Episode I, II or III, you have to walk through the door with that number above it. There is a door with \"?\" above it as well that is a very special extra that you have to do everthing to unlock. If you don't want to play any of the Episodes, you can explore the caf&eacute;, and go outside the caf&eacute; to see what ship pieces you have picked up on each level. The caf&eacute; has all the characters you have bought or unlocked walking around.You can play a character by walking up to them and pressing triangle, this is how it works in the caf&eacute; and on the Episode levels. You have to have a certain character sometimes to do certain things on the Episode levels. For example, R2-D2 and C-3PO can open certain doors, Padme can use her grappling hook to get to a higher ground and use her gun to shoot targets to open doors, Jedi use the force to make bridges, etc.Multi-player is fun as well. A friend or relative can play in the game with you just by pressing the start button, I had my brother play with me and it really did add to the fun. If you want to leave the game and let your friend go solo, just press the start button and select drop out. You can do this if your friend is playing the character you want to and vice verse. Your friend can drop out and press triangle on his character and you become the character, and he/she can press the start button and will automatically be the other character.Multi-player can also get annoying at times, for example, when you play Anakin and have to do the Pod Race, which in itself is really fun, but when your partner hits a rock and wrecks, it makes you start over as well. This is a level that should usually be done solo, or expect to do this over and over again.After you beat the first level of Episode I, Episode II and III are unlocked so you can go ahead and play those if you get stuck on a level you can't beat on Episode I, which is highly unlikely since you have infinite lives on this game and you start off right where you die at, this mainly for younger kids and older adults that don't know how to play video games that well.There are six chapters to each Episode. Each Episode is about an hour each, in other words, this game only lasts about 3 or 4 hours at the most, but don't despair. This game is fun enough that you'll be playing this game over and over again, if nothing else than to get all of the ship pieces you have missed or to collect the same LEGO pieces that have to be picked up to unlock other things. At least to unlock all 30 characters. Another downside to the game is that it may be way too easy for some of you. Like I said, you have infinite lives and when you die, you start exactly where you died.So, to sum things up, if you like challenging games, this is definitely not for you. But if you have any love for Star Wars, which you would or you be here in the first place lol  , you will have no problem with this only flaw and will enjoy it over and over again. This game is extremely fun! Nothin like using the Force to pick up LEGO pieces","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2005"}

Warioware: Twisted represents another example of Nintendo's innovative mind at its best. I just bought the game yesterday and I can honestly say it delivers on is game packaging promise \"It's easy to pick up but hard to put down\". Just like Twisted's predecessor WarioWare Microgames, Twisted presents the player with a rapid fire barrage of mini-games but this time with a new \"twist\" (pun intended). Instead of using the gameboy's directional pad to control motion you now turn the gameboy itself much as you would a steering wheel to play most of the games. As \"gimmicky\" as this may sound, Twisted (furnished with a gyro-motion sensor) executes this feature flawlessly and makes the game ridiculously fun!!

Gone is the tactical cover-based shooter that I love. Instead we get an arena based shooter where all the enemies ignore cover and run straight at you. It plays more like Serious Sam than Gears of War. My favorite mode in the previous Gears was Horde and that has been replaced by Survival: a class-based mode where you guard a generator. How is that survival? Is the generator is trying to survive? Horde 2.0 had an economy, meaningful upgrades, boss waves and you really got the feeling that YOU were trying to survive. Survival has none of this. As far as MP goes: they replaced KOTH with Domination which isn't as good. They removed execution (I know it's coming back in a DLC), Warzone, and the the locust. You can only play them in overrun. Overrun sounds good on paper but I found it to be a boring grind. All-in-all I am extremely disappointed with this game and I had low expectations to begin with. It's back to Gears 3 for me. Luckily Amazon has a pretty good trade in price so I'll get some of my money back.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2013"}

Let me just say, this is not a \"perfect\" game and it contains some bugs and inconsistencies, but those are overshadowed by the awesome graphics and gameplay.Pros:-great looking zombies. A lot of detail has been put in to the undead-very specific and unique damage you can do to enemies (break limbs to disable arms, cut parts of the body off, burn, drown, electrocute)-variety in enemies. Slow zombies, rushing zombies, huge hulk zombies, human enemies, different clothes and faces-very smooth graphics. The beautiful island paradise looks similar to far cry games. Trees and leaves move, directional wind,weather changes. The city looks just as good later-fun item searching (similar to Borderlands)-fun item customization. Not realistic but fun ways to modify items like making electric knives, super hammers, explosives-gazillion side quests which with main game will add up to 200 + hours.-over 75 levels advancement let you customize your character in the way you want.Cons:-initial quests at the start take too lo g to get the game really going-graphics bugs with collision of characters with environment-many out of world holes-poor facial animations and bad voice acting-no character development. Cutscenes are same for all characters-some areas look rushed and unpolished.Overall I'd say that this will be the best game for you if you really disliked Dead Rising 2 but enjoyed Borderlands. The focus of course is on the zombie killing and collecting money to get better weapons. Attacking and fighting with the zombies feels really close and personal. It feels like the zombies actually have mass to them unlike in so e other games. The game contains plenty of interesting moments when you'll be suddenly surrounded by 4 or more growling blood spewing flesh eaters which doesn't happen too much in other games because you cannot always rely on guns and ammo. Ammo can be in short supply so you have to make sure you collect the best melee weapons possible for your limited space.While some may say this game gets repetitive, I'd say it depends if you like this kind of the game. The weapons and locations are diverse, which makesup for it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2011"}

Both Spyro fans and those who didn't play the first game will revel in the  exploratory greatness that isSpyro: Ripto's Rage. Gone are the impossible tasks,  unbeatable enemies, and fragmented game flow. This game sports superior controls, more  colorful and faster graphics, a tighter story, achievable goals, and plenty of gameplay  variety.Don't be fooled by Spyro's cuteness--this isn't a kid's-only game. With multiple goals  and side quests, a fantastic soundtrack by ex-Police band member Stewart Copeland, and  a veneer of understated humor,Spyro: Ripto's Rageis highly addictive. The  playfulness of the main character comes through in the exploration of the otherworldly  levels using the new moves, including super high jumps, rapid underwater swimming,  and extended flight and hovering maneuvers.Determined explorers are always rewarded--sometimes with an ice hockey match or other  sub-game, sometimes with riches enough to learn a new move or uncover a new area.  Simply put,Spyro: Ripto's Rageis one of the best action/adventure games for the  system. Despite the fact that this game is a sequel, it manages to bring a fresh new look  and feel to PlayStation gaming.--Jeff YoungPros:Massive, fun levels are completely navigableCute and quirky sense of humor will appeal to all agesResponsive controls are an extension of Spyro's upbeat and exacting personalityCons:Camera angles can be problematic, but are completely adjustable","reviewerName":"JoeAZ92","summary":"Ripto's Rage improved on Spyro's original formula, as if it really needed to, and made for a really fun 3-D platformer","reviewText":"Positive:+ excellent gameplay+ smooth controls+ tons of bonus missions and stuff to collect+ fun boss battles+ great level designNegative:- a couple levels really aren't too great- looking around doesn't work as well as it should -Spyro the Dragon was a big success on Sony's PlayStation for many reasons: its excellent platforming gameplay, smooth controls, and tons of stuff to collect. Naturally, a sequel was released a year later: Ripto's Rage. This game further excelled areas that the first game already did well in and brought Spyro into a whole new world, both literally and figuratively. Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage is a really great game that's fun, has a lot to collect, and is just plain hard to not like.After saving the dragon world from certain doom in the first game, Spyro now has his mind set on taking a vacation in the sunny Dragon Shores. However, while he is in the portal on his way to his well-earned break, a professor in the world of Avalar intercepts him. He summoned a dragon to help because an evil guy named Ripto entered Avalar by chance a while back, and now he is bent on becoming the new emperor of the unfortunate realm. With the help of his big and stupid cronies, Crush and Gulp, he has been wreaking havoc in the land. It's now up to Spyro to stop him, as Ripto seemed to mention having a fear of dragons. And for good reason, because Spyro is now only more determined to get his vacation than before.The story progresses throughout three huge worlds, each having somewhere between five and ten levels each. The levels are pretty big, and although it won't take much time or effort to simply reach the end of each one, there is a ton of stuff to do in each and every stage. Beating a level earns you the talisman of the realm, but there are also between two and four orbs and also 400 gems to collect in each level. The levels are designed in such a way that directly leads you to the talisman, but there are so many side attractions within each and every one that they're hard to ignore.Gems are found everywhere: on the ground, on a ledge, inside stuff, you name it. Orbs, however, require accomplishing various tasks to obtain. You may be flying around a cave lighting lamps in one level or saving a prehistoric village from dinosaur hatchlings, but all these side quests earn you orbs.Since there is so much to do in each level, the game can last you quite a while if you go for completion, although if you put in the effort it won't be incredibly difficult to do. It strikes a perfect balance in this area, making for a game that you actually WANT to complete at some point and is not extremely irritating along the way. The grand total for the game is 14 talismans, about 65 orbs, and 10,000 gems.Visually, Spyro 2 isn't bad. The graphics are just a tad on the polygonal side, but they really look good for a game on the PlayStation. The sound is great too, the effects are quite nice and the music is pretty fitting. There is also, surprisingly, full voice acting for every piece of dialogue in the game, which is pretty cool but you'll probably end up skipping it to get on with the gameplay.Spyro 2's controls are very smooth and work almost perfectly. Moving Spyro around feels almost flawless and incredibly smooth, and the button layout is very nice. The only issue here is using the triangle button to look around, it doesn't really work exactly as well as it should but it's not hard to figure out.The game's three boss battles are surprisingly memorable. Hurling explosives at the massive Gulp and outsmarting the idiot Crush is always fun, but the best boss battle of the game is the epic, three-part brawl with Ripto at the end. The last part is especially fun, flying around with the super flame power up, blasting the crud out of Ripto's robot bird... good times, good times.Overall, Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage is one of the most worthwhile games of its generation. It has so much to it with great graphics and sound, loads of stuff to collect and tasks to accomplish, and it's just a game that's extremely hard to not like. If you want a game with lots to do and a great touch of personality, look no further than Spyro 2; even today it's a blast to play.Gameplay: 9.0Graphics: 8.0Sound: 9.0Value: 9.0FINAL SCORE: 8.8/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2008"}

{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","reviewerName":"G. Denick","summary":"Terrifying and emotionally exhausting, this is \"Survival Horror\" at its finest","reviewText":"This is one of the most immerersive game experiences I've ever had. I actually felt as if I had become Joel, trekking through this deadly, near hopeless world, struggling to survive for just one more day. On occasion, this level of immersion is broken (such as when I take out four armed soldiers, and can only salvage ONE rifle round from the lot of them), but for the most part, I truly felt like I had stepped into the shoes of the protagonist. His emotions became mine- the frustration, the elation, the horror, the desperation... and the slow, creeping pall of hopelessness in this dark, damaged earth.And let me tell you- if you are prone to night terrors or depression, do NOT play this game, because it will alternately terrify you and make you despair for the plight of this lost world. However, if you can handle the mature subjects of the tale, you are in for a real treat, and perhaps the greatest game to ever be produced in the genre of \"survival horror\". Yes, this game is scary. I generally felt powerless in this world and some of the enemies (primarily Clickers and Runners) make my stomach tighten with dread. If you're super hardcore, and you want a REALLY scary experience, I recommend you play on Hard difficulty for your first play-through, because the number of supplies (ammo, med kits, shivs, bombs, etc.) that are available on the Normal difficulty level are far too abundant for players who want a supreme challenge.On the subject of crafting, this is a component of the game that is easy to learn, and fun to engage in. It further puts you into the mindset of Joel, a man desperate for survival, who has learned to salvage at all available opportunities. Slowly tuning up my weapons was also a lot of fun, though Joel is but a pale imitator compared to his rival protagonists (Nathan Drake, Marcus Fenix, etc.) in other games (but this is a good thing, for it feels realistic, and fits with the tone of the piece). Joel's wobbly aim, perpetual shortage of ammo, and rather sluggish speed make him feel like a real, middle-aged guy who has learned to survive in a dangerous world, not some superhuman who handles everything with grace.The stealth aspect is also handled brilliantly, and engaging in it is extremely satisfying. To me, this stealth system is a perfect evolution of that which was established in the Metal Gear Solid series (particularly #2), utilizing a great visual cone and (and audio circumference) for your enemies, which must be studied for vulnerabilities and exploited at every possible opportunity. Determining how to approach each new challenge (lots of trial and error will be involved), and how to successfully clear an area of enemies (generally without being detected, as ammo and health are so limited) is really fun. These challenges become \"3D puzzles\" in a way, as you must use your noggin to break down enemy patterns and AI reactions, with the added tension of knowing that it only takes one slip-up to result in failure - and these enemies really do make you feel the fear.Visually speaking, this game can't keep up with the Uncharted series (surprising, since it's the only other game built on the same engine), but it's by no means a slouch. Just be prepared- this game is nothing at all like Uncharted. It's way harder, the game isn't split into short, easily managed levels, and the cheerfulness of Uncharted is completely absent. I play Uncharted all the time, but I'm not sure I can go back and play The Last of Us- it is, quite frankly, an exhausting experience. And that, my friends, is the sign of a superbly crafted game, one which has captured the emotions and tone that it was seeking to tell with its mature, finely told story. All fans of video games should at least sample The Last of Us. I couldn't stop playing it until the last steps of Joel's journey were complete, and I'm betting you won't be able to, either.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2013"}

There's also a Wygol village, holy water, knifes, and a Warg or two. Other than that however there's not much \"Castlevania\" going on in this here game.When you get down to brass tacks, what we're talking about here is a God of War style action game with some Shadow of the Colossus sprinkled in for good measure that's sort of \"Castlevania themed.\"So long story short.....if you're looking for a true dyed-in-the-wool Castlevania experience - you're going to be disappointed.On the other hand if you like a good solid action game that happens to be set in the Castlevania world... you might want to consider taking this here title for a spin. While sadly there's no real map to explore, no real RPG elements, and the \"secrets\" are less \"secrets\" and more of \"finding things that the fixed camera doesn't show you\" there is a solid action game here. The graphics are fantastic, the story works (and is narrated by ye olde Patrick Stewart), and both the controls and gameplay are pretty solid to boot.The puzzle elements are challenging enough without being too annoying and there's enough level/character design to make this worth your time. Sure I've got a couple of complaints about the way the camera gets buggy, the enemy AI (which is aggressive in a good way overall) is a little too well prepared to allow you to use half the moves your character ends up learning, and how you have to backtrack through stages you've already beaten (incl. the bosses) to get the things you couldn't get before - but there isn't anything that's major enough to detract from the overall experience.I am a long-standing fan of the series (from way back in the day) and while this is no Symphony of the Night, it's still worth a gander if you're a fan. It won't disappoint in the same way that some of the other Castlevania offshoots have. If you're not into God of War style games then you may want to give this a miss, but if you're like me and \"on the fence\" about a Castlevania game that's not true to the typical dungeon/platform experience, and are looking for something to play then this will do quite nicely.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2010"}

Ok...I guess that isn't much of a review.  So here are more details.If you have ever wanted to PLAY an action movie, this is your chance.  It is obvious that this game will draw comparisons to the Uncharted series.  It really is very similar.  There are many instances of death-defying escapes and chase scenes.  The world is lush and detailed with beautiful graphics.  The soundtrack is great.  The action is spot on and the game plays very well.This is where things differ from Uncharted, however.  The tone is much darker and the game overall is much more violent.  There are blood and guts on display here, folks.  I, for one, like the more mature tone.  Uncharted feels more like Indiana Jones while this feels like a more graphic version of a film in that vein.  It definitely earns its M rating due to language and a few very violent scenes.I like this game about as much as Uncharted.  It's similar but is different enough to make it a fresh experience.  For example, searching for treasures in semi-open environments kept me entertained.  The ability to fast-travel back to previous sections of the game was a Godsend.  This is actually the first game where I WANT to do fetch quests in a very long time.  Searching for hidden items is fun and doesn't feel like developers put items in hard to reach places just to make it irritating.  There are some items that require a search, but it's like they found the perfect balance between interesting and tedious.  Very impressive.  Uncharted is more linear but the production value is SLIGHTLY tighter.  There is still very little difference between the two games in terms of technical achievement.  The only thing that really stuck out to me was the fact that Laura's clothing did not become wet after getting out of water like Drake's does in Uncharted.  Minor stuff.The price has dropped so there is no reason not to give this game a try.  Especially if you are an XBox player who has not experienced an action game of this caliber.  When I think blockbuster action games this is what comes to mind now. (If it's not a beat-em-up action title in the style of God of War or the old Devil May Cry games that is.)  It's amazing what they pull off in these games.  Intense gameplay that will leave your pulse pounding; marveling at how you barely made that jump with all hell breaking loose around you.

That line began one of the greatest video game adventures of all time. I thought it would be hard to beat the original Uncharted, I was wrong. The sequel blew the original out of the water. The story was amazing twists and turns around every corner left you breathless. The game play elements are about the same as the original the only additions are the new stealth system, and a refined climbing system. No longer do you have to fight every enemy you can sneak around and kill them one by one. Of coarse you can still shoot everyone like I do. Also the climbing is more complex. There are a lot more things that Drake can climb in this one. You can climb walls easier than ever before. The puzzles in this game are massive; they are also challenging and a lot of fun. The action in this game is non stop. There are things blowing up and shooting you at all times. It's such a rush you never have time to breath. It has as much action as a million dollar motion picture, and the graphics look so good you might just think you're watching a movie. Don't let this game pass by; don't miss the game of the year.Presentation- This game has it all top notch music, amazing graphics, an unrivaled story, refined game play mechanics, and cut scenes that top Metal Gear. One amazing ride... 5/5Graphics- This game has the best graphics that I have ever seen. The cut scenes look amazing they almost tricked me into thinking I was watching a movie. They are so good the first time you see it you're jaw will drop. 5/5Game play- It has basically the same controls as the first one. It does have a new stealth system, and a new array of weapons to use. There are a few annoying parts in this game like the opening mission where the only thing you can use is stealth.  There is also a great new combat system. Punching enemies out has never been so easy or so fun. The addition of co op online and various other online modes helped this title. I don't like the hints; they make the puzzles and normal game play a little too easy. I advise you turn them off. Overall a wild ride and a smooth and enjoyable play through. 4.5/5Story- This game has one of the best written and acted stories that I have ever seen in a video game. The idea of going after Marco Polo's lost fleet is amazing. Every time that you think you have the whole thing figured out a new twist evolves and you're left breathless. The characters have layers of depth other video games can just envy. 5/5Lasting Appeal- Uncharted 2 is the best looking game I have ever seen and it is also one of the best playing games of all time. The online adds a lot of replay value to this title. There are a lot of treasures to find and trophies to unlock. In addition to a single player you are going to want to play again and again. It takes about 10 hours to beat the campaign, but you're going to want to beat it again. Forget game of the year, this is one of the best games of all time. 5/5Overall 4.9/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2009"}

Taken by itself, the game is really amazing on many levels, but after playing the game I also wish that Nintendo wouldn't have played it so safe with this title.  The innovation is only incremental over the DS release from a few years back and there are so many good features that could have been included.  My review has a lot of criticism, but please understand me... I only criticize this much because I love so much.PROS:+++ An insane and frantic multi-player experience that teeters between competitive and cooperative.+++ Easy to play but still challenging.+++ Colorful and whimsical level designs with lots of clever effects and features.+++ New suits, flowers, and power-upsCONS:--- Lack of an online multi-player mode.--- Forced use of motion control that could have been better assigned to a button.--- The Propeller Hat suit is really terrible.  What a lame power-up...GAMEPLAY: Back on the NES, Super Mario Bros. almost single-handedly defined the 2d platformer genre.  Collect coins, stars, and power-ups while traversing absurd platforms, traps, and castles to safe Princess Peach from Bowser.  The game is a very strong nod to Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World, with a return of the Koopa Kids and airships and castles.  Gameplay is largely unchanged from the DS New Super Mario Bros. and features 3D graphics on a 2D playing field.  Wall sliding, wall jumping, butt-stomping, spin-attacks... it's all here and largely unchanged.In single player mode, the game is a little bit slower paced compared to previous 2D Mario offerings, but still very enjoyable.  I wonder if part of that slower pace is an illusion due to the wide screen television.  Playing solo is pretty much what I have come to expect from a Nintendo platformer.  Mutli-player is a chaotic frenzy though, with players constantly shoving, smashing, and bouncing each other around the screen.  The multi-player mode makes for a great party game that usually results in tons of laughter, screaming, trash talking, etc.  Four player mode gets a bit dicey though because of the two Toad characters, which look identical except for their coloring.  I'm a bit color blind and they don't look distinct at all when things get crazy on screen.  The fact that other people who have better color distinction capability complain about the same issue really is the game's fault and not my own.  Two identical carbon copy characters on screen?  That's lazy, Nintendo.  At least give them different shaped hats.The new features are mostly subtle.  The best new addition is the Ice Flower, which allows you to throw ice balls that freeze enemies.  The propeller hat is a new addition as well, but I honestly think it is bland and quite un-fun.  I would have preferred to see a return of the the Racoon suit or Tanooki suit or even the cape from Super Mario World.The Bubble Mode is a take-it-or-leave-it feature as far as I'm concerned.  At any time you can press a button and the game will just let you get past the really tough spots for you.  Some people say that this makes the game too easy, but my argument is that you just shouldn't use it.  I personally have lots of fun sending Mario to his untimely (and repeated) doom.  The failure is part of the fun, and I see no need for me to ever use the bubble mode except in Multi-player when I need to go take a quick break and don't want to interrupt the other players' experience.ONLINE MULTI-PLAYER: None.  I read in more than a few places that Nintendo's explanation is that developers were pushing the Wii so hard with this game that it couldn't handle the strain of network traffic.  I don't buy that excuse for a second.  The game may have a lot going on at times, but it clearly isn't pushing the console to the limit.  This game could have allowed distant friends to play together, but Nintendo made the choice to keep all multi-player local, which is a shame.CONTROLS: For the most part the game controls very well.  The controller is held sideways, which makes have a Wii Motion Plus accessory kind of uncomfortable to have plugged in and the silicone Wii remote covers are slightly awkward as well.  Beyond the physical arrangement of the controller, today's Mario doesn't seem to get up to speed as quickly when he runs compared to his younger self.  Perhaps years of being a successful plumber celebrity, eating cake with Princess Peach after saving her in every game, and impending old age have taken a toll on his cardiovascular health, but he feels sluggish right out the gate.  Once up to speed he moves pretty quickly though.  It's not a huge change but if you've played a lot of 2D Mario games, the difference is noticeable.  Running speed is a minor quibble though compared to the forced use of motion control to do the spin attack, lifting heavy objects (like ice blocks), and the propeller hat jump.  Motion control as an option would have been nice, but forcing motion control when a button press would be more responsive and effective is a real annoyance.  I adapted just fine, but just because I adapted doesn't mean that I have to like it.GRAPHICS: Clean, bright, and colorful.  The character models could be more detailed, but overall the game looks good.  Many levels have some nifty graphical effects, such as light sourcing in darkened areas when you throw fireballs.  While the game could have looked better, it is still a standout title on the Wii in terms of graphical quality.AUDIO: The audio is ok, but feels uninspired.  It's more of the various Mario themes we've heard over the years mixed in with some new and instantly forgettable melodies.VALUE: With a solid single player mode and fun multi-player options, the game should be able to provide most people with a good amount of play time.  There are 64 main levels and a bunch of unlockable levels.  None of the levels I have played yet managed to be overly difficult but the later levels have definitely been challenging.  Every level has three large Yoshi coins which will give the completionists out there some extra goals to strive for.Considering this was the ultra-hyped Second (or 23rd) Coming of Mario, I really expected better because Nintendo has done better in the past.  That isn't to say this is a bad game.  It is very good in fact, but that doesn't mean there are a lot of things lacking that could have been done to turn a great game into a spectacular, mind-blowing revival of the franchise.  For all of my criticisms, I love this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2009"}

For example, many of these same Thief fans once hated Dishonored because they thought it was a \"Thief clone,\" yet for being such diehard Thief fans, these people didn't seem to know that Harvey Smith worked on Thief before working on Dishonored. Whatever, it ultimately doesn't matter, but the whole sheepish mentality in gaming communities is pretty silly. I find a lot of the knee-jerk reactions to be way over the top.Whether Thief lived up to your expectations or not, it's a nicely built game. especially when played on higher difficulty settings, giving it a really core Thief vibe.Pay no mind to the knee-jerk hive mentality, give this game a look for yourself and see if it's something that interests you.

Its a testament to its originality (and, unfortunately to the cookie-cutter nature of a lot of the games out there today) that makes Bioshock unlike anything ever created.  I was deeply affected and moved by the imagery, a \"Sky Captain and the World of Tommorow\" meets an Art-Deco Ayn Rand nightmare gone far off the edge of sanity.  The attention to detail is hard to verbalize, because so much effort clearly went into it, its quite an anomoly in today's gaming world.  There is an old game for 80's-era systems called \"Rocket Ranger\", and this has that type of style, but with absolutely no kitsche whatsoever.  This is a serious, mature themed game.  Despite the semi-cartoony Big Daddy on the cover (which you find out quickly are anything but cartoons), this game is about as adult as it gets, and the themes are probably unable to be appreciated by the young anyway.Nightmarish, eerie, and dark as dark gets, Bioshock is a comprehensive game, from the shadows of the cooridors, to the great ambient surround sounds that scare the heck out of you (no game thus far, I think, uses surround sound this effectively), to the period music, this game is 100% well thought out and executed.  If every game on the market was like this, this immersive experience, the gaming industry would be in a better place than it is right now...but, just the fact a game like Bioshock exists gives me hope that what gaming is all about, entertainment, experience, and escapism, is headed in the right direction.

I probably fall somewhere in the middle for reasons I hope to elaborate on.First off, I seem to be finding lately that if I hear about a game more than three months before a release date, it fails to live up to any hype.  This happened with Fable and Bioshock for example.  Both good games and worth the time and effort to play, but after all of the hype I almost expected them to cure cancer or something.  Assassin's Creed is very much the same.Pro's:The game looks amazing.  Given, it was made for the Xbox 360 and the PS3 as well as for pc sometime next year, but even so the smooth endless landscape looks phenomenal.  Every game released recently has blown my mind graphics wise, and this game does not disappoint in that regard.Freedom is an interesting event for this game as well, causing me to give it both good and bad marks.  As for the good side, it is cool to just climb nearly anything, jump anywhere and go practically anywhere.  I found it to work very much like Prince of Persia with an expanded world.  The first few times you climb to the top of a tower and swan dive off are very impressive.The control for this game also worked well.  This has been another mixed review for people.  Some hate the one button combat system, but then again I couldn't stand the \"Dance Dance Revolution\" combo timing button mashfest of God of War (Don't you have enough to keep track of in a battle?).  The combat of Assassin's Creed works more on timing strikes and counters and less on the pattern of buttons.  Given, battles in this game become boring beyond all redemption throughout the game, but I hesitate to blame the controls for that one.The \"Free running\" system works well too.  Instead of having to deal with worrying about climbing surfaces and moving over objects, you hold a button and simply move where you want.  This simplifies things immensely and immediately moves you away from the annoying wall running, jumping and timed daggerstabs of Prince of Persia.Sadly, that was about it for the pro's on this game.  Let's see how many con's I can jam in here.First, lets talk about the gameplay itself.  When I heard of this game, I really expected to play a game where you immerse yourself in a world of darkness, intrigue, and cold hearted death from the shadows.  In reality, you have about a baker's dozen of prominent people to kill and a bunch of worthless stuff to do.  I would say I actually spent less than 6% of my playtime killing people.  Most of the time is spent putzing about stealing things, questioning people or sitting on a bench.  Seriously, sitting on a bench.  You even have to hold down a button to overhear a conversation while you are sitting there.  As if I really believed that there was interactivity at this point.Several times you are forced into what I like to call \"interactive DVD\" sequences.  PS2 games were well known for this.  Essentially, you start the game, grab the controller and watch a movie.  After about an hour or so you ask whether you bought a game or the latest movie release out there.  The storyline for this game is developed and revealed through conversation, not action.  Before starting a mission, you sit through way too much conversation.  After killing someone you sit through yet again way too much talking with no way to skip out of it (believe me I tried really hard to make them talk faster at least).While helping out greatly in adding dimension to this game, the freedom of adventure is also a falling point.  Yes, you have the ability to go nearly anywhere, climb anything and look all over the place, there is just very little need to.  I referred to the Prince of Persia games earlier so forgive this next metaphor.  If the PoP games were non-linear, would the game have changed?  Answer, no.  Since you would have to go down that hallway, hit that button and jump that pit it wouldn't matter how much freedom you have.  In the end you are trapped in a linear game.  This game is very much like that.  You travel from town to town, performing ridiculous tasks to further the plot, and though you have the psuedo-freedom to do anything, there is no reason to.While I felt the combat system worked for this game, I at times questioned the purpose.  In many sequences of the game, it is nearly impossible to avoid fighting.  I recall several of my key plot kills happening while I was surrounded by guards and thus accidentally landing a killing blow.  Not all that assassinesh if you ask me.  The last few sequences of the game actually give up on the pretense of assassination altogether and simply threw you into a huge melee of a few dozen guards.  It almost seemed like the developers simply didn't want to finish making this game, and thus didn't want you to finish so they simply launched everything at you.While Assassin's Creed suffers in terms of gameplay and the ability to hold my interest for more than a few hours at a time, it does succeed in being unique and amusing as far as gaming goes.  While a decent game in it own right, it fails to live up to expectations and hype, thus causing a bit of a letdown.  I would say it is worth a play, but not a full price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2007"}

I don't know why, but once I restart the console, it will dissapear. Its a small glitch.If you have internet, you can get into the free HOME interface and interact, play and meet other people (similar to SecondLife, although you can't buy real estate or transfer cash to other people. Its strictly to meet and play with people).You can acces the Sony store to buy and download dozens of games or even movies in HD. They're not expensive. You can usually rent a movie for a few dollar for a day, or you can even buy it and store it in your system.And everything you do online is FREE. You don't have to pay a big monthly subscription like in the \"other\" competitor.The controller is wireless, and it doesn't have rumble effect. But you can buy on separately with that feature.I haven't had the time to use its features fully. But I know you can install Linux in it, and I'm going to try it.You can browse the internet with its included browser. You can even get into Youtube and make the video screen BIG to fit your TV. I think that's and awesome feature. Hulu.com works great also and you can watch whole TV shows and even moves, and they look better than regular TV because many times they're 480i HD.It doensn't have memory stick slots (this 40 gb model) but I don't need them ,because I can even transer file with a USB memory stick or a burned CDRom.It just has too many features too list. Its very versatily and Sony is constanlty updating the software FOR FREE. I have even seen games in the Playstation Network store for $2.99, and some are even free.But whatever, I don't really care what you choose in the end, its your money and you can blow it on a 360 or a Wii *laughs*, heck $20 a month for XBox live isn't much anyway, that's just $240 a year hahaha... later","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0050SY4DG","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"Frustrating","reviewText":"This is a relatively long game, and depending on my point in the game, I would could have either given it one stars or five stars, so I'm going to have to average it out with three stars. One of my biggest problems, are with something that shouldn't have happened, something that should have been tested and either removed or made easier, and that's the multitude of quicktime events. There are hundreds of them in this game, and none of them are easy, while some of them are damn near impossible. More than once I almost quit playing the game because I couldn't get by a quicktime event (most notably the one with the giant boss where you have to remove the armor around its spine/antenna thing). There's no reason for quicktime events, which are already annoying at the best of times, to be so difficult. I also found it very annoying for most of the time I played the game, where even though I was playing solo I wasn't allowed to pause the game (even if the controller lost power), which is something I've never seen in any game I've ever played. In my third campaign I finally figured out that you have to go out of your way to select offline play when starting your game.This game was touted as having three separate campaigns (it actually has four), but it was surprising how similar they are to each other. Even the game seems to recognize these as new game+ campaigns. I almost wish that there had been a way to combine all of the campaigns into one large campaign where you switch characters after every mission, and the parts that are copied between the campaigns you'd only have to do once. My enjoyment of the game was greatly harmed as I played the Leon campaign first, and I found it to be the weakest of the bunch, even though it was touted as being the one most like the earlier Resident Evil games. In fact, other than killing standard zombies more often, it is not at all like the early RE games, instead you play the weakest character with less ammo, no cool melee attacks, and not as many cool weapons. Personally my favorite campaign was with Jake, mainly as it was the most different of the campaigns, and it had the best story (which isn't saying much).Utlimately, there is a lot of game here, but most of it is a frustrating mess. I wouldn't recommend this game, but if you can suffer through the annoyances there is a decent amount of fun to be had in Resident Evil 6.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2013"}

Undercover investigations weave players through a murderous web of gangs and deceit as they battle crooks, Marcus' past and everything else the city throws at them.","reviewerName":"sporkdude \"sporkdude\"","summary":"Not too shabby if you have realistic expectations","reviewText":"When the first True Crime came out, it was the first real competition for the GTA series, and  it was pretty good.  Technically, this is a slight downgrade though.  By trying to recreate the New York city feel, it becomes too bogged down and too slow.Basically, it's like all the city immersive games out there.  Nothing really new.  Again, like the first True Crime, the streets are real, but the buildings and scenery are just generic.  Speaking of generic, you start off with a horrible cliched storyline.  The same one sided characters and cheesy dialogue that has plagued every game that has anything to do with crime.  So, I tried to get into it, but after ten minutes of pure unadulterated boredom, I just stopped caring and skipped all the FMVs.The gameplay itself is decent.  Nothing great, but very playable.  If you don't want to get involved or frustrated (like what is required for GTA: San Andreas), this game is perfect.  Driving is annoying, but after you discover the Subway and Taxis, you can move throughout the city with very little driving at all.  This leads to the missions.  The missions themselves are indoor third person shooting missions.  Nothing complicated here.  L2 to auto-aim, and shoot.  They tried to add stealth, but it's absolutely pointless to try.  That's about it for the major missions.There are some minor flaws, like one example would be if you don't have the proper weapon (happened to me twice), you can't leave the mission to get that weapon.  You have to reload and sometimes repeat a couple of missions to get to where you need to be.  Also, selecting and picking up guns is not quite correct.  For example, you'll pick up a carbine, but when the ammo is done, it will sometimes bring you to the stun gun.  Valuable seconds are wasted switching to your .38 (which is the only weapon with unlimited ammo).There are side missions that you can do (the major missions only yield 25% completion rate), they've eliminated the need for extraneous and useless combos, and even though some missions seem to drag on, it's nothing like the half hour borefests for the \"Dragon\" missions in True Crime: Streets of LA.Finally, people say there are tons of bugs.  I haven't see any except for the slow frame rate.  Heck, GTA: Vice City and Prince of Persia: Warriors Within had a lot of bugs that were easily identifiable.  If there are major bugs in this game, I didn't see them.The game looks a little dated, and there is really nothing new except for the Subway and Cabs, but it's fun, never frustrating, and a good solid rental.Pros:Actual streets of New York.Not frustrating at all.Taxis and Subways rule!Don't have to learn combos.Cons:Cliched story.Dullest beginning ever.Driving is a chore.Framerate problems.Some missions get really dull.Frustration Level: LowDifficulty Level: LowHours to Complete: 10 hours (major missions only)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2005"}

{"product_name":"B001PKHRVE","reviewerName":"Tyler Johnson","summary":"Wolverine could totally take Kratos","reviewText":"It still amazes me that more people don't know about this awesome game. Having played God of War, I wasn't expecting to find anything new in x-men origins; I was dead wrong. The basic combat in X-men origins is superior to every other God of War clone out there, and stands toe to toe with Krato's namesake. Wolverine can use his feral senses to track enemies in any enviornment, he can lunge over great distances and impale his enemies on his claws, or go berserk and shred everything in his path.There are two different time periods present in this game. The first shows Wolverine when he was still working for the government. These sections take place in africa, and are an excellent balance of combat and enjoyable, if simple, puzzles. The other time period loosely follows the storyline to the far inferior movie. These segments are almost wall to wall action and they are a lot of fun. Alternating between time periods was a good descsion on the part of the developers. It keeps the gameplay from growing stale.The graphics are more than servicable, the enviornments are colorful, and varied, and the voice acting is very good.Another very strong aspect of this game are it's boss fights. While it is true that the bosses in the past are almost all copy-pasted, the boss fights in the movie story line are epic. From wiping the floor with the blob, to taming wild Wendigo's the battles are varied and plentiful.My favorite feature in the game though, has to be the Wolverine on Wolverine fights. What are those you ask? There are Wolverine icons scattered throughout the game. When you collect both, you are able to unlock the outfit on the icon; but first you have to take it. You fight a mirror image of yourself, and once you when, not only do you get a new outfit, but you can fight your doppleganger again any time you want. You can even fight against a friend in this mode, which is just as cool.When all is said and done, only the God of War himself stands in the way of this being the best game in it's genre. A definite buy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2011"}

It's not like you'll have time to really enjoy sailing too because every 15 seconds you have another fight on the ocean.The story is relatively predictable and while it starts off well enough (which I won't spoil) I think that it's no where near on the level of the other Suikoden games.The game does have beautiful music though and I loved the opening song.

I saw many other customers complaining about the main character talking too much & similar stuff. I realise everybody likes something different, but I don't really mind those minor details. It's a sequel to Super Metroid, so it makes sense to me. I do agree it's not quite as good as the Metroid Prime series, but it's almost. I find this game has a great storyline & all & think they did a great job on it despite difference of opinions. It's a 5 star game in my opinion & can't wait for another to be released. :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I0F5I2","reviewerName":"Jacob","summary":"Great game!","reviewText":"Definitely deserved the Game of the Year award, great fun and adventure. I highly recommend it, pretty decent amount of play time too ( I recall over 20hours I think).If you love puzzles and adventure grab this game! It is a 3rd person shooter with puzzles and fighting.Don't need to play the first Uncharted to get into this great story(but i recommend playing the first uncharted(and 3rd) anyways because its just as much fun).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2012"}

I wish i didn't have to....as this headset fits my ear nicely.  You can mold it to fit your ear. (the official sony one would always fall off)the problem I'm having:  It seems like I'm having some type of interference.  I've tried shutting off wifi, other elements, and adjusting the level of the mic.  however, I still...routinely once every 2 seconds...hear a little \"click\" in the ear piece then on the TV it shows the \")))\" by the microphone as if I'm talking.  Really annoying..people will say \"CAN'T HEAR You!\" all the time because they think I'm talking.So yeah - maybe just having really bad luck - and wondering if my ps3 is defective - so it's not really fair to write a review.  Has anyone had this problem before?","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2013"}
{"product_name":"B003R783IY","description":"","reviewerName":"Louie the Italian Jew \"Lou da Joo\"","summary":"Multiplayer was great (when HP was just released)","reviewText":"Nothing like listening to your favorite music while playing on-line in a 4 on 4 match racing/take down match. This game rocks! When I first played the single player match, it reminded me distinctly of Burnout:Paradise City. From taking your picture with the console camera, to the little side destroyable roadblocks. This is Paradise City without getting lost from Point A to Point B.NFSHP's multiplayer is exciting! You are either the cop or the racer. As the racer, you place down jammers, spike strips, or and an experimental weapon named the EMP, and escape or takedown the police. As the cop, you put down roadblocks, spike strips, EMP's and can call in a helicopter and take-down racers. This added element, along with the nitrous is exciting!The single player consists primarily of earning bounty, by beating times, duels, and takedowns in order to get a bronze, silver, or gold medal. When you earn bounty, you have the option to buy a nicer car. You can also take a free drive on the course you choose if you'd like. NFS gives you bounty on every race for something you accomplished during the race. There are many variations on the single player types of races.This game also reminds me of Need For Speed Shift, but the biggest complaint I had with Need for Speed Shift was although I loved the physics of the game, the environments were all similar and boring (except London and the DLC). With this game, the environments are all beautiful and breathtaking. You can race along the coast, desert, forest, canyon etc. Times of day (from dusk till dawn) and night are also varied, along with different weather conditions. The graphics as well as the sound are top-notch. This has some of the most stunning visuals I have seen from any racing game. Also, if you buy the game, buy it new because when you buy the new version, you'll receive the online pass, and unlike the boring Need for Speed online, the multiplayer for NFSHP is exciting. I actually like this multiplayer more than Blur, which in my opinion, USED to be the best multiplayer racing game.Finally, don't hate because the trial was taken down. You got a taste of the good life, and now it's time to pay to play. I think you'll be thoroughly impressed with the full version of Need for Speed Hot Pursuit. It's worth your hard earned cash IMO (wait for Black Friday).edit: 2/8/11 traded this game in because the multiplayer mode died and the single player became repetitive. the multiplayer mode of this game was a lot of fun when it first came out, but unless you have friends to play with the game may suffer from non-existent or hard to find people to play with online.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2010"}
