It's been a few years, butFeverandMaddenare once again going head-to-head on the Xbox,  and once againFeverproves itself a serious threat to EA's perennial  football powerhouse. That's not to say thatNFL Fever 2002is a perfect  game, because it isn't, but it does offer great graphics, decent AI, and plenty  of bone-crunching gameplay.NFL Fever 2002features several gameplay modes, including practice,  single game, and season, which itself contains a couple of different options,  including dynasty and fantasy challenge.Fever 2002has a full NFL  license and includes all 31 current NFL teams--and 15 fantasy teams--along with  all the current stadiums. Dynasty mode is where most players will find  themselves, as this mode lets you manage all aspects of your team, including  signing and cutting players, negotiating trades, and making sure that your team  comes in under the salary cap.A great feature in dynasty mode is Dynamic Player Performance, which adjusts  players' ratings (which determine how well they play) based on past game  performances. So if you have a second-string running back who rattles off three  or four great games in a row, his rating will increase, which should keep him  performing at that high level. On the flip side, if a player has several poor  games, his rating will decrease.Because it was designed specifically for the Xbox (unlikeMadden NFL  2002, which was ported to the Xbox from the PlayStation2 version),NFL  Fever 2002looks awesome. Player animations are highly detailed, the  stadiums look fantastic, and the weather effects are topnotch. Beyond the  obvious features, though, there are many subtle details that really add to the  experience: the field will get torn up in wet weather, player uniforms will get  stained with dirt, and the crowd will begin to thin out if the game is a  blowout.In terms of gameplay,Fever 2002delivers a solid experience. The AI is  pretty solid, especially on the defensive side, and if you call a perfect game  it's possible to get a shutout against the computer, even on the higher  difficulty settings. On the downside, the computer rarely runs the ball, even  when it has a high-powered running back like Corey Dillon, and AI play calling  is rather suspect at times.Those complaints aside,Fever 2002is a lot of fun. It offers great  graphics, multiplayer is a blast, and the dynasty mode features a good deal of  depth. If you only want one football game,NFL Fever 2002deserves your  consideration.--William HarmsPros:Dynamic Player PerformanceGreat graphicsSolid defensive AICons:Computer rarely runs the ballGameplay a little arcadelike at times","reviewerName":"Jeff Schmidt","summary":"Top-Flight!","reviewText":"I've played this game more hours than the rest of my X-Box titles combined!  I keep coming back because every game and every season is different than the last thanks to the Dynasty Mode Feature and Dynamic player performance. The ability to control the strengths and weaknesses of your team and adjust your play-calling to maximize your team stregths makes this game continually interesting.  Anything can happen in these games.  I've successfully come back from 14 point deficits with 2 minutes to go in the fourth quarter. I've lost games on last second fifty-yard field goals.  It's frustrating, it's exhilirating, it's great.  I've purchased 7 games for the X-box and I feel this game is the most entertainment for the money.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2002"}

But what I found was a lame MK4 remake and a stupid mode for Konquest.The first thing I thought looked good was Chess Kombat, if you know how to play chess, you can play a game where once your piece tries to take another, you go to a fight, and take on the computer or player 2 in a MK style one on one match. Lower your difficulty settings at first, otherwise the CPU whips you in 10 seconds before you can blink, get used to it first. I then played the Arcade, euhh, it's MK4, the default costumes look stupid and you have to unlock classic costumes. At least you can do that.so far, those are OK, but the Konquest mode... how can anyone say it's good? Ok, I can understand if you like RPG games, you will probably get into it, but since when has MK been an RPG? I probably wouldn't mind it so much, is I was playing as a familiar character, but I'm not, i'm playing as a kid!!!!!??????? WTF??????You run around town, where time is moving so fast the space time continue should be caving in on itself, and i'm running around collecting coins and looking for another kid to take me to the next training session. ummm... ok... but wait, now I am trying to fill a bucket of water for an old lady, finding some guys lost dog, and collecting flour for a baker... WTF?????? This is Mortal Kombat, and i'm playing as a kid doing good deeds for the townspeople? WTF????????? I seriously mean it, WTF????????? If there is a great story to be told afterwards when you leave the walls of the first city, then I'm afraid I won't see it, because once I reached the first save point and exited the walls, I was bored stupid and wondering what the heck kind of idea Midway had to change Mortal Kombat into this sort of thing?Could you imagine if MK1 was like this? Instead of being a one on one fighter, you had to learn to tie your shoe laces and pee in a straight line before advancing to the next level? That game would have been horrible, and Mortal Kombat would not still be here today. MK is about fighting, not collecting coins and doing chores for a bunch of townspeople who can't be bothered doing it themselves... and the pictures of the meat and water bucket... BWUAHAHAHHA, Oh man, they are horrid to look at. It tried to through some humor in with the lost dog thing, but I failed to find it funny, because it seemed too child like orientated, not something for the likes of teenagers and adults, which MK has always been... until this game.WTF happened here? Did Midway try to make an MK for children? Yet get slapped with a M rating due to the 1 on 1 version?Get Shaolin Monks instead of this, this one is so warped and stupid it will make your head spin.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2013"}

I received the Xbox 360 version, and though the next gen consoles are out, Black Flag still looks beautiful and is entirely immersive on the 360. I was immediately drawn in by the richly detailed characters and environments. The story itself is also very interesting right off the bat, as for the first time in the series, the story doesn't revolve an assassin but a pirate. The story unfolds at the perfect pace and there are TONS of opportunities for character progression. Adding onto your ship is addicting and highly satisfying. I've spent more time just trolling the seas rescuing shipwrecked sailors for recruit than progressing with my main goals. The entire game has an immersion that is hard to describe. As you sail the seas, your crew sings sea chanties. As you sit around the fire in port at night, the bard serenades you. All the little touches are here to make this an amazing experience that is not to be missed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00BMFIXT2","description":"","reviewerName":"Trent Steele","summary":"Best entry since Brotherhood","reviewText":"AC4 is not perfect, but I feel it's the best entry in the series since Ezio in AC2.1/Brotherhood.  It seems Ubisoft is launching a new pirate-based trilogy starring Edward Kenway.  Connor from AC3 seems to simply be a jumping off point for the new trilogy much as Atair was the jumping off point for the Ezio trilogy.AC4 also presents a new opportunity for Ubisoft in that it's a game that newcomers won't feel lost jumping into.  You don't need to play the previous 5 or 6 games in order to enjoy this one.  It's a pirate game at its base with strong assassin elements.  It makes for a very compelling experience that's sure to have broad appeal for action fans.The game is incredibly rich.  There is land based gameplay that features the hide-in-plain-sight stealth and climb-nearly-anything elements that are core to the series.  There's incredibly well-developed sea based gameplay that features ship battles and boarding parties.  There's a rewarding upgrade system.  There's even a fleet mini game that helps you earn big heaps of cash.  And that's hardly an exhaustive list.The ship based portion of the game is even more developed from AC3.  The seas themselves behave wonderfully and the ship sails over them very satisfyingly.  My favorite thing to do is to attack one of the forts.  You assail the fort with your ship and when the fort is pacified, you land your ship and move on to secure the fort through combat.  It's very fun, but once the fort is secure, you never have to secure it again.  There are only 8 or so forts on the map.One other great new feature is the ability to fast travel to any discovered location or view point on the massive map.The combat, sadly enough, is one aspect of the game that seems to be a step back.  Edward uses any combination of 2 swords, up to 4 pistols and of course the double hidden blade.  There's no longer a knife like previous entries in the series.  It all works really well for the most part, but ultimately seems to lack the variation of kill animations that appeared in previous games.  Ezio and Connor were better fighters.Edward is also not much of a climber.  I think the climbing mechanic peaked with Connor in AC3 with his ability to climb buildings, trees and rock faces.  Edward is pretty much limited to buildings and trees to a lesser extent.  Rock faces are only climbable if there is a building embedded in the rock to support it.Edward's character is certainly a lot more interesting than Connor with the potential to rival even Ezio.  However, you don't grow as much with Edward as you did with Ezio (the series followed Ezio from a young boy to an old man).  Any of Edward's history is shown through unplayable flashbacks.The meta narrative I think is far improved in this game too.  There's even some good comedy to be found in those sections.In the end, I put more than 50 hours into this game and probably came within 70% of completion.  Like I said, it's a rich game.  Ubisoft also now includes some amount of social interaction with the ability to rate missions, which I think is great.  It means that future games will feature more of the fun missions and less of the tedious ones.  I enjoyed this game greatly.  It's an easy recommendation.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2014"}

Square Enix and Jupiter team up once again to showcaseThe World Ends With You, a trendy and vibrant gaming experience developed exclusively for the Nintendo DS. Featuring an intuitive combat system and exciting multiplayer mode,The World Ends With Youis set to immerse gamers into the modern-day culture of Japan.StoryThe story begins as Neku Sakuraba, an unsociable 15-year-old boy, unexpectedly wakes up in the Shibuya shopping district of Tokyo, Japan. While trying to piece together his rude awakening, he receives a strange text message warning him that he will cease to exist unless he accomplishes a certain mission.

Strange as it is, I haven't played much DS games but not for lack of games but just lack of funds. I thought I'd give The World Ends With You a shot and while I wouldn't say it's one of my favorite games on the DS, it's sure quite fun to play anyway.Story: You play as Neku, a kid who is more comfortable being by himself and doesn't want to rely on anyone (a kid after my own heart, it seems). He awakens in the Shibuya District in Tokyo with amnesia and no clue of how we arrived. Soon, he receives a message to be somewhere in 60 minutes or face erasure. With the ability to read minds and teaming up with a young girl, Shiki, Neku has to complete various tasks and take on numerous creatures lest he face being erased.Graphics: The game's graphics go for more a presentation rather than really going all-out in terms of the visuals. With character designs from Tetsuya Nomura who worked on various Final Fantasy games and the movie, the game takes on a comic-book feel mixed with 2D graphics to create the world which is quite inviting and certainly never boring.Sound/Music: The voice acting is kind of scattered with voice clips and sentences now and then as well as the occasional \"huh?\" when a character's confused or surprised. It works well within the game though too bad it wasn't voice acting the entire game. As for the music, it's a good mix of J-Pop and Rock and even though I wouldn't really call it a buy or even download-worthy but it works quite well and I never felt like I had to put on my own music.Gameplay: Most DS games use either screen as a map or extra gameplay features such as accessing special attacks or character stats. This game however requires both to fight as Neku and his partner have to battle the creatures on both screens in a sort-of tag team as Neku battles with the stylus on the bottom while the partner takes on the same enemy with the D-Pad or the face buttons on the top. Beat an enemy on one screen and it disappears from both screen so coordination and combos are extremely helpful. In fact they're kind of a necessity since successful attacks will pass a \"puck\" to the other player and keep it going long enough and better attacks will form. I will admit at first it was hard to keep track of both screens but while I still got hit quite a bit, I became a lot better and with the game's adjustable difficulty menu (the \"harder\" you make it, the better items and EXP you get) so it's best to start slow.Neku uses attacks based on \"pins\" which are basically equippable moves that can level up the more you use them. One requires a vertical slash with the stylus to cut enemies while another can allow you to nab cars and other objects and fling them at enemies. Tap repeatedly for bullets, drag to create a fire trail or slash vertically to create ice columns are just some of the special attacks that you can utilize. If you don't have a screen protector yet, buy one since the action can get quite scratch-heavy and a protector will help. Another is that it's very easy to miss your enemy and with a usage timer that has to recharge before you can use it again, you'll probably rely on a certain set of pins for best in battle.Other things can be used such as shops where you can buy clothing and wearing certain clothing in certain areas will give you bonuses since you're more \"with it\". It is isn't like say San Andreas where you can make your guy super muscular or ridiculously fat but it gives more options for strategy and gameplay changes. Other things like eating food which takes time to digest which will also give you stats help with playing the game and the customizing and new game+ features help the game feel more fresh the more you play. A word of caution though: this game can easily kick your *** if you're not careful and I often found myself being attacked from all sides on both screens because my eyes or fingers weren't fast enough but not to dissuade gamers from picking it up since it is fun and certainly different than \"press X\" gameplay but it took some getting used to.There's games that are a bit more niche audience and more for a certain kind of gamer but I'd say everyone needs to at least play The World Ends With You at least once. Not just for the uniqueness of it but the possibility after all the weirdness that you just might end up loving it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2008"}

WarioWare and WarioWare:Touched! are similar, in fact there are a few reviews out there that complain that the game was too short or too easy.  Those reviews are probably from someone that played the original one, WW Touched is different from the first one but it also has a lot of similar mini games.  A lot has changed since the first one has been release, Nintendo has released a new system (Nintendo DS) which has added a microphone and touchscreen.  I like how Nintendo incorporated these new features in to the game, it makes the game a lot funner.I would highly remcommend this game to anyone who has never played a WarioWare, it is by far the best version out.  If you own the first one and are an absolute WarioWare fan I recommend this to compliment your collection.  And if you are one of those gamers who thought it was too easy or too short then nothing but Final Fantasy Tactics Advance (All 300 missions) is going to satify your gaming craving.The first WarioWare is a GameBoy Advance Classic, time will tell if WW Touched is.

Wait til someone tosses it in the used and abused pile.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2006"}
{"product_name":"B000BI3QK2","description":"","reviewerName":"David Foskin \"SneakyGoblin on XBL\"","summary":"Think that little SanAndreas game was big (I used to)? GET THIS!","reviewText":"As far as jail-breaks go, you're about to have the opportunity to start again, everything set back to default with no-one the wiser. You owe your impending freedom to a man about to lose his own, the Emperor Uriel Septum, who for the last time peered into the well of destiny and found a stranger staring straight back at him, a stranger whose future is now bound with that of a nation. Whether through the alignment of the stars or just sheer dumb luck, you're as ordinary as they come and happen to be at the crossroads of history when forces combine to push ordinary individuals to great lengths and deeds. Yep, you guessed it, you're mister ordinary, about to embark on an adventure in which you decide how far depths are plummeted to find the information and experiences locked away inside Cyrodiil.Stretching from Anvil on the Abecean Sea in the West to the shadow of the Valus Mountains in the east, then south down the Niben waterway to Leyawiin and Topal Bay, Cyrodiil is a vast green dogleg, the \"Imperial Province\" within the Tamrielic Empire and named for a dynasty that included three early emperors. Your adventure starts roughly in the centre, on an island in Lake Rumar on which sits Imperial City. Rather like a stone wheel, the entire city circles around the central and towering Imperial Palace, with huge walls separating the streets into districts. Outside the city walls lies a waste pipe from the sewers underneath, where you'll learn the basics of the game through escaping from jail and become entangled with Uriel Septums final moments, the consequences of which give you the starting step to the main quest.There are many quests, adventures and experiences to find and accomplish within Oblivion, with plenty to do off the beaten track. Some have stories, though often they're written in gold, darkness and blood. Every dark hole in the ground is considered a new adventure, how you get to those new adventures is up to you. As you might have guessed, you can take life in Cyrodiil as you please. Either hit the floor running and gun up the levels, grab all the spells and beat back evil to save the Empire, or explore the vast world, find knowledge through interaction with the many residents and the books available. You won't find public transportation such as Silt Striders in Morrowind, instead players can buy horses and equip them with the optional download of armour to protect them from thieves and other animals, as well as fast-travelling to other cities via the in-game menu. You won't often ask for directions, thanks to the compass and GTA style map-markers, and knowing where to go is a help, because the world of Oblivion is constantly in motion, regardless of your status or whereabouts. Non player characters get up and go to work, go out for dinner afterwards before retiring home to bed. Others see neighbours or visit other cities. Some do things that are unexpected. Every person is a small mystery.Oblivion also moves internally, constantly adjusting challenges and rewards according to your characters level. Progression is performed in two ways; you can spend time boosting your skills to become more powerful, and then there's levelling up to face harder enemies. Low levels means weaker spells and potions, armour and weapons, whereas the higher ones unleash the cooler magical elements and stronger equipment and apparel. With progression comes harder enemies, and that's not in skill level. Out in the wild between cities, you'll encounter wolves at low levels. Go higher and you'll see packs of them, before they're replaced by tigers, and finally huge powerful bears. In dungeons you'll encounter zombies and skeletons at the start, with far more powerful enemies emerging as you climb the ladder. Besides the difficulty slider hidden away in the preferences menu, this presents players with the option to either breeze through a world populated by weak enemies, or take the time to level up and slay huge monsters, demons and all other types of unheard of foes. The choice, as they say, is yours.So you've probably got the idea that Oblivion is one heck of a world. There's plenty going on, there's plenty to do and there's plenty to see. On the subject of seeing, Cyrodiil looks absolutely stunning. Everything is bright and wonderful in the sunshine, birds singing, pigeons flocking, butterflies dodging about in the shadows, and then environments look damp, cold and miserable when rain rolls into town. The level of detail is quite breathtaking, with brickwork incredibly convincing, foliage resembling plants and not just clumps of green material and landscapes that could kill. Everything just looks so detailed, rich and wonderful that you simply cannot help being lured into the world of Oblivion. Water ripples as water should; litter flies about in the wind and collects in bundles in streets. This really is something, and for once words cannot describe the absolute beauty Bethesda have created here.The downside to Oblivion is if you're not an RPG fan, or someone looking to get into the genre, you're really being thrown into the deep end here. Besides the guiding arrow on the in-game compass, there's not a hand to lead you about or a massive tutorial to follow, so sometimes you can sit about confused and frustrated as what to do next. Luckily, if you have your wits about you, you'll realise that there is so much more to Oblivion than just mission beating. There are wild animals to guard against, of which you can sell their remains to make money. There's locations to explore and discover, books to read (thousands infact), a huge arena to fight in or bet wagers on, a mage university to gain access to and explore, amongst countless other things. We could literally sit here for days just explaining in vivid detail how much you can do and accomplish, but we'd rather simply skim he surface and leave the rest for you to discover.There are niggly bugs and exploits uncovered during the course of gameplay, but handy downloads from Live seem to have fixed these up, as well as introducing horse armour into the game for your trusty stead on those long voyages, but otherwise you're looking at the prime example to own the Xbox 360. We love GRAW and we're mastering PGR3, but Oblivion beats them both to the coveted top spot of must-have 360 games. The lush and vast environments will simply blow you away, the opportunity to either charge on through missions or sit back and enjoy exploring and conjuring up new potions will please many, and the variety of side-missions, quests and factions will keep fans coming back for more, even creating new characters to take on the world with.Let's stop it here before I uncover something revealing and spoil the plot. Just buy Oblivion and savour the moment, because next-next-gen gaming just got oh-so great.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

I've had my NGC for a long time. In fact, I had it through out the majority of this gen's life cycle. I sold my NGC (but kept the games) back in 2011 to buy a Wii & haven't regretted it since but lets stick to the NGC for this review lol. The GameCube is a pure work of art. It doesn't play DVDs, it doesn't play music. It only does ONE thing and one thing alone. Play games. This is a no gimmick, no nonsense gaming system, dedicated solely to gaming, & it shows hard.The NGC is FAST. Slow to almost NO load times are what you're looking at in games. The quality & durability of the system & it's components is superb & unmatched in every way. It's been proven that the NGC is the strongest, longest-lasting system of all three (NGC, PS2, Xbox). I've owned both a PS2 & NGC. NOTHING takes a hit & still works as flawlessly as a NGC. It's hard for the outer casing to even get scratched lol. It's light, portable, neat & sturdy. It comes with 4 control ports. 4's the standard, no wasting money on a multi-tap like you would need to for the PS2, this baby comes ready for a crowd. & the games are ready for a crowd too.Speaking of games, the NGC is a force to be reckoned with. It's really not that complicated. Xbox is out of the race before it even starts. Besides Halo & Fable, anything on an Xbox you can get anywhere else. Now comes the PS2. Ok, PS2 has by FAR the most games, and a crazy amount of them are good, but a crazy amount of games are also bad. THEN, you can't get Nintendo exclusives at all on a PS2 at all, and that's saying a lot, because unlike PS2 & Xbox, the NGC first party releases alone are are enough to power a system lol, & that's no exaggeration. Most good third party games on the PS2 can be found on the NGC. The others either don't matter cuz they're crap, or the NGC makes up for it, cuz it has ALOT of good games the PS2 doesn't have either. Incredible exclusives like Mario games, StarFox, Kirby, Pikmin, Pokemon, Donkey Kong, F-Zero, Zelda, Super Smash Bros, Fire Emblem, Metroid Prime, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles & Tales Of Symphonia are only a few in a very long line of epic games you can get only on the NGC & they're all great. Most are nominees for game of the year or winner of that award. NGC has less games than the PS2, but a higher percentage of it's games are good games.My mountain of NGC games never stopped growing, and i'm very picky when it comes to games. Even today there are good NGC games I haven't gotten my hands on yet that i intend to. Bottom line is, forget the fancy excuses to try and enhance sales, cuz the NGC doesn't do any of that. It just does what it's suppose to be, something to play video games on, and does it extremely well. This is of the best consoles you'll ever have the pleasure of knowing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2012"}

{"product_name":"B005VBVQBU","description":"","reviewerName":"Niedducciano","summary":"Good buy","reviewText":"The following review is something I actually wrote and submitted for a PS3 system, but since I was comparing and contrasting the PS3 to the Xbox, I felt like it might be useful for potential Xbox consumers as well.  the bottom line for the Xbox is that if it had a BluRay player, it would get 5 stars.I have been an Xbox user for years.  The PS3 is a system that has always intrigued me, though.  It is always louded as the higher level technology especially with the BluRay.  It had integrated wi-fi before Xbox, and the online interactions don't cost money (you don't *have* to pay to play online).  And so, for these reasons, I bought a PS3 250GB system.  Here are my thoughts on it.Pros:As I've already mentioned, the PS3 is a BluRay player as well as game consol.  You can watch movies and play games in 3D (which sometimes can make an okay game epic, or other times make you sick to your stomach - those with vertigo be warned).  You can surf the internet right on your TV.  And you can play online multiplayer games for no additional cost.Cons:Now, I want to point out the issues that I have.  The aesthetics - even though your main home screen isn't exactly ugly, I don't feel like I was just warped into a game universe like I do when I turn on my Xbox.  the menus on the PS3 are bland and unexciting.  They are easy to use, but unexciting with their and 2D format. There is no \"wow\" factor there.Also, the PSN isn't anywhere near as socially friendly (that I can see) or interactive.  So, even though online gameplay is free it can be cumbersome.  There hasn't been an online game that I've tried on the PS3 yet that hasn't taken at least twice as long to log into the lobbies and the actual games themselves as the Xbox.The games seem to be glitchier on the PS3 than Xbox - e.x. Mass Effect 2:  I've played ME2 more times than I can recall off the top of my head on the Xbox and I decided to see if there were any differences between the Xbox version and the PS3 version.  I have noticed *some* differences.  For one, the PS3 version can get glitchy - almost as if you are playing online and you are starting to time out or your internet connection is dieing out.  The difficulty level on the PS3 also seems to be a bit more challenging (which is not necessarily a bad thing).To be honest, I haven't even enjoyed the games I have played on my PS3 enough to be motivated to finish them.Oh - and this is a big one for me - you can't just stick a game into your PS3 and start playing it. EVERY SINGLE GAME I have put into my PS3 has taken between 10 minutes and 4 hours to install game data onto your hard drive and then install that data onto your hard drive.  And then if there have been updates to the game since it was released, then there is another 5 or 10 minutes of downloading and then waiting before you can play your game.  With the Xbox, there are updates to the games, but I have never had to download and install game data directly from the game disc.  Unless there has been an update pushed out for that game, I've always just popped the game in and started playing...3 minutes or less every time.And, I won't really talk about the different controller too much because that is just a matter of opinion - I do prefer the Xbox controller because the PS3 controller gives me left thumb cramps.  But, that is probably just because I got accustomed to the Xbox controller first.  They do make Xbox-style controllers for the PS3 but the reviews I've read on those are very mixed.Bottom Line:  I bought myself a glorified BluRay player that has *potential* to be awesome, but has yet to \"wow\" me.The only reason I don't regret the purchase is because I am simply trying to decrease my overall long-term expenses with regard to gaming and free online play was one of a few things I am doing to do that.  Plus, I have a BluRay player.  If it wasn't for that financial fact or the the PS3's peripheral BluRay capability, I would not recommend this over an Xbox.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Craig B. \"Craig B.\"","summary":"Hope you don't have a bad Xbox","reviewText":"I like the game, good graphics, great voice acting/sound effects, good story.  My main problem with the game isn't really the game itself.  LONG STORY...I got my first Xbox for Christmas 2001, and always had \"dirty disk\" errors.  It finally got to a point that it stopped recognizing ALL disks, even CD's and DVD's.  Thankfully my brother got the extended warranty.  So, here I am with this newer one, and still have that problem.  It is compounded much more with this game just because of the way the game is played.  Just as I'm getting into it, it says \"dirty disk\".  And because the people at Microsoft didn't put a power or eject button on the remote, I have to keep getting up and restarting the Xbox.  Not really a big deal, just a big pain in the butt.  The biggest problem with this is that I have to get the game restarted again.  Then, I may have gone a ways since my last save point, and have to trudge through the same spot again.  I have a very hard time getting into the game because I feel like I spend more time restarting my Xbox.  After looking at Xbox message boards, I see that this is a known problem.  Not for this game specifically, but for the system itself (have a lot of the same problem with Halo and Morrowind).  It seems they deny this when someone calls customer support.  Like I said, it just makes it very hard to get into and want to continue playing it.  If you've had these \"dirty disk\" problems with your Xbox, you probably would want to stay away from this title.Another problem I have with it is the turn based fighting.  They could have made it a 3rd person shooter for the fighting, not that there is really THAT much of it.  It's hard to enjoy the fight sequences when you have so little control.  They went for something different, I'll give them that.  But, it just doesn't make the game flow smoothly.  This does seem to get better as you get further.  Not that the style changes, just don't seem to mind the style as much as when you first play the game.Also, there is just too much talking.  I get tired of listening to the people talk and just want to play.  The way they have it set up isn't the best.  They may show three options of things you can ask someone, but even if you don't ask them the other two things, your character asks anyway after the one question you picked.  Why even give a choice if you're going to ask all possible questions anyway?  It should just start talking and have the whole conversation right then and there.  That would help move the game along more quickly.With all this said, I still like the game, just wish I could play it.  Even with the other issues, I would probably LOVE this game if it wasn't for the \"dirty disk\" errors.  I find myself just looking at a blank screen because I don't feel like getting up AGAIN to restart the darn thing.Hope this helps...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00005Y4Q1","description":"Unreal II: The Awakeningreturns to the fascinating futuristic setting ofUnreal, first visited in 1998. Since then we've had to content ourselves with the excellentUnreal Tournamentmultiplayer combat series. For this first true sequel Epic Games hired Legend Entertainment, who made a name for themselves with theUnreal: Return to Na Paliexpansion pack and the woefully underratedWheel of Timegame (based on the books by Robert Jordan). The result is fun and frantic, if a bit too short-lived.Unreal II's best feature is its lush graphics engine. It's state of the art. All the locations, which range from bizarre alien worlds to those based on the filmAlien, exude dynamic realism. Human and alien characters are well-animated and rendered, but have a cartoonish exaggeration that clashes with the realism of the architecture. The designers were undoubtedly shooting for a comic-book look, which explains why the women look like blow-up dolls with bare midriffs and the men have hulking muscles. The monsters, too, ripple with strength and menace. This style will please some, but is less effective than the more realistic styles employed by similar titles--although at least the art direction is consistent throughout the game.Unrealcast you as a prisoner who--through both good and bad luck--was freed from confinement, but marooned on an alien world. He goes on to become a sort of messiah figure to the four-armed natives, while other, scarier, natives want to kill him. It ends with a cliffhanger that this game does nothing to resolve. Now, you play as a new character who works for the Terran Colonial Authority. You're a space marshal on the ship Atlantis. You and your buxom partner, who looks more like an exotic dancer than a police woman, have to solve problems in a game only tenuously connected with the originalUnreal.Core gameplay and mission design are good, but uninspired. Legend has taken a conservative, almost minimalist approach. They've made a solid shooter that takes full advantage of Epic's state-of-the-art graphics engine, but did nothing to set the shooter apart from the crowd.

{"product_name":"B00004TC6E","reviewerName":"Madisen","summary":"Bow down and offer your soul to this game...","reviewText":"I first played this game when I was 9. I liked it, but it was too confusing for my little-kid brain, and was confined to the closet, unfinished and unappreciated. Years later, I found a strategy guide for it in a store. Excited, I bought the guide, raided the closet, and booted up the game once more.Several late nights, several very early mornings, several well-spent afternoons, and several dozen hours later, I wanted to send the store owner flowers, a bottle of wine, and an all-expenses-paid trip to Hawaii, because I loved the game to death. A few months later, I actually played it through a second time, because it was just so wonderful.Yes, the graphics are below-par by today's standards, but the bright colors and lovely painted look can be seen as plain as day. It looks amazing. Watch, especially, for the breathtaking cinematics scenes. They aren't terribly frequent, but their detail is astounding.Even if the graphics were a drab, blurred mess, it would not matter, because this is the best game music you're going to hear. Ever. From the first village's tropical, happy-go-lucky soundtrack to the swelling, emotional score of the final scenes, the soundtrack will have you revisiting cleared areas just to have a listen. It is truly awe-inspiring.The story is hard to describe, as it's kind of confusing. There's some stuff about the space-time continuum, political conflict involving an evil cat-person, and then at the end there's a lot of pontificating about free will, and some stuff about Dinopolis and Reptillites. However, you'll always understand enough to know why you're doing what you're doing, and if you concentrate hard, it makes sense, and has an epic tone that makes you feel like the fate of the world is really in your hands. The overall story arc isn't all there is, either. What intrigues you is the smaller stories that weave into it. Rather than focusing on the main plot, I found myself drawn into things like Lady Riddel's tragic, dimension-spanning love, or the strange contradiction of the Dead Sea. And even though you may be confused at times, the story is told in a beautiful way.Besides, even if it may be a bit vague, the story gives you excuses to do amazing things. Fighting the ancient elemental dragons, exploring a once-great city frozen in time, and escaping from a cliffside mansion on dragon-back is all part of the picture. The abundance of jaw-dropping moments is great.Of course, combat must eventually come into an RPG, and this is a great combat system. Although it is done in the traditional, turn-based system, it's still incredibly fun. There are dozens of \"elements\" (special attacks) to collect, and trying them out is a blast. Each one has great animations to accompany it, too. In addition, all the characters have their own unique \"tech skills\". It's worth using every character in battle, just to see their techs.Speaking of the characters, there are tons of them. Getting them all to join your party is one of the highlights of the game. You never know when you'll find a new potential recruit. Living voodoo dolls, monster-taming bunny girls, and harlequins with French accents are all possible party members.So, in sum, this game is new, original, and like nothing you've ever played before. With a complex, amazing story, gorgeous environments, and gameplay that constantly excites and astounds, not to mention a soundtrack that turned already-emotional moments into tissue-box affairs, this is a contender for the greatest RPG ever.

He is the last of a noble and respected line. Raised in a series of safehouses by families loyal to his father's memory, Lucas will not rest until the Legion is rebuilt, and his family's honor is restored. Lucas has been taught the art of combat in the ancient and deadly style of the Legion. Lucas is a skilled swordsman, and a master of two combat stances. He can fight with a sword and shield, which allows him to attack quickly, deal heavy damage, and interrupt and stun single targets. When outnumbered, he wields a massive two-handed sword. While slower to swing and less practical for one-on-one combat, it can strike multiple foes and knock them back, making it an ideal weapon for crowd control.AnjaliAnjali is an archon - a legend, come to life. In the old stories, archons were spirits of fire, who served the long-lost creator gods. But Anjali was raised by friends of the Legion, and she does not know how she came to this world, or what happened to the others of her kind.Anjali can shift freely between her human form and an incarnation of elemental fire. In human form, she fights with a staff or a spear, allowing her to fend off multiple attackers while leaping in and out of the fray. In her fiery incarnation, she can hurl bolts of flame at ranged targets, flood areas with heat and fire, or inflict searing wounds that injure her foes over time.KatarinaKatarina is the daughter of a Legion commander and a Lescanzi witch. Her mother's people are nomads and wanderers, skilled in both warfare and magic, Katarina has been trained in their ways. At long range, she fights with ensorcelled bullets and deadly curses.

Katarina is mischievous and unpredictable, but she is also devoted to the Legion's cause...ReinhartReinhart descended from a great line of Legion mages, but he spent most of his life in Stonebridge, studying magic at the Collegium. As a scholar of arcane magic, Reinhart bends the forces of creation and destruction to his will. He can channel Dynamic magic through his gauntlet, shocking or stunning his foes. Or he can use Entropic magic to warp time and space, destroying large numbers of enemies from afar.

INCOMING SPORTS CAR!!","reviewText":"When EA released Burnout 3: Takedown, the game took the world by storm with its high-speed graphics, more advanced level of racing thanks to the addition of Takedowns and several new racing modes such as Road Rage and Crash Junctions.  So how do you take the game of the year from 2004 and make it better.  Ask EA because they did it with Burnout: Revenge.Burnout: Revenge is like Takedown on some serious steroids with a side of caffiene.  The game is ramped up several major notches to give it a feel that makes it more advanced and more fun than Takedown.  One of the biggest new additions to the game is called Traffic Checking, where you can take your car and literally plow through traffic that is going in the same direction as you are and send them flying into oncoming trafficor other racers causing a Takedown (and adding on to your Boost Meter).  This also helps in a new mode of racing know as Traffic Attack, where plowing through the traffic and using it as a weapon can earn you serious cash.The additional ranking system is based on how well you perform in the events of Revenge. Each race has a 4-star rating system that increases or decreases dependent on your race performance, so if you score an Awesome rating and get a gold medal in the event your rating will advance to Perfect (5 stars)but conversely if you get an Awesome but you finish with a bronze medal your rating will decreaseto 3 stars.New features include brand new Takedowns including the extremely tricky Vertical Takedown (your car goes airborne and lands on top of a rival car), a hot new collection of cars to collect (including a very special car that you get if you happen to have Madden 06 save data on your Memory Card), all cars are equipped with Crashbreakers and can now be detonated if you crash during a race for some serious payback, a revamped Eliminator race that causes the last place finisher to be destroyed every time the clock reaches zero, a new ranking system that is marked by the stars that you earn during the game, and more.This is the game that Gran Truismo WISHES it could be.  If you find yourself wanting to take out a little aggression due to that little bit of road rage that you hold within...then it's time to take out some serious Revenge!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2005"}

Sure-Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands is not perfect, but for the most part it's a very solid and fun play through.  If anything, the only real disappointment of the game is it's unremarkable last gen graphics.It's pretty safe to say a game is fun when a player starts the game all over again immediately upon its completion.  That was exactly the case for me with Prince of Persia: TFS.  I've even considered a third play through.  It's that fun and addictive.Make no bones about it, I'm a huge Prince of Persia fan.  \"The Sands of Time\" is still one of my all-time favorite games.  That particular entry was about the closest thing to perfection I've seen in a game and the two follow up games \"Warrior Within\" and \"The Two Thrones\" were for the most part great to play as well.  Then came the 2008 title \"Prince of Persia\" for Xbox 360 and PS3 which was beautiful to look at but unremarkable to play.\"Prince of Persia: The forgotten sands\" is a welcome return to the Prince's earlier roots and I enjoyed this one exponentially more than the last entry.  What I do miss from the last game however are the graphics.  In comparison to the 2008 Prince of Persia, TFS is a fairly large step backwards graphically.  This game looks as though it might have been perfectly at home on any of the last gen systems.  Outside of the cut scenes-the graphics are pretty mediocre and surprisingly bland for a series known to graphically wow the player with each outing.  And (as a side note) what's up with the ugly black glow around the Prince in certain areas?  \"Alan Wake\" had this same graphical weirdness.  I truly hope this isn't some new trend in video game graphics.  It looks really ugly and out of place and does not do the game's already so-so graphics any favors.One of The Forgotten Sands most notable characteristics is how \"player friendly\" the game is.  It's not overly difficult or frustrating (outside of a few sections with freezing and unfreezing water at the very end of the game) and combat is very straight forward and easy to understand.  Also-the game does a great job of letting you know where to go and what to do next.  It is also well paced-switching back and forth frequently between combat and platforming so neither mechanic gets too dull or repetitive.There are a few tradeoffs to this more player friendly prince however, and that comes in the form of less nuanced combat mechanics (combat has devolved somewhat into mere button mashing), easier puzzles and less challenging \"trap\" areas.  This is most definitely a more casual Prince experience than previous games-but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Sometimes it's great to just sit back, relax and play a great game that doesn't expect the world from you.That being said though, \"The Forgotten Sands\" is not at all shallow or forgettable-quite the opposite in fact.  New abilities like freezing water, revealing past areas, a cross chasm jump ability involving your enemies and upgradable elemental powers add a lot of freshness to the Prince franchise.  These new play mechanics go a long way to reviving the POP game play we're familiar with and add a whole new level of fun and technique.  The water freezing alone makes for some absolutely brilliant and completely original areas the likes of which no Prince of Persia has seen before.  Of course classic tried and true POP mechanics make their return as well including wall running, column hopping, time reversal and even a couple of mechanics introduced in the 2008  game.Prince of Persia The Forgotten Sands is perhaps not the most graphically finessed game it should be considering the gorgeous last installment, but it is definitely a return to the brilliant fun play of the last gen trilogy.  I'm eagerly awaiting the next prince installment where hopefully both the game play and the graphics are truly up to par with the current console generation.  Regardless though, this is still an absolute blast to play and should not be passed up under any circumstance.PS: One last thing I wanted to comment on is the length of the game.  Several people have griped that the game is too short.  True, the game is only about six or seven hours in duration, but that's not a bad thing.  Not everyone has 30 plus hours of free time on their hands to sink into a  video game.  The Forgotten Sands is a great experience for all seven of it's hours, so why does it matter how brief the game is?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2010"}

The storyline is more epic sounding and there are some challenging puzzles at times that require thinking and there's more nudity and gore than ever.

This is why.Cons-People will follow you and block you unintentionally in town, gets really annoying.-Magic spells take too long to execute. (Sometimes I would just prefer having mana and spells load quicker)-Annoying glitches, VERY annoying glitches (at least to me)Examples include:#1 - When your dog locates a 'dig spot' and you try following the dog to it, he stops and you have to run into him to sorta move him, and it still gets irritating, especially when you get to the spot, you start digging it up, and if enemies appear, you have to go through the hassle again which takes up more time.#2 - When you press the left trigger to get someone's attention, and when you try to leave/press the trigger again, the name and stats of the person still linger on the top of the screen. It gets really annoying since it takes up a lot of space on the top of your screen. To fix it it's usually best you have to save and quit and return to the game.#3 - The Westcliff Shooting Range game. When you shoot the targets in the head, sometimes it doesn't count as a headshot. It gets really annoying especially when you try to get the 175 points for 1st prize, and it's one of the most difficult/frustrating goals of the game since sometimes headshots only give you 1 point instead of 3, or they don't give you any at all.#4 - Not sure if this is really a 'glitch' or not, but for example, you're working at the Blacksmith making swords, and you have that little meter above you. The white dot has to hit the green, and when you tap the button, sometimes the dot delays and moves over some more, making you lost your streak of perfectly made swords... gets really irritating when you're going for the 5 star promotion.All that being said, if the glitches were corrected or not as annoying, I'd definitely give this game a 5 star rating. Still, grab it while you can.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"From Detroit","summary":"Maybe there was too much hype?","reviewText":"My friends bought Xboxes soley for this game.

Staying up late, building my fleets and running around the Carribean. What went wrong?The gameplay is almost identical to Pirates! released on the C64 years ago which was great for years ago, but if gamers wanted the exact same gameplay they would go play the old game. I think on a whole the biggest letdown was the expectation of a classic title coming back which would give people the same entertainment level, but in a new gameplay environment and in this it failed miserably.Some positives is the graphics have been updated slightly. The water moves better, the ships are more animated and umm that's about it. The game works out of the box..no patch required.The cons (where do i begin). I'll give a few highlights..First off, the cutscenes make we want to vomit. They look like they come out of a Disney film. Really cheesy and cartoony. I don't get the feeling of being a pirate, more like a Backstreet boy with a cutlass.Courting the Governer's daughter becomes something highly avoided. You can't just give her presents or obtain stature you have to play a Nintendolike mini-game to dance with her which is basically arrows flash and you have to hit the correct arrow key to move with her or you both stumble and she gets pissed and hates you.

If the Retro Studios staff were here, how could I possibly express what is in my heart? The Metroid series and it's awesome hero, Samus Aran, have been a huge part of my life ever since I selected the first of three empty save slots in Metroid Prime nearly 8 years ago.Since then, I have mastered every single game in the series. (Pinball doesn't count.) Not only am I an expert and battle hardened veteran of the games, but also I have created (or tried to create) numerous fanfics, some of which were or are novelizations of the games, and my genius cousin and I have even come up with our own nonexistent fan game.But the question, the question you want to know is, why? How and why do I love it so much? What made me love it so? This is the story of how I discovered the greatest series of all time, and how it appealed to me. I take up my keybo... er, pen to tell you the tale.It's hard for me to remember a time before Metroid.My life was different then. I lived in PA. It was a time of great discovery and learning. I had just gotten a GCN the previous Christmas of 2003. I had been reared on such games as the Megaman Legends 2, Mechwarrior 4, and the original Medal of Honor. All of the previous generation.I didn't even know what Metroid was. When Prime and Fusion came out in the store, I had thought it was some cheesy spin off of Halo or something. I had played the demo of Metroid Prime in stores, (and had thought it cool that you could turn into a ball,) but I couldn't even get past the second force field. Wow... boy, did I suck. (Although I guess Retro was partly to blame for not having the game tell you to switch to the Scan Visor in the demo.) It was, I now realize, a clear indication of how primitive I was then. Of how much I sucked at gaming in general.Later, I had watched a kid from my church play the game, upon which I found that it was part of a series that featured a female character named Samus Aran in armor, and a creature called a Metroid. But when I watched it, somehow it didn't look like much. I don't know why, but it was as if I was blind to its beauty. Maybe the TV sucked, I don't know. But that would soon change.It all started back in 2004, when I subscribed to Nintendo Power. The first two issues I got featured articles about Metroid Zero Mission, the remake of the NES Metroid. From it I learned little bits about a planet called Zebes (pronounced ZEEBS, NOT ZEBEZ YOU FRIGGIN' IDIOTS) and a race called the Chozo, but I still didn't think much of it. I was just excited to have subscribed to NP. Little did I know that it would ultimately launch me into a realm unlike anything I'd ever seen or experienced.It started in early September of 2004, with the October issue of Nintendo Power. (NP issues arrive the month before, so technically the October issue is really the September issue, etc.) The cover story was all about Pokemon Firered and Leafgreen for GBA. The cover featured a picture of Charizard of Firered, and Venusaur of Leafgreen. But that's not important. What is important is that above the title, there was the picture of Samus with the words, \"Prime 2-exclusive info!\" I read the preview. It was unbelievable. It left me craving for more. The more I read that preview the more I thought, \"This is freakin' awesome!\"As time went on, more info appeared in later issues of Nintendo Power. I became more and more fascinated as a result. I could tell this was a continuation of an epic story that really began in the first game, so I didn't want to get second the second one until I'd played and beaten the first. Besides, NP said that although it wasn't necessary to play the first game, if you did, you'd appreciate it that much more. Another thing that motivated me was the fact that my cousin got Metroid Prime. He described it to me, and it sounded so awesome.However, I was hesitant. Many times before I had saved up my money to get something that turned out to be total crap and I wanted to never make that mistake again. I had 20 bucks saved up, and I did not want them to go down the tubes the way my other money had. So it ended up where I was deciding between Metroid Prime and another game. It was a difficult choice for me, because despite the lure of NP and my cousin's description of the prologue, I really did not know what to expect, and even something that looked this good could so easily be another waste of 20 bucks. The other game, on the other hand, I knew I would enjoy, and would not be a waste of money at all.I cannot begin to describe to you how close I came to getting the other game. But finally, in I think it was November of 2004, (apparently it took me far shorter to beat the game than I'd always thought) I decided to take a blind leap in the dark and buy Prime, even though I knew it might be just another one of the biggest mistakes I'd ever made.As soon as I opened the instruction booklet, I became intrigued. The manual told of an epic storyline involving the Chozo, the Space Pirates, and something called Phazon. It also gave me hints of a wicked arsenal and other cool stuff.But even then I had no idea what was in store.Although the manual looked promising, I still did not know for certain what the game would have in store for me. Even though it seemed a good game, there was a good chance it would be too hard for me. (And it would've been if I wasn't already battle-hardened by Megaman Legends 2, which had a lock-on orbiting system identical to the one in Prime, only in third person, not first-person.) One way or another, 11/??/04 would be a day I would never forget.I set the disk in the Cube's drive and turned it on. After seeing the title screen and selecting the first of three save slots, I was greeted with the words, \"Unidentified distress beacon has been tracked to a derelict space vessel in orbit above Tallon IV.\"What happened next, I have tried to describe below, though words cannot do this experience justice.The skyline of space with the streak of yellow. The Pirate ship in orbit. And the planet of Tallon IV in the background. The music that played when Samus landed her ship in the docking bay. (It would not be until two years later that I would discover it was a remix of music from Super Metroid.) I thrilled when I saw Samus jump fifty feet in the air and do a flip before landing on the ground. Then the camera zoomed in behind Samus's back and suddenly I was behind the visor.After getting past the force fields, I approached the door to the adjacent hallway. After shooting open the door, I scanned the stuff on the wall and proceeded to the air lock. After repressurizing it, I moved on to the emergency evacuation area.When I entered, metal fell from the ceiling and I stared out at the chaotic scene before me. A large creature was lying on the floor dead (I later identified it as a Parasite Queen) with fires burning all around it. Dead Pirates were all over the floor, their death descriptions exactly as my cousin had described them. After scanning everything in sight, I moved on to the Map Station. After downloading the map, I scanned the computers and took the lift down to deck beta.I then found myself in Biotech Research Area 1. From what I could scan so far, it seemed that two Parasite Queens had broken out of their stasis tanks and gone on a rampage. One was obviously the one that was dead, but what about the other one? I soon found out.After scanning interesting things all throughout the ship and saving at the nearby Save Station, I stepped into the Reactor Core. As I moved forward, a cutscene ensued in which I saw Samus descend the lift platform. A huge creature climbed inside the rector and activated a force field. Now I had to fight the second Parasite Queen.Unfortunately, I forgot to scan it, and it killed me. The second time I did scan it, revealing it's weak spot. Within two minutes, I send the large crustacean packing.Now the reactor was going critical. I had seven minutes to get out of there before the whole thing blew up! After taking a shortcut thru the ventilation shafts, I found Meta Ridley. After seeing him flee like the coward he was, I grappled across the gap and activated the elevator to Deck Alpha. Unfortunately, several pieces of metal slammed me against a wall, and the Varia Suit and all of my upgrades were destroyed!This came as no surprise to me since the friend who I had watch play the game told me about that part. Unfortunately, I wasn't exactly prepared for it either. After getting the heck out of that ship, (barely) I saw Ridley fly away. I hopped into my ship via cutscene and we descended towards the planet of Tallon IV.Tracking on enemy target has been lost. Ground-based recon required. Begin landing sequence.And the rest is history. I've been a proud owner of every game to hit store shelves since, and I even found an ancient rusty, moldy M2ROS cartridge in a store on vacation. Super I have on an emulator, (way better than VC, esp. with cool filters, recorders, cheats, etc.) and the NES Metroid I usually play on Prime, though I do have it on the VC, Zero Mission, and the Classic NES Series GBA cartridge as well. Zero Mission did an awesome job of remaking that game, and I LOVE Other M! It was just the cup of tea true fans had been waiting for. (SamusxAdam FOREVER!!!!!!!!!) Hunters multiplayer was awesome, I'd love to see more of that (Echoes multiplayer sucked with no bots and all), the singleplayer was good but sorely lacking in many quarters. (Killer pistons + chasm deaths + no Mocktroids + getting hurt by your own weapons = EPIC FAIL lol.) It`s just a shame the franchise is dead after the miserably poor sales of Other M, but at least we have AM2R to look forward to. In short, I am and will always be a Metroid fan. What began as a 3-page teaser in a magazine has become an epic saga, a burning passion, and an Empire of Dreams!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2012"}

The surround sound in this game also works well both in creating a scary environment and assisting in gameplay. You'll be able to pinpoint exactly where your enemies are if they're making noise and sometimes you'll just hear them whispering around a dark corner. This is the kind of game where you'll see something scurrying in the corner of your eye and just as you turn to shine your flashlight on it, it'll be gone.As your character, you'll be using forensic equipment to solve the strange case that you are in the middle of. It truly is a disturbing and violent game as you will find out soon enough. You'll have a gun to start with but more often than not you'll be using whatever you can find in your surroundings to defeat your attackers. Beating someone to death with something like a gas pipe or a 2x4 with nails sticking out of the end is the order of the day here, as well as ending things off with a neck snap or a crushing headbutt to deliver the final blow.The game can get a little tedious sometimes since the character movement is a little slow and the environments in some areas are slightly repetitive.

{"product_name":"B000IMYKQ0","description":"The Wii Nunchuk controller is a secondary controller that adds even more innovation to the next generation of gaming, and does it all with less physical movement.Used in conjunction with the standard Wii remote, certain games need the Nunchuk controller for additional control options. Contoured perfectly to fit a player's hand,The Wii Nunchuk (left) connects directly to the Wii remote.View larger.the Nunchuk controller builds on the simplicity of the Wii Remote controller. The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance. Just be careful not to knock out your significant other, or bruise the dog, severely, while using one, or two Nunchuk controllers.","reviewerName":"Potomac Hokie","summary":"Fun!","reviewText":"We bought this to go with our other remotes.

{"product_name":"B001NX6GBK","reviewerName":"The Bigmac","summary":"4 Stars. An almost perfect masterpiece.","reviewText":"I am a huge fan of history and this game was a delight for me to play. Many people don't know this but our concept of hell in the western civilization was originally conceived by the  mind of an Italian genius in the 14th century, poet Dante Aligeri in \"Inferno\" (hence the name of the game) which is the first part of his opus \"The Divine Comedy\" (So it's safe to say, expect EA to come up with the other 2 parts, Purgatory and Paradise in the next couple of years). And after 7 centuries, visceral games brought Dante Aligeri's concept of hell to life in a mind blowing way.Visuals and Presentation:From the triple A graphics and eye candy - incredibly looking cut scenes (the game is visually gorgeous) to the almost alive walls made of bodies crying in agony to the incredible work they did with the animation, this game in simply a work of art.Gameplay:It's been accused of being a GOW clone (and it clearly is). However you are presented with the very original option of being able to decide the fate of the damned - you can either absolve them with your cross or damn them with your scythe. The gameplay is quick and fun, and using the cross attacks was definitely my favorite part. The animation when you use it is simply spectacular and feels amazing.Sound:If you have a 7.1 system like I do hooked up to your PS3 via HDMI you will be treated to a feast for your ears while playing this game. The voice-work performances and sound effects were also stellar.Conclusion:Minor quirks aside (some annoying menus and a couple of frustrating puzzle sections) For a history buff like me, playing this game was an absolute blast and if you decide to give it a try, you will be treated to an art masterpiece in the form of a videogame like you've never seen before.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000BGPGU2","description":"","reviewerName":"F0X H0UND","summary":"Its huge, its in depth, and its not for everyone.","reviewText":"The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion takes place in a fantasy realm called Cyrodil... or Tamriel, I don't remember. Anyway it is under the rule of the Emporer Uriel Septim. When assassins from a cult known as the Mythic Dawn attack & killl Uriel, along with his direct heirs, the empire begins to fall into chaos - especially when the \"Oblivion Gates\" open and horrbile beasts begin to storm the land (these gates can also be considered gates to hell). Anyway, its up to your character to restore order to Cyrodil by finding Uriel's unknown son, crowning him king, and closing the Oblivion gates.This game is by all means huge. You can literally interact with practically everything. This means you can harvest plants, throw plates, steal potatoes, swim, open treasure chests, sit down on benches, sleep in beds, repair your armor, move & search dead corpses, ride horses, cure diseases, read books, mix & name potions, etc. Furthermore, the \"create a character\" system is extremley in depth - you can customize the hair & eye color, skin tone, hair style, nose size & width, how bald you are, the race you want to be, and much more. In addition, the map is even huge filled with random dungeons, fortresses, mountains, cities, rebel encampments, forests, caves, mines, open plains, oblivion gates... all for the adventureous to explore. But since the map is so big I highly doubt you'll find everything, though you do have a compass at the bottom of your screen which helps a little.Like every other RPG, you have to level up and to explain the leveling system is a bit complicated so bare with me. Depending on what you prefer as a weapon you go up in that sort of weapon style (ie: if you use swords, then your \"blade\" level goes up, if you prefer axes then your \"blunt\" level goes up.) You can raise your \"sneak\" level so you can pickpocket and go undetected, you can raise up your skills in lockpicking, blocking, heavy/light armor so you can carry more stuff, etc. Basically, if you can do it in the game, you can level it up and be better at it - easiest way to explain it.Also, you can join different guilds and arenas to gain money, experience points (so you can level up) , common & rare equipment, side quests, and those lame X-Box 360 achievment things.Oh, speaking of side quests do not think you will have this game completley beat in a matter of 3-6 hours like I did. There are MILLIONS of side quests... MILLIONS!!!! In every city there are atleast 25-30 side quests which involve having you go practically all over Cyrodil to find different things & people until the quest can be completed, but most of the time you have a choice of whether (for instance) to kill or not kill a character, which completley changes the outcome of the side quest. Meaning, you have two different paths to take. The main quest alone is really long, so I say this game is probably way more then 100 hours long.Lets talk flaws: first of all the game is (in my opinion) way too long for its own good. Secondly, being evil does not pay - no matter what you do, be it lifting a plate in a house or killing someone a billion miles away - you can get arrested no matter where you go. Third, I get a good laugh at how a goblin as skinny as twig can block a powerful swing of a mace and send me stumbling back. Finally, the load times are RIDICULOUSLY long.... I could a make & eat a sandwhich, go to work and push through a 8 hour shift, come home and catch a nap, and come back and it will STILL be loading. Also, it amazes me how some of the Daedra enemies have a striking resemblance to Darth Maul from Star Wars.. one more thing about the loading: one minute you can be running in an open field, then all of a sudden trees and rocks and what not begin to just blip onto the screen.. lame.The fighting in this game is somewhat lackluster, though its a big step up from Elder Scrolls: Morrowind. You can slash/swing sideways, up, down, block with your weapon or shield, shoot arrows (with a pretty decent aiming system by the way), and more. However, if you're playing on more difficult levels and you get attacked by more then two enemies at a time your basically screwed. You do get a LOT of weapons & armors, both magical & normal, all with different stats so thats cool.The graphics in this game are amazing, that much I can say. Everything just has so much detail and looks really good. You can see flowers & grass swaying in the wind, trees changing from one season to the next, the sky growing red & hateful as you near an Oblivion gate, people's jaws moving when they talk, etc. The cities are massive, and some parts of the scenery are absolutley breathtaking. However, some times there are contrasting colors that make things hard to see - for instance, an Elve's skin is so bright and the room is dark that it looks like his face is made out of just polished gold.The music is soothing, but it becomes really repetitve & just annoying after awhile. There are maybe three music tracks - a calm one, an action one, and a town one.. thats it. The sound effects are pretty right on for the most part, the swords & what not deliver a satisfying sound when connected with an enemy & monsters growls are excellent. However, I get a laugh when you throw a shield onto the floor and it sounds like a pin hitting the floor or when you throw a strawberry and it sounds like your slamming a rock against a wall. The voice acting is pretty good too.Thanks to X-Box Live you can download content for this game such as armor for your horse, new areas & new weapons. But... I don't have any points, so I didn't bother.In the collectors edition it comes with a 200 page book of the history of Cyrodil/Tamriel, a \"making of Oblivion\" DVD, and finally an actual Tamriel replicated coin.To finish this review, this game is great as a buy if you have no life, enjoy really big RPGs, or no games that interest you and you want something to take up a lot of time. But for guys like me, it serves as nothing more then a few days of rental gameplay....yeah it has a pretty good & engaging story, great graphics, and a decent fighting system, but its just too damned big for everyone to enjoy & hold their attention.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2006"}

{"product_name":"B004NRN5DU","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"Chutzpuh \"The last PC gamer\"","summary":"Best thing to hit the 360","reviewText":"I own and have played the heck out of Demon's Souls (the spiritual prequal to this game) for a while now.  While Demon's Souls was PS3 only, it is great to see that people can get the same level of frustration and joy on the 360 now.Basically, this is an action RPG game.  What sets it apart from the rest of the others is the punishing difficulty and playstyle.  Death, in most games, simply means you reload a save, restart a checkpoint, or just retry the area.  In Dark Souls, death means the loss of all unspent experience\\money, the respawning of all enemies and it usually means that you have to repeat a large section.This is true even for major boss fights.  When you die, and you will, you don't just restart the fight, you restart everything since the last bonfire you rested at.The gameplay is nothing too different than what you would expect.  You find spells, weapons and armor throughout the game.  If you meet the necessary requirements, you even create and find some very new ones.  Killing enemies builds up your collection of \"Souls\" which are used as currency as well as experience you use to strengthen your character.  The real trick of the game here is that many enemies can kill you in one shot (even after you level everything) and understanding the leveling system for your equipment requires something close to a 6 week course.  Monster Hunter fans will feel at home here.The game is long, even if you are a master and you manage to avoid death.  I have done decent for myself and am still looking at something near a 20 to 25 hour playthrough.  Hint: using many of the online wiki's will help you out greatly.  I have heard of people getting stuck for hours on one area alone.  In short, your time vs money ratio on this one is better than anything you can find most days.The multiplayer on the game is something impressive as well.  While there is little choice on who you play with, and no chat of any kind, it is immersive and interesting.  Many Covenants (societies or gangs if you prefer) you join in the game are geared toward multiplayer.  While some will allow you to be summoned into other peoples game worlds to help them, others bring you in to cause pain.  Some even let you send creatures into several worlds at a time, or bring many people together into one place against a common enemy.  I am not usually a big multiplayer guy, but this game does an amazing job with it.The only issues I have found so far with the game (thus the loss of a star) are some frame rate issues.  At very nasty times, framerates will drop.  Usually this happens while you are surrounded by enemies, or trying to make some very carefully planned motions.  The first game had this issue as well, so I can't tell if it is due to a bad job in porting of just the game itself.  Also, there are a large number of people editing their save files on the 360 versions of the game.  People may be running around with super weapons and completely immortal characters.  The leaderboards do a decent job of finding which ones, but that doesn't help when you are invaded by a death machine.Much of my play has been offline so far.  After hitting a section of the game where other people are summoned to fight you, I ended up going against a character who simply wouldn't die.  It also seemed that this character was far better equipped that I would expect for the level we were.All in all, this is an amazing game.  It gives people without 360's a chance to experience a deeply involved, difficult game which hasn't really been seen this console generation.  If you are looking for yet another shooter clone, well this isn't what you want.  If you are looking for something different that honestly challenges you, look no further.  After all, when a game doesn't have a pause button, you know it is hard core.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2011"}

Don't even think about buying this game unless you want to spend an entire evening maybe completing one area.Normally, I'm a spaz in games. I like to blast my way through and have a great time, only occasionally slowing down to breathe. This game has taught me a completely different way to enjoy a video game. It taught me to be scared of what's around the corner. It taught me to stop and survey my surroundings for traps, hidden monsters, and potential power ups. It's straight up a completely different play experience than anything else out there.If you have an open mind and are willing to radically change your play style, I'd say pick this up. If you're going to try to shoehorn your play style into this game, it won't work. The game will win, you'll feel cheated, and you'll tell everyone you know that the game is garbage when IT is not the problem in that situation.Graphics: Dark. Menacing. Hauntingly beautiful. The character models and textures are well done. The bosses are the amazing set pieces that are fun to work towards. Well, fun to work towards and then freak out about, anyway.Gameplay: Exacting. I've never had to use the block button so much in my life, but, learn to love it. The controls are fairly tight but not absolutely perfect. There were some platforming elements that were completely unnecessary in parts (getting arrows shot at me while trying to balance on a beam?

That's frustrating but it's in line with the game world so I can't really ding the score for it. You could have random people assist you on boss fights, but, those random people could also kill you for no good reason.

I played the first one, and I just was never much of a fan of the Infamous franchise.  Well, this game was so talked up and the reviews were so good that I decided to give it a whirl.  $60 is not a small amount of money, so I definitely hoped that I did not regret my purchase on this one.  Let me say &#8211; it is worth every penny so far.  First of all &#8211; the graphics on the PS4 for this game are amazing.  It does an awesome job of showcasing the potential of the PS4.  The sights of Seattle are totally breathtaking and the amount of detail shown in the characters&#8217; faces is unreal.  Also, this is one of the few games that really utilizes the new features of the DualShock 4 controller.  The touchpad and the speaker are both used in very cool ways for this game.  The gameplay is also very fun.  I think it&#8217;s a bit challenging, but not so hard that you will want to throw your controller across the room and give up.  I like that there is a specific storyline, but that there is also this open world that you can explore as well as tons of side missions.  I find myself wanting to play so that I can complete every single part of this game.  I have probably already put around 8-10 hours into it and I feel like I have barely scratched the surface - talk about getting your money&#8217;s worth!

But there is still one among the citizenry who is determined to exorcise the evil that has robbed the town of its former glory. He has pledged to both take back the streets from the gangs, as well as dole out equal justice of his own design upon the white-collar criminals who continue to bleed the city dry. He is vice cop Jack Slate. Betrayed and hunted by the organization he once served, he wages war on a daily basis, armed only with a gun, his bare hands and his intimidating canine, Shadow. Together the two of them make their way through the underbelly of the city, only to uncover a shocking conspiracy that threatens to shake the world to its core.","reviewerName":"Tim Janson","summary":"FEELS LIKE A PLAYSTATION 2 GAME","reviewText":"Dead to Rights, which made its debut in 2002, is back with a new entry in the series, Dead to Rights: Retribution.  While eight years isn't a long time in the general scheme of things, its eons in video game time but unfortunately the third person shooter/fighter doesn't show a great deal of progress.Once again you play as Grant City rogue cop Jack Slate who is accompanied by his faithful killer canine Shadow.  You are dropped into what seems to be the middle of a story as an injured Jack is being hunted by a gang of thugs in an industrial plant.  His only hope is to use Shadow to quickly dispatch the gang before they can pick them off.  Now, its great to jump right into a game but you feel like you're watching the third chapter of a DVD and wondering what happened.  Zero back-story in the game or the manual and don't expect things to get much clearer from there.After this initial prologue Jack is off to a high rise that has been taken over by the Union Gang who is holding numerous hostages on the 15th and 97th floors.  Again there's very little story buildup other than Jack has a run-in with his commanding officer and disobeys his order to enter the building to try and save the hostages.  Eventually Jack will discover that the Grant Police Department is rife with corruption but plot is definitely not one of the game's strong suits.On the other hand, its greatest weakness is also its greatest strength.  You're not required to think a whole lot, just kick ass and take names later.  Outdated thought it may be, DTR's melee system is simple and fun.  In hand-to-hand, Jack can pull off numerous bone-crunching combos.  When your opponent is vulnerable, you'll be prompted to hit the \"X\" button to pull off a finishing move that has Jack cracking limbs, necks, or backs, or smashing his opponents head into the ground...archaic but effective.  Jack can quickly disarm his opponents and use their weapons against him firing from the hip or using the targeting button for more precise firing.  Defeating enemies raises Jacks \"focus\" level.  Focus allows you to put the action into slow motion so Jack can easily target the enemies for clean head shots.As you will find yourself often up against multiple enemies firing on you at once, Jack can use his stealth abilities to take cover behind walls, furniture, poles, etc to more easily trying to pick off the bad guys while keeping himself relatively safe.  This also leads to one of the game's downfalls in that when you're surrounded by enemies, especially in hand-to-hand combat, the frame rate really drags and you feel like you're playing a PS2 or even a PS1 game.  The finishing moves and the slow-motion ability draw heavily on older games like Mortal Kombat and Max Payne which further adds to the dated feel of Dead to Rights: Retribution.You able to utilize Shadow in a couple of different ways.  You can essentially become the dog to take out enemies or go on reconnaissance missions.  Shadow can sense heartbeats of nearby foes.  It's particularly fun to rip out a guy's throat and drag the body away to hide it.  Jack can also remotely control Shadow to attack enemies in places he cannot reach, find ammo, etc...Shadow is even better at performing stealthy kills which is a must when you're trying to keep a low profile and save hostages.The voice acting is nothing special but it doesn't detract from the action.  The characters are all two-dimensional and there isn't much depth but for the style of game it works well enough.  The graphics feature some excellent effects in terms of explosions and kills.  The Elevator crashing to the ground inside the high rise was also cool.  But the enemies are all cookie cutter, offering little variety as you defeat the same looking guys over and over.Dead To Rights: Retribution offers a light, button-mashing diversion that you can jump right into but it feels like a game that is about six years too late.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2010"}

I had numerous NES, N64, and Sega Genesis games that I always played. Anyway, I am currently 21 years old and have had a hard time enjoying a lot of the newest video games of today because I personally enjoy the old school feel of video games, vs. today's more modern games. My boyfriend got this game for me as a Christmas gift and I am so happy he did because it is a ton of fun!! It brings back memories from when I sat on my NES all day long or Sega Genesis or N64. It really does give you that \"old school video game\" feel as you play it, while still keeping excellent graphics and scenes and game controls as you play your way through the levels. This game absolutely amazes me with the scenery in it from oceans to jungles to forests, etc. The game play is excellent. I love shaking the wii remote and nunchuck (or the wii remote alone if you prefer to play with just the wii remote) to do the ground pound to unlock secret items or areas in the game. I also really enjoy this on one player when you have the ability to use Diddy kong on your back as a jet pack. 2 player is also fun because you play as Donkey Kong, while your partner plays as Diddy Kong. Your partner can either run through the level with you or jump on your back from time to time, which allows you to use the jet pack for more precise jumps.I will admit, I have never played any of the older Donkey Kong games, so I unfortunately can not compare. However, as an old school video game lover who has never played a single Donkey Kong game in the past before this one, I absolutely LOVE this game and regret the fact that I didn't play any others like it in the past. This game does make me want to go backwards though by playing some of the older Donkey Kong games.All in all, I highly recommend this game.

I personally LOVED the game, from start to finish, and the little mini-games (after getting a hang of them - the publishers shouldn't have blended everything in so well because, at times, it's hard to see what you're supposed to press at that exact moment).  The cutscenes were gorgeous and provided an entertaining, albeit over-the-top performance that I'd expected from an anime style title.  The action is terrific, but some aspects - particularly playing as Yasha - got to be a bit tiresome after a few levels simply because Yasha lacks the power that Asura possesses, so it was more dodge-hit-dodge than pummel.

I'm currently a master league player in 1v1, 2v2 3v3, and 4v4 in Starcraft 2 along with having beaten the campaign on brutal.Pros and Cons(+) Pros:- Excellent quality game, great graphics and sound effects.- Solid storyline for the most part, despite some very cheesy moments and dialogue.- Game runs well on almost any half decent machine.- Smooth gameplay.- Very addictive multiplayer.- Game is more forgiving to newcomers when compared to Starcraft 1 or Warcraft 3. Different level leagues help players match up against people their skill level.(-) Cons:- Game is easier for newcomers, but it's still a highly competitive game. Don't expect to be in the master or diamond leagues if you're new to the game any time soon.- Only Terran campaign available, obviously they want you to buy the next 2 games ($$$$).- No LAN support.- Bnet has its problems, interface is laggy at times and not always easy to use.- Multiplayer games can get very repetitive because most people use cookie cutter strategies.- Gameplay is VERY similar to Starcraft I, very few changes.Summary: Don't believe the haters, Starcraft 2 is a fantastic game, BUT, it's not as groundbreaking as Starcraft 1. When Starcraft 1 was first released, a lot of its features were brand new and very appealing. Starcraft 2 is very well refined but little has changed fundamentally.You don't have much freedom at higher levels of ladder/league play. You usually have to stick to the main 2-3 cookie cutter strategies or risk getting completely trampled because the game is very specifically balanced. This is great for E-sports, but bad for the general fanbase due to the lack of freedom. Expect multiplayer games to get very repetitive after some time. Playing with friends, custom games, and different leagues help make up for this to a certain extent.The game will probably live on as an E-sport for quite some time (which is what blizzard wanted). The game should keep you hooked long enough until the expansions come out which should be good, knowing Blizzard's history.I respect Blizzard for doing the game well, but they played it TOO SAFE. A few new features would've gone a long way.Rating: 9/10. A must have if you're into RTS, but don't expect a game as earth shattering as the first, rather expect a very well refined and technically proficient game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2011"}

I would play it with friends via LAN and Battle.net almost daily and the amount and challenging game play made it last for hours. So when I heard that Starcraft 2 was going to be released, I was of course super excited.Lets start off by giving Blizzard some credit on the campaign. I really like what they have done with the campaign in Starcraft 2. Giving you more of a story that you play along to, rather then the old campaign mode of just base building and destroying Zerg or Protoss because they are on some planet. The new campaign mode is challenging and also allows you to choose your own path. Although this isn't the complete game, just the Terran story. The expansions are rumored to come out in the future and tell the story through the eyes of the Zerg and Protoss.Now onto the actual multiplayer. I was one of the many BETA testers that tried out the game months prior to the release. Through the BETA forums we would always complain about the lack of balance between the races and since Blizzard has launched Starcraft 2, we have seen at least 6 updates fixing the units and such. I recall Starcraft being almost perfect with the balancing.The Use Map Settings games on Starcraft 2 are not the same as they use to be. The games are not that fun and it seems like the old map makers from Starcraft have given up their gaming days and found something else to do. When looking at the actual map creator, it takes a lot of time to figure out how to actually create your own map.No lan support...enough said.Overall, I play this maybe once a week but just get bored from the lack of variety.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2010"}

{"product_name":"B007TYC8MI","description":"","reviewerName":"Private Quentin Tarantino Fan","summary":"An Excellent Send Up For Kratos on the PS3 (4.5/5)","reviewText":"God of War has always been one of my all time favorite gaming experiences for two generations, and we have one more huge adventure upon us before the 7th generation closes.  God of War 3 was one of the best games on PS3, with a scale unprecedented and a well realized sense of epic (hopefully you know I mean that in the dignified sense) storytelling.  Not to mention one of the all time best game play models in the action genre.  Ascension follow in the first PS3 entree's footsteps, and it's a fitting coda for Kratos on the PS3.  At the end of the day, Ascension is simply another great game that sheds even more light on Kratos and his long journey throughout the series.  That's pretty much what I wanted from this release.  If you are a God of War fan, you'll want to pick up the next chapter in Krato's saga.Story wise, Ascension is the first game chronology.  What's new this time around is Ascension's attempt to give Kratos a much more human side, instead of the downright off-putting, and downright scary at times, Kratos of the later series that most certainly polarizes people (and one that certainly causes debate amongst gamers, but I'll refrain from ranting regarding that notion.  Indeed, Ascension is pretty much marked by Kratos as he was during the early days of service to Ares and the others, and Kratos is certainly more of a mortal than a man; you can just tell he is at this particular state.  This time around, The Furies are to blame for his troubles, and, as you might expect, Kratos is on another journey to track them down.  I won't spoil the story, but what follows is what you would expect from a God of War game, with a more human Kratos being the point of the story.  He suffers, suffers, and suffers some more.  It's a really interesting thing to see, and it's easily the most well rounded and sympathetic portrayal of Kratos, one we haven't seen since the first game.Despite all of this new chance for character development, God of War, for better or for worse, follows the same classic story formula.  The ultra-violence, the Mount Everest sense of scale, the overblown, larger than life dramatic tone, the appropriately bombastic score; it's all here.  The performances in God of War are A-grade World of Ham, and dialogue is as over the top as usual, but God of War simply wouldn't be God of War without that.  It takes a certain sort of taste to enjoy God of War's brand of storytelling, and if you hate the series, Ascension probably won't change your mind.  Personally, I've always felt that the series benefits from never holding anything back.  It's because of this reason why the God of War series is such an entertaining ride, why the series is arguably, in the end, so memorable.  Once again, if you don't like God of War, this probably won't change your mind, but fans of the series will be utterly pleased with the single player this time around.There have been a few people out there who think Ascension's story doesn't have some of the memorability of the previous main games, and its pacing to be rather spotty.  While these people are no doubt entitled to their own personal views, I have to disagree.  I found the pacing of the campaign for me to be excellent, and there were plenty of awesome moments from start to finish.  Aside from a couple of difficulty spikes, I really didn't find myself pressing myself to go on due to pacing issues.  I rather enjoyed the somewhat subdued sections in the beginning, as it definitely had a much more relaxing pace that I rather enjoyed.  Besides, I never found myself bored, whether it was traversing an Ice mountain, roaming my way through ancient Greek Cities, and plenty more.  So I personally had no problem with the campaign at all.Game play wise, Ascension keeps the same basic formula that defines the series.  As someone who's been playing the series since the beginning, I had absolutely no problem jumping in.  Using an arsenal of weapons and powers, Kratos will, as always, battle through hordes of soldiers, the undead, mythical beasts, and just about everything else that happens to get in his way.  The same God of War game play interventions remain as well, including puzzles (including some that revolve around time manipulation) and platform sections.  As usual, you collect orbs to replenish your character, as well as items that improve your overall character maximums.  Combat is fluid as ever, and as rooted in the God of War series as you would expect.  If you're into the series and understand the core combat concepts, there is little to nothing else that can be said here.  Once you get your hands on the controller and start playing as Kratos, you'll be slinging combos together in no time.Much like the other games in the series, there are some new things the games do that are different from previous games before it.  Tweaked moves such as the new chain tethering move make for some welcome additions to the combat.  One thing that particularly stood out was the inclusion of a new game plus, which lets you start the game over with the weapons and magic you unlocked in a previous game.  However,  the best addition for m was the implementation of new power and weapons.  Once again, you get the chance to develop and unlock new moves, but there are also enemy weapons strewn out amongst the adventure.  You can pick them up after they are dropped from enemies, and you have the chance to use weapons such as Spears, Javelins, and Swords.  It makes combat all the more exciting, knowing that they're might just be another interesting weapon to use right around the corner.You still have the Blades of Chaos at all times, along with supplementary weapons, dropped from certain characters.  I particularly found the Blades of Chaos system to be the best it has ever been in the series.  You still certainly will be using them with the same familiarity that you do in every other game, being able to use them to perform devastating .  In this game, however, the Blades of Chaos now house elemental magic.  The magic at hand can be used in various ways to enhance combat, and they all feel useful; being able to an addition of magic in the heat of battle works wonders for you as a player.  Each of the elements contain awesome powers, such as The Fires of Ares (which let's you stun enemies with fire) and The Lighting Of Zeus (which let's you electrify enemies with electricity).  Finally, while minor, I found it to be useful to use one of the acquirable items (Oath Stone of Orkos) in battle, although I wouldn't use it all the time.Despite all of the satisfaction the single player game has given me, there are some slight misgivings with the game.  For one, sound occasionally drops out in strange and unusual ways.  Apparently I wasn't the only one who ran into this, either.  Granted, they don't really detract from the game, but they are still sort of annoying.  I also ended up having the camera get in the way, which was strange because the fixed camera angles usually work well for the series.  Be aware of how to beat the sometimes awkward camera angles.  Also, and while this last one is more subjective, some of the puzzles in the campaign are sort of cheap (remember that conveyor belt block puzzle from the first game?  Yeah, there's a couple of equivalents), and there are a few points in the game where they're are some atrocious difficulty spikes.  Other than that, I can't really think of any shortcomings that were noticeable.Now, the newest feature is obviously the MP.  I played a lot of Beta, and I've given the final MP mode plenty of time, and I have to say that I found what I played to be quite fun, if a bit decent instead of mind blowing. (in other words, don't expect the MP component to lead to a Tf2 style boom of popularity and staying power), I also can't help but think it's a tad wonky when it comes to longetivity (I'll get to that later).  The game certainly follows many MP standards, including experience points, teams, leveling up, and so forth.  Much like a standard MP, you will be able to participate in a variety of modes, such as death match and capture the flag.  With God of War's stellar combat being the crux of the ways to battle against one another, Ascension's MP ends up being pretty interesting, to say the least.Basically, all you really need to know is that combat is very fluid, with an excellent mix of the various modes of attack you would expect (light, grappling, heavy, etc.).  You'll need to fight with tact though, or else matches probably won't end up being fun for you.  You basically select one of four distinct character classes (each with their own unique statistics, strengths, weaknesses, etc), and once you do so, you can start racking up experience points.  In addition, be sure to be aware of Labors, which are essentially specific challenges that will give you extra XP upon completion.  You can use those experience points in order to level up, as usual, and once you do, you'll end up getting new weapons and perks.  The perk system, as you might expect, gives you passive abilities, so use them wisely.  The use of weapons, the extremely fast and fluid combat system; it all works.  Finally, here is a quick rundown the modes available.  Their most basic overall design are familiar, but they suit the game play and lay the ground work for some MP fun.Favour of the Gods: Basically, a simple free-for all death match.  Whoever gets the most kills wins the match.Team Favour of the Gods: Two teams of four are basically given objectives throughout the mode (I won't spoil them, but they are all challenging and fun to accomplish).  The team that hits 8000 points first hits the match.Team Capture the Flag:  Basically, much like you would expect, each time must work with one another to capture a group's flag and bring it to their own empty base.  The group that collects the most flags wins the match.Trial of the Gods: While this can also be played solo, this mode is also a free for all mode.  Together with a group of people, everyone must fight against waves and waves of enemies until both cannot go on.  This is the only mode where you don't fight against one another.However, despite all of this, I do want to address my concern on the longetivity of the MP mode.  As of writing this review, I really have to wonder: will the MP of this game last?  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, but given how so many games sadly end up losing much of the MP audience, I have to wonder if this will happen to Ascension as well.  I immensely enjoy the MP, personally, but I think the consumer should have ever right to be concerned.  I find it a tad hard to predict, given how many MP modes from various games have been shut down because nobody plays them not long after the launch of the MP servers.  If you were thinking about buying this game strictly for MP, I'd probably think twice if I were you, due to this.Regardless, anybody who's a fan of the franchise will want to pick up Ascension.  I know that there were sneaks around the gaming community about GoW's supposed series fatigue, and some gamers think Ascension is not worth buying because its the 7th game in the series.  I am not one of those people.  Yes, Ascension may not appeal to a casual God of War player, but as someone who's played every single game in the franchise and hasn't been let down yet, the streak continues with Ascension for me.  It's another exciting adventure into the world of Kratos and Greek Mythology, and an excellent send up for Kratos as the 7th generation comes to an end.  Even if the MP may not last (though it is very enjoyable, so I hope it does last for a while), the campaign is long enough to be a single player along the same line as the other games in the series.  Regardless, if your a fan of the series, I highly recommend Ascension","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2013"}

Sturgeon","summary":"Best of the Prime series","reviewText":"Maturity level: Well, when I heard a chief of what amounts to the armed forces using a curse word, however mild compared to what I've seen in other games, it was still surprising to hear it coming from Metroid. Metroid seems to have been getting darker as time goes on. Not a bad thing really. I've been thinking Nintendo should do more stuff like this. Of course games like Mario and Pokemon will always be kid friendly. But if they could make some of their franchises more mature like Metroid, maybe bring back Killer Instinct and maybe grade a few games between kiddie and mature (ie: Zelda), they could really start to beat the image of being too kiddie. So I like what they're doing making Metroid more adult oriented.Graphics: I can't stand when people whine about graphics. I don't even credit anyone who says the graphics are no better than Gamecube and put up Echoes as proof. Was Echoes pretty and flashy? Sure. But I don't think it holds a candle to Corruption. Sure the Wii may not be as powerful graphically when compared to the 360 or the PS3, but comparing it to the Gamecube is inane. This still looks way beyond what the Gamecube could pull off, both in cut scenes and actual game play.Controls: This is where Corruption really shines as far as I'm concerned. The things you can do with the grapple, the way you hold and twist levers and switches, these are all good. But the one thing that Corruption does right that totally infuriated me about the other Primes is that you can turn around more quickly. Nothing ticked me off more with the other Primes then when a boss would get behind you and you turn around so slowly that by the time you got turned around, the boss had already pegged away at least half a tank of energy and was already on its way to getting behind you again. This problem is finally solved in this Prime. You can turn much more quickly and re-target the enemies trying to flank you. Great job, finally, Nintendo.Difficulty...there's a harder setting for those who want it. Me, I have it on normal mode, which actually feels just about right for once. With the first Prime, I got aggravated and kept setting it aside for weeks/months at a time because I was constantly getting stuck. I finally got to Metroid Prime and threw in the towel when I kept getting wasted over and over again and I wasn't even nearly halfway down on his health. Echoes was even worse. I doubt I got halfway through that one before I just said \"forget this, I'm moving on to another game.\" I haven't touched it since. This one is actually keeping me playing. I've been beaten a couple times. But never so bad that it was frustrating, and I've gotten past each boss eventually. It's challenging, but not frustrating. For me, that's a first in the Prime series.So, over all this is an easy five stars. This is honestly the most fun I've had playing any of the Prime games. I've been ruing the move from 2D to FPS in the Metroid series ever since the first Prime. But this one finally won me over to the side of the Primes.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2007"}

Bar a VERY frustrating online mode (with no voice recognition control, hateful NPC interaction and a connection mode less stable than Ms. Sally Field in \"Sybil\"), \"Outbreak\" is basically a clone of a clone of a game concept from 1995.Which, 9 years later, hasn't aged at all well.GRAPHICS: In a word, Dull. Surprising, considering Capcom's prowess in the Onimusha and Devil May Cry series of games, as well as the recent graphical delights of survival horror brethern \"Silent Hill 4\" and \"Project Zero 2\", it's a worry and a shame that \"Outbreak\" is restricted to a (seeming) colour palette of 256 Browns, with the odd streak of red thrown in. Animation is average, renders are VERY humdrum, and the menu screens mystifying and very difficult to read. Which, since you need to be able to operate them quickly (decisions are made in realtime, folks!), is hugely prohibitive to decent gameplay flow.PLAYABILITY: Not really. NPCs have been a feature of Survival Horror since 1999's \"Silent Hill 2\", but never before, and hopefully never again, will they be so unresponsive and weak. Frustrating, silly deaths occur left, right and centre, and see how many new swear words you can invent while watching an NPC die as your gun reloads. PAINFULLY slowly, might I add.FEAR FACTOR: None whatsoever. That hot tension at the base of your skull ain't fear. It's rage. At Capcom. The pounding of your heart isn't from terror. It's annoyance at the same-old same-old creature design and unfair difficulty levels. In two words: Not Scary. \"Survival Infuriation\" could be a better genre in which to group this sorry little game.If Capcom is to sell Resident Evil titles on the Playstation 2, they need to concentrate on Originality and Playability, two crucial key points which \"Outbreak\", unfortunately, lacks in spades.Steer clear! And get something else, anything else, instead. A very, very disappointing showing for a franchise that was once so revered.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2004"}

Mainly, great action, competent fighting mechanics and a slew of Gotham super villains all capped with excellent voice acting and an engaging storyline.After finishing Arkham City, including all of the sidequests I'm left with mixed feelings on the game. As much as I want to like it the same way as I liked Arkham Asylum this sequel doesn't measure up.Graphically the title is not a disappointment. While not as visually striking as Arkham Asylum thanks to the years-old game engine the graphics are competent and crisp. The added freedom of having a small chunk of Gotham to explore is a nicety. Being a Batman game the entire game takes place at night (obviously) limiting the setting somewhat but it works perfectly here.Voice acting is again incredible with Mark Hamill reprising his role as the Joker. Kevin Conroy returns as the voice of Batman. The voice acting is so good that it makes it almost difficult to watch the recent Batman films and to hear Christian Bale's hoarse, almost comical voice as Batman.The main area where Arkham City missteps is in the story. Like the terrible Joel Schumacher directed Batman films Arkham City throws too many villains at the player too quickly with barely any time to develop a story. There's Hugo Strange who's in charge of Arkham City and his mysterious Protocol 10 which is Batman's main concern. Then there's the Joker who's sick and apparently dying. Toss in Mr. Freeze who's been captured by the Penguin; Poison Ivy who's really mad at Catwoman as is Two-Face; Ra's al Ghul who's got his own schemes cooking; Bane; Calendar Man; Soloman Grundy; Clayface;  Mad Hatter; Deadshot; Azrael; Zsasz.... and well you get the picture. There's a lot going on. The problem is that it's too much. There are so many enemies and so many little sidequests and story tidbits that go absolutely nowhere that it makes the game unfocused and difficult to stay interested in.Where Batman Arkham Asylum had direction, Arkham City is like a goulash of nonsensical story bits that seem to be thrown together with the hope of creating something interesting. The major plot piece Hugo Strange's Protocol 10 is a major letdown when finally revealed later in the game. It's one of those, \"I can't believe that's it\" moments. For literally there's an ongoing countdown to the start of Protocol 10 the entire game that you'd expect it to be some major piece of super villain debauchery... only it's not. Then there are the multitude of times that Batman, described as, \"the world's greatest detective\" walks into the simplest of traps.Thankfully Rocksteady Studios did add plenty of things to keep the player busy. Besides the 400 Riddler Challenges spread throughout the map there's the return of the Riddler's Revenge Combat and Predator challenge maps. The addition of Catwoman as a playable character with her own set of Riddler trophies and challenges. There tons of pieces of storyline and artwork to unlock as well as patient interviews which are excellent. As of this writing there are also DLC characters to download and play against their own set of challenges.All told this is a solid offering that really could have used more direction and focus in the story. I sincerely hope that future Batman games will focus more on a competent story than sheer number of characters included in the cast. As a whole this is definitely a game worth owning but doesn't live up to the original.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2011"}
{"product_name":"B006GHA8EE","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Bean","summary":"A complicated, but rewarding Action-RPG","reviewText":"'Witcher 2' is at once an easy and difficult recommendation. CD Projekt RED's port of their celebrated PC game carries everything I want in an RPG: a complex narrative, terrific voice-acting, great combat, a world I want to get lost in and some of the best graphics I've seen on the XBOX 360. Unfortunately it also requires you to invest a lot of your time and patience to get the most out of it and there are moments where some may feel that price is a bit steep.The Story of 'Witcher 2' involves Geralt of Rivia, a professional monster-hunter or titular \"Witcher\", who has amnesia and is regarded as a hero for his actions in the previous game (only available on PC). An unknown figure from his past is going around killing monarchs and Geralt finds himself framed and on the run in a quest to find this mysterious assassin. Along the way Geralt get's involved in politics, conspiracies, monster-hunting and conflicts between humans and non-humans. It's a simple enough setup but the overall plot ends up being VERY complex, asking you to absorb lots of information at a time (even more so if you follow every dialogue path like I do) and your in-game character-index becomes indespensable. Nothing ever rings false though and even with tons of branching options I felt rewarded for putting in the extra effort.In fact the writing of 'Witcher 2' is easily it's biggest asset and the world it presents puts some interesting (and dark) spins on familiar fantasy tropes. Human's wage war with each other over sexual jealousy. Elven nationalists engage in Guerilla warfare with anyone trespassing in their forests (and could eat the Dragon Age Dalish for breakfast). Trolls would rather build bridges and drink vodka than kill people. Even Geralt himself, with his clear-eyed perspective and wry-humor behaves more like a cynical detective than the usual fantasy hero.When you're not making kingdom-changing decisions or getting snarky with self-serious elves and interrogators, 'Witcher 2' has you exploring the world (which is loaded with shops and mini-games) and solving problems for other characters. These encounters can be anything from fetch-quests to simple monster-hunting, but most of them have you following different threads and you end up finding more to each conflict then is immediately present. What starts as a simple rescue mission can end up uncovering a kingdom-wide conspiracy (again, with dire consequences). Like the story, the missions don't hold your hand as there's usually no clear-cut quest markers and fast-travel. This helps with the immersion but can frustrate players used to more accessible RPG's like Skyrim.The combat in 'Witcher 2' seems straight-forward at first but requires some strategic thinking as you play. While button-mashing with the newest gear can get you out of some conflicts, the tougher confrontations require you to pay attention to Geralt's stance and place on the battlefield. You also have to mix and match magic/trap abilities with your martial skills which makes leveling up decisions just as much about strategy as the combat. It's a system I found very satisfying, though I would've liked more weapon variety (usually Geralt just has his two swords and maybe a sidearm).'Witcher 2' is not without it's faults, however and the sometimes PC-centric elements of the port can make things frustrating. While combat is dynamic, having to target specific enemies is hit and miss and the game offers no easy way to switch between targets. The same goes for exploration and trying to do anything precise like talking to specific characters or target certain objects to pick up. The menus are also a chore to sort through with no quick way to bring up maps and character sheets; the inventory screen is sometimes a puzzle in and of itself. There's nothing \"game breaking\" here but 'Witcher 2' isn't as smooth as a console RPG should be.There's so much to 'Witcher 2' I always feel like I'm leaving something out when talking about it. It's obviously not for everyone as it's PC-ness shows through a bit too much and the story-dumps are an investment in and of themselves. But if you're craving a complex RPG narrative with moral-ambiguity and consequences that make a difference (along with the great combat) then 'Witcher 2' is not to be missed!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2012"}

With its unique media format, known as the Universal Media Disc (UMD), the PSP brings innovation to the handheld world dominated by cartridges.  The PSP allows for great user customization, such as custom wallpapers, icons, etc.  The PSP has built in WiFi and can be utilized to gain full access to the built in web browser or to the PlayStation Store to download extras.The added benefit of the PSP-3000 over the PSP Go is the ability to own physical copies of the games/media purchased.  In case the console ever becomes damaged, it would be a much simpler, and quicker task to simply purchase another 3000 that can read your UMDs immediately upon purchase, as compared to the challenges one may face when switching over from one PSP Go to another.  The smaller price-tag of the PSP-3000 makes it an even more optimal choice over the Go.  The PSP has access to tons of great UMD games, many of which have not been added to the PlayStation store yet, making this yet another pro for the PSP over the Go.  Many users also like the added benefit of owning physical copies of media because it allows them to feel like they actually own the media rather than simply feel like they are renting it from the developers.  Licensing issues in the past have made Microsoft pull off a few games from Xbox Arcade after only a short amount of time after their initial release.  Situations such as this can cause high levels of paranoia amongst the owners of the media since they do not know whether or not the developers can remove the media just as quickly as they offered it.The PSP is very comfortable, fitting the forms of the hands quite nicely.  By using the familiar layout associated with other Sony consoles (square, triangle, etc.) the controls are very easy to adjust to and make playing games such as God of War Chains of Olympus an easy transition from their console counterparts.  The major complaint I have with the console is the small analog \"stick\" that protrudes from the bottom left corner of the console.  The stick is rather small and does not have a great range of motion, this makes it difficult to maneuver properly in games that use the stick.  The lack of a second stick also makes mapping of buttons quite awkward in certain games as well, especially when compared to console versions of the same game.  This takes some time to get used to and is simply a minor nuisance when weighed against all of the benefits of the console.  I highly recommend the PSP-3000 over the PSP Go to anyone who's ever been curious about the capabilities of the PSP consoles.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2009"}
{"product_name":"B001UW9ZW6","reviewerName":"Alex Honda \"onyx575\"","summary":"Different Than The **PS2** Version...DLC NOT AVAILABLE","reviewText":"I got a PS3 for Christmas and after being let down byMarvel Ultimate Alliance 2for PS2, and reading and hearing that this version was different, I decided to give MARVEL ULTIMATE ALLIANCE 2 PS3 a try.First, it follows the same storyline about \"registration/no registration\" for superheroes and you choose a side. Depending on which side you choose, certain characters become locked and you proceed through the game until they unite towards the end. When you replay the game, you can choose the other side and then you go through the game with different objectives.The difference between the PS2 version and the PS3 is in the levels and the fighting. The levels seem more varied and you can talk to different characters, unlike in PS2, and you can choose what type of responses you want to give--\"aggressive,\" \"diplomatic,\" \"defensive.\" The areas are totally different as well. You can also choose an alternate outfit for each character, after you pass some objective, but they don't augment your powers in anyway unlike MUA.Fighting is the same (as far as which button to push and using powers) but you face a multitude of villains and the fusions don't revive a dead teammate. You get to carry two heal tokens that can either restore \"HP\"(hit/health points) or to revive a fallen comrade, which isn't much, and you pick up badges that help augment your health, powers, and stamina.The PS3 version is much better than the PS2 version but it still falls short and here's the reason for the 2-star deduction. When you're fighting the camera zooms way out so that you end up being really tiny and you're swarmed with enemies, so you lose track as to where your character is. Many reviewers have pointed this out and I couldn't understand what they were talking about because this wasn't the case with the PS2 version or with the previous games:X-Men Legends II Rise of the ApocalypseorMarvel Ultimate Alliance. But now I get it.In one area my hero fell through the floor and was k.o.'d and the game crashed in another, where the screen just went blue and I had to restart. The save point isn't really the save point like in MUA where you were in a specific place and you returned to that same spot if you died or quit the game, this one takes you back to your last checkpoint, which you have no idea when or where it is--but usually after a cut-scene--and it could be way back.Some cut-scenes can't be skipped and when you're in the middle of battle, the voice-over telling you what to do next or how to defeat your opponent is really hard to understand. I don't know why this was done? But it's like trying to listen to two people talking to you at the same time.The other star deduction is for the DLC (down-loadable content) that was advertised from the Playstation store and on the game's site. This add-on was supposed to give you extra-characters and four other missions to play on the game, but this was a limited time only thing and was taken down way before the cut off date. It was supposed to be available until 12/31/09 but it was taken down about a week or so before. And this was for the paid DLC as well as the free ones. Makes no sense and customer support was really no help. I found out about the limited time on a game bulletin board because a lot of other people had the same problem. Even so it wasn't up till 12/31/09 because I was looking. I saw it sometime before Christmas and instead of downloading it then and there, I waited until I actually received the game which was either the 22 or 23. I went back on the 25th or 26th and it was gone.I'm not sure who is to blame for this but didn't they think Christmas gifts? Most people probably got this as a gift so why wouldn't they leave the DLC up, at least until the end of January? Bad move...Anyway, a lot can be explained because the maker of the original \"X-Men Legends\" and \"MUA\" was a company called Raven Software. MUA2 was done by a different company and I'm not sure why there was this change.I haven't played online but I heard that it's supposed to be fun. The game isn't too bad but the problems above make it just \"OK\" overall.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0001X5YN4","reviewerName":"Michael","summary":"One of my personal favorites.","reviewText":"To avoid reading a long review, let me just sum it up: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a game for those that enjoy immersive and very atmospheric games. And ones that aren't nearly as easy as most.To begin in more detail, the best part of the game is without a doubt, the atmosphere. Some of the more impressive aspects and moments of the game are so because of the game's great environment. Not only does the game play the part well through its look, it also has great sound design and music to compliment the gritty feel. On certain parts of the game you'll have to explore things like vaults and underground tunnels, which are kind of creepy.. A common comparison to make would be Fallout, but I assure you this game's atmosphere is much better in that sense. Just the sound design alone and the creepy 'What happened here..' feel that places in this game give make it worth it alone.Another thing that makes this game special, the brutal nature. It's not as difficult as even older games, but it certainly offers a challenge. The shooting mechanics have a peeking/cover system that make things more interesting to spice it up. Along this, other challenges the game gives is radiation. Be careful! If your level is too high, you will die in seconds. Even if you barely have any, you will slowly die -- just like you would in real life. Maybe this difficulty can be annoying, but it certainly makes for a more realistic and thus immersive feel.Also, exploring the world is a fun part. Though it's open world, keep in mind it's by no means as open as other high budget games. Most areas in the game will make you cross them to pass the storyline. There are a few other areas like small buildings and things like that that are optional, but they're limited -- so optional exploration isn't that big of a focus, but I don't mind because the world is so interesting to see and discover. Side quests, though not that interesting nor compelling will offer you places to visit and tasks to perform for things like money or supplies. This gives more of a reason to explore the world.Which brings up my biggest and maybe only beef with this game: The side quests. They're confusing, not in objective but in the way they're made. They're also buggy - objectives will stay even after finishing the quests, quests will randomly show up, their objective locations are sometimes different from where they should be.. and there's a 24 hour limit to side quests. While the time/day cycle is longer than most games and is more than enough for the objective, side quests get really repetitive and aren't very worthwhile for the most part. Also, some of them are really glitched. I'm really upset that I can't join any faction because the side quests associating to joining them are broken and unbeatable. Seriously, on one quest as soon as I accept I fail it. Instead of it saying 'Quest added,' as soon as I accept it says 'Quest failed' and there's no way to change this as multiple attempts have proved. I am still not very happy about this. While glitches are 'part of the package' in open world games they're still slightly upsetting.Alongside the excellent yet a little flawed singleplayer, there's a pretty standard multiplayer. There's some fun to be had here, but being an older game not many people play anymore and most servers are in places like Europe, so if you're in the U.S. like me your high ping over long distance connection will give you a hard time.Overall, very worth it. Atmospheric and brutal, yet very interesting to play. 9/10 due to some bugs. If can forgive a game for being rough around the edges for a highly immersive, atmospheric experience that's story-driven- S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2014"}

Flower is a GREAT game. But Journey... Journey is the best game I've played in my life, and I've been playing since the days of the Nintendo Entertainment System in the 1980s. The following review is SPOILER FREE.It's difficult to put into words what exactly makes Journey so special. As the title implies, it's more of an \"experience\", and I might even call it a spiritual/digital pilgrimage, as odd as that might sound. I have never before been so captivated while playing a game, so fully immersed, and so interested in what would come next. This accomplishment is even more remarkable when you consider that Journey contains no dialogue (written or spoken), and breaks many of the standard conventions that gaming relies upon.My recommendation for your first time through is to play it in solitude, in a darkened room, preferably with a good sound system, as the music is phenomenal. On the visual side, an HDTV is a must, and the larger the screen, the better. This is an incredibly immersive experience, and the more you can focus on it, the more you will get out of it. On subsequent playthroughs, it's fun to watch a friend play, and take joy in their reactions to the wonders they experience.Journey contains an orchestral soundtrack that is breathtaking, and fits the game perfectly. The visuals are equally spellbinding, and they become more and more fantastic as your journey progresses. Photos do no justice to the feelings that Journey's sweeping landscapes will evoke in you.One of my favorite aspects of Journey is that it can be completed, from start to finish, in a mere two hours. This means that going back and revisiting this incredible experience is relatively easy, even for those of us who are pressed for time between jobs and real world responsibilities. Journey can be played any evening after work, and it's fantastic to revisit its immersive, therapeutic, and breathtaking world. Making this game short was not a mistake, but a stroke of genius. There is no bloat, and every minute spent in the experience is finely tuned to provide maximum enjoyment, emotional stimulation, and thought provocation.I downloaded each of these games as they were made available on PSN. Therefore, I do not own the physical copy, so I cannot comment on the packaging or the bonus materials. My review is strictly for the content of the games themselves, and I give this collection my highest possible recommendation.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2012"}
{"product_name":"B008CP6RWU","description":"","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"All three titles rated and reviewed","reviewText":"FLOW:3.5 out of 5The wonderful thing about every game on this disc is the ability to find yourself lost within them. Reality is always subdued by these titles; whether due to their soundtracks meeting simplicity or just the complete interruption from anything you've done in other games before. Flow is no exception. But it is the weakest of the three games. I won't spoil the game for you. But suffice it to say that one of the most gratifying parts of this experience is just figuring out what you're doing. And, once your first playthrough is complete, you may still wonder if there are better ways to progress or even a different way to play altogether. Length and breadth are mostly what Flow is lacking. The developers were well on their way to greatness here, but weren't yet incorporating those truly awe-inspiring moments. It's enjoyable nonetheless.FLOWER:4.25 out of 5This is going to sound terrible, but the first time I began playing this game I was quickly out like a light. It wasn't that the game was boring; far from it. I suppose that the game itself just relaxed the hell out of me and made me realize how tired I'd been. And games don't normally do that. So I'd argue that this title is worth the price of a trip to the day-spa. Still, that isn't what prompts the rating. I just thought that would be a fun tidbit to share. What really makes Flower wonderful is the sense of freedom, atop the musical nature of its progression. Then there's all of the vibrancy in each level. It's difficult to know what's coming next. You really feel as though you're building a following while accomplishing something worthwhile. And it is unlike any game I have ever played. Long before Journey ever came about, I was very much taken by Flower and the spell it weaves on whoever is leading that lone petal.JOURNEY:4.5 out of 5I'll admit that I am not quite the admirer of this game that many people seem to be. This isn't to say I don't value it. I clearly think the game is breathtaking. But I'm not going to tell you that it's the greatest game I've ever played. Engrossing? Yes. Captivating? Oh yeah. Unique? Of course. Still not the end-all of video games as some reviewers have let on. From this title you can expect complete immersion. Play this thing when you have nothing else that needs done, and don't allow for interruptions. Because, beyond the simple beginnings of Journey, the game is going to grab you by the core and not let go until you've finished with it. Again, no spoilers. So I'll just say that the game is one of the most visually impressive titles out there. And the score is on par with what you'll see. What many people, myself included, love about this game is its ability to draw you in without the bells and whistles of other titles. You aren't killing things or hearing memorable one-liners. You aren't hunting objectives or solving riddles either. The game is literally about the journey itself. And that may sound dull to people who haven't played the game. But if you play it you'll realize how wrong that line of thinking can be. One thing I both loved and hated about the game was the multiplayer aspect. I disliked it because there was never any explanation of how it worked. To put it plainly, any time you see another character while you play, you're playing with a live person somewhere out there. The game makes this happen seamlessly and doesn't let you in on what's happened. If ever you wish to play by yourself, then simply sign out of the playstation network prior to playing. Otherwise the multiplayer is going to be part of your experience. But that doesn't equate to a negative. Remember that I also said I loved this aspect. The multiplayer is wonderful here because it gives you something no other games does; someone to journey with for the simple sake of someone to journey with. There is literally nothing about this game which requires a companion. You could do everything alone. And this means that some people may view the multiplayer as a nuisance or as useless. Others will recognize that this only deepens the experience. The emotional response and connection you'll feel toward that nameless, faceless, wordless stranger by the end of your journey is intense. Without it, the game isn't quite the same. And that's what makes it brilliant. You are literally tasked with understanding that any adventure for the sake of adventure is more memorable with someone in tow; even if you can't speak to each other. It's a moving and sobering testament to what games can do and all of the untapped potential which still exists. Not to be missed. But for the ultra-rigid and calculating minds which have trouble losing themselves in much of anything, especially something which offers no grand prize, Journey is not going to be thought worthwhile. The majority, however, will fall hard for this game. And anyone can/should play it; even non-gamers.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002I096AA","description":"","reviewerName":"Arch Stanton","summary":"A Very Nice Handheld Console","reviewText":"Pros:Quality gaming engine is able to improve noticeably over DS gamesHigh-quality upper screenAn ever increasing and high quality game libraryBackwards compatible with DS gamesEasily portable with a protective lid sheltering the screensCons:3D is mostly uselessNo second analog stickRegion lockedThe 3DS was released two years ago and is only just recently reaching its potential. I've had mine for a year at this point and I can definitely say that I've noticed the number of people I encountered through StreetPass skyrocket in the past few months. I used to be able to walk down the street without picking up anyone at all. In fact, I went through the London Underground in rush hour and only had five hits. But now I walk down through my fairly small town and I pick up ten new people every time. It's made it almost tooo easy.The reason for this surge in popularity is obvious. The 3DS was marred by a rather dismal set of release games that was dominated by ports from the N64 and PS2, such asThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Star Fox 64, andTales of the Abyss. It was the same way for the first year and a half as everyone tried to figure out what to do with it, with the strange 3D features and motion controls putting some developers off. Fortunately, the system got over that and now has its own unique games likeFire Emblem: Awakening,A Link Between Worlds, andPok&eacute;mon X.As to the 3DS in general, the system is basically the same as the DS with improved graphics. Why improve on perfection I suppose? That machine was a near-perfect gaming platform with many classic games. The graphics however, were often quite blocky and sometimes ugly. The 3DS improves on that although most games keep the unrealistic style of DS games. They just do it better, with cartoony graphics that actually look like cartoons. Some of the visuals on the 3DS can be pretty amazing, but there are few games that show them off to the full. I think that the graphics level is somewhere around that of the PS2, as can be seen in a number of direct PS2 ports. This is good enough for a handheld system and means we can finally get rid of the blocky little shrunken men that dominated DS games. It's not as good as theVita, but since 3DS games are rarely about superior graphics that doesn't matter. Most of the best 3DS games would have worked just fine on the DS, they simply look nicer with better graphics. And that sums up Nintendo's strategy to a T: If it ain't broke don't fix it. And since the 3DS can do DS games better than the DS as well as play higher end games (Ace Combat looked pretty good on its screen) this system offers a lot more chance for expansion while allowing Nintendo to take few risks.The big gripe everyone has about the 3DS is the 3D part. And yes, it isn't great. If it wasn't for the fact that I dislike the non-clamshell design of the 2DS I'd recommend going for that. But the problems with the 3D have often been overstated. Yes, it rarely adds anything to the gaming experience; yes it means you have to hold the system at exactly the right angle to see it; yes, it can sometimes cause headaches; but then you can simply turn it off if you don't like it. There's a little switch on the side that makes it dead easy. I don't know of any games that require 3D to function so you don't really lose anything. What I generally do is put the 3D off when I'm playing the game, but turn it on for cinematics. Because animated cutscenes in 3D look absolutely superb. Sometimes they has left me utterly blown away.The motion control elements of the 3DS are similarly gimmicky, although I can see more potential for their integration into a good gaming experience. Under no circumstances should the two gimmicks be used together. The 3D is dependent on having the 3DS at a constant distance from your face, so if you have to move the unit around to use the motion sensors then you're going to get a headache quick.Another aspect of the hardware that gets people a bit upset is the battery life. The 3DS can't really play a 3DS game for longer than 3-4 hours, putting it well below the operating time of the original DS and even the Vita. However, that's only for 3DS games. The system can run on battery for eight or more hours when playing DS games, which isn't really any worse than the DS itself. The reduced battery life is just the tradeoff you get for superior graphics. There is no way around it. The one battery-related thing that does bother me though is that the sleep mode isn't very good at conserving energy. If you leave the 3DS sleeping for two days without a charge it will run out of battery. I assume this is related to Streetpass and could be resolved by simply turning the wifi off so I'm giving it a break on that score.The 3DS comes with with a number of programs preinstalled including System Settings, the eShop, Activity Log, Nintendo Zone, 3D Camera, and Mii Maker. These programs are fairly self-explanitory and cannot be deleted as they are essential to the functioning of the system. I'm not particularly happy with the eStore. It seems rather clunky to use, and crashes frequently. It's nice that it can background download, but it makes everything up to that point far too difficult. The 3DS can play downloaded games rather than using cartridges, and the fact that it uses standard memory cards means that this isn't that difficult or expensive to do. A major plus over the Vita and its Vita-exclusive memory cards.Also preinstalled are Face Raiders and Augmented Reality. These are both short games designed to be used with the 3DS's camera. They add digitally created figures to what appears behind your 3DS and allow you to, for example, shoot men with your face on them who fly about your room in little balls. It's pretty cool, and a real shame that no games have been made to take advantage of these features since. The other game on there is StreetPass. This is a collection of two games (though they can be upped to six if you pay for them) that depend on you collecting other players' characters via wifi. As you pass another 3DS in the street you will automatically sync with it and their character will show up on your Mii Plaza from which you can play games. I don't know of any other system that has social gaming features that make you feel as involved as this. I understand that Japan has something similar with cell phone games and I believe there was something like it for the PSP, but over here the only competition is Vita's Near, and StreetPass leaves Near in the dust. There's just no benefit to using Near whereas with StreetPass you get to play games with people you run into, even if they're not involved any more than that. Rewards include hats and uniforms for your Mii character.A major problem with the 3DS when compared to its predecessor is that games are now region-locked. European games cannot be played on American systems, nor can Japanese games. This is a real problem for me as I have a European 3DS. So at the moment I can't play games likeShin Megami Tensei IV, though I suspect that they'll release it in Europe eventually. Fortunately, the DS cartridges are still region-free and can be played in any system.The 3DS comes in three versions: the base model 3DS (this one), the3DS-XL, and the2DS. Now, the 3DS is fine as a system, but its screen is just as tiny as the DS's. The 3DS-XL however has a screen that's almost twice as big while still fitting comfortably in your hand or your pocket. It also has a longer battery life, giving you perhaps an extra hour's usage. Even if you only want to use it to play DS games it's worth the upgrade. It is of course, the most expensive of the three options. The 3DS is somewhat cheaper and fits in pockets easier, but I personally don't like how boxy it is. The 3DS-XL is all smooth lines and is only slightly bigger when you consider the increased size of the screen. But if small size really is important for you I'd go with the 3DS. The 2DS is really only for people who don't expect to carry it around in their pockets. The one-piece construction makes it stronger, but it does mean that it is less protected and you need a jacket or sweater to carry it in. The fact that it doesn't have 3D isn't much of a loss. I have friends who swear by the 2DS, and I can see its advantages, but if you expect to bring it everywhere I'd go for one of the other two options.To sum up: the 3DS is an excellent gaming system that improves on what didn't work on the DS while keeping all of the features that worked. If it features gimmicks like 3D and motion control they can be easily turned off or ignored. It's a small price to pay for quality. Anyone wanting a portable gaming system has no reason not to turn to the 3DS. I was never a fan of portable games since I came to them back in the days of Gameboy and Game Gear when 2D sprites were the way to go and difficulty settings often unforgiving. But the 3DS has made a convert out of me and consumes far too much of my free time. Definitely recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00AKIPBNS","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Hughes","summary":"Not much strategy in this game","reviewText":"I recently beat the game. However all 40 or so battles are really all the same. You essentially huddle your team together closely so they help each other out and turn after turn you kill the enemy till you win. There's no real strategy to it other than that.My biggest annoyance with the game is with the counter attack system. That is, if your character is attacked (and say loses 10 health) and then kills the attacker in the counter attack, then often another enemy will attack your character right away. This repeats, with your character losing 10 health each time  until your character is dead. **HOWEVER**, if your character *doesn't* kill the attacker, then he's not attacked anymore. So often times I found myself hoping my character *wouldn't* kill the attacker in the counter attack, just so they wouldn't be attacked anymore and could live long enough to be healed.Conversely taking advantage of the above system, I found pairing up Chrom with my main character and pushing them way off into enemy territory meant they were attacked constantly, *but* defended each other so much that they lived through these battles and also killed more than half of the enemy's this way. So I just kind of sat back and watched them do this turn after turn, which got boring.Anyway I thought this game would have much deeper strategy than this, like a fantasy chess game where positioning would play a bigger role. So I was let down. Unlike Advance Wars there's nothing that really shakes up the gameplay such as CO powers. So you just prod along kill after kill in a straight forward manner.The story was interesting enough that I wanted to play this game to the end, but there's no replay value here for me.Graphics are top notch for 3DS.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0050SWUTQ","description":"","reviewerName":"2pacleo","summary":"A Great Journey as Always.","reviewText":"Most of people rating this game low is because people don't like changes. People get used to stuff most of the time and they don't understand that changes in every aspect of life is what makes it interesting. YES, it is not the same Dead Space you are used to, YES  there has been changes and YES it feels different. But it is important to mention that some of the aspects that made this franchise big, still in DS3. You are going to find yourself walking around the game (not running) scared of what you are going to encounter around the corner. This game plays with your brain the same way the other 2 games did. You play 2 or 3 minutes without any action (your brain thinks everything is all good), minding your own business and all of the sudden, you find your self pressing buttons, holding the controller like your life depended on it (literally), your brains flips out and changes to survival mode from one second to the other. THAT is what makes DS lovely... and that is still in the game. On the other hand, co-op was added to the game and that sensation i just mentioned is lost, since you play with a partner and you feel more secured. The story in the game changed as well... WHY?? because developers wanted to explain many of the things that happened on the other 2 games, so the MYSTERY is lost. Which in my opinion, should not affect your experience at all. The addition of co-op is not the developers fault, BUT YOUR FAULT. Thanks to the COD phenomenon and other shooters, instigating and forcing developers to add multiplayer to everything, now it has transcended to DS and other games, which NEVER depended on multiplayer to be excellent games. But, business is business, since multiplayer sells nowadays, why not have it on other games. Again, I blame it all on COD fanboys.Anyway, BUY THE GAME... who cares about reviews, who cares about others opinions. BE A MAN/WOMAN and play the game and judge it on your own, your voice and opinion counts and if you are a FAN of the DS universe, you know you won't be disappointed, 'cause you know what DS is about and trust me, they kept the ESSENCE of what made this franchise, better than Resident Evil and destroyed Silent Hill.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2013"}

I'm a big fan of games like Age of Empires, Empire Earth, Command & Conquer, etc and this is a similar kind of real time strategy game but obviously set in the context of World War 2.First I played through the campaign on normal mode and found it challenging but not hair pulling frustrating.  I then went through the skirmish maps and enjoyed those very much.  The music, sound effects, voices and graphics were all very nice and made for a very immersive experience and the controls are all pretty easy, especially if you're familiar with RTS games.The only thing I have to complain about is probably multiplayer.  I found it to be a catch 22 situation such that if you are new to multiplayer and haven't built up a lot of wins or levels, no one wants to play with you, but of course you can't get to that point unless people are willing to play with you.  Every once in a while I'd find a game people would play with me on but I usually would get called a bunch of names and kicked out of prospective games many times before finding one.So, as a single player game I enjoyed it greatly and thought it was terrific and would highly recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000SSPH3E","description":"","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Fight through the pages of history...","reviewText":"In a strange way, one could say that the original Final Fantasy Tactics was sort of the middle child of the Playstation era, sandwiched between the massive Final Fantasy VII and its heavily-hyped Final Fantasy VIII. Many found the story intriguing but translation shoddy, gameplay addicting but frequently hard and the music was praised as well though done by someone other than Uematsu. As part of the \"Ivalice Alliance\" compilation, Square decided to revisit the original and do some touchups and upgrades. This isn't an entirely redone game but rather it's remastered shall we say and while it does have its occasional flaws, it was actually the reason why I bought a PSP in the first place.Story: Not to get too story-heavy since it's engrossing but complicated to know where to start, the game centers on the world of Ivalice and the conflict as to what to do about the recently available throne. 2 warring factions sought after the title to be king until history records show a young man named Delita Heiral was the hero that stopped the conflict, though there was also a young man named Ramza Beoulve that also had a hand but why is his name not mentioned in the records and what came about that brought the war to an end?Graphics: The in-game graphics during battle and cutscenes don't really look any different than before. There's a degree of sharpness that I can tell is changed but the sprites don't look like much has changed. Where the game excels is the animated cutscenes that remind me of a drawing being continously animated on the fly as colors will dance around and it's very distinctive and unique and also a pleasure to watch.Sound/Music: Like Final Fantasy XII or Tactics Advance 1 and 2, composer Hitoshi Sakimoto, who also did Vagrant Story and Odin Sphere, takes over the reins from series mainstay Uematsu and while I always thought Sakimoto has a gift for arrangement/orchestrations but lacking in melodies, this soundtrack is some of his best work and it's easy to find yourself tracking down the soundtrack. The voice acting is also quite good and never gets into weird casting choices or stiled delivery.Gameplay: If you've ever played a strategy RPG before, it's pretty much the same thing. The characters move on a chessboard-esque battlefield and when turn is up, could move anywhere you want. Sword users have to be directly against the enemy while archers, spell casters or gun users have to be a relatively close space to attack. Spells can also targer a specific group of tiles, allowing it to actually hit more than one enemy if they're grouped together or a positive spell like Cure. What I sometimes didn't care for was you'd cast a spell in a spot only the character(s) that'll benefit can't really move and there was a few times where a character would start to cast, let's say Fire, and the enemy goes right up to you prompting the spell both him and you. But you gradually figure out the rules and it becomes easier to figure out what to do.I usually never saw the appeal in the Job system, preferring the class-specific style of something like VI or IX but in this game it was weirdly beneficial, moreso I thought. Characters start out with a generally low assortment of jobs to choose from but the more they spend JP (job points) on abilities, the more they can access other and better ones. So you can have a Knight with Black Magic abilities or Thief who knows how to use Dragoon abilities. The customization possibilities are quite endless and should you know how to best present your party, you could be brutal in battle. But at the start, I was kind of sad to see the bow not being sold in stores which would've made getting an Archer early on very beneficial, not to mention JP-allotting can take quite awhile.My one complaint (aside from the slowdown issues which are very noticeable though they were never intrusive to gameplay) was its difficulty. Basically, the game can be quite erratic in whether or not a story-centric battle will decimate your party or you'll handle a few battles with ease only to be hit by a whopper of a battle and indeed the initial couple battles were annoying because my party was just not strong enough. Since characters level by successful actions, attack or otherwise, rather than an end battle experience as seen in most RPG's, have your characters do as much stuff as possible. But be warned: there's times where it's a bit unfair and characters can die left and right.While the difficulty could get to some and the slowdown's more annoying than anything, Tactics is a great way to spend some time with your PSP...a lot of time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00432O4VM","description":"","reviewerName":"Tyler Johnson","summary":"Underappreciated, and unashamedly fun","reviewText":"I picked this game up on the cheap, and honestly wasn't expecting very much. I am happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised. Shadows of the damned is a well made, highly enjoyable, and extremely raunchy romp through the underworld in pursuit of your girlfriend, Paula. I want to be very clear when I say that this game has raunchy humor. This is not a children's game and the content reflects this. If you dislike constant phallic references than this is definitely not the game for you. For everyone who isn't going to let a little raunch get in the way of their fun, you are in for a treat.You play as Garcia Hotspur, demon hunter extraordinaire and his trusty wisecracking sidearm Johnson. Garcia's girlfriend, Paula, has been kidnapped by the lord of darkness and Garcia jumps straight into hell to get her back. Garcia and Johnson are wonderful company. Each are fully fleshed out and have distinct, and engaging personalities. I never got tired of hearing their good natured banter as I played through the wonderfully varied levels.The world of shadows of the damned are beautifully different. Each stage brings something new to the table meaning that you won't be getting bored. From sides scrolling shooters, to weaving through fruit stands avoiding a masked killer, the game does a great job of keeping things fresh. To address the supposed difficulty of a certain level where you fend off waves of monsters, please don't believe the hype. It took my three tries, and that was only so I could see the humorous cutscenes exclusive to dying in those sections.If you have ever played resident evil four, the combat system is like that except better. Garcia moves pretty well, but I did find myself wishing his roll had a little more distance to it. You have four weapons: a pistol, machine gun, shotgun, and torch for melee attacks. Don't worry though; after every boss fight you will recieve an upgrade that completely changes the way the weapon works, and always for the better. A warning for all the achievement hunters out there, once a weapon levels up you won't be able to get the achievement for the previous weapon.Overall this is a fun game. Had this game come out in a different year, one not filled with incredible AAA titles like Arkaham city, Skyrim, and Zelda, maybe Shadows of the damned could have enjoyed more shine, but don't let that stop you from picking up the sleeper hit of the year.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00027CXEM","reviewerName":"Strategos \"The Guardian of Time\"","summary":"The Sith Strike Back: Return of the Exile","reviewText":"A New RPGThe first Knights of the old Republic (KOTOR), was one heck of a game. It took everything that people loved about the classic trilogy and expanded universe of Star Wars, and packed it neatly into an epic RPG where everything you did had either light side or dark side properties. Sure there was light-saber combat, but the game was more about storyline and immersion than anything else. The countless hours of voice-acting and intriguing dialog choices, to say nothing of conversations that would or would not take place depending on what you did, created an experience that sent shockwaves through the video game world. Of course there were also some bugs to be found (okay, a LOT of bugs), and some of the mini games were pointless (anyone else get tired of playing gunner when it's almost impossible to lose?), but on the whole, that game was awesome, giving you everything from jedi mind-tricks and choking of smart-mouths with the force to dancing with twileks and finding out your own dark \"Luke, I AM your father\" secret. So naturally, the second KOTOR has a lot to live up to.You Should Not Have Come BackIf the first KOTOR was A New Hope with the plot twist from Empire Strikes back, this one is probably Empire Strikes back with the plot and pacing of A New Hope. In a move that sits particularly well with me, the dialog and plot are both much darker and much funnier this time around. I knew that from the moment I found myself half-naked tallking to a prisoner in a cell in a station where hundreds lie dead on the ground and psycho droids roam the halls. As the title of the game suggests, this time around everything revolves around the Sith (well, that and finding out why you were banished in the first place). Pretty much the whole game has you playing cat-and-mouse with the Sith, trying to figure out who exactly the real bad guys are. Is is the tortured zombie Darth Sion, who is only kept alive by his own hatred and dark-side power, lusting for revenge on his old master? Is it Sith Lord who wears the creepy Sith Mask, so consumed with hunger for force energy that entire planets are devoured by his hunger as he roams the galaxy in his ghost-ship? Or is the true villain the one who manipulates these Sith fools, using them to make YOU stronger?Pluck of an Old (Fashioned) SithInstead of the same old questions of simple \"Do I kill the guy or give him ALL of my money\" good and evil, a lot of situations in this game are grey areas. You COULD help someone, but it may hurt them more in the long run. You COULD listen to someone's innocent comments, only to discover that they are pure evil. And you COULD hurt someone very much by allowing them to get too close to you. Really, if there is one thing that makes this game fascinating, is the way that puts such a wonderful spin on things, making you repeatedly question your actions and why you are doing the things that you are, forcing nice people to kill when YOU are the good guy, making people betray their master to serve YOU. Perhaps the ultimate question of the game (and it's proved by the very end) is just how far are you willing to go in order to help someone you believe in or destroy something that you hate. Far more is at stake than just the Jedi and the Sith, or even just the Republic. What will you do? Sacrifice your soldiers or save the galaxy?The Weapon of a Jedi KnightSome people will undoubted become irked at the fact that they can't have a light saber from the get-go. But storyline is key here, and now that almost all the Jedi are dead, and most of the Sith as well, light sabers are becoming a little rare. And what with people hunting Jedi down and all, well you get the picture. Consider this though, what is a Jedi without his light saber? Have you ever thought about it? A jedi who's an expert marksman would be a dangerous foe, and a jedi with a sword is kind of like a samurai... And much to my delight, when you begin the game you DO have force powers.I Want to Learn the Ways of the ForceWhen I heard about how this game was going to have all these new force powers, at first I was irritated. Great, more confusion, more head-scratching and decision making distracting me from the game. But as the game progressed I discovered something wonderful. Instead of forcing you to choose, the game helps you along by making the choices far more obvious. Certain types of Jedi gain certain abilities automatically (bonuses that come from leveling up in a certain style), and certain super-cool powers can only be obtained by types. In other words, a weapons master can't throw lightening around like a jedi master. More choices, but the impossible ones aren't shown, and the crucial ones are automatic. Nice.Fastest Ship in the GalaxyReally you've got to love most of the changes that have been made in this game. The card game has been expanded and so has the racing (and both have gotten a lot more sophisticated). You can break down components, build new ones, create upgrades, choose fighting styles You have three extra levels of Jedi on top of the old for dark side and light side, and dialog options change depending on your skills. Of course the game is also a lot easier on normal now (which some may not like), and there is a lot more soloing this time (which adds to the narrative, but forces you to use certain characters). I particularly loved the fact that Jedi can now equip armor of certain types and still use force powers. That and the fact that I never ran out of money (like I frequenly did in the first game the first time around).From a Certain Point of ViewWhat really makes this game shine though, is the story. Granted, it may not be as ambitious as the first game, and a few critical moments could have been better (I wanted a LONG battle with the main villains, not a quick death for one of us), but on the whole I think the story of this game is better. Essentially you start the game full of questions and end it in a similar way, but along the way to the answers to your main questions you pick up a variety of characters who are just full of surprises, and keep you guessing as to how you should play things out.You can try to get close to one character or another, but inevitably you're going to alienate someone, and as certain characters will give you bonuses as you teach each other various techniques, you're likely to quickly start playing favorites. While some characters will just plain shut up if you have nothing to talk about, and others will allow you (glitch time) to have the same conversations over and over again, on the whole the character interaction is incredible, augmented by some wonderful voice-acting. Depending on what you say and do, you may find yourself with not only a love interest, but a love TRIANGLE, and in this game no one is quite what they seem (even the droids).While the influence you exert over others (turning them light or dark side and opening them up to you) is great, many will doubtless be delighted with the prospect of training their own apprentice(s) in the ways of the Force. There is just something insanely cool about training your own private army of Jedi, don't you think? Of course it can go so many ways depending on how you play...It also seems to me that the characters in this game have a much stronger sense of identity and personal agenda than in the first game, and the conversations feel more personal. In particular I found the new female characters fascinating, as the manipulate Kreia tries to teach you, protect you, and control you, the Handmaiden tries to preach to you, learn from you, and respect you, Mira tries to decypher you, and Visas just plain worships you (or does she?). The frustrating but interesting thing about the characters is that you'll only get certain ones if you are light side/dark side and you can only figure out what they're really up to if you use your powers of persuation in a concentrated effort. And of course there are also characters that will or will not join you depending on whether you are male or female (how about that?). Some people will comepletely overlook this part of the game and not talk to anyone, but they will never understand the true motivations of the characters, and certain won't have any padawan learners to educate in the ways of the force.All in all, the story and characters are pretty great, and definitely worth playing the game through more than once to see the full scope of. Your fist time through will doubtless still leave you wondering about the future at the end of the game, as some big questions are still left unanswered (can you say KOTOR III?).The Droids You're Looking ForAnd then there's the droids. Is it possible for our psychotic assasin droid to get any more sarcastic and cynical (and demented)? And what about our little astromech droid? Now you can converse with the cute little guy the way Luke and Obi-Wan did with R2 (how cool is that?). In addition to these guys though, you also have a floating orb that follows your resident mechanic/melee expert, and a new floating torture/assasin droid that is more than he seems.You Don't Know the Power of the PCOf course there are some nice additions to the X-Box version of this game that bear mentioning. There are mods of every shape and size out there on the Internet that will supposedly allow you to do everything from grabbing Kreia's final attack technique for your own use (three flying lightsabers!), to making your character take on the character model of one of the Sith Lords (a friend of mine bragged that he WAS the dark lord with the Sith mask). And then there's that HUGE mod that will make the game like twice as long (seems pretty ambitious, borderline getting carried away).Add to that the improvements of PC soundcards, video hardware, and monitor resolution and many will say that there is no contest (no graphical slowdowns if you've got the right hardware). Personally I think it all comes down to a question of whether or not you can tolerate playing a game like this with a mouse and keyboard. In the end though, either version of the game will do.I Have a Bad Feeling About ThisThere were times early in the game where I was so incredible sucked-in that I could think of nothing else except that I hadn't played a game I enjoyed this much in ages. The storyline really is that good. There were moments when I thought this was going to be the greatest game I ever played (the flying creature from The Phantom Menace who faked being fooled by my mind-trick was one for the ages, as was Mira's description of how to deal with a guy that a girl likes). Some of the lines characters said were so close to classic Star Wars lines I was laughing hysterically (not to mention some of the wacky things you could say in reply). And no matter how slice it, saving the galaxy, fighting dark lords and wielding light sabers is mighty cool. Sadly though, glitches, gameplay flaws, and weak confrontations with the biggest bosses left this one a bit short of perfect. It's still definitely worth playing though. Especially if you liked the first KOTOR. It's also nice and long. It took me 50 hours to beat the first time through. May the force be with you...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"Ben","summary":"Great game","reviewText":"I am only halfway through the game but already agree on most of the positive reviews. The storyline, cutscenes and voice overs are incredible. The story is not as over the top as Vice City but I find it interesting and waiting to find out what happens next. However if you do not do the story it does get a little boring because of the lack of side missions. Love all the little (but useful) features added to the game like the GPS, cellphone, being able to zoom out on the mini map, calling a cab to get around etc. I really like the new cover system as well, it works pretty good and makes the gunfights so much fun. Though they removed a lot of great features that was in San Andreas eg. car mods, buying property and the casino. There seems to be complaints in regards to the driving in IV but I havent had that problem. I LOVE how the vehicles handle in GTA IV. If you are frustrated with it I would say give it some time, once you get a feel for the driving you will discover that it is probably one of the best parts in the game. Graphics are also pretty good, especially the vehicle lighting and shadows. There are still some jaggies and its not full 1080P but graphics are definitely above average. I really only have two complaints about the game and that is the player movement and motorcycle handling. Motorcycles just plain suck, hard to control and too easy too fall off. Its a chore to use during missions. Lastly Niko's movement is very fluid but too slow. Mainly it takes too long to escape out of a vehicle or get back up from a fall, really sucks in a gunfight or high speed chase. Its only a minor annoyance, I guess thats just the price you have to pay for having better graphics and more realistic movement. Player animation though is very nice, Niko looks wicked sick carrying the carbine or shotgun! In the end its still a great game, definitely lives up to the GTA name.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2009"}

Disgaea so far has been the best strategy RPG series with more levels, characters, weapons, moves than any other game.My first SRPG was Final Fantasy Tactics and the sequels dissapointed me to no end, no other game had the fun of that game till Disgaea.Disgaea 3 offers what the first two give and tons more, you still have the story mode and Item World (a game in itself seriously) \"hero\" units, demon units, monster units who you can name and pair up. Though now you're in a school of demons, a school of chaos, innuendos, sarcasm, explosions, lazy teachers and students sure to fail and be happy about it.Now when you create a character their chance of team attack will be based off where they're seated in the class with another character.There's more \"hero\" units in this game than the other Disgaea games with their own unique look on the netherworld (Hell) more demon units and monster units to make even bigger teams, more insane attacks, and even more damage. (the game has characters doing over 9 million damage!Now you can merge special moves instead of just team attacks, buy moves with mana and special buffs to help your character. You can lift your entire team to make them toss fireballs at a enemy, or use \"Tower Swing\" to fling them around the level while your characters act like a giant whip. Another interesting combat addon is Magichange, where you temporary turn a monster unit into a weapon to give your character boosted stats and new moves only when they're \"fused\".Rant rant rant, it's a great game with only one real flaw, the sprites are not in HD and it's on PS3, some of the sprites have been ported from Disgaea 2. But they did make more frames of animation for the classes they did \"port\" but there's also a lot more classes and characters and some redone all together. And honestly it's not about the graphics in this game, it still looks awesome but might have been more at home on PS2/PSP.The game is easily over 150 hours, you could spend 250 I'm sure it depends on if you're willing to level your characters up to 9,999Lvl. Which could take a while since you can reincarnate characters to 1Lvl to buff their stats with benefits. To add to the game length you can jump into an item and go through levels inside. That may sound weird but it's what you do, you can go inside of a sword, stick of gum, axe and there's levels inside where when you beat them, the item will get better/stronger.Seriously you like turn based RPGs this one is amazing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2008"}

The Japan stages are really intense. The Japanese fighters are very aggressive. They will charge at you bayonets. Now, you have a chance to defend the attacks. When they come up, you can press the R3 button and counterattack by stabbing them in the throat. It will remind players of the counterattacks of the dogs in COD4. Some stages will remind a player of COD4. For example, there is another sniper stage called \"Vendetta. In this stage, the player is a Russia soldier in the middle of Germany. The stage is very similar to COD4's \"All Ghillied Up.\" Of course, the stage is a lot more intense and a heck of a lot more things are going on. I don't want to spoil it for new gamers, though. The cutscenes are very intense. The only thing is that I'm a little tired of WWII games. That is the only reason why I gave the game 4 stars. Still, if you are a COD fan, this game is for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2008"}

What follows is a romanticized sci-fi mini epic that mostly does what it sets out to do. The story is unconventionally structured and open ended enough to give a sense of a larger game world that could be fleshed out further. And the story takes some unexpected turns and like a memorable old school sci-fi story, ends on a soberly ironic note. Art design is a cool mix of asian deco and Flash Gordon style tech... Firefly fans will likely get a charge out of the look, here. In game voicework and music by Nitin Sawhney are top quality.Then there's the gameplay.Enough's been made of linear jumping sections, I didn't have a problem with that so much, I felt it streamlined the action so you could enjoy the scenery more, and the scenery's nice (especially the Manhattan modeled after the 'Life After People' History Channel series).. The combat felt a little loose in the camera, but did manage to convey a sense of heaviness to the swings, so not bad, but not great. The best sequences involve (surprise) using both Trip and Monkey to overcome obstacles. They play well, and even get some emotion going in a few places. Reminiscent of Ico in that you are guiding the girl to safety, but more modern in that she can take care of herself.. except when she's being carried off by some giant creature that you have to chase on your hover board.. err - \"Cloud\".Ok. Must there always be a floaty wobbly thing that steers like a waterbed in sci fi games? Can we commit to not doing the floaty thing anymore? The worser sin of doing chase scenes with them? It's not fun. Stop it. Seriously.And the same goes for the 'green' level. You know the 'green' level? It's in every sci fi fantasy adventure game.. & it's in this one. The puke green industrial level with the toxic ooze and the wrecked machines that offers nothing except another visually uninspired slog to get to the chapter you're trying to get to. More insulting is that the character you meet on the green level in Enslaved is dressed (and acts for the most part) like a pig.. more painfully reminiscent of Beyond Good & Evil since you're already fighting with a bo staff just like Jade. An homage? It doesn't feel like one, it just feels cheap.Those things cost this game some emotional investment, which is bad because mood is where this game succeeds. It's as if the idea of uneasy alliance seems to have penetrated this game down to it's core, but for the worse. For every sequence that bonds you with the characters (the appearance of the 'dogs', the bridge sequence) there were plenty of others including the above-mentioned that would de-invest you back into playing by rote through sequences you felt you played before. So, it's hard for me to strongly recommend this title on gameplay. At all.On the other hand, I felt the art and the overall beauty of this game make it worth playing, if only once. I fully respect what they tried to with the story, and I liked the ending alot.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2010"}

The story was good, all the characters were interesting, the fighting mechanic was different and the sixaxis moments gave it variety.  I didn't mind that it was a short game because there was a lot of content packed in that time-frame.With Enslaved, you have yet another 3rd person hacknslash that adds nothing new...I'd say they actually took a step backwards with the gameplay mechanic.  The levels broken down are just repetitive \"clear the area of enemies\" and \"climb on platform a to b to c\" to advance to the next level where you do it all again. The point of view is too closed in, so you lose sight of enemies at times.  The combat consists of button mashing, maybe dodge here and there.  There are basically no puzzles in the game because each foot-hold is lit up so you know where to advance.  But with all this said, an interesting story and colorful characters would have saved the game, and it has neither.  I won't spoil the story, but the characters consist of an MMA fighter and a prototypical heroine.  Some have said the facial expressions are amazing and that is true, but if that's the selling point for this game, then you may as well watch a movie, because I assure you that the facial expressions are much better on that medium, aside from the Twilight movies.Bottom line...rent or buy/re-sell if possible.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J5UQ","description":"","reviewerName":"eternal now \"roejoerrer\"","summary":"More movie than video game.","reviewText":"There is a lot to love in L.A Noire, from the impressive graphics and acting to the well written story, this game certainly delivers value for your money. However not everything glimmers in this solid but otherwise imperfect crime drama.You play as Cole Phelps, an up and coming cop, honest to the bone and haunted by memories of World War II. Starting as a beat cop you rise the rank and file of the law solving cases and bearing first hand witness to the dark and seedy side of L.A. and life in post-war 1940s. Rockstar Games and Team Bondi spared no expense to bring their vision to life with stunning graphics, a meticulous rendition of Los Angeles, and a story that is just as engaging and gripping as any noire film or novel, filled with deep characters and grisly crime scenes that will definitely stay with you long after you are done playing. L.A Noire sets a precedent that elevates the video game medium into the realm of acting and film more so than any game before. With the use of Motionscan, a process that films actions from many angles with the use of 32 cameras, characters come to life in ways never seen before with realistic facial expressions and movements, adding a whole new realism and believability to the game. In many ways, L.A Noire feels more like an interactive movie than a video game, but it works.Visual: From the faithful rendition of Los Angeles in the 1940s to the character models, everything is meticulously detailed down to the most minute detail. Zoom in on pavement and you will see the individual cracks and wear, zoom in on a face and you will see laugh lines, creases, pock marks, moles, stubble, crows feet....the list goes on. Everything has been superbly detailed and it fits perfectly in a game where you inspect objects and your surroundings. From a match book to a bloody letter found on a victim, every word is clearly legible and every graphic fleshed out. The character models are downright stunning, thanks to Motionscan. Faces are so realistic its unsettling at times yet does well to immerse you into the story and the experience as a whole.Audio: From the old time radio jingles and jazzy 1940s tunes permeating the air waves to the excellent voice acting, L.A Noire is no slouch in the audio department. You can try, but you will not find a mediocre voice actor in this game, not even in the passerby or unimportant dialog that is often found in Rockstar titles, and the cut scene dialog is A list quality, which is no doubt due to actual film and television stars acting the parts and speaking the lines. Aside from the old timey and jazz songs that can be heard there is some amazing ambient music that plays throughout the game. When you are browsing a crime scene the music switches to something more ominous and fitting, when you are on the chase the music is intense, and when nothing much is happening laid back jazz can be heard; its all fitting and accentuates the various moods of the game.Gameplay: I read a review that called L.A Noire the Police Quest for the modern generation, and I have to agree with that statement. The gameplay here is strictly procedural with lots of scene investigation, evidence gathering and questioning of witnesses and suspects. Unlike most of the games associated with Rockstar Games shooting and driving and free roaming take a backseat to story, atmosphere and paced and meticulous police work and overall this is a fairly linear game. You play a good, honest cop, which means you cannot actually shoot at anything other than criminals, and sadly it also means that your character has no time for fun mini games or distractions, so there are none; you cannot even enter any buildings but the ones specified by the current case you are one.  Most of the gameplay involves inspecting the scene of a crime, gathering evidence, questioning witnesses and squeezing the truth out of suspects. While true free roaming would have been welcome the linear pace fits the story and the game quite nicely.Evidence gathering is fun, and you may spend a lot of time looking at red herrings just to make sure you grabbed all the evidence available since having more evidence makes it easier to solve the case. Evidence could be anywhere, and the game does encourage you to think outside the box to find all the clues. The one downside is that a helper was added in the form of audio cues and a vibration in the game controller when you are next to something that you can inspect, making it all too easy to find clues (though this can be turned off in the settings).Questioning witnesses and suspects is where the true heart of the game lies, and this is where I had the most fun during my play through. You ask questions based on evidence and information gathered and based on the responses you receive you can either assume they are telling the truth, withholding information, or downright lying to you. How you proceed directs the conversation and determines what your witness/suspect will divulge. Believe everything that comes out of their mouths and you will certainly miss essential information that can delay the case or mislead you, doubt what they say too much and they will clam up and become a dead end, and accusing them of lying too much and you'll get nowhere; its all about properly gauging the answers and facial expressions of each character you are questioning. This is where the Motionscan pays off, as there would be no way for this game to exist without that technology. As in real life, the characters in L.A. Noire give off visual clues in their facial expressions and body language that will either confirm their answers or betray them. Its all about the little things; if a witness or suspect frequently looks away its usually a sign that they are hiding something, or if they look like they are about to explode with tension its most likely that they are lying to you. This adds a level of depth not seen in any video games up to this point.Combat and driving are the more mundane aspects of L.A Noire. Combat is basically third person shooting with a cover system, and its all rather boring thanks to the aim assist and enemies that die too fast. Combat is way too easy and smacks of hand holding feels more like a chore than anything else. Driving is your basic open world style driving that we've all gotten used to thanks to Grand Theft Auto and its ilk. Not much to be said for either of these two aspects, and frankly they are the weakest portions of the game. One more aspect that you will come across a lot is the chase portions of the game. Frequently, and I do mean frequently you will have to chase a suspect, and it always plays out the same: suspect runs from you, you chase, and you either fire a warning shot or kill them to complete the mission. It happens so much that by the second time I was already tired of it.Since this is a game that bears the name of Rockstar Games on the cover you can expect side missions, however don't expect them to be fun, because they aren't. They mostly involve a robbery of some kind, a chase and a shooting, nothing more. I found them to be rather boring and tacked on to stretch the game out. I would have liked to see some actual variation in the side quests, and this is an area that I felt could have used more development time.My main gripe with this game is that it seems as if it was designed so that you cannot fail. You barely take damage during shootouts, and auto-aim makes sure you get your man. Worse yet, you can completely botch a case and still pass, which makes no sense; there should be consequences for making the wrong decisions or not gathering enough evidence. My other gripe with this game is that its supposed to be based on noire, which means there should be shades of gray with the main character, but there isn't. You play a good cop, and thats it. I would have liked to see some choices given to the player, hard choices that forced you make decisions outside of what is right and wrong, but rather what solved crimes. It would have been nice to be able to choose to play as a bad cop, if only for the noire aspect.Overall, the presentation is great but marred by bland side quests, no fun mini games or distractions and nothing to really do in the sprawling city but go to the next marker on your map. Rockstar Games and Team Bondi spent a lot of time making sure that their representation of post-war L.A was incredibly detailed but you can't actually explore it, its a shame really. Since L.A Noire follows a specific attitude of being an honest cop on a mission the linearity fits, it just would have been nice to have more.Story: There is an over arching story for most of the game but there is also little events that bear no weight to the overall story, however the writing, acting, dialog and atmosphere are so well executed that I think you won't care so much about some grand plot.L.A Noire is an achievement on many levels, from excellent graphics, gameplay that requires you to use your smarts and tests your ability to read facial expressions, to the richly detailed environments and atmosphere. You really get the feeling that you are an officer of the law and your perception skills are put to the test. The game is not perfect, with boring side quests, a huge beautifully rendered city that limits what you can do and interact with, and too much hand holding, but these are minor complaints in comparison to all of the great things. I highly recommend this game as you will get your moneys worth out of it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2011"}

Yes. Are they overpriced due to the fact that you need one to get any real use out of your Vita? Yes. However, you only buy this because you already have a Vita presumably, and so with that in mind, this is the way to go. It will take quite the Vita library to fill this up. So far, the biggest game I have is Uncharted at more than 3 gigs. Everything else was far less. I loaded all the PSPlus \"freebies\" plus Zen Pinball and a couple PSN, PS1, and PSP games and still have more than 19 gigs left on this card. If you bought a Vita bundle, you also ended up with a 4 or 8 gig card (depending on the specific bundle purchased). That combined with this should be sufficient for some time to come in my estimation. I dont anticipate needing to delete any games anytime soon.Note: While this shows as a verified purchase due to my ordering another card for my second Vita, I actually bought my first card at a Best Buy for $78. Currently, they are listed here at around $85.

This is basically the same as the prior incarnations, with a little better graphics and a few new songs, but really all the same bells and whistles. Thats not to say that its bad, but i just wasn't impressed with the handful of interface improvements. I can't describe what differences I expected, but maybe some more explanation of flaws, easier to udnerstand commands or a more responsive character.I do really enjoy the cardio portion. They actually made a new game segment, complete with shadowboxing, kicks, and it can be a seriously grueling workout if you do a 30' run. Also included is a very nice, tai chi esque cooldown, so the game won't allow you to just collapse in a puddle and set yourself up for an agonizing next few days.One serious flaw that I can't figure out how to get around is the game is hard-wired for 4 players. This means rather than have half of the viewing area for the Kinect, your have a slice, a very narrow slice, of the screen. Added to this is some of the songs include portions that're strictly two player dances that have you wander around, and you basically can't get back into your own slice without some kind of marker.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2013"}

I loved the story because the player got to play as Big Boss in the 1964 setting. Of course, there is no modern weapons, here. The games focus was all about survival in the wilderness. It kind of reminded me of Rambo because you had to kill animals and store them for food. Not only that, injuries sustained must be healed. Every boss battle was extremely tough, especially against \"The End\", which was a sniper. This sniper battle was like no other of any game. The cutscenes throughout the game came at good times because it enhanced the story and gameplay. The story really kept me at the edge of my seat, especially close to the end.

It's very much GTA-esque.  Within the game you hack into ctOS, the centralized system that manages much of the future Chicago which allows you to do things like change intersection lights on demand, open drawbridges, character recognition and much more through your trusty cell phone. This opens up a whole world of sub possibilities to you including stealing money from people's bank accounts, snooping in on their phone conversations which leads to side bar tasks like stopping crimes and picking up money drop offs.Completing these side missions earns you skill points reputation.  The skill points you can convert into a number of skills like the ability to open draw bridges, block radio communications, unlock cars etc.Throughout the city are a number of ctOS towers that you can hack that will give you points of interest on your map that you can visit and interact with.  Throughout the city are a number of sub games including chess and follow the ball (not sure what this is actually called) which increase your skill points as well.Of course there are multiple weapons and weapon types that you can buy.  Playing the game, you have multiple choices on how you wish to complete a mission.  You can go in guns blazing, wipe out all the opposition and reach your target or you can use your cell phone to hack into the numerous cameras positioned around the city and use these to trigger things like car alarms which will distract your opponents, explode power generators to kill nearby opponents and help you sneak into your target area.It seems that virtually the whole of Chicago is mapped out which gives you quite a large playing area to play in.Overall the gameplay is very much GTA-esque but with some hacking type puzzles and sneaking thrown in for good measure. The biggest disappointment for me so far is the handling of the cars.  Apart from speed, the cars all seem to handle in the same way and not really in a good way either, not realistic.The graphics on the game (Xbox one and PS4 versions) are very good with smooth animation virtually non-existent load times as you travel around the map.  Sound is also very good although some of the dialog within the game is bad to the point of laughable.It's a polished open world game with lots to do that will give you many hours of enjoyment and you will want to come back to unlock the next ctOS tower, or further the main campaign just to see what happens next however it's not up to the standard of GTA.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2014"}

The opening sequence switches between an intense swordfight between the game's hero, Squall, and his archenemy, Seifer, and scenes of Squall's soon to be lover, Rinoa, dancing through a field of flowers. It's artfully done, and very exciting. However, the results of said battle are underwhelming. Both men receive as wounds a scratch on the cheek, which happens to deliver Squall to the hospital. And so, in a matter of moments, the game switches from awesome to disappointing that its hero is such a wimp. Despite some triumphs in the graphics area, FF8's lame story, uninteresting characters, and step away from the traditional RPG norm make it a forgettable experience.The main problem comes from the game's plot, which wouldn't be so bad if cutscenes weren't so long and there weren't boring and cliched characters populating the story (the only non-human characters in the game are enemies). Squall is a Cloud wanna-be, only he takes his role a little too far. He becomes an emo, depressed teenager who delves too much into his own thoughts to notice that the game's three beautiful female characters all have feelings for him. Right. Squall, along with his archenemy Seifer, is a student at a school called SeeD, whose purpose is to train teens to fight and undergo secret missions. Seifer is a much more childish version of the frightening Sephiroth from FF7. He bullies fellow students by calling them \"chicken-wuss,\" rebels by not wearing the school uniform, and intimidates his teacher. Just an immature little punk if you ask me. The other characters include Quistis, the teacher barely older than her students; Zell, the friend easily fumed by such comments as \"chicken-wuss;\" Selphie, the vivacious girl who tries to be so cute and air-headed it's annoying; Irvine, the cliched ladies' man that can't get the ladies; and last but not least, Rinoa - who finally gets Squall out of his thoughts of himself and into thoughts of her. I would have liked it more if the characters were mature teenagers rather than your cliched self-absorbed ones.FF8 takes a stab at a rather unique combat system, which is great, but the problem is it doesn't work very well. You don't get money or weapons the traditional way. The money part is pretty neat. You earn a weekly paycheck through employment with SeeD, and you earn more money by being promoted to a higher rank. The weapons part is a problem, however. The only way to earn stronger weapons is by taking material to junk shops and having it made into a weapon. The problem is the game doesn't give you these items very easily. You can only retrieve these items by fighting monsters that have what you need. Problem is, you can't know what monsters have which items unless you glue yourself to a strategy guide. For those who want to play the game without a guide, or those who don't want to spend their time fighting monsters and hoping they'll drop the item you need, you'll probably finish the game still equipped with the game's weakest weapons.Not upgrading your weapons means you'll only do minimal damage with them, so you will want to look to other sources of damage. There is magic, but magic doesn't operate on MP and is limited. It's more like a usable item, and the only way to get higher quantities of said items is by drawing it from enemies. Plus, if you junction certain spells to your characters, you most likely don't want to use those spells in combat. That leaves the Guardian Forces. These summons can do a lot of damage, and while you are waiting for them to be summoned, they protect the summoner from attacks. The GFs will carry you through the game, though they have the drawback of having to sit through sometimes lengthy summon sequences every battle. Making matters worse is the experience system. Every 1000 experience points earns your character a level, but the worst part is that enemies grow levels with you. This wouldn't be so bad, but it means random battles last longer than they should. Random battles tend to be tedious as they are, so it's awful when a game adds to that tedium.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-28-2013"}

When a great RPG company like Squaresoft, who been making the best RPG's for years now, comes in and makes a game, people expect it to be great!!!  Esspecally if it's a Final Fantasy game!  Well let me tell you that Final Fantasy VIII is anyting BUT a great RPG!!!  In fact this game is so pooryly thought out I am at a loss of words!  I'm sure you've already herd complaints about the complicated battle system, cumcumber (And glitched) plot, and lack of charicter developement!  So I'll spare you the details for once!  Lets just say Final Fantasy VIII not only gives the Final Fantasy series a bad name, but it also gives RPG's as a whole a bad name!  Thank you.  Have a nice day!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2001"}
{"product_name":"B000FRS9II","reviewerName":"PS2 Bruce","summary":"It's OK. But I don't like it...","reviewText":"First I'm not a fanboy. I own a 360 (21 games) an original XBOX (61 games) games) and a PS2 (49 games). I had always gamed on my computer, but purchased a PS2 so I could play GTA-Vice City, then about a year after that, got my XBOX; and then this summer, my 360 (purchased so that I could play Saint's Row). I like all kinds of games, and I have most of the major releases, for all 3 platforms for about the last 3 years. I also will admit for a few of my most favorite games, I will buy other versions, to get other content, etc (I own all 3 platforms of Godfather, the game, lol). I do want to get a PS3 when they are more widely available, probably will wait till the summer like I did for the 360. Plus there will be more games for it then, I'm sure. With my boring background out of the way, here's my review:Last week I picked up a bunch of new games for my 360-Gears of War was the first one I tried out. OK well, I wasn't that impressed. Visuals were pretty good, but it seemed like the couple-of-humans-trapped-in a small area-by huge aliens-type story like Alien or things like that. I don't like the fact you can't control your crouching/wall cover more; although I guess with time I could get used to the movements. One thing I noticed everyone else say was, hey you can't jump...myself, I think they made it like that on purpose--if a human soldier was carrying all that equipment (in real life it would be at LEAST 150lbs of pack/weapons/armor), obviously, he wouldn't be able to jump very high, lol. In fact, quite honestly I always thought the fact you COULD jump like a jumping bean in HALO, with that armor/enviro suit on, was kind of silly, but, that's just me I guess.Anyway, maybe part of the problem is, it's me, i.e. I'm not too good at this type of shooter, i.e. the quake/doom/unreal type game rather than the GTA/Saints Row/Godfathe type game. It was frustrating to be stuck in the same place (where the enemy species is cutting through that door), and, even though I'm taking cover, etc, being killed in like 10 to 15 seconds. The weapons you have at this stage don't seem to do too much damage to the enemy either, or maybe I'm not hitting them in the right places. I read somewhere, take their knees out first becuase their thorax is heavily armored, tried that, still got killed. Maybe once I got the machine gun with the saw bayonet I'd score more kills, I dont know. To me, right now, this game seems too frustrating-the enemies are too strong and the weapons are too weak. Again, this could just be my poor skills, just my opinion, but I don't think I'm going to spend too much time on this one.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2006"}

Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"Another homerun for Double Fine","reviewText":"You can always count on Double Fine when you need a game that really deviates from the norm. Run by the legendary Tim Shafer, their games are about as unique and funny as they come and Brutal Legend is no different. Sometimes, however, Brutal Legend can seem to be a style-over-substance affair, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. This game's style is so completely rad and over the top that it can't help but overshadow the gameplay at times, and that is a good thing.First off, the game's strength: the art direction. Imagine taking every epic metal album cover you've ever seen, combined with Frank Franzetta's paintings, Norse Mythology, Conan the Barbarian, and anything else you can think of that is metal related. If you associate it with headbanger music, this game has it in some form and it is a very faithful, loving tribute to all things metal. Then, dial up the testosterone to 11. Seriously, this game is epic! The environments really steal the show, and there's a lot of variety. Metal music is a huge category of music, with tons of sub-genres that all fall under its umbrella. This game features it all, from 1970's Black Sabbath era attitude and visuals, to an area that is all goth-black-death-metal. The characters and creatures all appropriately represent all of heavy metals's variety as well. It's pretty cool.Since the premise of the game is hugely based on a genre of MUSIC, the soundtrack is pretty awesome. I personally enjoy SOME styles of Metal music, but not all. In general, it isn't a kind of music I find myself seeking out in my personal life. Still, I really enjoyed it in this game. It also features the voice talent of Jack Black as the main character. He did a really great job at furthering the charm of the game. It also has some of Metal's biggest figures in real life as well. Lemmy Kilmister(Motorhead), Rob Halford (Judas Priest), Lita Ford (The Runaways), and Ozzy Osborne are all in here, and they do a fantastic job at bringing life to their respective characters, who are already very likable and fairly deep. I was pleasantly surprised. The writing, as you would expect from Double Fine, is both charming and hilarious. The story in this game is campy and funny at times and surprisingly poignant and touching in others. I was very impressed by it. Great job Double Fine!The gameplay is by far Brutal Legend's weakest point. It's not bad at all, but it really isn't that great. Brutal Legend is a long island iced tea combination of gameplay ideas. In this game, you'll be playing an open-world game, a real time strategy game, a hack n' slash, a music rhythm game, a racing game, and several others. It all really comes across as s a jack-of-all-trades but master of none, and that's not necessarily a bad thing, but it doesn't match the quality of the rest of the game. It is worth noting that fact going in.Now for the problems I have: There is hardly any variety to the tasks to do outside of the story (hunt this animal, race this guy, shoot a mortar at these bad guys, defend this base, and of course, collectables), but the game sort of requires a bit of it. The tasks aren't poorly executed or bad in themselves, but there's hardly any variety and you'll quickly tire of performing them. Unfortunately, if you want the points to level your magical guitar, axe, hot-rod, character, etc, you have to do them. Also, this game is very, very short without the paltry diversions, about half the length I expected and would have liked. Still, these are minor qualms, and overall this game is one worth enjoying.Overall, this is a game that exceeds in its art direction, audio, story, characters, and falls a bit short in its gameplay execution, gameplay variety, and length. Does that mean this game is not worth getting? Absolutely not! The strengths of this game are so excellently implemented that the good definitely outweigh the bad, but not enough to keep it from losing a single star. I'd still buy this game and recommend doing so for anybody out there that is interested. For metal fans, this game is a no brainer. Get it. For those that are a fan of Double Fine, get it. For the greater number of people who aren't fans of metal or don't know who Tim Shafer is, I'd still recommend it. It's a very lighthearted, unique experience, and a breath of fresh air from the constant barrage of sameness in games these days. Buy it, headbang to it, bring the enemies of metal to their knees with its awesomeness!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2011"}

Gildart","summary":"Still Playing This One","reviewText":"UPDATE:  Two Years Later My Son and I Both Revisit These Games Frequently ENough to Make This One of the Best Values Ever for a Pokemon GameOriginal Review:  I have been playing these games with my now-10-year-old son since he was three (I bought used GBCs and color pokemon games and let him figure it out - he also learned to read). Together, we have gone through the Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance, the Sinnoh games, and Heart Gold/Soul Silver. I almost didn't buy a copy of Pokemon Black, because the games had been getting kind of stale for me. My son still loves them (as do his classmates - if you have a fourth grade boy on your gift list, and he doesn't already have this? You will be making a little boy ecstatic.Anyway, my son really wanted me to play, and I gave in a bit reluctantly, but, now that I'm playing the game, I love this iteration for the following reasons:1. I do not want to spoil the storyline, but the antagonists' issues and ethical positions are fairly sophisticated. Team Plasma is actually asking some interesting questions about trainers' relationships with their pokemon. Those questions also apply to our own relationships with other (real) creatures here in our world.2. The smack-talk from rivals and other trainers is toned way down from generations past.3. The game helps you along, which makes it much less frustrating (at least for me). For example, before each of the three gym battles I've done so far, you get an opportunity to get a pokemon who has a helpful type and a high enough level to ensure that you don't spend a ton of time fighting and re-fighting the same battles.4. The graphics are really amazing for a handheld game, and the towns have lots to do besides gym battling, so your kid isn't likely to beat this game in a day and toss it aside. You get your money's worth.5. There are new battle modes, new pokemon, new ways of interacting with friends in person and over the Wifi Connection. Nintendo also made Black and White just different enough from each other to make it worthwhile to purchase and play both.I deducted one star because my game cartridge arrived glitchy. In the first battle, my pokemon, a female Oshawott could not execute any attacks. Every time I selected an attack, the game went to a screen describing the attack and showing my trainer statistics. I had to shut down the game and restart several times, all with the same result (except never again did I get a female starter), before I decided to try cleaning the cartridge, which worked (use a q-tip and rubbing alcohol gently to clean the game cartridge and let it dry completely). This is the first time since the Gameboy color games (which I bought used) that I have had a quality control issue with a pokemon game.I recommend this game for kids who enjoy the anime and the other rpg and for adults who either want to play along with their children or enjoy gentle (mostly) nature/environmental-themed rpgs. It's fun and has good replay value for the money.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2011"}

InAge of Mythologyheroes do battle with monsters of legend, and the gods intervene in the affairs of mortal men.Age of Mythologyplayers wage war as leaders of a Greek, Norse, or Egyptian civilization with a customized pantheon. Players use human armies and diplomacy, progress through development ages, enhance military and economic performance with improvements, and manage economics through resource gathering and trade. Mythology enters the mix when players call upon the gods to act on their behalf or reinforce their armies with more than 20 mythological creatures such as jackal-headed Egyptian warriors or mighty minotaurs.Age of Mythology's revolutionary 3-D engine provides the game with gorgeous environments featuring lifelike rolling terrain, beautiful waves and water, realistic sunlight, and lush forests. The units roaming these environments are incredibly detailed, move naturally over the terrain, and come to life through hundreds of fluid animations. Amazing special effects change the look of this beautiful world when the gods get involved: all grows dark as an eclipse takes effect, funnel clouds twist and grow as a tornado sends buildings spinning toward the heavens, and meteors streak in from the heavens to send people and armies flying.An entertaining tutorial, an intuitive interface, and logical game rules allow anyone to quickly and easily learn to play. Once started, there is a lot to explore: an epic 36 scenario single player campaign, easy-to-use multiplayer gaming online, single player games against the challengingAge of MythologyAI opponents, more than 15 different random map types that help make the game infinitely replayable, nine highly differentiated civilizations, multiple difficulty levels to allow players of any skill level to have an enjoyable game, and a fully functional scenario editor.Age of Mythologyoffers something for everyone: a fun game for any playing style or skill level.","reviewerName":"mdizzog","summary":"Mythology should be spelled \"Empire\"","reviewText":"While at the mall, I was pretty bored of most strategic games. So I picked up Age of Mythology thinking I would be treated to a great gift. But now I have mixed feelings for the game.It is just like ages of empires. The resources are the same and gathering them are the same. But there is a new one called favor. To buy myth units or certain upgrades you need favor. For the Greeks you pray at a temple, Egyptians build monuments, and Norse fight. The Greeks are basically the regular race. The main one in the game. They are okay, but kinda boring after a while. The Egyptians have cool god powers, and do not really need to chop wood for any reason. The Norse are the best, they have the best units and can build quickly with their army. While playing online, Norse always dominate because they build several fortresses right outside your town then attack. Because Norse build buildings with their infantry, they have a huge advantage. But their godpowers are not that great compared to the other races.God powers are given to you when you advance an age. If you advance to a new age you get to pick a minor god to worship, and each god has its own god power. Most of the god powers are kinda lame, and you can just waste. Zeus has a lighting bolt which kills one unit, but does not kill main units in the story, so it has no point. The only good ones are meteor, tornado, plenty vault, and earthquake. Meteor and tornado are the best Egyptian god powers, because they decimate areas of buildings. Earthquake and plenty vault rock. Earthquake belongs to the Greek and totally destroys every building in an area. Plenty vault also belongs to the Greek and provides a steady resource flow.But the fighting gets old. The unit selection is awesome, but still, norse will win. Norse have the best units and just rock. Egyptian do not need alot of wood, so they can be good. Greek needs everything and the only rewarding experience is the 2 god powers I mentioned above. If you truly love ages of empire you can like this game. Most missions result in you killing one unit, then going on to the next mission and rebuilding your base all over. So the campaign gets really frustrating. Especially on moderate where the attacks are constant. In all seriousness, if you want to buy this game go ahead, but please wait till it is on sale.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2002"}

It has the pace of an RPG but without any of the aspects that make time consuming games like that worth the time investment (like level building and character, weapon, and armor depth).  The plot is okay but the game controls are sloppy (controlling the helicopter is such a farce I was in disbelief) and the driving around and around for hours is SO dull and tedious I had to quit the game about a third of the way through before I went insane (and a third of the way through was 15 hours!).  The graphics are well below par for the 360 as well.  The voice acting is about the only bright spot.  My only conclusion is that people are mindless sheep that believe hype and have no standards because this game overall is not good.  So, thanks a lot all you imbecilic GTA drones for giving this over-hyped pile 5 stars and convincing me to waste my time and money.  Also, Rockstar games can go take a leap for somehow making this continually unimpressive series  a bestseller (I have played every GTA game, and other than number 3 which was okay, the rest are flat out boring...yes, even Vice City, which other than the '80s music was B-O-R-I-N-G).  I am done with them permanently.  I could even go into the absurdity of the violence, not that it offends me, but that it is just preposterous to even make games where a guy can get away with mayhem on such a massive scale and not be killed or tossed in jail forever.  Lame.  I mean, really though, this game compared to Halo 3, Bioshock, Dead Space, Modern Warfare 2, Ninja Gaiden 2, Mass Effect, or even Crackdown?  They may not be apples to apples comparisons, but GTA 4 falls far behind these games in graphics, storyline, pace, and very important to me, controls.  I hate nothing more in video games than poor controls (this isn't 1986 NES days anymore...ARGH!).  I am a high-standard type individual so dismiss this review at your own peril of wasting time.

So months down the road i ended up buying a PS3 and saw that the physical copies were about to release. Since i still don't have anything high speed, purchasing the rest of the episodes from Live would take forever so i decided to buy the PS3 version of the game since i've read so many bad reviews on the 360 version. I must admit, it does stutter the words at times and lags more than i would like it to but it's definitely not unplayable like the 360 version. Ok, so there was the part where you had to choose between **** or ****** that lagged so much that it was almost impossible to progress further but i just had to react a little faster than normal. The game freezes alot and i was expecting all of this before i purchased it because i've purchased Tell Tale's BTTF game so i know how their imports turn out. I'm on episode 4 at the moment and so far, so good. It's a good game but not intended for fans of FPS's who are trigger happy. This game should be bought by fans of the series or people who like a good story or both. It's not a long game and you could definitely beat it in one sitting if you get wrapped up in it. It's definitely violent with some gore moments so viewers discretion is advised. This game is all about making choices and by doing so, you're creating your own unique storyline. There's also alot of vulgar language involved. Lots of F bombs. I personally like the game. I can't speak for everyone else. There's not much replay value unless you want to replay all 5 ep's again choosing different things to say and do to somewhat alter your first playthrough. That's about it. Once you beat it, it might not be played again because next year the new and improved Walking Dead video game will be relased and i heard it's going to be way better in terms of looks and gameplay so this one will collect dust eventually. It's a one player game obviously so there is no online play involved but you do get to see the percentage results of major choices you made after each episode. Thus, comparing your choices to other players.  It's definitely worth the rental. Although it lags at times, it's still not as bad as the 360 version and i'm sure there will be patches accordingly so because of that, i will still give it 5 stars!UPDATE:I found a glitch in this game. An annoying one. Ok, on the second episode, when it comes to the part where you have to give the axe to either Mark or Larry, don't give it to Larry! I was restarting the game for a second playthrough making different choices from what i made during my first playthrough and all was fine until the second episode. The first time i played the game, i gave the axe to Mark but the second time, i gave it to Larry. When it comes time for Larry to actually use the axe to kill the legless zombie that attacks Lee from the truck, he doesn't respond. He just watches Lee die repeatedly. For those that know the story, Lee and Larry don't get along so seeing Larry letting him die isn't out of character but the problem is Lee has to survive because he is the main character and you can't process further without Larry's defense. I had to replay that particular part a few times to makes sure it wasn't a mistake on my end and it wasn't. Hopefully it gets patched up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2012"}

The graphics and sound effects are great. The character development is better than any which I have ever seen (I played AD&amp;D for the last twenty years, and I think that D2 has developed a better character system). The game is divided into four acts (five with expansion). The first three acts are fun, challenging, and not too hard. The fourth and fifth acts are just rediculously difficult. I find myself running my characters around in the third act in an attempt to beef them up, only to still find them far too weak to stand up to the hordes of far-too-difficult monsters in the fourth act.The only reason I have even SEEN the fifth act is because I have some &quot;hacked&quot; characters, which are ultra-powerful (one is a 93rd level paladin with about 3500 HP, and yes he has been killed on the hell difficulty level).The difficulty goes to the extreme with the Nightmare and Hell difficulty levels, and I don't know how anyone could ever beat them. A typical monster has over 1000 hp, and does hundreds of points of damage. At the same time, the experience point demands for advancing levels becomes sky-high.

Recht","summary":"I'm in an undead state of mind","reviewText":"This game alone was the reason I went with the Xbox 360. Well, that and looking forward to Halo 3--which I still haven't gotten around to buying. I'm a hardcore zombie fan, so anything with undead as title characters is a sure sell with me.So the story picks right up and sucks you in. There isn't a lot to distract you in the cutscenes besides Carlito's ridiculous getup. The voice acting is good and the directing's great. Some of them, especially a bit with a security feed, do an excellent job of setting up the atmosphere.After several minutes of plot, you're set loose in the mall. Great care was taken to make sure that combat with the zombies is fun. It never, ever gets old. Just about anything you could lift in real life can be used as a weapon--sometimes even other zombies.But you don't get overconfident, because anyone who's played this through will tell you: sometimes, when a zombie hits you, that's all she wrote--because you'll stagger out of control right into another hit, then right into a bite, then into another hit, and then you're dead.Still, aside from achievements, there's not much to actually gain from killing zombies. There's a small PP (exp) bonus for every 500 and a few special kill count bonuses, but that's small potatoes next to what you earn for rescuing survivors, so concentrate on that and dodge the rotters. Save those (and many other) achievements for Infinity Mode, when you're not on the clock.The two normal story modes, in which Frank tries to stay alive until rescue -and- get the story of the zombies rising, can be terribly stressful. The game's total playing time is 8 hours, so it's pretty short, and you really feel that trying to get from place to place in the mall. You want to rescue survivors, or kill zombies, or maybe you'd like to explore the mall--sorry, no time. The end result is you feel a bit rushed.Oh, and Otis Must Die. This character calls you unceasingly with useless observations about where you are. Sometimes it's worth answering--he might tell you about a survivor--but not often. To make matters worse, you can't attack or jump while he's talking to you. And he loves to call you while you're in the middle of a crowd of zombies.Infinity Mode, on the other hand, is grand fun. In this mode it's Frank versus the world and the dreaded clock is gone. The only point is to survive for as long as you can. This gives you all sorts of opportunities to experiment and play around. I unlocked a lot of my achievements using this mode. I can also occupy myself for quite a while building forts out of random objects and seeing how long they hold off the zombies. This mode just never gets old. Can't stress that enough. The best thing about playing through the main storyline is unlocking this game mode.All in all, this is worth having in your collection. Not the shining star I was hoping for, but well worth my investment.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2008"}

But this old school Star Wars epic game takes you back to the late seventies and early eighties classics with it's environments, characters and music.The puzzles are annoying at times, and although logical, can be hard to figure out without some help. Later on in the game they get a bit easier and more intuitive though, and when you obtain the light saber after going through the various trials, the game really takes-off.Luckily the puzzles add to the game rather than take away from it, and add more than just \"point and shoot\" action like most FPS games.The levels are huge, dark, and scream Star Wars at every turn. You'll see a number of familiar characters such as Greedo's race, Luke Skywalker, AT-AT's, X-wing fighters, tons of wonderfully rendered Stormtroopers and their officers, among others.The music is classic Star Wars' fare with booming, theatrical sound and increases in intensity as the action picks up depending on what you are doing.The lightsaber is so much fun as you can go through most of the game using it to slay tons of enemies or focus on your weapons if you'd like.  There are trip mines, a sniper gun, an automatic laser weapon and many other gadgets to work with. Then there are the force powers, choke holds, push and pull, and force speed, all which are incredibly well done and add even more to the already varied arsenal of weapons and options at your disposal.  The first time I put a choke hold on a poor sap, then quickly did a force push on him in mid-air, watching him fly screaming over an edge into oblivion, I felt like standing up and applauding.You really do feel as though you are in an old-school Star Wars movie, and unlike the previus Jedi Knight games, Raven has used the latest Quake III technology to render great looking models and textures that bring it all to life on your screen.The story is meaningful and well done, driving you to the end of the game to see what happens.  And Billy Dee's cameo appearance and voice overs are a treat as well.If you like action/FPS games, this one is easy to recommend.  And if you grew up watching Star Wars movies, you are in for a real treat.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2002"}

Gimli uses his powerful axes to attack in close range combats, and throws his axes to attack from long distances. Aragorn uses his mighty sword to attack in close range combats, and throws arrows from his bow to attack from long distances. Legolas uses his cool swords (two of them) to attack in close range combats, and uses arrows from his bow to attack from long distances. These weapons can be up-graded while you progress in the game. For example, the arrows can be up-graded into fire arrows, which give more damage. Each character has his stats in a different way: Legolas is the fastest in throwing arrows and attacking, but he is the weakest (if an enemy attacks him, he will lose more life than the rest of the crew). Gimli is the strongest, but he is the slowest of all. Finally, Aragorn is all-round, which means he has all his stats equal or similar.Once you begin your journey, you will have to battle two mayor events from the Fellowship of the Ring: The Mines of Moria and the final battle against the trolls (at the end of the movie).

Yes, it employs the standard mechanics of most third person shooters (cover, blindfire, melee, squad commands) but the story is what really distinguishes this title.When I first started playing this game, I admit, I was fairly disappointed because it didn't seem to offer anything that I hadn't seen before.  But then a curious thing happened.  The story slowly started to put my head in a chokehold and would not let go.  This is the problem I have with some of the games out there in the market.  Story seems to have taken a back seat to extensive set piece sequences rather that the other way around.  Granted, Spec Ops has more than a few of these sequences, but they come from a natural progression of the story.What started off as standard action movie fare, slowly unraveled in a story of horror and madness.  That seems like an overly dramatic statement but that's what I felt as the game continually bombards you with images of violence and questionable moral perspectives under the theme that even the most honorable of men are capable of doing evil things.  For a military shooter, this is pretty groundbreaking.  Your enemies aren't just faceless sprites that you pick off one by one as you pump your fists in the air.  In Spec-Ops, they are just as human as you and I.  I didn't feel good playing this game, and I say that with the highest compliment.  It was the equivalent of seeing a car crash in slow motion: you can't tear your eyes away from it and you know it's not going to end well, but you're fascinated nontheless.A couple of gripes that I have is that the game mechanics are very dated.  There's not a lot of innovation and quite frankly, the Gears of War series, a comparable genre, does it better.  The animations are a bit stiff and don't get me started on the enemy AI.  They flank, which is a good thing, but more often than not, they will start shooting at you out in the open which makes them too easy to kill.  The game is also fairly short at 5-6 hours.  Some may not be able to justify a full retail purchase for a game that you can complete in an afternoon, but the game's story convinced me that it was worth the price.I really like this game.  It's not as polished as it could have been, but I'm glad the developer has taken the time to focus on narrative which distinguishes it from most shooters these days.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-28-2012"}

Sail the seas with your crew, upgrade your ship to the top of its class and terrorize the Caribbean with your arsenal of weapons and skills. The free roaming of this game is excellent, especially when your crew sings shanties while you are sailing. I do wish they added the song Shiver my Timbers from Muppets Treasure Island.The game does bring the usual fight of the Templars vs Assassins but it is very minimal that it barely affects the gameplay of it. It doesn't feel forced but it doesn't feel like it's needed. Especially when you have to leave the Animus for main quests outside of the game. You are being led by Desmonds friends inside Abstergo Entertainment to find intel and information for them, so there will be a bit of hacking included. This part I feel takes away from the experience of the game.The graphics and sound are superb especially when sometimes you feel you are actually on a ship seeing the waves move very well. The lightning and thunder are so spot on that make you enjoy the game a lot.I've yet to finish the game since I keep pirating more than just rushing through it.

The game kind of reminds me of many shooters....Like: BLACK, or KILLZONE, or something like that...I DO like the game, it's fast paced, and fun to play, however, I can see myself getting bored with it quickly...Just like I did with Black & Killzone.Overall, the game is kind of repititious, fighting the same bad guys on & on & on, and even on the easy level, the game can be a bit on the tough side (at least for me) Then again, I'm not always into these types of games. I'm more into War-related games like SOCOM, Call of Duty, etc.......Now, many people think it's a great game, and I certainly agree, it is a great game. The graphics are awesome, the music soundtrack is great, the shooting, the blood...etc etc etc....(don't get me wrong, I love bloody games!)

This console epitomizes the meaning of quality in gaming consoles in almost every way, even much more so when compared to the faulty, hardware failure prone console that is the xbox 360.For starters this is the most powerful console out there, technologically speaking, it is way above the Xbox 360 and the Wii, so we will be seeing a lot potential being drawn out of it, for much longer than any of it's competitors.Secondly it is the console with more features for your home and family. PS3 surprises you with the amount of things you can do with it, not only does it have an excellent repertoire of awesome games, it is your key to non-gaming home entertainment, with its integrated blu-ray player, which is the new standard for movies, meaning high definition movies, you can take a pause from gaming and throw in a HD movie and enjoy it in a level of quality DVD cannot offer. Maybe you also have some movies in your PC that you have downloaded?, no problem, the PS3 can also act as a media server, meaning you can access from the comfort of your PS3, all the movies you've downloaded and watch it in your TV with little to no effort.Also you have FREE access to the PSN network, which is your gateway to movie downloads, game demos, trailers, online gaming, while this is free in the PS3, it is NOT for the xbox 360, as you are forced to pay an annual fee for these same things, no thank you...And while we're talking about fees, PS3 also has an integrated wireless adapter so you don't have to bother with cables when connecting your PS3 to the internet, Xbox 360 makes you pay 100 bucks for this same adapter, which you can only buy from them.Also with your PS3 you are free to buy any hard drive you want and switch it over very easily, sony even encourages the practice, the xbox on the other hand can only use microsoft designed hard drives, which are way above market price, forcing you to buy from them or not buy at all.These and many other points put PS3 way above its competitors, it offers you the power, the features, the flexibility and the zero fee services that competitors simply do not provide. It doesn't get any better than this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2009"}

It is so disconnected with all of the previous content in any of the games that it makes it feel like you are not even playing the same game. I dont even know how they thought this ending would make sense (yes there are 3 endings but they are all the same). It is complete garbage. Nothing in it makes any sense after you are done with Cerberus. None of the characters matter and there is no real resolution with harbinger or The Allucit Man. It becomes some kind of BS indirect ending that was never hinted being possible but just shoved down our thoats like we would just accept it....i dont give this game a 1 or 2 because it is actually a fun game but I understand why people have. We have commited hours upon hours to this series to have such a terrible ending....Some additional things. I feel bad for those that dont have the DLC cause he is a major character with major plot lines associated with him. Also I dont think they did as good of a job with the character development in this game compared to the previous. The new characters do not have as much substance to them and most of the old ones barely give anything additional to the story. It is like they just have conclusions to their ME2 characters. There are a few exceptions like Tali and Miranda. But most characters just feel like add on's. More of the story is focused on the larger scale effects to the characters not the personal aspects like previous games.Also in my mind there is no way to do DLC unless it effects the ending. I am not going to go back like the game takes you after you beat it to before the Cerberus conflict and do DLC. It is pointless.In closing it was a good attempt by BIOWARE and ME1 and ME2 are fantastic but I dont think they new how to do an ending that would actually use all the pieces to this game. Instead they gave us a disconnected ending that was just lazy and wrecks the game.Update:The new endings are better. Destroy is well done and probably the most effective ending to the series. Control is good and a little dark. Synthesis is kind of goofy now. The 4th option they could have explored a little more because there could have been some depth there but it is funny to me. This game is still not a 5 star game. Especially compared to 1 and 2 but it is worth playing now and an acceptable conclusion now.2nd update:Played through the first game again and most of the 2nd one. Put my review back to 3 stars. Beyond the improved combat this game just does not stand up against the other two. The story just shuts down the other 2 games. The enemy should have been harbinger not the star child. He does not even say anything in the last game. When he was the main protagonist of the first 2 games. He was like the emperor in Star Wars and we were given no conclusion. the star child was a joke and the updates are only acceptable based on being ok with the star child. Also the third game does not come close to the character developement of the second game and it just shuts down all that you worked for with the crew from ME:2. EA and Bioware have will not be part of my game purchases going forward.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2012"}

Fire upSoul Calibur, and instantly you'll appreciate that the graphics and gameplay are even better than in the arcade version. AndSonic Adventure, with its light-speed gameplay, is sure to wow even the most jaded gamer.It's amazing that such a small machine (it's about the size of your mouse pad) can deliver such incredible performance. Chalk it up to superior engineering. Dreamcast's only downside is that it comes with only one controller and a demo disc. In order to truly take advantage of Dreamcast's capabilities, we recommend outfitting the controller with a Jump Pack and a Visual Memory Unit. Getting one or more extra controllers is also a good idea, because some of the best Dreamcast games support up to four players at once.Why it's so cool:Ultramodern components:Custom-made video, audio, and processor technology blows away the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation and puts Dreamcast in the same league as PS2 and XBox.Integrated modem:In another video-game first, Dreamcast comes with a 56K modem. Use your regular Internet service provider and the separately sold keyboard to access e-mail, shopping, and the World Wide Web. Not only can you upload high scores, participate in chat discussions, and download updates and enhancements for your games, but, through a membership to the SegaNet Internet service provider, you can playQuake III Arena,NFL 2K1, and other games against Dreamcast owners over the Internet.The Visual Memory Unit (VMU):More than just a memory card, the VMU is a miniature portable game system that fits inside a controller--so its LCD screen is easily seen by you but hidden from your opponent.All-in-one entertainment:It plays games. It plays audio CDs. It connects to the Internet and lets you browse the Web or e-mail friends. Our note to the cost-conscious: If you have a Dreamcast system, you just don't need a separate CD player or a separate computer.

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest. This unprecedented 60-player option could revolutionize online multiplayer game play and is sure to provide countless hours of action-packed fun.Resistance 2, set in the United States, is loaded with new weapons, enemies, and an unprecedented online gaming experience.","reviewerName":"Steven Herring","summary":"An inferior sequel...","reviewText":"I really loved the first Resistance game. Prior to its release I was really excited for this title. A sequel to one of the best games of the generation should be awesome, but it was not. The story really took a hit in this sequel. The great voice overs by Miss Parker were surprisingly missing. In fact no one except Hale makes an appearance in both games. It's almost like Insomniac took all the good from the first game and threw it away for Resistance 2. The story is only a set up for more action it is not a companion as in the first one. The overall look of the game is different as well. The first was drab and dreary; the second one is bright and cheery. The graphics are a step up from the first one. That is about the only improvement. The game play has changed for the worse and the story as well.Presentation- The look of this game has a lot of orange in it which takes away from the dread of the franchise which is a huge mistake. The music is about the same as the first. There aren't as many cut scenes which hurt the overall story and feel of the game. The graphics are an advancement however over the first. 4/5Graphics- The graphics do look pretty good compared to Resistance: Fall of Man. The environments are pretty lush and natural looking. The facial models look ok Hale looks great the others don't look as good. 4/5Game Play- The game play has changed a lot from Resistance 1. You can no longer hold all the weapons in the game. You are confined to two at a time. The game is also very difficult. Even in the casual setting it is challenging. They have added a lot of alien hybrids as well. This can be frustrating because it makes them feel unrealistic. These are supposed to be alien human hybrids then how can they be the size of a sky scraper. Also there are a lot of spawn problems. You really have to be careful where you walk the enemies can spawn at any time. They can also kill you randomly with one shot, which gets really annoying. The edition of rumble does help you feel like you're actually shooting the Chimera. 3.5/5Story- As I stated above the story took a big hit in this title. There are no interesting voice overs and the few # of cut scenes in general does not help. In fact you could take the title off of the front of the case and you might not be able to tell it's a Resistance game. The ending does have some interesting elements, but the story as a whole is disappointing. 3/5Lasting Appeal- The game in my opinion only has lasting appeal if you want to follow beating the first one with beating this game. There is very little to come back for. There is a big multiplayer element, but I am not a fan of online. They completely scrapped the co op split screen, which was a great part of the first one. It did however have a great ending that some how saved the game from being completely a waste of time. 3/5The Verdict: I recommend this game for people who have never played the original. If you love the original skip this title, and read a plot summary before Resistance 3 comes out. I hope they can make a better game to save this franchise and make a great trilogy. Overall this game is action packed with lots of enemies, but the lack of story and changes in game play elements hurts this title. Overall 3.5/5","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2009"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

So much so that I've probably played through both games 3 or 4 times each.  The series is simply fantastic.  From the storyline to the voice acting; the tight controls to the magnificent graphics, this series has everything a gamer could ask for.  Simply said, a person that doesn't find great entertainment value in this series needs to be medicated.  That being said, GOW 3 is one of the greatest games I've ever played.  And I've been playing video games since the Atari 2600.  The story truly is epic.  The gameplay is epic.  The graphics are beautiful.  There is simply nothing negative that can be said about this game, with the exception being that it didn't last long enough.  Not that it was a short game, I just wanted to keep on playing!  If you are lucky enough to own an XBOX 360, there is no excuse not to have this game in your library.  If you haven't played any of the GOW games in the series, I urge you to pick each title up, 1 through 3.  Start with the original GOW and play though a fantastic series that culminates with one of the finest trilogy endings ever.

Some other games' sequals usually turn out to be crappy, but this one was amazing. You can do just about anything. In GTA3, you can only drive few transportations. In Vice City, you can drive motorcycles, cars, tanks, boats, and even helicopter if you own a mansion. You can also do more missions after you complete the game by driving a taxi, police car, tanks just to name a few. You can try to find secret packages or do stunts to earn more money. The best part, you can just go around killing anyone or drive around running away from cars. Also, if you are being chased, I think tank and heli are most helpful. You can also find police stars to stop the pursue. If you take pills, you become stronger and it becomes like matrix. As you can see, there are endless things to do. Now, I'm going to talk about the requirments. I ran this game on my Pentium 3 933, 512mb ram, ATI RADEON 8500. It worked fine. I could have used my dad's computer, which is great, but I ran it on my brother's pc which was ok to run this game. Everything was on high settings and it nver really slowed down. This shows that with a little less than medium quality pc, you can enjoy this game. I'm pretty sure that you are going to have fun playing this game, but if you don't, try playing Simpsons Hit and Run. It's not as good as GTA VC but it's the best Simpsons mafia game so far.

I know you've all seen it and seen how slick and cool it looks. Of course there is the AMAZING touch screen(amazing........i guess you could say that). And last is the INTUITIVE games(ok hold on I kinda missed the whole intuitive part about this when I bought it). Well now that youve heard of all that jazz, I'm here to tell you about the REAL facts of this sleek little machine.To begin, I know it looks cool. That's what Nintendo was aiming for, and I give them full credit in their efforts. I love how it look, sleek and silver and it fits just perfectly in your pocket. 10/10 on this Nintendo, well doneNext is the touch screen (Hail To The King is playing in the background). This is supposedly the most wonderous invention since sliced bread. But is it really all that great? Well I can tell you that I beg to differ from this touch craze. My touch screen on my beloved DS got scratched instantly. Not after a a month, not even after a week! Within 2 days of normal, nonintensive handing of my DS, the touch screen was scratched beyond belief. I imidietly went and bought a BETTER screen protector then the one nintendo provided, but the damage was already done. Thanks alot Nintendo, I sure love you guys. Touch screen=4/10Next. The \"wonderfully intuitive\" games. Well I would have to say that Metroid Prime Hunters was an amazing game, and I would give that certain game a 9/10, but too bad there are other games on the market to ruin it.  One I will mention is Animal Crossing DS. Whoa, this game was a DISASTER! It was a complete mess, and I cannot believe they ruined it so disaterously bad. Need I mention, well, any other game Nintendo has plagues the DS with. Nintendo, if you can't take the heat, then by peter STAY OUT OF THE KITCHEN! \"intuitive games\"=4/10Ok now for the hyped up WiFi. This is the most overrated piece of crap I have ever been scammed into thinking would work. I, like millions of others, was tricked into buying WiFi capable games(Animal Crossing ring a bell?) Well that was a MISTAKE! JEEZE I WAS MAD! I was under the impression that Nintendo gave me:that WiFi was included free in the buying of a WiFI capable game. Well I soon found that I would have to end up buying $65 worth of wireless internet connecting devises as well as a whole new kind of internet hook up for my computer. No way was I going to sacrifice all that time and money for this. WiFi=2/10All in all, the Nintendo DS is the kind of things that only true Nintendo veterans would want to have. I can understand how this would be a wonderful thing to some people, but for most(including me) it is a rather worthless piece of junk. I am sorry if I am ruining your hopes for an awesome new product, but I felt obliged to tell the whole truth about this product. And no, Im not just bashing this thing cuz I want to, I dont have that much time to waste. I just want to save you from making a bad buying decision. $120 is just too much to spend on something you wouldn't even use.

If you can find it cheap, good--but I wouldn't pay more than $10 for this... item.  I'm a huge Conan fan (the movies and books) but this game was a let down.Graphics/Sound: The graphics are slick, clean, and fun to watch.  There is a lot of gore and fantasy violence, so kids beware.  The music is great: high-fantasy, orchestra-inspired Conan stock music.  Sound effects are appropriate, satisfying, and balance with the music.Controls: the controls were easy to learn but challenging to master.  There are many, many types of moves you can do with different combinations of buttons.  The controls were responsive.Gameplay: this is the area where Conan falls apart.  You earn points to learn skills and new moves (great mechanic, works fine) and you get to beat up the bad guys with your new moves.  So far, so good.However, you have absolutely no option about quest, mission, location--nada.  Strike one (for me)--there's not even any special, secret areas to explore!  You can't decide to wander off the beaten path, not even to take a different way to the goal: it's all lead-you-by-the-nose linear gameplay.Strike two: fighting the boss enemies is repetitious, tedious, and frustrating.  You cannot defeat a boss with any of the cool new moves you learn in the game; you can only defeat them by knocking down their health and then doing some combination of buttons as a cinematic plays.  If you mess up, the boss gets half their life back and you rinse-repeat until you don't miss a single button during the movie.Strike three (OUT!): I finished the game on normal difficulty in just under 8 hours.  I explored every building, tower, path, and cranny I could find; I died about 40 times.  It still only took me 8 hours.

{"product_name":"B00D6PTMB4","description":"","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"I wonder what Andres Segovia would have to say about this.","reviewText":"I started playing guitar in mid-1999 and really got into it for a few years. I had a band for a while and enjoyed playing with the group, even using now-ancient recording software and CD burners to put out albums to give away at the few shows we did. But then, like most things I pick up on, I got interested in something else and more or less abandoned the hobby. Just a couple of weeks ago, someone brought their guitar to work, and when he gave it to me, I practically forgot everything I knew how to play even just 5 years ago when I bought my last guitar. Where did all those riffs go?! Rocksmith 2014 is here to save the day. Honestly, you don't need yet another 5 star review telling you what's so great about this game and that it really does work as a tutoring program for guitar. This is one of the few games/programs for guitar that I know of that I can say is absolutely worth every penny, and even if you're a regular guitar or bass player, you could benefit from a few things that the game has.When it comes learning in a way that works for you, this game has you covered in spades. You can select what specific areas of playing you work on, from distortion to slide to scales. There are even a ton of different amps you can choose to play through in order to get the authentic tone of the original recordings! One of the coolest additions is that as you get better in the game and start hitting everything perfectly, the on-screen notes fade away and you're left to pull it off all on your own. The game does this automatically, serving as a way to acknowledge that you've gotten better. The only bad thing I can say regarding Rocksmith 2014 Edition is that there's nothing along the lines of notation, something that musicians would benefit greatly from over time. And I say that with 100% honesty. I still feel like an idiot when someone hands me sheet music asking if I know how to play it. Tabs, absolutely! That stuff...not so much. Who knows, maybe there'll be a DLC pack in the future for this. Also, the lack of a recording feature for the awesome improv session mode hurts, though you can always find ways to record it on your own with the right programs and devices.Beginner, intermediate and even self-proclaimed pros should invest in this game as soon as possible. If I had started playing guitar more recently, or if this game had been around when I was 14, I'm sure I would've gotten more into the instrument and been more serious about it. The fact that the game features a cool little arcade game mode to help you with different techniques in the form of old school arcade games kept me in this mode for longer than expected, and especially considering I used to know all of this stuff. This game is perfect, and there's only so much written reviews can explain for you. Get the game for yourself or watch some videos online to see how it works better. Now you can be a real guitar hero...with a real guitar!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00D6PTMB4","description":"","reviewerName":"Lionheart","summary":"Disappointing","reviewText":"Here is where the Rocksmith people went and messed up a nearly perfect thing. Rocksmith 2013 is one of the tools I still use to hone my skills. The system is brilliantly devised, easy to understand and assimilate. But in this sequel? I find that the graphics get in the way, the fret numbers are smaller, the \"symbols\" too similar to one another... it's an overall murky, disconcerting experience.Rather than just numbering the major frets (3, 5, 9, 12, etc), this game numbers ALL the frets as the speeding notes touch them, leading to confusion. Everything is smaller and harder to see as you're trying to learn it. Hammer-ons look like they could be anything when they're speeding down the screen, as do pull-offs and harmonics. Is that a bend or a palm mute? You don't know until it's already gone by. I don't have that problem with the previous incarnation.When I try to play this version, ugly amps bleeding sound waves distract my eyes from the notes I'm trying to read -- what are they doing there? When the song goes up and down the neck, the fingerboard shrinks in size to the point where I don't know what fret I need to play. I can see them, but can't read the number. Complicating matters are notes you need to play that are indicated in advance by transparent blocks, because they're part of a chord shape, I guess. Very messy.There are too many songs with alternate tunings. I want to learn how to play better, not constantly have to retune my guitar. Give my E standard or Drop D, with the option of playing it differently. Don't force it.There is no ranking or point system when learning songs here: you go by mastery, instead. But I liked both. It was easier to tell how you were doing. Even if you only went up a few hundred points, you could see that you were doing better. But here you have to look at that mastery score.The game gives you the option of transferring Rocksmith 2013 songs into this system: but it should be the other way around, in my opinion.The best feature allows you to play with a \"band,\" which really means the AI will follow along with you using certain instruments of your choosing, like a banjo or mandolin. That's awesome. But you still can't record what you do; and that's not awesome.There are more, and better, arcade games, but the songs are what you come for. And although it's a pretty good selection this year, it's still missing folk and blues tunes. Not everybody who plays guitar wants to play hard rock or alternative rock tunes, right? So let's have more variety.I liked the new options, in other words, but hated the new look. They should not try to reinvent an already almost perfect wheel.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2013"}

Players can earn up to 20 weapons (including online and offline) with up to four levels of upgrades for most weapons, plus new high-tech gadgets to help them through their journey.After word spreads of Ratchet and Clank's recent conquest inRatchet & Clank: Going Commando, Clank finds himself recognized as an interstellar robot of mystery and intrigue after starring in his own television series, Secret Agent Clank. While Ratchet is dismayed by his new sidekick status, the feelings are put aside when the twosome is called together by the Galactic President to bring peace to the universe. They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise. This includes Helga, the robotic seductress; Big Al, a techno-geek with the ability to encrypt technology systems; and Skidd McMarxx, a former hoverboarding champ and pro slacker turned spy. Together with the Q-Force, Ratchet and Clank set off on another hilarious interstellar romp to uncover the schemes of the sinister Dr. Nefarious and keep the galaxy safe for organic life.The Starship Phoenix, headquarters for the Q-Force, is the flagship in the fight against Dr. Nefarious and serves as a key information hub. The Starship is also where players can expect to receive new missions and training, and purchase armor and weapons. In addition, players will gain access to new vehicles, like the Turbo Slider or Hovership, to compete in races and combat enemies in intense battlefield missions. Refined intuitive enemy artificial intelligence means non-playable characters behave more intelligently by gathering information about their environments and forthcoming attacks, ultimately providing the player with more challenging gameplay.The multiplayer gameplay featured inRatchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenalis naturally suited for both the offline and online universe because it includes the variety of weapons, gadgets, vehicles and gameplay made famous throughout the Ratchet & Clank franchise. For those who want to experience the split screen multiplayer capabilities, up to four players can play offline, while the multiplayer online mode accommodates up to eight players over a broadband connection. In addition, six new levels are introduced for online play, featuring several elements that encourage team-based activities in modes such as capturing an enemy's base. For example, destructible environment obstacles in battlefield environments create strategic gameplay decisions and general mayhem. Commandeering multiple vehicles further encourages strategic co-op gameplay by allowing players to work together as one person navigates the vehicle while the other works its weapon's arsenal.In order to promote community gameplay, voice communication is supported online via the USB headset (for PlayStation2), allowing players to communicate with fellow team members during online games, either in-game or in the main lobby. The lobby area features an online friends list, allowing players to be matched up based on their gameplay statistics and will offer the ability to select from a variety of player skins.","reviewerName":"Hadi Jones \"The Tree\"","summary":"The next Halo, for the PS2","reviewText":"I've played both Ratchet and Clank 1 & 2 and Halo, although Halo is a first person shooter, so is Ratchet and Clank.

The first had decent graphics, somewhat dated, but the gameplay was good and engaging. The Godfather 2 is boring, everything is the same, the graphics are terrible for a PS3 game and after playing for 3 hours, you havent gotten anywhere. Your player is asked to do the same things over and over, without much reward. The controls are bad and the police and health systems are buggy and do not live up to the first game. Driving in the game is like driving a square. When you crash, the car damages in the same place everytime and gets stuck very easily. The driving physics need work and the weapons are terribly unrealistic and it takes many shots to down an enemy with a basic pistol.

It's interestin to see so many people bashing a game that, if you  actually think about it, is exactly what people were expecting.The  original Diablo was a fun game, in that it was addictive and people who  liked repetetive hack and slash action enjoyed it.  However, it only held  appeal for a very narrow branch of gamers.  The rest of us wanted strategy  and something else to make fighting endless hordes somewhat more  interesting.Enter Diablo 2.  By adding a horde of various skills and  tweaking a lot of code, the original Diablo battle system returns with a  punch.  Imagine being a huge barbarian: instead of just hacking everything  to pieces, you leap 7 meters into the fray, slash a few monsters, block  some attacks with your shield, leap out again and just for good measure,  give a huge shout to scare off any pursuers.  You clamber behind a wall and  equip a bow to shoot monsters from between the bars of a jail cell before  they catch up to you again and you decide that *this* time, you're going to  equip *2* swords and do a huge double slice attack.  Sounds a lot better,  doesn't it?The graphics of this game are also highly under appreciated.  Everyone seems to think that it looks basically the same...but in reality,  the graphics have improved in many, many ways.  Take the lighting effects  for example: walk around any pillar in a dungeon and you will see some of  the most beautiful lighting effects ever created.  Every animation is  smoother, more pronounced, and easily distinguishable.But enough about  the graphics.  Even smaller changes to the game system have made it so much  more enjoyable.  The concept of &quot;tomes&quot; - huge collections of  identical scrolls - have freed up inventory space for everyone's  characters.  As previously mentioned, the skills system is huge and allows  for crazy levels of character customization.But the biggest, most  incredible part of this game is the multiplayer.  Diablo 1's major fault  was that you could import a character from your single player game and use  it online.  In addition, a monstrous number of hacks and other programs of  that nature went into circulation so that everyone online had the best of  everything...where was the enjoyment?  There wasn't any - I stopped playing  Diablo online very quickly because of the lack of enjoyment.  This time  around, Blizzard got smart - online characters are stored online and cannot  be modified short of hacking Blizzard's character database, because none of  the character data is stored on your machine.  Multiplayer has become that  much more fun because of it.And last, but not least, the storyline is  much improved.  No more of this &quot;we live in one town and walk into the  same dungeon to fight everything&quot;.  Diablo 2 actually has something of  a storyline, and a new quest system that enables you to more clearly see  the benefits of doing favors for the townspeople you encounter.  In  addition, the world map is huge - and easily travelable due to the added  concept of waypoints.To conclude, people who are saying this game is a  Diablo 1 clone are obviously not very attentive, or are playing both games  without half as much enjoyment as they can offer...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2000"}

Its strange mix of action and roleplaying kept many glued to their chairs for months on end, and spawned nearly as many imitators as the legendary \"Doom.\" In 1997, the formula worked splendidly - but it's the new millennium now that \"Diablo II\" has come to store shelves, and it just feels a little long in the tooth. That hasn't kept it from becoming one of the most overwhelmingly critically praised games of 2000, though. One PC Gamer reviewer went so far as to call it \"the best game ever\" at the time. Apparently he enjoyed the minimal story, the pithy roleplaying elements, and the repetitive click-fest that is \"Diablo II\" - or maybe he just needs to play more games, because this one remains tremendously overrated. I really want to stress how gratingly easy critics were on this game, just because it had the Blizzard logo on the box. Much better games have taken critical beatings, and justice dictates that \"Diablo II\" is put in its proper place. Even so, it's certainly not a bad game, and can become very engrossing despite its lack of depth and dearth of variety.Though the \"Diablo\" games can often be found in the roleplaying section, there is little actual roleplaying to be done. You are offered five character options at the beginning of the game, and you pick one of them as your avatar - it's that simple. It should be noted, though, that each character plays quite differently, and all have unique and impressive skills (or spells) that they can employ when things get rough. Of course, you will also tweak your character's stats to your liking as you gain levels, which is why this is considered roleplaying at all.In reality, though, \"Diablo II\" is a top-down isometric action game, and that's just fine. Wading through hordes of demonic baddies is certainly an enjoyable experience - though I myself couldn't help but wish there was more to the game. Combat only ceases when you're in one of the game's three cities (one city per episode), and you really only visit these cities when you need weapons or other items, or perhaps when you're ready to receive your next quest. Quests are extremely linear as well. While playing through the game, I didn't encounter a single quest that was designed to boost experience and was not somehow related to finishing the game's main storyline. I enjoy linearity, personally, but the inability to do your own thing, even just a little bit, keeps \"Diablo II\" from maintaining its freshness. It all boils down to hacking and slashing, leveling up, and repeating that process until the credits roll. It's certainly fun at times, but it's not enough for the game to stay compelling for long periods. Great games transport you to another reality, but \"Diablo II\" will never allow you to forget that you're just staring at your monitor and constantly clicking on things with your mouse. Even the outdoor environments just feel like the spruced up tabletops upon which you are playing with your fantasy-themed action figures.Oh, yes, and I can't forget to mention that &quot;Diablo II&quot; has a truly awful save system that would be more at home in &quot;Everquest.&quot; In other words, there's an autosave, and that's about it. It makes casual sittings with the game become more frustrating than they should ever have been, since when you die you'll lose key items in your inventory (like your primary weapons), and you'll have to find your body to recover them. To make matters worse, enemies respawn like rodents when your back is turned, and it's just so bloody  aggravating!In the end, I have been focusing more on the game's faults than its virtues, since I feel that its faults have been least touched upon in the press - but it really is a good game. It is far from achieving the greatness others have claimed, but it's good. If you're one of the few people with a PC and a penchant for gaming on planet earth who hasn't yet picked up a copy, you could be well-served if you're in the mood for some lightweight action. Don't put too much stock in those editorial reviews you've read, though, and take note that games like \"Icewind Dale,\" \"Baldur's Gate,\" \"Divine Divinity,&quot; and &quot;Nox&quot; have all done this isometric roleplaying thing considerably better than \"Diablo II.\" They actually offer depth as well as frenetic combat. (Well, all except &quot;Nox,&quot; but it was just so bloody fun!) It's inevitable that Blizzard will eventually begin working on \"Diablo III,\" and though it will certainly make plenty of money for the company, if it's to attain true success it had better acknowledge its peers and offer more than its shallow predecessor.Final Score: C+","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2003"}

Let me say that again: WOW.  This game is a neat little gem that works so well with the idea and execution of the Wii.  Its fun to play, easy to learn, and challenging as your skills increase.The idea is deceptivley simple- throw a variety of objects at towers/buildings/constructs of blocks...knock them down, pull pieces away, create domino effects and all that jazz to score points.  By and far the most fun are the levels where you can destroy everything.  Other levels let you pull pieces away from the larger structure a la Jenga or similar games.The best part of this game is figuring out the least amount of \"moves\" needed to complete each goal.  The physics engine is quite good and things react, for the most part, as you would expect them to.  The ability to move the field around and change some perspective is helpful and actually necessary to complete levels and goals as you progress through the game.The learing curve is structured well so that by the time you have finished the training missions, you have all the skills necessary to dive into the full game.  I have a 5 year old and a 3 year old.  They dont get all the finer points, but they have fun knocking things down and doing some of the simpler levels. I myself, like the challenge that the \"story\" (explore) mode offers.  So the game is great for kids and adults alike.  Totally gets my vote for that one!The editing features are nice, but somewhat limited in my opinion.  You start with a blank field in which to build with a whole plethora of choices for blocks, doors, walls, buildings...but the game has a limit on what can be placed on the field before it gets \"full.\"  And it fills up fast.  I barely had enough memory space to plunk down two guard towers, some bomb blocks, a mini wall and some gem blocks before I was not allowed to place anything else- but the worst part was all that unused space on the editing field.  It felt a little dissapointing to me.  With the next generation hardware and memory, one would think they would be able to create bigger and better levels.  Minor annoyance, but still one that irks me at times.The multiplayer mode is good, and while I havent used it extensivley- it works well for two players and the split screen is handled nicely.  I havent gone online or anything like that as of yet- and dont plan to, so I cannot review or rate those features of the game.The storyline is loose and simplistic, just what one would expect from a game of this presentation- and that isnt a bad thing at all.  Having a story kind of ties a few things together and makes the goals make a bit more sense, but doesnt take any attention away from the wonderful gameplay.  One thing to watch out after you are done playing this game...\"Wii elbow\"- boy did the soreness strike with a vengance the next day!  That being said, I love this game and am glad that we purchased it.  I highly suggest you get this one, like another overlooked Wii gem (Zack and Wiki), I dont think this game will stick around for too long before it becomes harder to find.  A sure sleeper hit and a definite must have game for the Nintendo Wii.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2008"}

Customizing your characters and weapons changes your playing experience visually and within the gameplay.","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Very good","reviewText":"\"Resonance of Fate\" slipped out right after \"Final Fantasy 13\" without a lot of fanfare, which is a shame as there is a risk of it slipping under the radar and disappearing into bargain-bin hell. Plus it's also pretty good.The game is set in a future world where everybody lives in a tall metal tower due to the earth having become uninhabitable for some reason, and you play as a team of three youngsters called Leanne, Zephyr and Vashyron (just the usual names for teenagers of course!), who start the game as guns for hire, taking on missions to mend broken bridges or deal with rebel bandits causing trouble around the tower. Things start slowly as you explore the locations and fight various gangsters and goblins, but right from the start the battle system really shines.Well I should say it does not shine immediately, because with no in-game tutorial, your first battles are going to be an exercise in bewilderment as it's impossible to fathom them out unaided. Luckily you are told that there is a battle arena near town where you can practise, and in here is a tutorial (thank god!), so I headed here as soon as I knew where it was.The game's appeal rests solely on the battle system, so it's important you know what it is all about. You have the same three characters throughout the whole game, and random battles see you face up against enemies of all sorts. The simplest thing to do is run around the battle field and fire at an enemy of your choice with your gun (it's all about guns in this game). First thing to know is that there are two types of firearms available: Machine guns, which cause very heavy damage but it's only temporary and recovers over time, and handguns, which cause very light damage, but turn any amount of temporary damage permanent as soon as they hit. So the idea is that you share out the types of guns, so (say) Leanne will fire a whole load of machine gun fire at an enemy and then Zephyr will go straight after her with his handgun, and convert that damage to permanent before it wears off. You can also hold your aim on an enemy while the gun powers up, which is a balance between waiting for the gun to charge up and firing before the enemy attacks, as any attack will make you lose all of your charge-up...and you only get one shot per turn. Got that part? Good, because there's a lot more, and if this is all you do, the game will get very boring quite fast.The real fun of the battles comes from using Hero Actions. Put simply, at the start of every action you have a limited number of orange gems on a guage. For the cost of one gem, you can do a charge across the entire length (or width) of the screen, and while you do this mad dash you can fire at the enemies as many times as you like before you come to a stop. It's great fun and of course can cause loads of damage, which is why it's not free to do - and you start the game with a very limited number of gems - three, I think, but you (very gradually) earn more throughout the game. You have to use these gems wisely, as if you spend all three doing these Hero Runs, you will go into panic mode, which almost always leads to a Game Over as you basically can't do anything. So you have to make sure each gem you spend is worth it. If you cause enough damage on a Hero Run or cause any part of the enemy (armour, usually) to break off, you earn a gem back, so you can see how strategic play is required to get lots of running in without running out of gems.This in itself is fun enough, but the true play experience of \"Resonance of Fate\" really comes from the Tri-Attack. This attack can only occur after you have done a succession of Hero Runs, during which time the characters have crossed paths at least once and have ended up in a vaguely triangular formation. Once you have a few successful runs in the bank you can unleash the Tri-Attack, which sees all three characters start running AT THE SAME TIME, all ready to fire at the enemy when you give the command. The camera starts weaving wildly across the screen as the characters leap and spin across the terrain (you can make them jump), firing and spinning through the air and shouting heroic cries like \"Now you're gonna get it!\" and so on. It all looks fantastic, and I never tired of it, in fact as soon as I got the hang of it I used Tri-Attacks in every single battle. It takes a lot of concentraion to plan each one, as you have to make sure your characters are well positioned on the ground so that they can all target the enemy, and they can all run without bashing into any walls or obstacles (the terrain often has things like ramps and pillars all over the place), which will end the run for whoever comes a cropper.Trust me, if you learn this battle system you will derive hours of fun from this game. Which is good because \"Resonance of Fate\" has no plot! I'm not kidding, to me it just seemed like I got given missions and targets to achieve and I just went around doing them, without any reason or motive other than being paid. The so-called story seems to revolve around the higher classes of the tower experimenting with the mortality of the regular inhabitants, but this is very hard to figure out. Most if the time the cast just mumble pondeorus phrases like \"What have I done?\" or \"Why am I still alive? It would be better if I was dead!\" and all that type of thing, few of which ever make sense. So do not play this game for the story!It's also not an easy game but to be honest, this is probably going to be because gamers are not using the Tri-Attack properly, and if you master this, you will win pretty much everything. Some bosses ramp up the challenge quite significantly, especially when they can only be damaged from one angle, so aiming Hero Runs in the right direction (so you can fire at their backs before they turn round, for example) becomes paramount.Apart from the battles, there is also the fun of powering up the guns. Instead of finding new weapons, you buy or find attachemnts for the ones you have throughout the game, and upgrading a gun becomes a mini-game, as you are required to fit all the additional barrels, bullet clips and sights onto the gun by means of a 2D grid diagram, which means arranging as many as you can on the grid and leaving as few unfilled spaces as possible (all the attachments are a different shape). Hours of geeky fun!And finally, you also have another mini-game in the world map, which you can only traverse by laying down tiles side by side to \"fill in\" the empty map. The tiles are shaped like jigsaw peices so you have to have enough of all the different shapes in order to successfully fill up entire floors of the tower, so this in itself is another fun part to play with.So to finish, you should absolutely buy this game and experience the very dynamic battle system. You might enjoy getting to know the three characters (you can even dress them up!), but don't expect to get too attached as the story is so vague that I finished the game without a clue what had happened. I just know that I won - Hooray! And a lot of fun it was too.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2010"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J6KU","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"Rough around the edges, but has a grand sense of adventure that few games can match","reviewText":"Dragon's Dogma, like Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, which released around the same time, is an epic, Western-style role playing game that has a strong focus on real time action combat. In fact, it wouldn't be a stretch to call both of these titles action games with RPG elements. But while the two titles look quite similar on paper, they couldn't be more different. Dragon's Dogma is developed by Capcom, a Japanese studio, and the game still has deep roots in Japanese gaming despite being a Western RPG through and through.One thing that has to be mentioned right away is that Dragon's Dogma has its share of issues. It's an incredibly ambitious game whose ambitions were far greater than the hardware it was made for. Technical issues such as texture pop-in and chugging frame rates are common. Character facial animations, particularly during scenes of dialogue, are quite lifeless. The menu system can be quite unwieldy and non-intuitive. Even after 50 hours into the game, I was still finding myself fumbling around the menus at times. The game's fast travel system, despite being improved for this Dark Arisen edition, is still one of the most poorly executed in any game of this type that I've ever played. Dragon's Dogma is a game that reached for the stars, and despite being a valiant attempt, especially for Capcom's first foray into this type of game, is still quite rough around the edges.Despite this, Dragon's Dogma is a game that I would wholeheartedly recommend to fans of action games and WRPGs. I loved the game.Dragon's Dogma has a sense of adventure about it that no other Western RPG I've played this generation has (and I've played nearly all of them). The world of Gransys is huge and ripe for exploration, yet this never comes without significant risk. Like the classic Japanese RPG's of the 90's, setting off on foot someplace that you aren't adequately prepared and leveled up for will result in your swift death. The day/night cycle of Gransys also plays a huge part of the experience, as the nighttime becomes extremely dangerous. Gransys is a fantastic game world, filled with epic vistas, diverse landscapes, and secrets everywhere.I would have to say that the one area where Dragon's Dogma trumps all of its competition is in combat. And this isn't referring just to the combat controls (which are fantastic), but to the way combat scenarios unfold in the field. Imagine the free-form dance that is The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's combat, combined with the tightly-tuned yet flexible controls of something like the old Devil May Cry titles, and that is what you have here. Dragon's Dogma provided me with some of the most thrilling battle sequences I've ever experienced in a video game, period.Battles have this sense of \"anything goes\" and can often become chaotic quite quickly if you aren't prepared. Thankfully, you will always have the aid of your Pawns, your AI controlled partners-for-hire who I found to have some of the best AI I've ever come across in a party-based RPG. Thanks to the diverse skill sets of my Pawns, I was always being healed when I needed to be, my weapons were always buffed appropriately, and the appropriate tactics were always applied to emerge victorious. The Pawns in Dragon's Dogma are a fantastic innovation in partner AI. The Pawn system especially comes to life with its multiplayer functionality, allowing you to loan your pawn to people on your friends list, and also allowing you to borrow theirs for no cost.Rounding out the game's high points are an excellent class system that eventually lets you form custom classes to suit your liking, a story that starts out somewhat bland yet becomes extremely intriguing after a wild turn of events in the last quarter of the game, excellent voice acting, and TONS of stuff to do. I spent about 50 hours with the main campaign, and that was skipping lots of side quests and not even touching the Dark Arisen expansion content. The creature design is something that is worth a mention as well, as it is stellar. Many of your non-human enemies have a stop-motion look to them that seems more realistic than other RPG's I've played, and the ability to attack them in a variety of ways, including lunging at and climbing up their bodies to hack at weak points, adds to the scope and epic feel of the battles described earlier.Dragon's Dogma is a great game despite its rough spots. It's an ambitious, unique RPG that is not only extremely thrilling and fun to play, but has a grand sense of adventure that really sets it apart. A no-brainer for fans of this genre.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2013"}

Combining drop dead beautiful graphics with a superb soundtrack and superbly controls, Gravity Rush is the game your Vita's been craving.While Gravity Rush's core campaign will last around 7 or so hours, it has some side missions/challenges that'll really challenge the player if they want to get the best time. In addition, there'll be additional affordable downloadable content to extend the game's lifespan. Seriously though, Gravity Rush is a game you'll want to replay just because of how well done it is. The city traveral is handled so well and it's so satisfying. This is one of those gems that rarely comes along, so you better not miss it when it does.

{"product_name":"B00004YRQ9","description":"The layout of PlayStation2's Dual Shock 2 controller is nearly identical to that of the original PlayStation's Dual Shock controller, which is good news for most gamers. The main new feature is that, when the buttons are pushed, the controller can register how much pressure is being exerted. This adds a completely new dimension to sports, racing, fighting, and more games. Aside from the Start and Select buttons, all of the functions are analog for greater control, a wider variety of operations, and a more compelling interactive experience. Two convex analog thumb pads and two force-feedback solenoid rumblers round out the features. This controller is also compatible with all software that supports the original Dual Shock controller.","reviewerName":"Ted Del Prato \"technodemon\"","summary":"Well designed, but I could do without the analog sticks","reviewText":"At first glance, Sony's Dual Shock Playstation 2 controller is just a black version of the original standard controller with analog sticks. However, upon extended play one will notice some differences. The materials the D-pad and buttons are made out of are not the same, and they are set further down into the controller. After a while, the D-pad becomes loose (something that did not happen with the standard controller) and the buttons become soft...almost mushy. The result is more difficulty while playing games that require precision timing, movement, and simultaneous button pressing. The analog sticks are of decent quality, though not quite up to par with the newer X-Box controllers. While I usually despise using any kind of analog stick, I have found some games actually work well with it. For free roaming games that require you to move in all 360 degree directions, they are surprisingly useful (like Gauntlet: Dark Legacy or Ecco The Dolphin). Despite my complaints, the Dual Shock is still a great controller for general use in any PS2 game. Casual gamers probably won't even notice it's flaws. Even though the analog sticks seem to serve no other purpose than to get in my way while playing my favorite fighting games, it's leagues better than the standard Dreamcast controller.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2002"}

Why put a story in an arcade racing game?-There are lags or bugs? Not for me at the moment... Yes one huge! Play New York Online, you'll see. Happens to me every time with that race and some other races in online gameplay.-No matter if you go out of track, getting frontal crash with normal vehicules and/or police vehicles or crash with the nature, the game will put you instantly to the last check point if your car \"wrecked\". (charging time when this happens) Press \"select\" was much better.-Kind of linear.-Most of the time AI cars reach you from nowhere.-Very easy to complete the platinum trophy, just two trophies remaining to get it. So yes it's a short game.the good:-Firstable, grafics... Awesome! cars, nature, city, everything here is fantasticly done!-Car damage looks amazing, well done.-Some say in their reviews that the AI cars does not use short cuts, of course, if you're playing in easy they wont! ...or they never advanced in the game to find out they were wrong. (Just put it, say \"I don't like it\", got out from the game and pulsed \"eject\", then went to amazon and wrote a review)-Liked the online gameplay a lot. Usually I don't spent time in online game modes.-Like said \"Vyprstryke\" in his review:\"The story is fairly short, it's also to encourage you to replay it to surpass a friends autolog completion time for the campaign (Positive point for me). But if you're not one to care for competition, then there are a good amount of challenge modes that unlock as you complete each stage in the campaign\"(times here are compared with friends too).-About the challenge mode; Complete the challenges and try to earn at least gold. Autolog tells you every time a friend beat your time to you to beat him. You get rewarded by completing challenges, getting medals and beating friend's time: xp, new cars, new profile items.-Finally some of the bad things can be solved with a patch. Done already, they repaired the reset mode, now if you go out of the track without wreck, you'll be right back at the track, but you'll lose valious seconds.-The car list is huge! Love it! I like almost all the cars!Despite to be a short game, compared with previous NFS, this one is far from be the black sheep. Of course it's not Most Wanted or Underground, but this is a really good game (for me it's better than those previous both). That's why after played various challenges, I found that this game is kind of retro, if you played NFS III or High Stakes (one of my favorite car games ever), you will find similarities. I love that, is great! Loved Challenge mode.Online players, you will enjoy it and have lot of fun! there are lot's of cars to unlock in online.Little advise: If at the begining you feel disapointed, give it a shot. At least, you will have good reasons to say why you don't like this game.Just in case: sorry about my english.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2011"}
{"product_name":"B003O6ECOM","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"NFS The Run:  Momentum lost from NFS:Hot Pursuit","reviewText":"For anyone that played NFS:Hot Pursuit, one could argue the only thing that game was missing was a \"freeplay\" mode (ala Test Drive Unlimited 2) to run over any part of the map you wanted.  But the gameplay was top notch, as was the online multiplayer, which shows why NFS: Hot Pursuit still has a strong following.And while I can appreciate what EA tried to do with NFS: The Run, it's just not done very well.For a full retail game ($60) to be over in THREE hours, that's not acceptable in a racing game considering that Blur could take you several WEEKS to work through, along with racers like Dirt 3, Gran Turismo 5, etc.  This means unless you're a trophy hunter or a die-hard online player, the game's over in about the time it takes to play an NFL game on Sunday.  So for this reason, I suggest if you don't fall into the categories I just mentioned, give this a rental.From a graphics standpoint, the game looks awesome, especially during the cutscenes and the areas you'll be driving.  However when the graphics is the strongest point of the game, you've got a problem right there.One of the things that has plagued the Shift series of games is the floaty handling.  And one of the things that made NFS:Hot Pursuit so GOOD was how well that game handled.  Sadly, in NFS: The Run, it seems you're driving a Land Rover instead of a Zonda.  It's extremely hard to execute good, drifting turns, hard to weave in and out of the environmental scenes (which Split/Second did far better and more convincingly), and more often then not, you end up wrecking.  While the \"rewind\" feature is nice, a 10 second interruption in the gameplay is not while you're waiting to get back in the race.Furthermore, if you're going to have a story you better care about the \"main\" character.  Unfortunately, it seems like EA went to the Paris Hilton school of \"souless\" acting because while the cutscenes look cool, you're really not getting a sense of intrigue (OMG, we have to win, Jack owes $25M, he's going to die if he doesn't pay.  Get the ___ out of my way, I gotta win!  Erm, no so much).I had VERY high hopes for this game.  But coming out around the same time Elder Scrolls:  Skyrim, Batman, Saints Row and MW3, and containing about 1/10 of the gameplay time, I simply can't recommend buying this game except for the most diehard Autolog/achievement hunter.And it's a shame.  We want developers to push the edge, and then crack back on them when they fail.  As much as I'd like to see EA make another go at this, you're probably going to see a return closer to what Hot Pursuit was then you'll see another \"The Run\" type of game.Pros:- Great graphics and sound- Autolog and lots of achievements to chaseCons:- WAY too short at 2-4 hours long- Bare multiplayer modes compared to NFS:Hot Pursuit- Sluggish controls/responsiveness- Lack of connection with the story","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

So, I finally just broke down and bought myself a shiny new PLATINUM GameCube system (along with Zelda and Preview disc-included for free, of course!).  Was it a wise choice?  Most definitely!XBOX games are great...I love my XBOX and continue to play it.  But certain games on the GC have that certain &quot;magic&quot; that is reminiscient of the Nintendo games of old and rarely seen on other systems.  The system is small (a stark contrast since it sits next to my XBOX), the Platinum finish is really classy, it boots up games quickly and the overall setup is very well done.  The game discs are a refreshingly small disc form factor, the controller, while difficult to use at first due to the odd button placement, becomes second nature after a few hours.  I have had no complaints with the hardware.  I think Nintendo R&amp;D did a good job in this area.The games themselves are fun and that's the main factor.  The GC is not an XBOX, so you shouldn't expect the games to technical masterpieces that push millions of polygons and so forth.  The system is capable of great things, but the developers are wisely choosing to focus on the gameplay aspect, and this is immediately evident in the few games that I've had the pleasure of playing on my new Cube.  So what if the GC can't use pixel shaders or render bump maps?  If you can't get over these and other tech facts, then do yourself a favor and get a high-spec PC.  Games are about fun gameplay, not rendering photo-realistic graphics.Overall, I'd have to rate the GameCube 5 stars out of a possible 5.  Why such high praise?  Well, after playing Zelda and some other games, the GC has so far managed to exceed my expectations and has gotten me to realize once again that gameplay is the king.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00009WAUO","description":"Players can add cool new features with the Card e-Reader or link up with friends for multiplayer adventures with the original Mario Bros. game.","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"One of the most frustrating episodes in Mario's storied career","reviewText":"I've already reviewed \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" elsewhere, with both the 8-Bit NES version and the \"Super Mario All-Stars\" version.  I don't want to spend a lot of time and space on \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" specifically, but instead focus on this port (which is based on the \"Super Mario Allstars\" version).  We all know \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" is a classic title.  So, let's dispense with the cursory introduction of \"Super Mario Bros. 3\".  Basically, this is just a copy and paste job from a short blurb I wrote in my 2004 review of \"Super Mario All-stars\".\"SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 3: The best selling game ever released independently, SMB3 greatly expanded the Mario universe with the introduction of several new enemies, Bowser's children (who was the mother, I wonder? Godzilla's ex?), and introduced cool new suites for Mario to wear. The game play was more expansive than ever, with cool new secrets to discover and eight tremendously large worlds. This game laid the foundation for so many other plat-formers, especially SUPER MARIO WORLD. While SMB2 felt like a weird detour, SMB3 took Mario back to the atmosphere or the original game, taking it a thousand different directions, and coming up with one of the best games ever developed. Although there were a few tweaks for the ALL STARS release (some levels got a few more coins to make it easy to access game secrets), like the other games this is tremendously faithful to the original NES release. That alone makes this essential playing\"To further elaborate, there are a few cosmetic changes, but this is largely the All-stars port of \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" that we all know and adore.  Ok, we all love SMB3?  It's an eternal classic, etc, etc. Best game on the NES. Yada yada.  Everyone on the same page?  Good.Now, let's get to the problems of \"Super Mario Advance 4\", and yes, there are problems.  Well, one problem anyway.  And it's a BIG problem.  It's a little selling point called e-Reader compatibility.  What's so great about e-Reader cards you ask?  Well, I'm glad you asked.e-Reader cards features new content than can be added to pre-existing games.  In the case of \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", there were three specific types: Power-ups (which uploads specific items into Mario or Luigi's inventory list and can be used an unlimited amount of times), Demo Cards (which showed Mario speed-running, collecting enough coins to unlock a blue Toad House, or doing infinite 1-Up tricks - essentially, the hint videos of \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" six years before), and, wait for it . . . New Levels.Yes, you read right.  New levels.  Yes, Nintendo made NEW LEVELS to \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", and a whole new world called, appropriately enough, \"World-e\".  Note, these are not the 15 inaccesible levels embedded in the original NES \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" code. Nintendo released ten levels in Japan, the PAL reigion, and America, with two different series.  Fantastic, eh?  Awesome?No, not really.  In fact, as a Mario can you just feel cheated.  Why?  Well, for one, although Japan frequently gets exclusive content, Nintendo released a full TWENTY TWO additional new levels in Japan only, because (again, wait for it) . . . Nintendo discontinued the e-Card readerSo, what's frustrating here?  Mainly, Nintendo made THIRTY THREE NEW LEVELS (which, to put in perspective, is over a third of the original game, as \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" has 88 levels total), plus five re-made levels in \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" style of \"Super Mario Bros.\".  These were levels 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, and 2-1.  Also, in homage to \"Super Mario World\" there are five new coloured switches which effect gameplay in different ways, but again only were released in Japan.Although many think Boomerang Mario first appeared in \"Super Mario 3D Land\", actually he first appeared in these one-off levels on the e-Cards, but (with only one exception, \"Slidin' the Slopes\", where you can use a boomerang on that one level only, just like Goomba's Shoe on 5-3) no one outside of Japan got to play as Boomerang Mario.  2/3s of the e-cards appeared only in Japan.Another problem with the e-Cards?  In World-e, there are three mushroom houses, each featuring three specific mini-games.  To unlock these mushroom houses, you must get Advance Coins found in the new levels (a precursor to the Star Coins of the \"New Super Mario Bros.\" series).  But here's the kicker.  Outside of Japan, there's only enough coins to access ONE of these three mini-games, because there's not enough currency in the ten levels that Nintendo actually did release to unlock the other two.In Europe, the gamers got screwed even worst than the Americans, with the e-Card functionality completely disabled, inaccessible through normal gameplay.For Mario fans, this is beyond disappointing.  Nintendo put so much effort into new content, and yet do to poor implementation the majority of gamers will not get to experience these fantastic levels.  The e-reader was also a failure, so the cards weren't available for very long anyway.  Had all this new content been released in the game proper, \"Super Mario Advance 4\" would be the definitive port of \"Super Mario Bros. 3\"; as it stands, there is only a vague sense of disappointment and incompletion for those who know about the new content.These are the true Lost Levels in the Mario universe, still commercially unreleased and widely difficult to play legitimately.  Note that the original \"Super Mario Bros.\" had 32 levels.  These lost levels are 32 in number, along with three bonus levels and five remade levels.In the NES days that would be a full-length Mario title!

{"product_name":"B007VFHGZ4","description":"","reviewerName":"Riyad Kalla","summary":"Gritty, Intense, Movie-esque Reboot Dripping with Style","reviewText":"What a nice surprise this game was.Totally story driven, fantastic feel, great graphics (Radeon 6970), great-feeling climbing mechanic, awesome cut-scenes with occasional QTE (quick time event) interactions BUT (and this is the biggie) the QTE's are VERY forgiving.If you hate QTE's like me because they don't allow you to enjoy the amazing scene unfolding and you have to stay hyper focused on key presses, you will love that this game just lets you _enjoy_ the story while still being engaged enough to feel really invested (e.g. freaking out and pressing \"forward\" because a bridge is collapsing)There are all sorts of stylistic touches all over this game... for example, pressing the wrong buttons during QTEs result in gory or entertaining deaths. Hiding from an enemy during a cut scene and once the cutscene is over, walking out from cover right over to them just to see what the game does results in an appropriately wonderful death -- not that these things are level-setting, but you get the feeling that the developers didn't let a single set piece or scene go to production before really massaging it into a COMPLETE experience.I can't count how many times I have lost my bearings in a level only to some how, magically, get all turned out, find a bunch of treasure and then pop up on a ledge right where I needed to be. I've not known where I am plenty of times during this game, but NEVER been \"lost\" -- that speaks volumes about the degree of talent the level designers put into this experience.Laura herself is awesome; sexy, tough, human, committed and loyal.I absolutely disagree with GameTrailer's review that said there is too short of a transition from \"Laura the intrepid explorer\" to \"Laura the super-murderer\" -- the story is wonderfully paced, with very clear stepping stones along Laura's path from Explorer to Fighter. I never felt like \"Wow, that was out of character\" -- everything she does in the game is absolutely in line with what is going on. Bravo to the writers.Another thing I have to specific call out... the jumping/platforming mechanic is damn near perfect... there are minor elements of Prince of Persia here with some of the movements, but it generally feels \"easy\" to look/feel awesome... leaping off of ledges is fairly forgiving and grabbing/scrambling to a ledge is again easy to pull off. Overall I just _always_ felt awesome while traversing an environment. I had no misjumps (a la Assassin's Creen or Uncharted 3) and had no poorly timed jumps that I had to try over and over... just ran, leaped, jumped and felt like a badass the entire time doing it.The lock-on mechanic especially (used for rope targeting, ledges, hand holds, etc) seems perfect... I've played a lot of platform heavy games (again, Ass Creed series, Uncharted, new Prince of Persia, etc.) and there were always little quirks with the mechanics that made for some frustrating experiences -- in Tomb Raider I literally experienced no mistakes or accidentally deaths and was able to just run around leaping and climbing at full speed which generally feels awesome (great leaping animations).If you enjoy this new run of intense, personal, character-driven action-adventure experiences, you'll really enjoy this.Bravo to Crystal Dynamics, they really nailed this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00007B77T","description":"We could talk about theSerious Sambackstory, but that would be missing the point, namely to commit carnage on a galactic scale. The smooth engine, multiplayer options, and fast pace make this game a solid choice for fans of first-person shooters.The interface uses the tried-and-true Xbox formula for shooters: the left thumbstick controls movement and the right thumbstick controls the angle of view. The extensive arsenal is something special though, with each weapon possessing a different efficiency so you have to find the perfect weapon quickly for each situation. For instance, the shotgun is a great weapon for up-close fighting among a crowd of enemies, but it's horrible at a distance or when you're stuck in the middle of a melee. The enemy list is also quite extensive. You will be fired upon, stepped on, stabbed, slashed, and electrocuted. Enemies will appear by land, air, and water.What makes this game stand out and keep you interested, though, is its irreverent, offbeat sense of humor. Serious Sam makes outlandish comments throughout the game, rides cosmic surfboards between scenes, saves progress at Dr. Who-like telephone booths, and pays homage to the Indiana Jones theme song. And you can change the blood splatters between red, green, and hippy (flowers and fruit). Our only major complaint is level design. Even when you believe you've cleared a room, enemies can pop out of midair and injure you. By not allowing you to seal yourself off from the onrushing masses in appropriate spaces, a major strategic element has been missed.--Eric Franklin","reviewerName":"J.

Players will find familiar names like Glass Joe, King Hippo and trainer Doc Louis. These boxers come to life again in cell-shaded 3-D, complete with hilarious fighting animations and backstories that capture all the fun and flair of the originalPunch-Out!!games.The Wii's Motion SensitivityThe motion-sensitive controls of the Wii console mean that when players throw punches, Little Mac throws punches as well. Additionally, you can control hooks and jabs by combining motion control with control-stick movement. The motion-sensing Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers turn real-life swings into on-screen punches, so anyone can play. The game can also be played with classic NES-style controls by turning the Wii Remote sideways.CharactersPunch-Out!!features a total of 13 opponents for Little Mac to step into the ring with. 12 of which are returning from previous games in thePunch-Out!!series. Each have their own backstory and patterns of attacks to learn and learn to counter. Just a few of the characters you can expect to see are:Little MacSmall but extremely game, Little Mac is a young, up-and-coming fighter, who with the help of his trainer, ex-champion Doc Lewis, has set his sights on working his way through the ranks.Glass JoeA fearful French fighter due to his extremely weak chin, Glass Joe will crumple to the mat quickly with just a few well-placed shots, making him an easy mark and a good warm-up for the fighters to follow.King HippoKing Hippo is both huge and an immensely powerful fighter, but can be weakened with the right combinations to the head and body, giving you time to go for the knockout if you can survive his onslaught.Von KaiserAn old-timey fighter whose rumored childhood difficulties have left him eager to dish out punishment in the ring, Von Kaiser is a dangerous opponent, but one who will turn tail if you can find his weakness.Special AttacksPlayers can obtain special 'Star Punches,' which allow Little Mac to take more health from his rival in a single punch. Players can now use multiple stars in a single punch for an extra-powerful attack.Controller OptionsPunch-Out!!features multiple controller options. For players looking to take advantage of the Wii's motion control capabilities,Punch-Out!!uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers to simulate throwing punches. Use the Nunchuck to throw a left punch and the Wii Remote to throw a right punch. Fans of the NES version and core gamers will be excited to see Nintendo has also included the option to playPunch-Out!!using the classic layout from the original NES controller. Use the 1 and 2 buttons along with the cross pad to throw hooks and jabs or to dodge.","reviewerName":"Derek G","summary":"Hooray!  A remake that's better than the original!","reviewText":"Old school gamers, rejoice!  Nintendo for the Wii brings back the fun of the classic joystick jammer updated for the Wii controller with nunchuck.  Punch-Out plays just like the original game but the ability to throw punches yourself makes it even better.When I first loaded the disc it did a system update.  Be forewarned, this took much longer than any previous update and the progress indicator never indicated anything was happening.  I was starting to get concerned my system locked up but it finally finished after about five minutes.All the classic favorites are here like Glass Joe, King Hippo and Piston Hondo (wasn't he Piston Honda?) I haven't made it far enough to figure out whether Mike Tyson will make an appearance.  Maybe it's my added years of gaming experience (sob) but I find this to be much easier than the arcade classic.  In just a few hours of play, I've already made it past the easy (Minor Circuit), and medium (Major Circuit) levels to the hardest (World Circuit) with only four opponents remaining.  Don't worry, though, there is a special surprise waiting once you finish.  Let's just say it will add a lot of replay value to this game.  In fact, I highly recommend you DON'T READ THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL as it will spoil the surprise.  Besides, you won't learn anything from the instruction manual that isn't already provided in the tutorial video included on the game disc.There are also some interesting surprises in this update.  For instance, I don't know if it was coincidence, but the coach asked me if I was up past my bedtime once it got past 10pm.  Also, if you're having trouble with a specific opponent you can enter into \"exhibition mode\" where you practice against a hologram of the same opponent that doesn't deal damage.  That would have saved me a lot of quarters in the 80's.I knocked off a star because the balance board doesn't work well with this game.  Those familiar with this game know it isn't a slugfest but rather a game of timing and precision.  Unfortunately the tougher opponents are impossible to play against using the board due to its slower reaction time.  Incorporating the balance board was a worthy attempt but I doubt anyone will use it.  Wii controller + nunchuck works perfect, though.  Put a couple hours into this game and you'll feel it in your arms the next morning.  If you would rather play in NES controller mode with no nunchuck, that's also an option.All in all, Punch-Out is a fantastic remake that works great with the Wii.  It's highly recommended and I hope the review helped.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2009"}

However, a newcomer to the series should stay away. This game has aged incredibly poorly. Really, only FF veterans should apply++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++I'll be reviewing the product here. It will obviously include a portion reviewing each game, but if you want a review that is based solely on the game, build yourself a time machine and return to circa 2003.The HD collection looks beautiful. Seriously, FFX and FFX-2 are some of the most beautiful JRPGs on the PS3, which is amazing (and sad), since they are over a decade old. I'm not nearly as in love with the music. They've remixed it, and somehow, the bass has really been lessened. After an hour of playing with the controls on my own system, I still can't re-create the sound of the original. That's too bad, too - I think this remix has actually enhanced the flaws of the soundtrack. I miss the driving beat behind the opening (and, in fact, the driving beat behind pretty much anything).Square has made the choice to remove the instruction book, but at least has given us an insert. I wish the insert was a hard card, though, as the cases are clearly designed to hold something to dampen pressure placed on the middle. It's not a huge deal, though, and it's certainly better than the cheap-looking nothing given by Namco-Bandai these days.The load times are atrocious. The music skips at time. The latter is hardly game-breaking, but the former really makes the proceedings drag.(PROTIP: in FFX, be sure to allow every member of your party to perform some non-trivial action in every battle - this will really cut down on grinding, and lessen the load-time problem).FFX:This game looks absolutely beautiful in HD. Although I've already mentioned it above, it bears repeating - this is the best-looking JRPG from a company not named Square or FROM, at least among the ones I've played (which is a pretty large selection).Unfortunately, this title really hasn't aged well. The story and its delivery, in particular, are abysmally bad. Perhaps in 2003, this was OK, but the RPG has grown up. In fact, were I to trace the downfall of the JRPG, it would probably stem from here. Characters move from point A to point B, engaging in pointless dialogue, and acting in the only fashion that might drive this stinker of a plot. In fact, I don't think the developers even cared about plot, except as a way to deliver mind-blowing, but utterly nonsensical, cutscenes. Watch as Yuna performs a sending, which turns into a rock concert, complete with a rising stage of water. Behold as our summoner, who supposedly trusts her companions with her very life, continues to withhold vital information from them (and vice versa). Why? Because that's the only way the plot is going to move forward. It even appears in the most trivial of times: why does Tidus leave the blitzball tourney final for Wakka, instead of, say, Botta, or Datto, or one of the other also-rans who wondered if they would be warming the bench? After all, by that point, my Tidus has usually scored two goals.Sure, it's a trivial thing, but it sticks in the mind, leaving the player to wonder, \"Why do they always act so stupidly?\"Battle is OK. It's a simple system - faster players move/attack more quickly and more often, slower players move/attack more slowly and less often. You know the order of the characters from the beginning, and are allowed to switch out on the fly. I always thought they looked stupid switching out, though (particularly since you can just switch a character over and over, and apparently, the enemies don't care). In the original version, each character had a role to play in the main game (black mage, white mage, blue mage, fighter, thief, etc.). However, apparently the International Version added something called an \"expert grid\", which allows characters to be whatever they want early. Don't use it - it makes an already-easy game absolutely trivial.(PROTIP: When asked, take the \"standard grid\".)The sphere grid is arguably the worst leveling system I've ever seen. It's a disaster. It's painfully slow and tedious, and there is no auto-level option (and really, for most of the main game, that's actually what you'll be doing - moving along a linear path, taking whatever is in front of you). I hated it then, and I hate it more now.For nostalgia's sake, I give this game 4 stars. If I was playing it fresh today, I might give it only 2, but I remember its greatness at the time. But it's a much weaker title today.FFX-2:This game was deplored by many, but it's not bad. Yes, the plot is even dumber than FFX (to the point of being foolish), but the game only takes itself seriously a few times. The gameplay is significantly better - the beloved job class system of Final Fantasy V (and Final Fantasy III, although I only played that game later, and it sucked)returns in the guise of \"dressspheres\". Wear different clothes, and have different powers. My main complaint is that later dresses are vastly more powerful and better than early ones, so really, the early ones are just to learn a few abilities and pave the way for the endgame dresses.Don't get me wrong: this story is abysmally bad as well. But it just doesn't have the stink of FFX (or other FF titles). It knows what it is, and works in those parameters. No one would ever confuse this slop with Hemingway, but it understands that. Compare this, e.g., to FFX, which seems to think it has so much to say on so many issues (religion, parent-child relationships, war, etc.). At 39, I find this significantly more palatable.FFX-2 had a satisfying NG+ system, and the international version adds a few nice touches as well. Battle works nicely - enemies can now attack in more real time, which makes the proceedings more frantic. However, again this game is very easy. My biggest problem with this game is that often, you don't know what items do. The descriptions are remarkably vague. Also, it's very easy to miss things in this game, and I just hate games that require guides.Again, this game looks gorgeous. I personally like FFX better (the color palette is brighter and more remarkable). Also, this game is far more non-linear than its prequel, and while it doesn't do as well as the majesty of FFXII, more control for the player means more fun for the player.But again, nostalgia rules here. I just don't think either of these games give a good idea of the awesomeness that once was Final Fantasy. But if you played them before, they are worth the re-buy, if only for the great HD support. Have fun!oh, by the way, in both games, I think the trophies are like Square-Enix itself: lazy and unimaginative.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2014"}

Gameplay is all about using your Beam Katana (via Wii remote) to defeat enemies.","reviewerName":"E. David Swan","summary":"Very Disappointing","reviewText":"Two things prompted me to purchase this game; the positive reviews from online gaming sites and the low price. What I ended up with is one of the most overrated games I have ever played. The game starts off well enough with a helpful tutorial. The fighting engine is interesting and puts the Wii remote to good use. Next, players are launched into the action exploring a mansion and testing out new skills. Right off the bat I was disappointed to see that players have essentially no interaction with the environment. Goldeneye was doing environmental destruction over a decade ago, would it be so hard for modern games to feature it? Each level consists of fighting through waves of enemy foot soldiers before battling the boss level assassin. For the most part the enemy assassins are creative and fun to fight but it felt like UBI Soft ran out of steam as the enemies seemed to get less interesting as the game progressed..When my wife saw me playing the driving portion of `No More Heroes' she asked if it was the Wii's version of `Grand Theft Auto'. This was my initial reaction as well. The other game it reminded me of was True Crime: Streets of LA. Despite getting some pretty good reviews in its time I found True Crime to be painfully ugly particularly compared to the spectacular GTA. `No More Heroes' is much better looking than True Crime but it's still a poor mans GTA. The game features a lot of pop-ins as you drive through the city and the frame rate sputters along. The Wii is much more powerful than the GameCube but it still strains to produce a fully realized cities. The dimensions of Santa Destroy (dumb name) are puny compared to the ones in GTA although it is a fairly active city. My last issue is more a stylistic complaint. The designers decided to give everything in the game large jet black shadows but I just don't think it works. The graphics are already a bit muddy and adding all this black only makes it more difficult for the player to see.It's the fighting portion that got the reviewers attention and it's pretty good but like everything in this game it is extremely repetitive. As the game progresses you acquire a hefty list of wrestling moves. The problem is the wrestling moves are always inferior to the sword so I constantly found myself falling back on slash slash slash. This is symptomatic of a larger failing in the game. Everything is just so darn repetitive. Drive around, earn money, kill lots of people, fight a boss. Repeat.The thing that defines this game for me most is the refrigerator in your apartment. Opening the refrigerator heals your character completely but there is simply no way you can be in your apartment and not be at full health. It's sort of emblematic of how unfinished the game feels. By the end the designers just seemed to be trying to get the game to the market. Early on the player explores a decently modeled mansion but the lead up to one of the later bosses was just a seemingly endless narrow hallway. I kid you not. A completely non-descript hall with an enemy every 40 or 50 feet. I could think of so many games I would have rather been playing while I slowly walked down the tedious hall.In the end No More Heroes is a step forward for Nintendo as far as open ended city games are concerned but a step backwards in general as Rockstar has been producing better games in this genre for years on other platforms. The fighting is good but gets old and the exploration was done better by games I played a decade ago. In no area does the game excel not in driving, or fighting or adventuring or collecting. If I had it to do all over again I would not have purchased this game even at the reduced price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2008"}

Cadieux","summary":"Collection comes complete, even with original game-breaking bugs!","reviewText":"I am a first-time Tomb Raider player.  I will give my brief impression of the 3 games here.Anniversary:  Might have been really good when it came out back in the day, but it shows its age.  The controls are awful, definitely the worst of the 3 games in this collection.  I had to struggle to do some very basic jumps, and the game can be really unforgiving of slight mis-alignments.  Modern games are a little more forgiving, I find.  The game overall was OK, but I found myself really eager for it to end.  3 stars.Legend:  A little more fun than Anniversary, with better controls, but still has problems.  I encountered a game-ending glitch near the end, something that was present in the first versions of the game and has not been fixed!  How can you re-release a game with serious game-ending glitches you've known about for years?  Anyway, a simple re-load solved the glitch, but the bigger problem was the amount of time I spent not even knowing it was a glitch, wandering around this place trying to figure out how to progress.  Unacceptable for the game to be re-released with this glitch and unacceptable for there not to be a patch.  2 stars.Underworld: Worst camera work of the 3 games by far.  Professional reviewers commented on the jittery and obnoxious camera, and it gave me loads of problems.  Controls have generally been improved again.  Better story than the others, up until the point I got to.  I encountered a game-breaking glitch that cannot be solved with a simple re-load.  The official solution from the publisher is to re-load an earlier save, but I don't have one (silly me for trusting the game).  In that case, my only solution is to re-start the entire game.  Not gonna happen, I'm done.  My research taught me that this has been a known issue since its original release in 2008, and was not fixed for this re-release.  See comments for Legend above about how unacceptable this is.  Completely unacceptable.  1 star.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2011"}

Its that simple, and i'm not complaining, as I loved smash brothers, sooo....i don't really see the problem :)  Saves me from having to find a used Wii anytime soon.  But I almost wish, if you were going to copy the idea from smash, why didn't you just copy the whole thing?  No replays are in the game, which sucks.  One of the most enjoyable parts of smash brothers was awesome replays that you could even edit, take pictures of, and send to your friends.  Also, no level creator liket he last smash, which was another fun part of smash.  So taking that into account, and the game itself, its just fun.

The games are amazing, of course.  But there is so much more to the system than games.  The streamlined ease of use really makes this a brilliant device.  Here are the features that made the Xbox one an easy choice for my console choice.1. Xbox Fitness: Several months ago I had started working out with my kinect.  Having a routine and tracking calories helped me lose 30 lbs.  The Xbox Fitness app with access to P90X many many more routines all with kinect pulse and motion tracking will take my exercising to the next level.2. HDMI Input: No more switching inputs on the TV to go between xbox and cable.  This will make it much simpler on my elderly mother when she wants to watch TV.3. Snap Apps: Keep track of the score on favorite sporting event while playing a game.  Snap Youtube if you want to watch a walkthrough while you play.4. Skype: My family lives far away.  I look forward to skyping for the holidays.  The Kinect stays in focus on you even if you get up and walk around while skyping, very cool.If you love your 360, you will love the upgrade to the One. If you've never had a game console before, the Xbox One is a great place to join the party.  Never before has gaming been more integrated and user friendly.

{"product_name":"B00005N7YR","reviewerName":"AntVector","summary":"War...it's fan-tastic...","reviewText":"MoH vets will be right at home in this, the first pc edition of the classic Ps2 game.  Stepping into the muddy boots of Army Ranger Jimmy Patterson it's out of boot camp (with a great advisory voice over by retired USMC Captain Dale Dye) and off to the battlefield.  And what a battlefield.  Jim will be taking part in many daring WW2 missions, embarking in Africa and spanning the globe to frost-bitten Germany.  And yup, there's that now famous Normandy Landing to make it through in piece.The graphics are crisp and (very) realistic, if your graphics card is up to the challenge.  A downloaded blood patch will add some realistic gore if that's your thing...otherwise its just puff's of dust when you rip into those naughty German's with your Thompson carbine.  The sound is also pretty involving, as bullets zip overhead, grenades go boom, and your squad mates bark orders and scream for medics.  In fact its a lot like real war.  Without the potato peeling in between levels.With lots of varied landscapes to hide behind, and a nice (and authentic) variety of shooty tools to play with you'll have a blast on your first play through the game.Sadly its a very scripted experience, and once you've pegged where that german sniper is, you'll find him waiting patiently every time you play through.  This is particularly true of the riviting Omaha Beach level.  The first time through you'll be in veritable shell-shock at the detail crammed into the level...from staggering out of your higgin's boat under intense mg42 fire, to the agonising crawl up the beach as your fellow rangers are blown sky high its a level that will go down in video game history.  But make no mistake, it'll still be the same when you play though the next time.  And the next time.Still, there's a brilliant multiplayer game to duke it out in, with lots of diffent levels to suit the junior rocketeers as well as the wily snipers.  I'd certainly give this five stars for the first time-through single player game...and the multiplayer saves it from being a one-hit-wonder.  Add on the short-but-sweet Spearhead expansion pack and you've got one fine military crusade.  On the ready line soldier, time to hit the beaches...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2003"}

So and so game has twice as many levels, another has bigger bosses, another includes some new moves. Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 is a game that has more variety than you could ever imagine, a storyline that spans the globe, enemies so diverse you expect something new around every corner, combat so brutal you'll be wincing until the closing credits and a style that is effortlessly cool. Ninja Gaiden 2 was more bad ass than its predecessor in every conceivable way, and this PS3 exclusive refresh is even better... for the most part.If you haven't been following the Ninja Gaiden series over the past few years you probably aren't prepared for how difficult Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 is, even if it's definitely easier than the 360 original. It's still on a completely different level to current genre favourite God of War. To put Ninja Gaiden 2 into perspective, I was able to beat God of War and its sequel fairly comfortably on the default difficulty - on the easiest difficulty Ninja Gaiden 2 almost made me gnaw my fingers off at certain points. Newcomers will definitely appreciate Sigma 2's more forgiving gameplay, but unless you're 100 per cent focused don't expect to make it very far.Although lead character Ryu Hayabusa gains quite a selection of weaponry as you move through the game, it's his block and dodge moves that are key to survival. You might be able to button mash your way through one or two enemies, but soon enough you'll be using health elixirs like no tomorrow and seeing the Game Over screen enough to have it burnt onto your retinas. Learn to use your block and when to counter attack and you'll be on your way.Playing Ninja Gaiden 2 is a very different experience to playing the majority of games. Whether it's for simply beating a wave of blood-thirsty bats or for finally slaying a boss you've been tearing your hair out over for more than an hour, the sense of reward and gratification is practically unrivalled. For every level you beat you feel like you're becoming a better gamer and that's a feeling that very few games can claim to give. This is action gaming at its very best, although with the toned down carnage during combat there's a nagging sense that Sigma 2's not quite the ultimate edition of the game it could have been.That being said,Its still an amazing Game.Joining your melee weapons are a number of projectiles, ranging from your default shuriken to a gatling gun-style spear gun for use underwater. Most of these have a limited supply of ammo, with more available from fallen warriors you find on your adventure and at shops scattered around each level. Handily, Ryu automatically targets enemies when using a projectile weapon, although weapons like the bow and gun can be manually aimed if you want to hit a certain location on an enemy. One of the keys to the game is working out which weapons work best against each enemy type, so thankfully the d-pad offers a quick weapon-change, eliminating the need to go into the pause menu.Your third means of attack comes from magic, or Ninpo as it's called in the game. Fire-filled icons below your health bar show how many Ninpo strikes you have at your disposal. Holding down Triangle and Circle initiates a monster slaying Ninpo attack and you have a few seconds to aim using the left analogue stick. As with your weapons, these powers can be upgraded, allowing you to dish out more damage. To begin with you're limited to a fire attack, but soon enough this will be joined by wind and fire bird assaults. Unless you're a true expert these special magic abilities will be essential during boss battles, so it's wise to stock up on replenishing items.Brand new to Sigma 2 are three extra playable female characters. Rachel from Ninja Gaiden, Ayane from Dead or Alive and Momiji from DS game Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword each offer a different gameplay experience during their brand new levels. Rachel is still as slow as she was in the original Sigma title on PS3, so is just as likely to divide opinion amongst fans, but the other two should go down quite well as their combat styles are fast and flowing like Ryu's. They each have brand new weapons to play with, too.Enemies in Ninja Gaiden 2 come thick and fast and in large groups. You'll face warriors, giant lizard monsters, dogs, frenzied bats, gargoyles, metallic scorpion-like spinning nasties, werewolves, flying piranhas and more - in fact, that lot are just from the game's opening third. Your health bar in Ninja Gaiden 2 uses a replenishment system, meaning you don't need to use elixirs to get your energy back. When you beat a wave of enemies your health is re-filled, but any sustained damage (shown by red in your bar) is permanent unless you use a health elixir or blue essence. Fallen enemies release essences of various colours, with yellows acting as the in-game currency used to purchase new items and upgrade weapons, Reds replenish your magic, and blues heal semi-permanent damage.You don't always want to absorb these essences for health though. By holding down the Triangle button Ryu draws them in, allowing him to unleash an Ultimate Technique move. These devastating moves destroy any enemies standing in your way and look spectacular to boot. The standard combat in the 360 version was extremely brutal, with limbs flying and blood spilling all over the place, but this PS3 game has been quite significantly toned down - something that is likely to anger and disappoint fans hoping this would be the ultimate version of the game. Limb and head dismemberment doesn't leave bloody stumps but instead a glowing purple patch. On 360 all the carnage remained in place too, with body parts lying strewn across the floor and blood smeared over walls. This just doesn't happen to the same extent here and the combat loses some of its edge as a result. Still, the new obliteration moves, triggered by pressing Triangle near to a damaged enemy, are pretty brutal.. It's essential you perform these finishing moves as enemies will keep going at you until they're dead - one set of enemies even commit suicide by blowing themselves up while on top of you.In stills Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 doesn't come close to showing its true beauty, although the reduction in gore has made the game less spectacular to see in motion. It doesn't have the same \"WOW\" factor of something like Killzone 2, but it's still a fine looking game when running at a pin-sharp 1080p resolution. The best is reserved for the bosses, which are immense. We're talking proper Shadow of the Colossus scale beasts here, each with numerous attack stages and techniques for taking them down. Just when you think you've seen it all you'll come face to face with another giant monstrosity that defies belief. As with the rest of the game, they're no push over either, with my PS3 controller coming dangerously close to being hurtled towards the TV screen on more than one occasion. Even better for PS3 owners is the fact that Sigma 2 includes a number of bosses not included in the original 360 game!Completely new to the PS3 game is online cooperative play during a number of special challenge stages. It's a shame that there's no story mode to play through with a friend, but the inclusion of any multiplayer at all can only been seen as a good thing. It does make for a rather more chaotic experience, so be prepared for a screen full of carnage. Sadly there's no split-screen co-op, but you can play with an AI partner offline. With medals to go for and stages set across four difficulties there's plenty here to keep you playing once you're done with the campaign. You've also got online leaderboards, although given the game's hardcore following you're going to have to be pretty good to get anywhere near the top.Everything isn't perfect of course. The story is largely forgettable and simply serves to fill the gap between levels. Voice acting is pretty cheesy too, although the voices of the main baddies are typical '80s cartoon quality, which makes them sound pretty menacing and cool. Swimming is once again something I'd rather avoid if possible, with the underwater controls feeling a tad clumsy. Running on water is handled well, but if you get caught in a fight it's all too easy to miss an attack and fall in, resulting in some easy hits for your foes. Some complaints could also be levelled at the save points, which on occasion are a little too spread out and the frame rate drops from time to time during particularly action packed moments just as it did in the 360 game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2009"}

Fleeing his home, Ezio heads for Rome, determined to bring down the juggernaut of the Church and its corrupted allies. Along the way, he rebuilds the Assassins Guild of Italy and Rome itself.AC:B still earns the gold medal for graphics. Whats provided are about ten square miles of the city, and includes many famous landmarks and rather nice background info on a lot of them, for the history buffs who're curious about that stuff. The only down side is by carrying such a huge load for grpahics, loading times tend to lag a noticeable amount. NPC's wink into existence at a close distance before beginning their macro activities, and its somewhat easy to stumble into spawning group of guards. Also included is the present day Mottrogionni, which can be explored by Desmond, who finally has the ability to get up and stretch his legs as needed.Audio also gets a gold medal again. Well written, interesting dialogue, believable and well-voiced characters, and enough background speeches and dialogue that you pretty much only here repeats from the annoyed peasants you crash into.Gameplay is pretty much how you remember it. Actual assassinations are a tad difficult, as you can't move at faster than a brisk walk without alerting guards to your presence, and high profile targets are usually kept surrounded by more guards than the President. But there are so many other options you won't notice or care. You can summon you Assassin initiates to take them out, you can shoot them with pistol or crossbow, poison other guards to nail them in the swinging, or just wage through the ranks, as you're still a elite killer with years of experience.Major improvements abound. You can reload earlier memories, a major annoyance from the prior game. Combat is a lot slicker and more offensive, as you can chain together kills without waiting to counter every opponent. Modern day story is vastly expanded, and its worthwhile to get out and wander around. Puzzles for \"The Truth\" are a lot of fun still, and more creepily delivered. Probably the only let downs are some carry overs from the last game, namely the chase scenes, where you're constantly 3 feet behind your target until the finish line.The third iteration is by far the best. Should Ubi continue to improve in this fashion, they'll be making Game of the Year for a long time. While it doesn't have the wide appeal that current over-hyped titles possess, it's still by far the most in-depth, engaging and entertaining of the series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2010"}
{"product_name":"B004LLRYOY","description":"Square Enix FF IV:The Complete CollectionFinal Fantasy IV:The Complete Collection PSP","reviewerName":"Christopher Barrett \"Evil Corgi\"","summary":"PSP vs DS version: PSP wins in a landslide","reviewText":"Now don't get me wrong, they are both very good remakes.  There are a few issues with each.  In the PSP version, the magic defense glitch is fixed, so your magic defense totals from your equipment actually work (whereas in the DS version...).  So now you won't be getting one shot party death from Red Dragons and such.  But the most glaring problem that I have with this version is the monster speeds.  They are slow.  Super slow.  I found myself getting in two attacks per character before the enemies even hit once.  And I fiddled with the settings, turning the ATB to active and bumping the battles speeds up and down but it made little difference.  Later in the game it does seem that the enemies improve their speed, but your characters' speed also increases greatly, so it's a bit of a wash.  It does tend to make random battles easier.But beyond that one little issue, the game is nearly perfect.  With the addition of the After Years saga, this is a must own for any FFIV fan, and it's one of the main reasons I bought a PSP (along with the Star Ocean remakes and Lunar remake).  So let me tell you a little about why I love this remake.Unlike the more \"3D\" style of the DS FFIV, this is a faithful re-rendering of the original.  Everything is presented in a top down perspective.  The widescreen adds a nice bit of map area which is kind of nice.  The graphics have been updated, but not so much that they detract from the experience and nostalgia.  There are a few spots where the graphic updates make the game look different than the original, but mostly these are inside houses and inside castle rooms.  The towns and dungeons appear to have the same number of 'squares' as the original game.  So if it took twenty 'steps' to get from stairs in one cave to the treasure chest over yonder in the SNES version, than it takes the same in this version.  Encounter rates seem to be on par with the Japanese version of the game.The dialogue has been updated from the old SNES script.  Thankfully they did keep \"You spoony Bard!\" in the game.  One major thumbs up for the game designers is that the music has been remastered, but there is an option to switch to the original score instead.  This can be done from the game menu, so you can actually toggle between scores at will (as long as you can access the menu that is).  The remastered score is very nice and true to the original.  There were only a few times where I felt the new score was changed a bit too much (the few times were mostly during the sappy romance scenes - when Rosa visits Cecil in his room early in the game for example).Many purists might not go for the game as a remake.  It does bear a strong similarity to the original.  But what is nice is the addition of the 'new' sequel The After Years.  This sequel of sorts gives players a continuation of the game with Cecil and Rosa's son as the protagonist.  I highly recommend playing through the remake of FFIV first, especially if you have never played FFIV (FF2 in the US).  The game is a faithful adaptation, and though there isn't a lot of 'fluff' added (such as FMV, or voice acting), I think this gives a nice amount of credibility to the game.  The DS version upped the story line with cut scenes and voice acting, added a mini map and some questionable 'add on' material that changes the game drastically from the original.So the verdict is:FF IV for the PSP is the traditional remake keeping close to the original.  The After Years is a nice addition.FF IV for the DS is a remake along the lines of the FF3 DS remake and FF Four Heroes of Light games.I think they are both worthy games though the DS version is much more difficult.  Especially with the magic defense glitch.  Plus the Dr. Lugae fight is about 99% luck in the DS version.  Frustrations aside, the DS version will test even seasoned RPG veterans in the last couple of areas and on some of the optional bosses.  I own both, and I play both, though I give the higher praise to the PSP version.  It's well worth purchasing this gem on the PSP.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMB3","description":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timemay be the greatest single-player video game ever created in any genre. It's that good. Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide. WithThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Nintendo has come up with an all-consuming adventure title that will provide days of engrossing gameplay.--Eric FredricksonPros:Best single-player video gameFreedom to explore a rich, complex worldHelpful fairy guide gives hintsCharming, humorous, lighthearted, yet challengingCons:Some puzzles can be frustratingOnly one saved game per player--don't save when you're stuck!Much more fun with Rumble Pack","reviewerName":"SleepyJD","summary":"Good back then","reviewText":"This is still a great game to own, especialy if you missed it, but the graphics are dated.

Rhodes","summary":"Actually better than I thought... (4.5 Stars)","reviewText":"Alright my first review depicted that this game had a weak storyline and such. Well, that review is being revised NOW!  Sure I still have all my other gripes but now that I've 100% completed the game, this shows that the story I saw from the first Golden Sun wasn't all of it.  The storyline is actually really good and really complex, even if near the end of this part it got predictable.The good is that the music and graphics are ASTOUNDING for the GBA.  Lots of visuals too. Very colorful to the point where it looks like a nice beautiful PSX game.  The music is astonishing and you'll wonder how they made orchastral music come out of your GBA speaker.  Amazing if you ask me.The storyline is a continuation of the first Golden Sun where as with Golden Sun it's a basic storyline, this one takes a twists where you are the ones that the party of the first Golden Sun was persuing.  Eventually your old party from Golden Sun will join your new one. So you can transfer data (and believe me you WANT to do this if you want all the games incredible secrets). Thus, the plot in this one is extended to a point where it's actually DIFFERENT but conncets to the first one.  Hard to explain.My cons with this game is that it's almost exactly like the first Golden Sun game. Old spells that return have the same battle animation and the battle system hasn't really been changed in anyway. So it's pretty much like a \"Disk 2\" of any PSX game.  But because of this rehash it leaves for little replay value.  The puzzles, while complex are enough to make you want to rip your hair out.The other con is that the game has NO direction in the beginning. You have no idea what you're supposed to do next or where to go. So you could explore all day (FUN!) but if you come to an area where you just don't have the magic for it then you're ..... Now unless you want to talk to just about every NPC in the game and I mean ALL of them, you might as well buy a guide at least if you get stuck.The game was beautiful and by far it was best I've seen on the GBA so far (besides probably Metroid Fusion). This is absolutely a breath taking game. If you liked the first one then get this! If you haven't played the first one then play that first.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-02-2003"}

Its a silent hill game on one hand and on the other one that has a story that predates one of the leading frontier of psychological horror video games. I will start with the story then go down the list._STORY_Travis is a truck driver who on a routine drive almost runs over a young girl thats on the road, sound familiar? Thats because most of the game is. In general the game is pretty much silent hill from the psone condensed along with some character missing. Think of it as a directors cut sort of like the resident evil directors cut on the psnone. You really don't have to play this game. You can skip right ahead to the original and still get the same experience except one that is more disturbing and doesn't explain everything. That's one thing that bothers me is that they try to explain a lot about the characters from the original game. I did not like what they did to Lisa and Kaufman it feels out of place and too raunchy for a SH story and characters._GAMEPLAY_The gameplay I appreciate for the most part. It plays just like the classic survival horror games of yesteryears. With some slight tweaks of course, mainly tide to combat. Travis can punch and pick up a lot of junk to use as weapons; thankfully they break easily because the combat should and never be the focus of a SH game._SOUND_Superb, this is one game you'll want to play with headphones on especially at night when your alone. The music is fantastic as always with Akira and Mary lending their much needed talent notably Akira's with his unerving industrial sounds that permiates the whole game._ENEMIES_They sort of suffer from the rehash of being tied to Alessa, Travis has some demons to but they are hardly noticeable when trying to find the connection. Some of them feel forced in there.Overall its a great first SH outing on the PSP and one that you'll appreciate I just wish they didn't use any connection to the first game. It would of been a much better game had it been original like SH2 or SH4 with no ties to any other game. Its still a must own if your horror and SH fan.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00BQI3UQG","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"One of the best Wii games has now become one of the best 3DS games","reviewText":"I can almost hear the haters now, complaining about Nintendo re-releasing a two year old game onto the 3DS, but such gripes are unfounded in my opinion. While it is true that this is *mostly* a port of the fantastic platformer from a couple years back, there are definitely enough additions and differences to make this a game that may be the preferred version among fans. Seeing how this is a game that has, for the most part, been accessible since 2010, I'll focus mainly on discussing the differences between this version and the original and whether or not you'll want to even bother buying this.In the rare case that you're not familiar withDonkey Kong Country Returns, I'll sum the game up thusly: It is easily one of the best Wii games, arguably the best Donkey Kong game that has ever been released, and it's a real contender for best 2-D platformer of the past two decades. It is that good. The whole experience is just saturated with nostalgia while still feeling extremely fresh. The visuals are colorful and stylistic, and the music is wonderful, whether the tune is classic or new. The level design and game mechanics are amazingly well-crafted, the difficulty and satisfaction in the game is huge, and most importantly, the control mechanics are so tight you can bounce a quarter off of the game and make change. Much like the original DKC trilogy, the gameplay has an awesome rhythmic quality to it. Yes, the game may be missing King K. Rool and the Kremlings as villains, and many of DK's relatives we've all come to know and love don't show up, but for the most part, Donkey Kong Country Returns really is the quintessential Donkey Kong game, and should not be missed. If you never got a change to play the original (god forbid), then this is a wonderful time to get into it, for certain.So what are the main additions/differences between DKCR3D and the original? First off, the controls are obviously different. The Wii original used the motion-control capability of the Wiimote to good effect, in my opinion. I thought the waggle activated actions worked well for the most part, but it did have its issues that could really add frustration in intense platforming sections. I know of many people who hated that part of the original. For those who weren't so enthusiastic about the motion, you'll be happy to know that has all been replaced by traditional button presses, obviously. So basically, you will have a different experience when it comes to rolling, blowing, ground-pounding, etc. Otherwise, the super tight controls are the same.There is a bit of extra content that has been added to the game this time around. After you beat the game, a whole new \"world\" of levels becomes accessible that are quite fun and unique to play through. Many of the settings of these new levels fit the themes found in the original world levels, but are brand new, such as one on a huge, low-leveled riverbed in a forest. They look and play great. The original had a ton of content, but these new additions are very nice indeed.While DKCR is definitely a fun game, there's no doubt that it's also by far one of the most challenging platformers of the past decade or so. This definitely adds a huge level of satisfaction to the game, but it also stands as a huge barrier of entry to younger or less experienced gamers. For those people, Nintendo has added an \"easy mode\" of sorts to the game that greatly reduces the challenge. Some changes in this mode include DK and Diddy getting three hearts by default instead of two, power-ups that reduce damage, green balloons that save you if you were to fall into a bottomless pit, etc. To be honest, I'm torn on this. On one hand, I appreciate making a hard game more accessible so everyone can enjoy it. On the other hand, this \"easy mode\" makes the game almost insultingly easy by comparison. It's not too bad though, because \"original mode\" is still available, so if you crave the soul-crushing difficulty of the original, you can still play it that way, which is great.Well, that's most of the major changes/additions you can expect from this game. I'm very impressed with the port-job the game received. Very little was sacrificed to get the game to play on Nintendo's handheld. You'll notice some details in the visuals are a bit toned down. After all, the 3DS isn't quite up to the Wii's specs, but it does still look great for the most part. DKCR is a splendidly detailed game, and it's worth noting that having all that shrunk to the 3DS(XL)'s screen size can get crowded at times. The cool 3-D effect, while nonessential for the gameplay itself, is really enjoyable to look at. Some portions of the game, such as the special silhouette levels, look really awesome in 3-D. The only problem I have with 3-D is that when action is heavy, sometimes the frame rate stutters ever-so-slightly, which can be a problem in a precision platformer like this. It's also worth noting that, while the original DKCR ran in 60 fps on the Wii, this version has been toned down to 30 fps, again, due to the difference in tech. While this is a shame, it really doesn't affect what a good time you'll be having. It still plays fantastic. Overall, Monster Games, the developer who did most of the work porting this game (they also madePilotwings Resort), did a pretty fantastic job.So, whether you played the original DKCR and salivate at the idea of it being portable, having extra content, and a new control scheme, or you're a newbie who has never even touched the game before, I'd say Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D is definitely a game you'll want to buy. I understand veterans of the original may not want to dish out the cash to play the game again, even with the aforementioned additions, but I did, and I'm glad I did. DKCR was the game that proved Retros Studios was a top-tier developer whose genius in theMetroid Prime Trilogywas not luck or a one-off success (and it appears Retro isn't quite done making DK games. Can't wait for DK Tropical Freeze, it looks amazing already!). They really hit this one out of the park. Personally, I can only think of a few \"flatformers\" that I enjoyed as much or more than I did with DKCR, and now I can enjoy it again on the go with this 3DS version. It's a fantastic game that simply should not be missed if you consider yourself a fan of Nintendo, DK, platformers, or just plain awesome games in general. Buy it, enjoy the expertly crafted platforming, and go on a banana hoarding adventure through a lush jungle island with one of video gaming's biggest and oldest icons.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2013"}

In his final hours, he experiences a fantastical dream where he encounters a young girl facing a terrible destiny and the boy who will fight to save her. On the border between dreams and reality, Chopin discovers the light that shines in all of us in this enduring tale of good and evil, love and betrayal. Developed by Tri-Crescendo and featuring the music of Chopin, Eternal Sonata for the PLAYSTATION&#xAE;3 computer entertainment system delivers amazingly detailed 3D graphics, a captivating storyline, an innovative action battle system as well as new playable characters, quests, music and more.","reviewerName":"citan-uzuki \"citan-uzuki\"","summary":"Second Playthrough is a Charm","reviewText":"This is my second review of this game.  My first review was written when Eternal Sonata first came out for the XB360, roughly three years ago.  I was browsing my local game store and came across this version for the PS3.  I decided to buy it and play on my PS3.Well, after six weeks, and approximately 77 hours of play-time, I have finished the game.  I do not recall the XB360 version being this challenging!  Browsing through various game forums confirmed my belief that the PS3 version is indeed more challenging.  I have been playing Japanese Role Playing Games ever since the first Playstation console came out.  I've had my share of fighting tough Boss battles.  And the battle with Tuba at the bridge in this game has to rank as one of the more challenging ones.  Along with Mikumari in Xenosaga II.  Tuba is not quite as tough as Mikumari, but he certainly will make you feel accomplished once you do beat him.The main character in the game is the composer, Frederic Chopin.  On his deathbed, he starts to dream.  And the story takes place within his dream.  He joins Allegretto, Beat, Polka, Viola, and others in trying to stop the villain, Count Waltz.  Yes, the characters are named based on music.  We also get some flashbacks and glimpses into the real life of Chopin.The battle system is basically turn-based, but you are under pressure because your turn is limited by time.  The countdown starts as soon as its your turn.  Just as you can interrupt the enemy's attack by counterattacking, they can do the same to you.  Strategy is important because your enemy can \"block\", or guard against your attack.  If you can, try to get behind them before attacking.  Speed is very important.  The faster you can press the attack button, the X button, the more damage you can do.  Needless to day, after almost 80 hours of playing this game, the X button on my controller is showing some wear.  The battles are definitely frenetic and fast-paced compared to most role-playing games.There are numerous sidequests in the game.  One has you collecting Score pieces, basically pieces of music.  You can then play what you have together with various NPCs throughout the game for rewards.  There are a few bonus dungeons in the PS3 version to keep you playing longer.  The main sidequests is called \"Mysterious Unison\".  This is a very long and challenging quests that takes place later in the game.The story itself is involving.  While not as good as the likes of Xenogears, Xenosaga, Final Fantasy, etc., it is more than good enough.  And hey, it's great to play along as Frederic Chopin!  Playing the role of a real-life character is satisfying on its own.  Although it is highly doubtful that the real Frederic Chopin was ever any good at fighting dragons, wizards, zombies, and such.  I am sure if Chopin could see this game, he would be amused and entertained.  In the game, his main weapon is a French baston (cane).The graphics are great.  No surprise there.  The soundtrack is outstanding, featuring some of Chopin's compositions.  The renowned pianists Stanislav Bunin played the pieces for the game's soundtrack.  The game is also educational, in that we are introduced to one of the greatest composers to have lived.  Through various flashbacks, we are told the story of Chopin's short life.  He died at a young age of 39 after fighting with tuberculosis.I highly recommend this game.  This is a true, classic Japanese Role-Playing Game.  You will not regret it.  Just be forewarned that there are three very difficult, very challenging battles in the game.  One with Tuba at the bridge, and two with the arch villain, Count Waltz.  It will take more than a few tries to get through these battles.  But please do not give up.  The ending scenes are a treat.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2011"}

As these survivors' allies mysteriously fall victim to dementia, it becomes clear that protecting a young girl granting them a bizarre immunity may be their only hope for survival in a struggle that could have implications for all of humanity.GameplayAlthough designed to preserve the feel of the action of the original game, gameplay inExtractionis also quite unique. First, the player perspective has been changed from third, to first-person, placing all the action right in front of you. Also,Extractionis a 'rail shooter,' meaning a shooter game where most of the action engaged in and paths followed are programmed into the mission play, instead of the freeform wandering ability built into the considerably larger Next-Gen and PCDead Spacerelease. The combination of these two changes funnels the players focus onto the combat options available in the game. In dealing with the danger of the alien Necromorphs swarming the game space,Dead Space Extractionutilizes the precision of the Wii Remote in variety of ways. Weapons like the Plasma Cutter can dispatch these enemies from a distance by taking advantage of the remote's pointing targeting ability, while a quick wave can activate weapons like the Ripper, a guidable spinning saw blade. The Wii Remote is also handy for picking up items and hurling them at enemies using the power of Kinesis.Other gameplay changes include new play modes. The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn't become too easy. In addition,Extractionalso features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed. Taken together all these changes add up to more action, more fun and moreDead Spacefor players on the Wii.Key Game FeaturesAn All-New Prequel Exclusively for the WiiFollow the lives of several different Aegis VII colony members as they carve a bloody path to survival.Meet a new cast of characters, destroy fearsome new enemies, and wield brutal new weapons.Real TerrorStunning graphics, panic-inducing audio, and a frenetic first-person perspective thrust you headlong into the terror.Play through an engrossing, interactive horror movie experience that raises the bar for storytelling in video games.Intuitive ControlsStrategically dismember your enemies with pinpoint control using the Wii Remote.Wield a powerful arsenal of abilities and weapons to freeze enemies, manipulate gravity with telekinesis, solve puzzles, and fight off attacks from every direction in zero gravity.Co-Op GameplayTeam up with a friend to fight off the invasion on the USG Ishimura with jump-in cooperative play.Combine efforts on engineering puzzles or determine specific roles to create a unique experience with each play session.","reviewerName":"Christopher Deweese","summary":"Death on Rails","reviewText":"Dead Space: Extraction is the best rail shooter I've ever played.  To be quite honest, it's possibly the best Wii game I've ever played!  The graphics, audio, and gameplay are all superb and represent what all developers should be striving for with this genre.Visceral Games has pushed the Wii's graphics capabilities to the max on this one.  Of course, that's not saying much when compared to the original title on the PS3 and 360.  You're not going to see the same lighting or particle effects, but you will be impressed by it's stability and framerate.  The environments are actually very detailed, and the characters' facial expressions are pretty realistic.The sound effects are every bit as eery as the original's.  The score provides a heightened sense of tension throughout the game.  Like any good horror movie, Dead Space's use of silence punctuated with intense creepy sounds keeps you on your toes.As you've probably already gathered, this is a rail shooter.  The only thing you control is the reticle on screen, what type of weapon you fire, and telekinesis to grab goodies.  Even though it's a rail shooter, it doesn't feel too \"arcady.\"  There's enough challenge and customization (upgrades, weapons cache, player rating) to keep you coming back after you've finished the campaign.  The fact that you can't really control where you go doesn't hurt the experience.Having played and loved the original Dead Space on the PS3, I was a tad skeptical about how it would translate to the Wii.  Those fears have been alleviated!  If anything, I'm glad I have a reason to fire up my Wii.  Moreover, I'm glad the Dead Space story is being fleshed out.  It's creepy, intense, and just plain fun!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2009"}

It's so strange, the characters in the game often comment \"it's hard to believe that the Nazis would try that.\"The bizzaro plot does not detract from game play too much. Castle Wolfenstein of course is a first person shooter. The controls are intuitive - players of other x-box games like Halo should have no problem adapting. The graphics are hit and miss. Some levels look very nice and lush - the water looks very real. Other levels are too dark, and it's hard to see. Still other levels have mediocre graphics that probably could've been done on old PS1.The weaponry is nothing new: rifles, submachine guns, silenced pistols, knives, rocket launchers, grenades, etc. etc. I found the large number of weapons made it difficult to quickly switch guns during game play from one to another.Overall this game is nothing new to x-box. Some parts look good, others look pretty bad. The plot is pretty unbelieveable stuff, and doesn't do anything for the game (except explain why nazis and zombies are fighting you at the same time). If you're looking for a new game, you might just rent this and beat it over the weekend. Of course, I didn't play the live version, so you might read another review for that.

I was in disbelief through the entire game at how much detail they managed to add to the world. In other &#34;tube shooters&#34; - what I call games where you shoot your way from point A to point B and then roll credits, normally you can't help but feel right away that you are basically in a tunnel. Every door and path is locked except for exactly how the developers intended you to get past this point. In many ways Naughty Dog's Uncharted series is very guilty of follow this trope, but The Last of Us completely redefines what games like this can be.Generally, the game is about getting from point A to point B; the characters in the game actually point at B several times and say &#34;We have to get over there,&#34; but the big difference is that there is almost always at least two paths to take, and you can choose stealthy, confrontational, or evasive strategies to get by.Each one of these paths is just as detailed as the others. There are so much art work in the game it astonishes me. There are posters, statues, vases, books, general desk mess, etc that very seldom repeat, and you will be rewarded greatly for exploring every dead end.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"A Masterpiece.  What more can I say?","reviewText":"A while back, I went to Game Stop to pick up something and as usual the guy behind the counter was trying to get me to reserve every game in the book including Bio Shock which at the time I had heard nothing about.  We had about a 5 minute conversation, (with him doing most of the talking) about how great it was going to be and how it was going to hold gamers over until Halo 3 was released.  After all that I told him no thanks, thinking to myself just how great can a FPS game be?  After I got what I needed I was on my way, and before I left he suggested trying out the Demo.  A few days later I decided to download the Bio Shock demo from XBOX Live to see what all the fuss was about.  Ever since that fateful day, I have been hooked ever since.  The demo showed much potential and I ended up purchasing it a week later.Before you go thinking that this is \"just another FPS\", I am here to tell you it's not.  It's the originality of this game that keeps me intrigued more than anything.  First off while you have space to hold more guns that a real human being can carry, there is also a new element that I have not seen in any other FPS game that I have played.  What I am referring to is \"Plasmids\", shortly in the game, after an incident with a syringe, you DNA is altered in a way that gives you many abilities and new attacks.  The first skill you get is the electro bolt which does just that, allowing you to shoot an electric ball out of your hand to stun enemies and to also override malfunctioning door panels.  There are many other skills including fire ball, winter blast and telekinesis which should be pretty self explanatory.  These are not limited to combat abilities there are other \"Tracks\" that effect how fast you can hack a machine and the ability to auto-camouflage just to name a few.In addition this game is not linear which is a flaw of many FPS's.  You are pretty much able to go anywhere you want, and the various cabinets, bodies and ice are not just there for decoration, you can actually search them for money, bullets and other useful items.  You can also melt ice with your fire plasmid.The graphics in the game are good, but nothing like the graphics in Halo 3.  This does not mean that the graphics are disappointing, quite the contrary; the way you and the other characters interact with the environment is quite realistic, if you walk under falling water you will see water run down the screen momentarily even slightly blurring your vision.  If you burn enemies you will actually see their charred bodies smoking momentarily as your search their bodies for goodies.  Even when equipping your winter blast tonic, your left hand will spurt blood as the icicles shoot through your skin. The only thing about the graphics that is not \"top notch\" is the up close detail of the characters.  You will notice a little blockiness, but this does not hurt the game play at all.Bio Shock is a creepy and suspenseful game, and a big reason is because of the sound.  Having surround sound allows one to experience the game the way it was supposed to.  Walking through the underwater city of Rapture, you will frequently hear the splicers chat with each other or even talking to themselves as they wander around.  If they see you, they will occasionally sneak up behind you and you will be able to hear their footsteps creeping up from behind, only to turn around and see that they are not there, other times they will be right in your face trying to beat you to death with a bloody wrench.The controls are well suited for this game and it only takes a couple of minutes to get used to the controls.  One may find switching between weapons and/or tonics in the heat of battle to be a little bit cumbersome.  However it is forgiving in that the game action pauses while you switch weapons, so there is no fumbling around on the analogue stick needed, just simply hold down RB or LB (for plasmids) and the game will let you make your selection in peace.  Once you are done selecting, the game jumps back into action immediately without missing a beat.The storyline is also miles ahead of any storyline in other FPS, and as you may already know, it takes place in the under water city of Rapture in the Atlantic Ocean.  You will obviously notice by the environment that the story does not take place \"now\", instead its set around 1959 judging from the \"Happy New Year\" picture in one of the first levels in the game.  This even adds more to originality of the game, usually when a FPS is set in the past it's a war game like COD or Medal of Honor.  The reviewer, pattic that mentions that it has an \"absorbing story\" is absolutely correct.  It is quite a refreshing twist on your typical FPS story and it's almost as enjoyable as the game itself; great job in this department.In summary I really can't find anything wrong with this game that would warrant me giving this game any less than 5 stars in both categories.  With all the hype surrounding Halo 3, this game may be unfairly overlooked; and while Halo 3 is also a very fun game, Bio Shock is one of those rare titles that come along every once in a while that raises the bar and blows everyone away with original game play and a great story to go along with it.A must have if you want a break from your typical \"shoot everything that moves\" title.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2007"}

Don't we all already have one of these that we're not using?- Has a headset jack so you can still plug one in (it covers the controller's jack).- It does not impact chargers that charge from top of the controller. Works fine with what I have,Xbox 360 Energizer Power & Play Charging System.CONS- If you have really big hands and like to wrap your fingers around the entire controller handles, you won't be able to anymore.- This adds a little bit of weight to the controller.- It drains the battery quicker; though nothing too noticeable for me since I don't message much.- It blocks chargers that charge from the bottom of the controller.OVERALL- Personally, I think this chatpad is worth the investment if you can afford it (or if you send a lot of messages). That said, at the cost of about $25, if I was a starving college kid like I was eons ago, I would probably suffer without it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2011"}

Fans of the original Star Wars Battlefront will also enjoy an all-new single-player experience that takes players through an epic story-based saga where every action the player takes impacts the battlefront and ultimately the fate of the Star Wars galaxy.Star Wars Battlefront II improves upon the original game s single-player experience with open-ended mission-based objectives inspired from all six Star Wars films. The pelling storyline spans more than 16 new locations many from the Episode III movie including volcanic Mustafar and the space battle above Coruscant.

When I 1st got the game I went right to Galactic Conquest I click on the 1st selection and I was fighting in space and was very excited until I got kill 15 times!! (most I ever died in Battlefront I was 4 times) then to top it off I couldn't shot down any ships, I became very frustrated!!! Then I exited the space fighting and went to Genoese to do land battle (which I know I'm expert at) then I was being killed there every minute and I had hard time understand were my life meter was, how to reload ammo etc... I was ready to give up on the game and understood why some people said Battlefront II isn't as good as Battlefront I.Then I decided to started the game from the beginning and went through \"Training\" which is Very easy but that is where I learn how I can change my trooper in the middle of the game (without having to kill myself, is a great new feature!!) and how to use a Jedi, after the training was done I went to \"Over View of Space\" where it tells you to do \"Rise of the Empire\" Your on land at 1st, which is easy to accomplish but you learn how to take down shields and find object to take back to base or to a ship. Then your in space where it teaches you how to fly, how to lock on the targets, and how to fly into enemies hangers and blow up their ships. After completing all the task in the training & Rise of the empire, then I jump into Galactic Conquest and I did so Much Better and I now LOVE Battlefront II.It's so much more challenging Then BFI, you can't accomplish BFII in one day, which I like!! BFI my 4yr old can play it and get score as high as me, but BFII is to hard for him as it should be. There are more troops & vehicles to choose from. And I don't understand why other say the graphic are bad, maybe they have cheap TV's. But on my 32\" flat screen TV the graphic are crystal clear for me, the planets have more detail and are almost real looking, the wookies look a lot better then they did in Battlefront I. There are so many more planets to choose from and fighting in space is a great feature when you get tired of doing land battles.The best advice I can give: I don't care how good you are at Battlefront I, this is a Whole new game with different features so I suggest going through \"Training\" and \"Rise of the Empire\" before conquering the galaxy and you'll like the game much better I do. BFII IS SO MUCH BETTER THEN BFI!! can't wait for BFIII","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2005"}

True Crime 1 had you flying in different directions and doing slow motion dives behind cars. When cars would explode, you would be thrown backwards. In True Crime 2, you basically just point and shoot. There are different weapons that let you take people down non-lethally that you are given. There's no point in using targeting.The melee fights aren't that cool either. In True Crime 1 you were doing all kinds of kung fu moves while breaking everything around you. In this game, you press a button 3 times and the combo is executed.Also, the actual feel of the game has been lost a little bit. In True Crime 1, you had no map and were basically cruising to a destination unknown. It was fun driving to new objectives at night during the rain. In this game, you aren't quite as lost, but then again, that isn't a great thing. I enjoyed getting lost in True Crime 1 and I enjoyed feeling out of place everywhere. It was weird cruising as far as I could go and feeling like i should turn around.One of the more interesting features about True Crime 2 is the fact that you can enter any building.

It's a royal pain if your controller dies when you're deep in the middle of your favorite game! Because there's four of them, having a single unit that charges all of them at the same time is perfect.The unit is just about as small as it could be. The four controllers sit in it vertically, in a two by two grid, and they fit in quite easily. In essence the port at the base of each controller fits right into a matching port in the half-a-sphere shaped charger unit.There's a ring around the base of each controller's area which turns blue when that controller is fully charged. That way you can tell at a glance when they are ready.There's an on-off switch so if you're playing with the controllers you can turn off the unit and not have it use any extra power.The Quad Charger even provides an extra bonus - there are two regular USB ports on the back side of the unit. So if you have items in your house that need to plug into a USB, you can plug them in here. There's a lot of charging that this one little item can handle for you.Are there any downsides here? Normally I try to make my reviews as rounded as possible and, really, I can't see any issues. If you're going to be playing with your PS3 Move system, you need your controllers to be fully charged. You don't want them to die while you're in the middle of a game. You want a charger that's as small as possible, that's easy to use, and that lets you know when the charge is complete. You get everything here!Highly recommended, with no reservations.We purchased this unit with our own funds for the purpose of doing this review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2011"}

I picked it up along with a variety of titles that had already been released.  It just so happens that Dark Kingdom was my least favorite of the bunch, in fact at the time I beat once over the span of two weeks and haven't even touched the game since.  Untold Legends: Dark Kingdom is not a very good example of what the PS3 is capable of (we all probably know this by now), but the game comes across as rushed and lacking.Dark Kingdom is a Hack n' Slash with some RPG elements, such as leveling up.  At first glance Dark Kingdom has some really desirable features in a hack n' slash.  It allows you to level up and improve your character, co-op mode, minor puzzle elements, simple combat system that makes the game easy to pick up and play.  However the overall rushed feeling the game presents ruins much of the positives.  Co-Op has camera problems, simple combat ends up leading to incredibly repetitive and almost boring combat elements and the puzzle elements really didn't provide much of a challenge.  It just feels like a game that could of been a really fun Hack and Slash that got rushed and butchered to favor early release over quality.Overall, Dark Kingdom is what it is... a rushed early launch title for the PS3.  At the time I purchased this title it was for $29.99 and at that price it still felt disappointing.  At the current price of $16 (9/5/2011), if you happen to be bored and in need of a generic, simple hack and slash this might be worth a buy at that price.  I still recommend this game as a RENTAL though.A 3 star game in terms of Fun and experience; but overall value for the game falls in a 2 star category... good for a rental.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2011"}

This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Brian Reaves","summary":"Clear your afternoon before you start playing","reviewText":"This is one of those \"WOW!\" games you find every so often. The graphics here are great, and it's a free-roam city to race in (and a pretty big one at that). You choose to run a mission or if you'd like you can just drive around and find shortcuts or complete side tasks like hitting billboards or busting private areas. The car physics are good, and there's not a huge learning curve right off the bat to keep you from playing.Starting off you only have one car to choose from. It's all right for a starter, but gets old quickly. Getting a new car isn't that hard though, so you don't have to keep it for long. And I love the way you can get a new paint job for free just by driving through the paint place!The enemy AI is competitive, but not impossible. If you know shortcuts (and some of them will take a while to find), you can win most races with time to spare. Trying to win the race with no shortcuts, however, will be frustrating quickly.Of course, the major draw of the game is the crashes and instant replays of such. You can do some spectacular smash-ups here, and when you hit top speed it will probably be what you do on an ongoing basis just to be amazed. There's a lot of fun to be had here, and it's not a game you get tired of quickly.The only major downside to the game is the fact that it's single player only. I wish they'd have allowed us some head-to-head racing that didn't involve an online account. Still, it's the only fault I could see in this game and I wouldn't let it stop me from buying it.

{"product_name":"B000P46NKC","description":"Resident Evil 4 Wii","reviewerName":"engnir1","summary":"G.O.A.T. - Greatest Of All Time.......","reviewText":"By now I'm sure you have read plenty of reviews about this game for the Wii. So I'm going to throw this out to you instead.....I have played Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition, all four Call Of Duty games, GoldenEye and Quantum of Solace, The Conduit, Red Steel 1 & 2, Rogue Trooper, No More Heroes, Dead Rising Chop Till You Drop, and Cursed Mountain all for the Wii. So if you have played some or all of these games and enjoyed them, then I don't know how you cannot like Resident Evil 4!! RE4 is not only the best game I have played on the Wii (and continue to play to this day), but it just might be the best game I have ever played. And I started playing games back when the Atari 2600 came out. It's a long game to finish, and when you do complete the game, more games are now available like Assignment Ada, Separate Ways, and the Mercenaries missions so re-playability is endless! Bottom line is this, if you are on this page, then you obviously have an interest in this game. You CANNOT go wrong in buying this game as it is one of the best games ever made and very inexpensive. Again, if you have played some or all of the games that I mentioned above, then you are completely missing out on this one. BUY IT!!! You won't regret it!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2011"}

As far as in game communications go, it's effective but flawed. You need to speak clearly in order to really be heard.The other problem is that the headset isn't adjustable. You basically take a gamble that the product will fit on your ear. I'm not sure that's something that everyone wants to do.For the price, it's hard to argue against this though. If you spend more money, you'll get a better product. But for the price, this headset isn't a bad option. I like it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2013"}

He has traveled back into Nosgoth's past to continue his relentless pursuit of Kain, his nemesis and father.Over the course of his journey, Raziel unearths the mysteries behind Nosgoth's ancient races, and exposes the secrets behind the corruption of the Pillars and the vampire genocide. As Raziel confronts the shadows of his unremembered past, he discovers a web of destiny stretching eons into Nosgoth's history.

The game also plays with greater fluidity due to its constant 60-frames-per-second run rate.","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"Sometimes if you toss the coin enough times...","reviewText":"There are a handful of quoteable movies that just make someone seem so much cooler when they quote the movie, there aren't that many games like that, sadly because the emphases has always been on graphics, and ocassionally developers will work on Gameplay too. For those of us who play games for story we just seem so much cooler for knowing the dialogue of Legacy of Kain. Legacy of Kain can be for gamers, what Fight Club is for movie buffs. seriesly! These three games are the most quotable games in history! Nothing is more fun than running down the halls at work shouting &quot;Vae Victus!&quot; Not only is the dialogue sharp, and so well written it would blow shakespear out of the water, but Kain has had a history of incredably great gameplay, it's hard to get bored playing these games.SR 1 (especially the dreamcast version) had it's bugs and was less than perfect. SR 2, however, has corrected absolutely every minor complaint I had with the first one. The camera work is better, the graphics and animation are solid and the best part is that the story is even deeper than SR 1, and is right up there with Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, the original by Silicon Knights.Eidos Interactive is listed as one of my least favorite devlopers for Tomb Raider and it's countless clones, and thier refusal to put an end to the crappy cameras and bad control. When I first heard that Eidos had nabbed Legacy of Kain I was in a state of dread, thankfully Legacy of Kain still manages to break the molds of corporate games and takes the gamer on a wild thrill ride throughout Nosgoth, past present and future, like it's predicassors the games focuses on art and story every bit as much as graphics and gameplay. I don't think there could possibly be a better horror title out there. Crystal D should really look into getting a verbatim film made of these games, as Legacy of Kain is second Only to Vampire The Masqerade (Tabletop) in it's gothic horror style storytelling.Eidos should learn from this game. If the next Tomb Raider plays this well then maybe I'll buy it. Resident Evil may also want to learn from this.Something else to boast about is the complex new method of puzzel solving. Gone are the insert block through slot throw switch puzzles, instead there is a lot of object placement, and setting things up. I'm stuck on the light mirror puzzle. This game was well worth the wait!The DVD extras give the game a little kick. Something else I hope becomes industry standard. Kain breaks the mold of PS2 games here by giving the player a true DVD experience with DVD extras, backstory, soundtracks, making of featurett, even outtakes, though some of it must be unlocked. SR 2 is packed full of everything one would need to declair this game perfect, and hands down the best of the series thus far. The only complaint I have is that the opening FMV seemed a bit cartoony compared to SR 1's amazing FMV which just looked more realistic for some reason.&quot;Vae Victus!&quot;Buy this game, you know you want it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2001"}
