This time, our Prince is hunted by Dahaka, an immortal incarnation of Fate. The spirit seeks retirbution against the Prince, but he is wiser and deadlier than he was. To avoid his preordained death, he'll travel to the infernal core of mankind's worst fears.","reviewerName":"Abhilash.R \"The Sagittarian\"","summary":"A preview of a worthy sequel...(rating based on first-look)","reviewText":"If you enjoyed playing Prince of Persia - The Sands of Time, then you will be spellbound by its sequel \"Warrior Within\". This game no doubt, ups the ante of the previous rendition by a huge scale.  Since I am not in a position to review it yet, let me state my first impressions of the game in the context of the videos and files I've gone through.Firstly, the protagonist. The Prince in the first game was an up-and-coming warrior of immense skill and heart. Though naive, he had the courage to set things right . But he had no clear idea of what to do except restore the order of time.In Warrior Within though, the Prince is 10 yrs older. And more mysterious. He is the ultimate warrior, having experienced countless battles since restoring the Sands of Time. He is dark, broody, independent and utterly dangerous to the point of being manic. And he knows exactly what to do now.Sands of Time has a very brightly-lit atmosphere to it. All the surroundings are visually breathtaking and there is a soft aura of appearance to it, probably showcasing the transient beauty of the Arabian landscape.POP-Warrior Within is the exact opposite in appearance. It has vivid and awe-inspiring landscapes, no doubt, but it is creepy, foreboding and unforgiving. It rather showcases the effect of the Sands of Time's disastrous effect on the world. It also has a completely re-worked graphics engine which looks terrific. The terrain and the characters looks extremely realistic and fluid in movement.I wish to state that if there is any reason POP:WW might have a fallout with you, it could only be the environment itself. Take it for granted that the game will have a very dark, menacing look to it, all through. It will be gorgeous to look at, no doubt, but somehwere down the line, we might start asking \"Why is it SO dark in concept?\". This could turn us off quite a bit coz' we would want to relate this game to the fantastic feel of Sands of Time. Let's face it. Sands of Time had the most uplifting level design to date. I surely hope Ubisoft has not taken the word 'bleakness' to the extreme.I also noticed that the Prince is not the same naive, likeable guy we know off.  Hopefully he doesn't have a total makeover in his personality.Neverthless, POP:WW has a lot more to offer.....Sands of Time had the bubbly Farah as your companion. In Warrior Within, you seek no one's aid in combat. But a few new mysterious characters do help you at times, in achieving your objective. Variety is one thing you can expect.In Sands of Time, the Prince has only a few but effective combat moves to his repertoire. In one hand he held the Dagger of Time and in the other, he had a Scimitar to deal primary damage and he could piece together a few combos to deal some effective damage.In Warrior Within, the combat is truly groundbreaking. Just like Ryu Hayabusa in Ninja Gaiden, the Prince has some amazing combos to showcase his skill. Not only can he dual-wield weapons this time around, but he can also grab his assailant's weapon and counter target his enemy. He can also contextually use his environment to good effect, for instance, latch onto a pole and revolve-slash multiple enemies. The effect, I tell you, is something to be seen. Warrior Within is the first game to introduce 'free-form' combat, meaning, you can create your own combos and latch them together to deal some truly unique and incredible attack manoeuvres. Imagine. Think of all the weapons that he gets his hands on and the combos you can attach them to. The though itself is whetting my appetite.Sands of Time had a sense of grandness that not many games could even think off, particularly the level design. Even Halo cannot compare itself to it. But Warrior Within is very similar to its predecessor. Though darker story-wise, it has the same sweeping sense of scale the first rendition enjoyed and provides a lot more than that. Ubisoft has been clever not to expose everything just yet but it is safe to say that Warrior Within is much bigger than Sands of Time.The enemies in Sands of Time were few and all of them were zombies. With some understanding, they could be easily disposed off. Not so in Warrior Within. I believe there are all-together 9 types who range from the fast Executioners who attack in co-ordinate pairs to the massive Brute who can crush you with one swipe. There is another creature called the Griffin that could put even some Ninja Gaiden bosses to shame. All sounds exciting.Phew !. If I go on, this preview would probably never end.  Since this is just a general description of what you can expect in Warrior Within, I'd be hard pressed to discuss its finer details. It is astonishing how Ubisoft has managed to change the game completely in just over a year after the first game.  I would be very surprised if you aren't impressed with its technical aspects. They are truly Next-Gen and among the three consoles supporting it, the XBOX version undoubtedly looks and feels better. But it is safe to say that Prince of Persia : Warrior Within will be a must-buy for any console.PS: Thanx for going through the preview. If you are interested in my review, you can check it out in the Playstation version of the game.Have a nice day.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2004"}

{"product_name":"B0050SZD18","reviewerName":"terpfan1980 \"Barry\"","summary":"The start of something...","reviewText":"Realistically, as I've been tinkering with the limited edition Kickstarter Backer Ouya console that I finally received in the last few weeks, I've been left trying to figure out whether or not the money that I put into supporting the company was money well spent or instead just a lost cause.  Like many others that had backed Ouya via Kickstarter, I sat for quite a while waiting to finally get some sort of notice that the Limited Edition console that I should have been getting as a reward was ever going to ship.  When I finally did receive the e-mail saying that my Ouya was on the move, well, then the thoughts switched more to \"now what am I going to do with this thing?\"Oh, I had and continue to have plans and expectations.  I'm very hopeful that apps like an Amazon Instant Video app will come to pass (no, I have no inside knowledge of one coming, and don't want to start a rumor here of one coming, I just hope that one does).  I'd like apps like Flixster, Vudu, and other video streaming apps such as Netflix to also come to the device.  If they do, then this console certainly moves well up into 5 star territory.Even as the console currently exists, with a whopping 170+ (at the time I'm writing this) games and apps available on it, it is showing a lot of promise and could be the start of something big from a relatively small package.  At roughly the size of a Rubik's Cube, this little piece of hardware is pretty amazing, or can be, depending on the applications you want to run and can find available.Granted, the Ouya store is somewhat limited, but part of the beauty of this little device is that you aren't just limited to using the Ouya app store.  You can go a little sideways (to borrow a line from a Dierks Bentley song) and install a much, much wider selection of apps on this device if you want to.  Instructions, walk-throughs, etc., are freely available out there for those that might be so inclined.Natively, via the Ouya store, are a fair number of applications that for many will help make this little cube worth the investment -- the variety of emulators that are available that let fans of games gone by go back and play those games while also offering those gamers the opportunity to do something that the tablet devices (or phone devices) that run the Android OS (as this console does) can't do: use a full-fledged controller device.  While I can use myArchos GamePad Android Tabletto run most of the same emulators and play games on it, it doesn't have that comfortable feel that sitting in front of my big screen HDTV does with the Ouya's comfortable controller sitting in my hand.  (The Archos Gamepad does, however, offer up the buttons and joystick type controls on it, so that does help.  It is also portable, so again, it comes in handy at times ;-) )In the end, the success or failure of the Ouya is going to come down to the library of software that will be available.  Well, that, and the customer service on the part of Ouya, the company.  An area that has unfortunately not been as adequate as it should have been, with poor communication to backers, those that had pre-ordered, and others along the way.  If the company makes the needed improvements there and gets past the obvious growing pains they've encountered thanks to their own success (all of those contributions they took in via Kickstarter, as well as the funds that they got from venture capitalists), then this device and the company behind it could be, well, special.The games library, as things sit on the release date for this console, is not necessarily the greatest, but it too shows a lot of promise.  Some games that are available (such as Shadowgun) are a bargain and look very impressive.  Others seem to show that we're dealing with a new device and new developers.  Not bad, per se, but certainly early apps.  (Those that lived through early generations of Android phones or iOS devices can likely understand here.)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2013"}

But even if you didn't like WindWaker you will probably still love this game, and here's why:Very few Zelda game introduce something drastically different from the series. Phantom Hourglass takes full advantage of the dual screens and stylus to create a gaming experience that will leave you completely satisfied.First, the dual screens. Having two screens in this game is fantastic because as you're travelling the high seas in the bottom screen you'll see the the ocean map in the top screen showing your boat and its route to your destination. No more having to pause to view the map to see where you are. This applies also to exploring areas and dungeons, the map will be in the top screen while you control \"Link\" on the bottom screen.Second, the stylus. You control Link through the stylus on the touch screen. The controls are extremely fluid - the only thing I struggled with was consistently performing a somersault. Using the stylus for shooting the bow and arrow and drawing a path for throwing the boomerang are a lot of fun. Instead of just throwing a boomerang in a cardinal direction, you can draw circles and curves for the boomerang to fly, creating new and interesting puzzles. But the best part of having a touch screen is the ability to write on the maps. Some of the puzzles involve drawing lines at certain angles on a map and noting their intersection for example. Some of the puzzles are more complex now, requiring you to keep notes and draw on the map to solve them. It really adds something new and fresh to the puzzle solving in this game.I want to note that playing the Temple of the Ocean King over and over was fun for me - unlike most everyone else. For starters, most of the time when you replay a level in the temple for the second time you can use your newest item to complete the level faster - e.g. you played the level the first time and had to navigate a bunch of tunnels and hit switches, the second time you can use your newly acquired bombs to just create a shortcut. Also, when playing a level through the first time, you are not able to acquire all treasure chests. Its only when you replay the level with additional items that you are able to reach these remaining treasure chests. Plus, having a time limit made it intense. To me, these elements made the temple fun to play and re-play.Overall, this game is just fabulous and this is a must have title for all DS owners, Zelda fans and new comers alike.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2010"}

Best motion controls in gaming.","reviewText":"Going from the 1st Bronze cup to Silver and then Gold can be a very fun and challenging experience. After the Gold cups there is the Championship cup and this to me tests the motion controls like no other game before it or since. Table Tennis and Frisbee Golf as well as Bocce are about as accurate as you are ever going to get in a game this generation minus the fact the games runs at 30FPS instead of 60FPS which would have been very welcome to have. It would have made the game smoother for sure but it might have also taken too many resources for the programmers to cook up in such little time. It doesn't matter. From top to bottom this game is everything you never got with the casual and somewhat inaccurate Wii renditions.The graphics are actually very fitting and surprisingly detailed and do not suffer from too many jaggies or soft and mushy textures. You can definitely tell some quality time was spent making this game. I would say Volleyball is the weakest game but even that is very fun with TWO motion controllers. Archery and Gladiator also can use two but all games are compatible with one. Each game steadily increases difficulty until you will be screaming at your own ineptitude or the fact you don't have enough space to calibrate the game properly or something else of less merit. I do recommend you have a full body and arm's length space to play with and they say it works best at about 5-8 feet away from the camera but it's still very playable 4 feet away or so. When you see people playing Table Tennis like in real life it's really not that far off. All in all you cannot be disappointed with this game. After tiring of the Wii's kiddy aesthetics and much too facile gameplay this is the next big step up in motion gaming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2011"}

DLC caliber maybe...","reviewText":"Halo 3: ODST is an interesting side note type of game to the Halo Universe. It takes place in New Mombasa right before Halo 3 and it has good things and bad. First off, it is not like any other Halo entries. Yes, it has Covenant, no Flood (Which I love because I HATE the flood), and the weapons everyone loves. However, the HUD is pretty different, and the location is monotonous if you don't know where to go. Second, you play as 'the Rookie' travelling the streets during the night and search the city to find out what happens from drop to leaving the pod. When you find a clue or out of place object, you play as another member of the squad, and their personal experiences that explain what that particular item is doing there. The game was really short, but had some solid elements. The one confusing part about the game is the achievements 'Good Samaritan' and 'Naughty, Naughty' (Hint: It deals with the Engineers).Pros:+ Solid story, however short+ The look of it is nicely done.Cons:- Some people hate the difference between this and other Halo games, but I don't understand why...- Once again, to reiterate; SHORT!!!This is actually a solid game.

{"product_name":"B0047THYWC","description":"","reviewerName":"James Lin","summary":"You got your Mass Effect in my Dragon Age!","reviewText":"Don't get me wrong.  I really enjoyed Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2, but I loved Dragon Age: Origins because it felt like an old-school, computer RPG with the polish and presentation of a modern of game.  My favorite parts of DA:O were the incredibly difficult and long dungeons, the extremely conservative loot drops, and the super detailed dialog trees.  Dragon Age 2 does away with all three of these things in addition to cutting a few corners that I just chalk up to laziness.The quests in DA2 are much shorter and less involved than the draining dungeon crawls in DA:O.  For the most part, you run out to a dungeon, kill or find something and return for your reward.  There are a number of quests that begin with you finding a random, personal item that belongs to someone. You complete them by returning the item to a random NPC in the city and they give you a few pieces of silver.  No dialog, backstory, nothing.  Many of these quests will happen without you even realizing it.  Again, it felt like Bioware just got lazy.  Fortunately, these types of quests aren't the majority.Most of the quests in the game, including the ones for the main story, just feel like side quests.  I wouldn't say that it's bad, but I really enjoyed the more satisfying and lengthy quests in DA:O.  This might be a good thing though, because Bioware really cut some corners in designing dungeons and constantly reused the same few layouts throughout the entire game.  Some might find this more annoying than I did, but the reused dungeons were definitely the most noticeable of the shortcuts that Bioware made in DA2.From these quick quests, you also get plenty of loot, which you'll need because the game forces you to constantly upgrade your weapons and armor.  I found this new system to be really annoying.  I don't like having to micromanage my equipment, and getting a new, slightly better dagger every 20 minutes kind of kills the excitement of finding new stuff.  In addition, many of the rings, belts, and amulets that you find also carry generic names like \"Ornate Amulate\" or \"Belt.\"  Fortunately, or unfortunately, they also got rid of armor for your companions.  Instead you find unique, specific armor upgrades that they'll automatically equip, but you have to make sure you get every single one before moving onto the next act or quest, because each of the upgrades is only available from a specific merchant, chest, or loot drop.  If you miss one and the area closes, you don't get another chance.Bioware opted to go with the Mass Effect dialog wheel for conversations in DA2.  I actually don't mind the dialog wheel, but I feel like having your options explicitly marked as good, neutral and aggressive makes the choices a little too obvious and too easy.  The text summaries next to each option don't always accurately reflect what Hawke will actually say, but as long you picked the right tone, you should be fine, right?  In DA:O, I spend a lot of time reading over the dialog options and picking what I felt were the best responses, as opposed to simply picking good/neutral/aggressive.  I felt like I actually had to work to get my DA:O companions to like me.  In DA2, I managed to accidentally trigger a romance story with a character by simply picking the nice option every time.Despite all of this though, Dragon Age 2 was actually still a really fun game to play.  The new battle system is great and makes rogue/warrior classes A LOT more fun to play without really sacrificing the strategic aspects from the first game.  One big change to the battles is that enemies attack you in waves and the waves will spawn from different points around the battlefield.  This adds a twist to the strategy of fights because you'll often find your ranged characters suddenly surrounded by newly spawned enemies.  Some people think it's a really cheap game design technique, but I thought it made for some pretty fun game play.  I found myself holding back on using up all of my special abilities or items just in case another wave showed up.The story in Dragon Age 2 is still fantastic and feels a lot more nuanced this time around.  You're not longer playing a save-the-world epic, but more of a tale about a guy who builds a name for himself a city and has to face some pretty tough choices.  By the end, big things are happening, but you aren't saving the world from a giant demon this time around.  I don't want to give anything away, so I'll just say that right and wrong aren't so clear in this game and I never really felt secure about any of the choices that I made.I know that my list of complaints seems long, but these things really aren't enough to completely ruin the otherwise excellent game.  If you've played Mass Effect 2, then you'll probably find yourself in familiar territory here with the simplified equipment system, the dialog wheel, and the short quests.  Those who have only played DA:O might feel a bit alienated, but I encourage you to keep playing because once you get used to the changes, Dragon Age 2 is still a solid RPG with a very satisfying story.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"A Gamer at Heart","summary":"From a Diablo Neophyte . . .","reviewText":"I am a long-time gamer, but I tend to prefer FPS games with the occasional action RPG (Skyrim, Witcher 3) thrown in. I had long heard of the Diablo franchise but had never waded in. The top down camera angle, and point and click action just wasn't my style. Then, when I researched Diablo 3's release last year and all of the fan hate that came with it, I just moved along as I always had.When the most recent patch for Diablo 3 was released, a flurry of positive reviews came out, and coupled with a $20 Amazon sale, I gave it a shot. If you have already played Diablo you can stop reading here. If, like me, you have not, keep on reading.Diablo 3's play style is deceptively simple. You mouse click to move, and mouse click to attack. My first thoughts were \"How is this even a game?\" As you progress, however, you gather new weapons via \"drops\" from slain enemies, and you unlock skills. Many of these skills look pretty good graphically. The enemies also increase in difficulty and number. You soon realize you need to strategize the use and timing of your skills, and try to have your chosen skills complement your chosen weapons. You can play multiple different character classes, basically as a warrior (Barbarian class in Diablo), or a mage, a combination, etc.Over time I found myself sucked into this game to see what cool new loot (weapons and armor) I could acquire, and I increased the difficulty to increase the challenge. I am really enjoying the game and I will probably pick up the expansion when I'm done, assuming I don't first replay the game on a higher difficulty or with a different character class.Lastly, this game has also drawn some flack for its constant internet requirement. Do I like that requirement? No. Does that affect the game content and the enjoy-ability of the game itself? In my opinion, no. But obviously if you lack connectivity or have a connectivity issue the \"always on\" requirement will indeed affect your ability to play the game. If you have a steady internet connection, it's not really an issue other than where your DRM ideology falls.If you are a hard-core Diablo fan, the new patch is claimed to have fixed many of the early complaints (which I never experienced). If you are new to the franchise, you may want to check it out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2014"}

I know its been out forever, but I only recently had a chance to solve it, and if, like me, you've put off playing it, its time to get with the general populace and buy this one.  Its not a \"renter\", its an \"owner\".  Its the type of game you'll wait a few weeks or months, fire up and solve again.To top this is gonna be challenging, although I know with the revenue they've made, Rocksteady will try.  I say this because this game is comprehensive.  If you are even casually into the Batman mythos, really at any point in history, you will find reference to something you remember: it covers it all.  Sure, the setting is probably the most historic and cataloged single location in Gotham, but the game also references old and new foes with love and appreciation.  I very much enjoyed the inner-encyclopedia that this game conveyed through the Riddler's challenges.Superb graphics? Check.  Solid music, foreground and ambient sound?  Absolutely.  Great gameplay?  Some of the best and easiest to adapt to that I've ever played.  You'll feel like you are channeling Bruce Lee (or Bruce Wayne, whatever) as you flawlessly kick six bad-guys butts around the room.

I played the campaign, played the multiplayer, and returned it through the Amazon buyback program for 40 dollars. The biggest complaint with this game is the length of time in the campaign mode. I just say that there is way too much complaining. 6 hours is a lot of time, but you get endless hours with the multiplayer(which now has no wait). I played and beat the campaign, but during that time thoroughly enjoyed myself. I've played every FPS available to date, and have to say that BFBC2, MW2, and this have the best campaigns. The game really gets interesting during the second half of the game. Not only are you shooting weapons, but you get to take charge of a vehicle and spot enemies while you are in cover outside the vehicle.Multiplayer: My biggest gripe was the multiplayer when the game first came out because you'd usually wait 20 minutes to get a game going. Now, as soon as you go to multiplayer, the game starts. There are always people playing, and full squads appear instantly. Homefront has my favorite maps of any multiplayer, excluding the downloadable maps from Black Ops (Hotel and Zoo from Black Ops and Seine Crossing from BF3) I especially like the map on Homefront in the suburban neighborhood. The only gripe is the DLC maps. THQ should give those to everybody for free, because nobody ever plays those, and the rooms are usually empty. Looking forward to Homefront 2!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2011"}

That aside, this version of Final Fantasy IV was awesome! It has the same story, for the most part. This game has better graphics and a new skill system to more than validate this purchase.Story: 5/5This story is full of adventure, betrayals, love, loss, sacrifices, magic and redemption. You start your adventure as a dark knight, commander of a fleet of airships call the Red Wings. You and your childhood friend, Kain, are sent on a mission to destroy a town.I found this story to be the 2nd BEST in the Final Fantasy chronicles. This is one of the stories I use to measure all RPGs by.Sound: 5/5The musical score haunts my dreams. I loved the whole game soundtrack. The added voice acting really brings this story to life. I give kudos to Square Enix.Graphics: 4.5/5ULTRA updated from the 2-D, the DS 3-D style is similar to the remake of Final Fantasy III on the DS. It took me a while to get use to the face lift that one of my favorite games underwent. Because I've played this game on the Super Nintendo then on the Playstation, then on the Game Boy Advance and now on the Nintendo DS, out of all the versions that I've played of this game this DS version has looked the best. They added voice-acted cut-scenes at all the right moments in this game. WOW!Game-play: 3.5/5Thank goodness for a typical turn based battle system. They tossed in an abilities section to the item menu that allows you to equip skills that others on your team may have had or that enhance you stats, HP or MP. You can find these items on the ground or by talking to people. (Talk to everyone! Multiple times. And at different stages in the game.) Also, with the DS Map feature, if you complete 100% of the map you are given a prize.Replay Value: 1/5Once you go though the game you will not need to play it over again, unless you want to see the cut-scenes and that GREAT story again!Overall: 4.5/5I will award this game with a 4.5/5 because I loved the story, the graphics were great, the game-play was standard and the sound was just good. My only issue with this game is that I've bought the same game 4 times on 4 different systems. I'm beginning to get a bit tired of playing the same game. Yes, when they remake Final Fantasy IV again for the next group of systems, I'll be right there in line at the store to pick it up.This game is for any RPG fan.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2008"}

The game is played in first-person perspective, and with the use of the Havok 3.0 physics engine and other advanced techniques, players can utilize anything in the area as a weapon when they've been cornered by their prey. Prepare for a slow-paced, frightening, and dark adventure.","reviewerName":"eternal now \"roejoerrer\"","summary":"This game will scare the snot out of you!","reviewText":"You are a federal agent who specializes in hunting down serial killers. You have a handy set of forensic tools with which to investigate crime scenes.You are sent to investigate the latest murder by the \"Matchmaker killer\" and end up being framed for the murder of two police officers.From here, the story unfolds in a twisted and dark fashion.The setting is a decaying city where crime has drastically increased. Drug addicts, gang members and vagrants of all types are roaming the streets committing random acts of violence and mayhem.Your mission is to clear your name by tracking down the man who framed you.You will explore dimly lit abandoned buildings, subway tunnels, dark alleyways, service tunnels, an abandoned department store, and all sorts of scary and decaying areas. Your only source of light is a dim flashlight. Your only weapons are those that you find either hidden or items that you can literally rip off of the environment. You also have a kick that comes in handy more than you would think.The levels are very detailed and very, very scary. Most of the level will consist of you searching through dark, dirty and grimy areas searching for clues or following the man who framed you, while drug addicts, gang members and vagrants roam the darkness searching for weapons to kill you with. These levels are dark! Your flashlight barely lights the way. The game engine produces amazing lighting and shadow effects which really set the mood. Textures and environments are absolutely stunning in their detail. Each level looks just like its realistic counterpart. Character models are well mapped and their movements are realistic.Condemned: Criminal Origins is a true treat for your eyes.And a treat for your ears as well. The high level of care that was put into the graphics has been put into the sound as well. Aluminum cans and glass bottles clank around when kicked or stumbled over, garbage shuffles and shifts under your feet, metal clangs when it hits the floor. An eerie soundtrack of ambient noise plays constantly through the game, which really intensifies the mood.Sound is the dominant sense here. Since most of the levels are bathed in darkness, you will have to rely on your ears to sense whether an enemy is close. You can hear them cough and shuffle around - which is extremely creepy yet helpful.Weapons consist of whatever you can find laying around. Pipes of all sizes, rebar,2X4's, shovel's, fire axes, sledgehammers, conduit pipes, crowbars and signs all pose as weapons which you can literally rip off of the environment and use on your enemies. Of course they can use them too, and often you will run into an enemy who will run away from you in search of a pipe or some kind of makeshift weapon to bash your skull in with.Combat is fun, especially since you and your enemy have a block feature that works really well. Combat actually has some soul behind it as well, it not just button mashing. You have to strafe, stick-n-move and block (the enemy AI has good aim). The Enemy AI in general is very top notch and smart. They will flank you, take cover, run off to find more weapons, adn try to ambush you. They block your moves and react to each other as well. If a group attacks you and they accidentally hit each other, they will forget about you and try to kill each other - this leads to some interesting moments where you can just sit back and watch all of the enemies kill each other, doing all of the work for you.You also have access to finishing moves (available when you have an enemy on their knees). They consist of: A headbutt, a finishing punch to their face, slamming their head into the ground, and snapping their neck.There are more traditional weapons around (guns). You actually start off with a gun, however you soon lose it. There are handguns and shotguns scattered around the levels, some hidden. The only stipulation is that they are limited to the ammo that is already loaded into them, so don't expect to run around on an ammo hunt like in most games.Since you ARE the federal agent, the point of view for this game is a First Person point of view. The game does really well of hardly ever breaking that view either, save for the cut scenes. If you get kicked down some stairs, your point of view does not change, and it seems like YOU actually got kicked down the stairs.Your only point of contacts is a lab rat who analyzes the evidence that you find and gives you some tips at certain parts of the game, and a guy named Valhorn who somewhat helps you. They contact you via your cellular phone.The game features a whole laundry list of achievements, from finding all of the dead birds and metal pieces in a level, to actually passing a level, to finding hidden XBOX 360 systems hidden throughout the game. You also get an achievement if you finish the game without firing a gun (you can use the guns as blunt objects also). No online features, however it would be hard to have some kind of multiplayer game without it getting boring fast.Overall, Condemned: Criminal Origins is a very engaging game that should have you investing about 10 hours or so into it. There are 10 missions, about one hour per mission (this is considering that you are looking for the dead birds and the metal pieces, but not considering if you get lost enjoying the graphics of each level). Visually this game is a great representation of \"next-gen\" gaming, the gameplay is great and the sound is killer.Condemned comes off as a very realistic game where you have to think before you move. You cannot defeat the game by running and gunning. Pacing  and nerves of steel are required for this game, as it will test both.I really enjoy Condemned, graphically and in gameplay.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2007"}

Resident Evil 4 falls into the truly epic category.Here's why;  It's everything from the technical aspect of the camera angle, to the weapon selection and upgrades, to the sound effects and downright creepy sounds and environments that you play in.  Too many games mess up the camera angles, to the point where sometimes you actually lose your spot on the screen (which is invariably at that critical time when a bad guy is just about to eat your lunch) not so in Resident Evil 4.  The weapon selection is very varied with many upgrades.  The sound and graphics combined are enough to stand the hairs on the back of your head on end.  Throughout the game when one of the unseen zombies screams you will literally jump out of your chair.The best part of Resident Evil 4 is the replay value, which is SKY High.  In particular \"Separate Ways\" which puts you in the position of an important supporting cast member as you replay the game through her eyes, its a great twist, which adds a lot to the game.Lastly, with over 20 hours of gameplay, Resident Evil 4 really delivers.

The gameplay has been improved immmeasurably by an over-the-shoulder perspective that moves with the character constantly, a method which is both dramatically easier to use and immensely intuitive. The voice acting, usually sub-par to average for the previous Resident Evil games, is substantially improved here.  The graphics are absolutely beautiful, utilizing complex terrain and environments which seem to live and breathe, and rich character models that almost seem like they could jump right out of the screen. The addition of a simple economy/market system for new weapons and upgrades adds a new dimension never seen in Resident Evil before. The story is a departure from the tropes of the previous games, though it still has its roots in familiar places.And yet, despite these improvements (and they are ALL improvements), there's enough of the classic Resident Evil here to satisfy the diehard fans of the series.  Plenty of nasty beasties to fight with a variety of weaponry, and if you aim well heads will still explode and bodies will still burn.  Green, red, and yellow herbs are still here to heal you, and you'll still find the occasional can of First Aid Spray as well. The main character in this one in Leon Kennedy, last seen as a rookie cop in Raccoon City in Resdient Evil 2, now working for the U.S. government, tougher and stronger and ready for a new challenge.  Other familiar characters will also appear along the way, including a couple of old favorites from the previous games.Resident Evil 4 is a long game, too, taking many hours for the initial run-through, withs lots of replayability once the first time is done. After you finish the first game, new games become available, including \"Mercenaries,\" a free-for-all shooting match, \"Assignment: Ada,\" in which you take on the short mission of one of the other characters, and new for the PS2 version of the game, \"Separate Ways,\" a five-chapter story filling in some of the gaps that the main storyline doesn't completely explain. And once you finish those, you might be ready to try the main game again in Professional mode for a bigger challenge.  Rest assured, many hours of gore-streaked play await you with Resident Evil 4.As much as I love the original Resident Evil games and the way they do what they do, I was glad to see that the makers of this game took some risks and breathed new life into the undead. By making a few changes, they actually made the experience of this game more like playing the original for the first time, and all the delightfully twisted, disgusting, scary fun that entailed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2006"}

These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving.

With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Mark Twain \"Sr\"","summary":"Awesome game From a First Time Burnout Player","reviewText":"I never played a Burnout game before this one as it never appealed to me.

The game is fun in  single, co-op and online mode!First, the graphics, because they are just so gorgeous in high definition.  The character movements are smooth and realistic. Characters tumble down stairs. Smoke billows. Leaves wave. The different types of area - beach, city, snow - all have their own look and feel.We mostly play games single player or XBox Live - but it so happens that when we first took this game home there were 2 gamers who both wanted to play. We played the side by side co-op. It was amazingly fun! There was plenty of screen for both players and with the huge maps, there was great opportunity to flank your opponents and catch them in the crossfire.The sound is fantastic. The ambient noise around you really adds to the feeling that you are there - from people talking, to wind noises, to the various noises made by the weaponry used. If you don't have your XBox 360 going through a good stereo yet, now is really the time to hook that up.I found the on screen status alerts to be both easy to read and unobtrusive. They were there for quick reference, but didn't get in the way of actual gameplay.The regular single player campaign is a ton of fun, involving, and very fun to play through. The real challenge, of course, is going Live and facing off against other real players. If you don't have Live yet, then this is a game that might entice you to take that step. It really does make this game one you could play for years and still have fun.I've had non-war-gamers come over and pick up the basics of gameplay within minutes. It's not super-challenging or technical in that sense.  It does take patience, though. This isn't a game about plowing Rambo-like into the middle of a pack of enemies and blasting away. It requires you to look over the situation, find the angle that gives you the best protection and to pick away at the enemies while staying safe. You're not a super-human here. You are a well equipped soldier who can stay alive with a combination of weaponry skill and strategic intelligence.Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2006"}

Developed using the same digital assets as the films,The Return of the Kingre-creates in stunning detail the final events of the War of the Ring.

The fate of Middle-earth is in your hands.","reviewerName":"Christian Wheeler \"Husband/Father/Gamer/Proud...","summary":"EA saved the best for last","reviewText":"The first two Lord of the Rings titles belonged to that rare group of worthy film-based games. How many movie tie-in games have been less-than-stellar garbage capitalizing on a film's popularity? With \"The Return of the King,\" EA concludes their trilogy with one of the best games of the year. A warning to those who have not read the books and do not know how the trilogy ends: As expected, the game contains many spoilers.The biggest difference between ROTK and its predecessors may be the amount of action: Fellowship was mostly plot-oriented, and Two Towers featured one great action piece--Helm's Deep. ROTK, however, thrives on action. From start to finish,  this game is non-stop action and adventure: gargantuan Siege Towers,  monstrous trolls, bloodthirsty Uruk-Hai--this game gives you all you can handle, and then some. You'll be thankful for the occasional pauses to rest your thumbs--before the next attack begins. The game features voice-work from the film's actors and some of the most amazing backgrounds and environments I've ever seen in a video game, with perfect contrast between light and dark elements  Like the films, there's meticulous attention to detail. Character design and appearance is first-rate, and character animation (thanks to motion-capture technology) is smooth and even. In addition, the sound quality (THX, no less) is outstanding--every roar, every clash of steel resounds through your speakers.ROTK features three distinct playable storylines: The Path of the King, The Path of the Hobbits, and The Path of the Wizard. One can play as Aragorn, Legolas, Gandalf, Gimli, Frodo, or Sam, and beating the game unlocks three new characters.  Follow Aragorn on the Paths of the Dead and recruit the undead to fight alongside you, from Minas Tirith to the Black Gate (and you'll get to battle the Mouth Of  Sauron in an epic conflict).  Follow Frodo and Sam from Osgiliath to Shelob's Lair to Mount Doom. Take the wizard's path, and have Gandalf fight from Orthanc to Minas Tirith. There are thirteen levels, and the three storylines converge in a final level only accessible when all thirteen are finished. Some levels are relatively easy (Shelob's Lair wasn't too tough) and some are barbaric in their difficulty (Paths of the Dead took me six tries before I beat it). Each character has their own unique style and weapons, with plenty of enemies to battle: Shelob, Orcs, Mumakils (Oliphaunts), Uruk-Hai, The King of the Dead, and more. Attacks are pretty straightforward: Quick attack, Fierce attack, parry, or fire (arrows and the like). As you gain experience points from defeating enemies, you can acquire better weapons and skills (such as invisibility and the truly awesome Balrog's Revenge) to combat the increasingly difficult foes one faces as the game progresses.  And, one can choose to retain those points for oneself, or share them with other characters.The game has three difficulty settings: Easy, normal, and hard. Easy is just that: easy. Normal is moderately challenging, but beatable for most average gamers. Select hard, and you're asking for it. The enemies seem to never end, and even the lowliest orcs take incredible amounts of punishment before falling. Hard difficulty may be best tackled with the game's Co-Op mode, which allows a friend to participate. A major problem with the game, however, is that you can't replay a level until you've beaten it. But once you complete it, every level opens up and can be played by any character--which gives the game better long-term replayability than most movie titles (and many non-movie ones, as well). PS2 gamers will have to contend with occasionally slow framerates due to the PS2's low-end processor. This usually only occurs when a horde of enemies are present, but it's still a little annoying. Another thing I didn't like was the occasional difficulty caused by the game's third-person perspective. Like most TP games, certain positions or angles create blind spots. In close combat, this can prove to be a major aggravation. But those are relatively minor things that detract little from the overall quality of this game. For anyone looking for an excellent action/adventure game, this can't be beat. Highly recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2003"}
{"product_name":"B0012N3ZXS","reviewerName":"The Tech Fanatic \"The Tech Fanatic\"","summary":"Highly Overrated","reviewText":"I can honestly say that this game is, without a doubt, the most highly overrated game out there. As an experienced Street Fighter II player I found the game to be the same in almost every way. There is truly nothing new here. The graphics are definitely better. But the graphics itself does not impress me. I thought the characters looked rather cartoony in comparison to all the games out there for this current generation of consoles. Second, the movements are actually the same. Yes, there are updated moves but they still look the same to me. The ability to generate the special moves is a little easier compared to the original Street Fighter II. Third, The cut-scenes leave a lot to be desired. I thought they were somewhat bland and cheaply made compared to the characters themselves which are already dated in my opinion. Just look at Call of Duty 4 and you will see what I mean. Fourth, I cannot believe that they charged the amount for this game which is nothing really new. It's just a rehash of all the prior Street Fighter games. Now they have Super Street Fighter at a lower price but still so high in terms of their actual worth. The bonus material, worlwide matches, just doesn't cut it to me. Why don't they have true tournaments periodically to make it worth your while? We certainly have the technology to do this. And when I mean tournaments, I mean a true tournament that is officiated by referees. Finally, yes, the game is supposed to be difficult. But some of the moves by the A.I. opponents are really cheap. I am for challenging games but this one cuts the cake. If I had known how this game was going to be I would not have purchased it. It was a waste of money.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2010"}

In this sequel to Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga, the brothers travel back in time to retrieve Princess Peach, only to come face to face with baby versions of themselves, the princess and Bowser. They'll team up with their younger selves for a quest of lunatic proportions!","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"YOUR new Partner in Time!","reviewText":"The smash success of Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga on the GBA is now followed by another smash on the DS.  The game utilizes the touch screen greatly, and gives new innovation to an already golden formula, making it platinum.You will once again take control of Mario and Luigi and save the Mushroom Kingdom and Princess Peach from danger.  The thrat this time is a race known as the Shroob.  Their home planet is no longer bursting with life, and so they decided to leave and check out your  home.  They're all lead by Princess Shroob, and they think the Mushroom Kingdom is the perfect place to conquer.The events that take place in the game will take place in the present, as well as the past.  Using not only Mario and Luigi, but baby Mario and baby Luigi.  The game is full of as much love and heart as the previous title, being funny and having some of the most engaging gameplay ever presented in an RPG.As with the GBA version, Superstar Saga, you'll control Mario and Luigi.  The A button controls Mario and the B button controls Luigi.  Just the same, the X and Y buttons control baby Mario and baby Luigi.  And using all four characters isn't all that bad at all.  The younger versions of our heros can be given piggyback rides to speed things up a little.  You may find yourself having to use the children more often than not.  They can fit into places their adult counterparts can't, and they can also be flailed to places the older brothers can't reach.  You'll most likely control both sets independently, and that's fine as well.Both sets work in different ways, however.  Mario and Luigi use toned down versions of special abilities found in Superstar Saga.  Mario and Luigi execute the jumps, while Baby Mario and Baby Luigi use hammers, which let them hit switches and bury underground.Shopping hasn't changed at all.  The only difference is that you'll have to buy baby clothes for the younger heros.  Badges, thankfully, can be equiped on anyone.Battling has undergone a big change, but I assure you it's for the better.  You now control four characters in battle as opposed to just two.  Some of your attacks can now be enhanced thanks to the babies.  For example, they can perform an attack with their hammers while standing on their respected shoulders.  Special moves in battle have also changed.  Instead of learning all new techs, it's based on the items you have in stock.  This is also enhanced by the babies.  Some of your special techniques will involve all four of your players.  Others will be slightly enhanced by using the babies, meaning they'll be more powerful.  You may have to do some battles without your little buddies.The same old \"timed hits\" which was introduced in the SNES classic, Super Mario RPG, still exists here.  In your special attacks if you mess up the button combination it could cost you to perform a watered down attack instead of a successful rock hitting assault.  The same goes for dodging techniques.  As in the first Mario and Luigi game, enemies will clue you in on who they're attacking and you'll have to have the correct timing to dodge them.  It takes time to learn, but it presents a very good challenge to the game.Mario and Luigi Partners in Time does not slouch on the DS capabilities.  You'll find yourself using both screens.  The top screen serves as a map, and as a gameplay screen when the babies seperate from the adults.  The top screen also serves to present story sequences rather well.  The use of the touch screen may sometimes feel a little tacked on (like wiping off a dirty picture to make a discovery), but at least you'll actually use it.Visually, the game stays true to the look and feel of the GBA title.  It's good to see it doesn't make Baby Mario and Baby Luigi look too cute either.  The DS also gives us a more sharper look at thing such as special attacks.  The time periods also look distinctly different.  The only problem that really presents itself with the visuals, is how some angles make jumps hard, and how some of the counterattacks are hard to pull off because of the angle.The voice acting is fantastic.  With a different variety, including the babies.  It also sounds really lively.  The sound is pretty well done too.  Some of the themes (like the battle theme) you won't find yourself humming, but the music is good where it is, and it also stays true to the situation, as well as to the original GBA game.Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time is without a doubt, one of the best DS titles out there.  While it's safe to say it doesn't outdo Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga on the GBA, you can be sure this is a damn good follow up.The Good:+Great graphics+Wonderful combat system+Engaging fameplay+Solid graphics+Great sense of humorThe Bad:-Camera angles make some jumps hardA solid DS title!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2005"}

This is one of the only games that really created a battle within me trying to decide if I wanted to play it.  On one hand I have always loved RPGs and from what I had seen the combat and exploration in this game looked to be right up my alley.  However, I had heard and read about the brutal difficulty and it hardly offering anything of a tutorial.I finally decided to buy a used copy for cheap and play it.  While the game is definitely challenging and pretty much leaves you to figure out almost everything on your own, I have enjoyed exploring, fighting, and even dying within the world of Dark Souls.  It's addicting.I didn't enjoy the game at first, however.  After you create your character from a wide variety of different classes and are shown a little bit how movement of your character works you get placed within the world of the game with not much direction.  Sure, there is a guy within your proximity that explains a bit of what you need to do but offers little in terms of direction.  This proved pretty frustrating for me since I kept going in different directions trying to find where to go only to get attacked by incredibly tough enemies and killed.  I knew the game was going to be difficult but getting killed by one hit at the get go seemed too much.  I have to admit, I looked up where to go on online guides from other players.  Ever since then I have have been glued to my tv learning from past mistakes and figuring out how everything works(with the occasional help of forums of course).This is one of the reasons I find the game so addicting.  It's challenging but it rewards you greatly for overcoming obstacles that you once thought were impossible.  Looking back a few hours of playing the game you can really see how much better you are presently.  There have been boss fights that kept killing me over and over again but I would finally find the weakness, exploit it, and kill it while reaping the numerous rewards crucial for leveling up, upgrading equipment, buying equipment, etc.  This also even applies to many of the smaller and more common enemies in the game as well.  Your patience is always repaid.This game would fall apart if the gameplay wasn't up to the task.  Thankfully, it's fantastic.  The control scheme is simple to understand but difficult to adapt to each enemy encounter.  There is definitely the factor of the level of your character and the equipment being used, but largely its your quick thinking and reflexes that determine the outcome of each encounter.  This makes it so its almost always your fault when you die.  You need to always be aware of your surroundings and never take your hands off the controller.  The only thing I really have to complain about is the fact that you can't really pause the game while playing.  You better make darn sure youre in a safe place if you plan on taking a short break.The game looks fantastic.  Each area I have seen of the game has been vastly different from the last and they have all looked great.  Whether its a forest area, castle grounds, or a dank dark sewer I have always enjoyed the incredible design and look of each of the environments I have found myself in.  This doesn't just apply to environments, however.  The character models(your character included) look fantastic.  They are detailed and animated well.  The bosses are exceptionally well done.One thing that did surprise me about the game is how great the online aspect of the game is.  In an RPG like this I figured that the MP experience would just be an afterthought.  I was pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying pretty much everything about it. You can use different markers that you acquire as items throughout the game to right messages to other players, spawn friends' characters into your game, and even invade a random player's world in an attempt to kill their character for some of their equipment.  Im sure there's more but these are the ones that really stood out to me.  There's nothing more satisfying that someone invading your game and killing them.  It's a great feeling.I could write a ton more about the game but I'll end it here.  I can't believe how much Im enjoying the game.  All I can say is that if you're an RPG fan then definitely give the game a try.  Even if you're turned off by some of the descriptions about it you need to experience the game anyway.  You'll probably be glad you did.  Remember: you can always learn how things work from other players on the internet forums and such.  I figure that everyone playing the game is in it together so I don't feel so bad in seeking help from others.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2012"}

All you really do is run, fight battles, run again, cut scene, run, battles, repeat.  To me, 10 is the last great Final Fantasy I've played.  Oh yeah, the music is pretty bland.  I really miss Nobuo Uematsu's music in this series.  You have no real control over your party...everything is automated.  This is even more hand-holding than the battle system in 12.  People were already complaining about how that game felt like auto-pilot the whole way through.  Well, this game makes that system feel like a high level chess match compared to this \"Paradigm\" system.  All you do is hit X and L1...rinse and repeat.  People have been able to beat BOSSES while not even in the room!  I've read the stories online and trust me, it's feasible that they are true.  This is a very disappointing entry in a once great series that has been falling off lately in my opinion.

The foundation of this handheld is amazing, but only time will tell if the painting is magnificent.What to expect from the PlayStation Vita:The Good:- Incredible hardware. I can't even begin to express how much care and attention this handheld received from Sony during development. Everything from the internal hardware, shape, features, and design screams brilliance.- Great operating system. It functions well, is intuitive, and looks fantastic.- Great launch line-up. Nearly all bases were covered by the launch library with Hot Shots Golf, Uncharted, Lumines, Rayman, and more garnering quality reception.The Bad:- Memory cards are overpriced. There is no way around it, the proprietary story on the Vita is insanely expensive. In Sony's defense, the PSP was pirated to extinction so some level of defense was needed. I just wish that didn't mean you had to pay $100 for 32GB of storage.- Initial sales. Developer support is everything in this industry, and bad vs good sales can mean the difference between an Atari Jaguar and a Super NES.My experience is limited since the device is still less than a month old, but my time with the Vita has been nothing but great. There's something to be said about having a handheld that can produce near PS3 quality graphics in the palm of your hand. There are quite a few of promising games in the pipeline, and the addition of Remote Play for PS3 titles could have a profound impact.

These resources include new weapons, expanded weapon combination/creation possibilities, and even two-player coop functionality. The game also features a 4-player online multiplayer mode, an optional prologue to the game available as downloadable content and a dramatic increase in the number of zombies that can be faced at once.","reviewerName":"Spunkus Maximus","summary":"Not as good as the first one","reviewText":"This game is awesome, like the first.

Only that MS made it 3D. Think about it, a guy in an astronaut suit, and killing weird aliens in other planets. The music is mysterious, Metroid like too. I'm sure the Metroid in 3D in Nintendo GC offers more variety, with monster at the end of a level, etc. Anyway, Halo I also has Quake II stuff; the walls and futuristic things are reminiscent of Quake. Nothing original about Halo I. However, it shines in the control precision and smoothness. The game is 7 years old now. Nothing better than playing a game after many years to see if it got rotten like an egg or aged like a fine wine. The graphics look primitive, but it's the controls and the shooting experienced where the game really stands out and stood the test of time. All in all, the game feels too empty and boring to be fun, but the controls are the best I've seen.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8LR","description":"WhenLuigi's Mansionwas first announced, many assumed it would  follow in the legendary footsteps ofSuper Mario WorldandSuper Mario  64. The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy. If  only it were a bit longer.--David Jenkins. --Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Troy","summary":"Better than Mario Sunshine (imho)","reviewText":"I see and hear a lot of criticism laid on Luigi's Mansion, but I thought it was more enjoyable than his brother's Sunshine game (I grew tired of washing things).  Luigi's game does a good job of creating a scary-yet-cartoonish atmosphere to immerse yourself into, and it's fun to go-round sucking ghosts into your vacuum cleaner.Of course no game is perfect, and the flaw here is that the fun only lasts ~20 hours, but I figure I'd rather have a short solid title than one that pads the game with long stretches of boredom (cough - Wind Waker).  Resident Evil 2 is only 20 hours long too, but I still consider it the best survival-horror game to date.  It's short but solid, and so too is Luigi's Mansion.Recommended buy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2009"}

After ordering it with some other DS games, for use on my 3DS XL, I decided that it would be the first of the batch that I would play, and therefore also one of the first games I had played on the system in months.Throughout this game I found myself saying 'what a great game' aloud, after finding one thing or another that was amazing. While this is the first game of it's type that I think I've played, I don't believe it'll be the last.A few of the puzzles I had difficulty with, and ended up consulting a guide for the solution, but I'm sure I would have figured them out, had I not been more interested in the story than my pride of completing it alone.The story is definitely the strongest aspect of the game, although the art style and gameplay are not too far behind. With a few twists and turns, and a fantastic (and slightly tear-invoking) conclusion, Ghost Trick will stay with me for quite some time.I can easily give Ghost Trick a full five of five stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2014"}

Great graphics and arguably the best analog controls in any first person shooter. Honestly I liked Halo 2 better than the original Halo and I am not sure why but I just enjoyed it more. This is a game you can pick up and play keep playing. The multiplayer in Halo 2 has added to the formula either offline or online. Granted I do not have Xbox Live a friend of mine does and thats how I got to experience the online part. I really like how people complain about the length of modern video games. Do you people not remember old atari and nes games ? Some of them could be easily beaten in a half hour ! Granted with modern technology people expect more and I clearly better than anyone understand that. Lets put it this way if you have a shorter game your more apt to replay it again. If you have a 50 hour game are you really going to go back to it ? I dunno maybe its just my preference but I enjoy a shorter game thats between 5 to 12 hours.Graphics - By Xbox standards this is a masterpiece and really raised the bar for what first person shooters can look like on a home console for its generation.Gameplay - Its pretty simple if you enjoyed Halo Combat Evolved you are going to enjoy this one with great controls that set the bar for what a console game can do.Replayability - Is all how much you love this game and I know most will like it and others will think its just hype. If you have XBOX Live chances are you are going to love it.Pros - Great graphics, exceptional use of analog thumbsticks, pretty interesting story for a game, multiplayer is fun with friends and is also fun online and the newest addition in this game THE SWORD !Cons - That I did not buy this game sooner","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"CJ Foster \"Herbal\"","summary":"Jak and Daxter go to space?","reviewText":"That's what it seems like anyway.

{"product_name":"B000088KH9","description":"Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis the third in the successful mission-based stealth series that first appeared on the PlayStation in 1998; few changes have been made to the basic format. Players can once again choose to be either Rikimaru, the silent sword-wielding assassin, or Ayama, the acrobatic younger ninja. Both characters pass through the same game world, but each has slightly different goals that take them on different routes. A third character can be unlocked later on.During the first mission, you're required to choose a number of weapons to aid you in your immediate tasks. Throughout the game, more and more weapons--from melee to ranged weapons--are added to your arsenal depending on your performance during each level; your chosen weapons dictate how you approach the mission goals. The silent approach is always encouraged, and there's a variety of graphically satisfying stealth kills that will only work if you remain elusive and strike unexpectedly and silently.Aside from the stealth kills, the game is a mixed bag in terms of its graphics. Light shimmers off your sword menacingly, but the environments are bland and repetitive, and the game fails to maximize on differences between light and dark areas in ways that might have added to the experience. Also, the stealth dynamic is made less challenging by the shortsightedness and slow reactions of the enemy guards and the iffy AI. Since guards give up searching for you within seconds and are unable to follow you through doors, this potentially atmospheric and tactical stealth game is actually just a hack-and-slash arcade romp. Multiplayer options are included, though, so if you feel the need for a more realistic opponent, you may want to call a friend.Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis still an enjoyable experience despite its flaws. It&#x92;s just a shame that, after doing so much to establish and define the stealth-game genre, it fails to raise the bar or introduce any novel elements.

S.","summary":"The best ninja simulator to date, but something is missing...","reviewText":"Recommendation:  Worth purchasing one game of the series.  Chances are you'll enjoy it, but it will be more than enough.Tenchu 3 is a true step into the world of Japanese mythical ninja popular culture.  This is a consistent theme throughout the gameplay, the music, and the story, which makes this a very fun, interesting, and educational experience for anyone who is into such scenes.  The problem is, Tenchu 3 brings nothing new to the gaming experience that we haven't seen again and again other than it's theme.  This, unfortunately, is bound to happen when trying to resemble something precisely.One of the most prominent drawbacks for this game has to be the repetition of levels, enemies, stories, and unlockable skills and items.  While players will be given a choice among 3 different characters with their own storylines, they will all go through the same levels, achieve the same or similar purposes, unlock the same skills and items, and fight the same enemies.  Many will agree that this is a crushing flaw as the majority of what propels players to complete a game is to progress further within it.  Unfortunately, this means that after completing one character's storyline in Tenchu 3, basically the player will have played through the whole game of all the characters.As far as the gameplay goes, it is far too simplified and instead of making the game more difficult by making the gameplay more creative, Tenchu 3 relies on archaic alternatives such as having the opponents deal more damage.  Most combo/special attacks give little tactical advantage for the player and enemies, instead forcing the player to rely on luck or patience to wait out the enemy's attack.  As for the enemy, they will have no reason to rely on luck or patience as they are much quicker than the player and calculate actions without falter, giving them a great edge over the player.  Items the player may use additionally have no real tactical purpose other than damaging or knocking the opponent off balance to leave them open to damage, making even significant battles on the child's level of play - button mashing.  And in the end, engaging in combat with enemies, regardless of how difficult is it, is simply a fast pass to getting a low score, as normal combat kills are only worth 1/4th what stealth kills are.  This makes the tedious combat even more annoying to deal with.Tenchu 3 really captures its audience with the stealth killing feature.  This makes plowing through fortresses of clueless enemies quite a treat.  Not only is it more fun, but it is also more rewarded in score - stealth kills are the only way to achieve the best score.  There are various cutscenes for the interesting ways to surprise your enemy and run them through with your sword, however unfortunately you will find that you will only see one cutscene the majority of the time as it is based on location and generally you'll be attacking from behind.  Often, the graphics might be too muddy to actually calculate a plan of stealth, which can become quite tedious, sometimes even leading the player to their death.  And in Tenchu 3, if you die... you begin all the way from the beginning to repeat the averagely 40 minute stage all over again.  But stealth killing still remains to be quite fun, especially when coupled with the grappling hook and some of the only useful skills in the game.In the end, a poor game can at least draw in players with an intriguing story.  Well... not Tenchu 3.  The story here is so pumped full of filler sub-stories that it's hard to even determine which is filler and which is not.  However, the story is also pumped full of classic Japanese lore, which is a treat to anyone who is into such scenes.  Additionally, the only story that is well documented in cutscenes is Rikimaru's, leaving the other characters' stories simply bland and directionless.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2007"}

Unlike just clicking a button to make something when you've acquired the mats you need, you actually have to produce the items via a minigame similar to Vanguard or EQ2.- Unique gathering system- Gorgeous graphics- Beautiful music and sounds- Challenging battles as you get further- Class system that lets you do everything on one character- Player housing- Treasure hunting- Levequest systemWhat could be better?- Battle system can be a little slow but you get used to it.- A lot of fates seem like lower quality versions of rifts from RIFT.- Gathering professions, while unique in the process of gathering, can be very grindy to level up- Lots of instancing, breaking the world immersion to a degree- Simple game mechanics locked to questing, such as using the marketplace (you must pass a large chunk of quests and 3 dungeons before even being granted access to sell on the market)- Some class / job quests feel blandOverall the game is one of the most unique and enjoyable I've found released over the last few years, despite the faults.  It isn't perfect, but it sure as hell isn't a wow or themepark clone either.  I strongly suggest giving it a try, especially if you are a lore or story buff.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00004U1R2","description":"Conker's Bad Fur Dayis for adults, the ESRB has rated thisgame Mature; it should not be bought for--or played by or around--children. That stated, the story of the game is the following: Conker's verygoodnight turns into a very bad day. He has to deal with a crazy and abusive world, all while suffering through a massive hangover. Conker encounters abusive paint pots; jabbering dung beetles; trigger-happy, scar-faced Tediz; and a belligerent giant, with only a frying pan as a means of self-defense. He is resourceful, however, and makes the best of his situation. The game combines elements of 3-D exploration, combat, and puzzle solving. It features cinematic cutscenes, movie parodies, facial expressions, dozens of unhinged characters, and 1- to 4-player deathmatch games in a variety of styles.","reviewerName":"mdizzog","summary":"Still one of my favorite","reviewText":"This game is basically perfect. In nearly every aspect I love this game.Conker has a hangover. He now forgot how to get home. Basically Conker now runs into crazy characters and pretty funny situations. The funniest is probably the barn(the game is really funny). Anyways, the game does a great job of putting Conker in situations that are fun and enjoyable.Yes it is a platform game. It isn't that frustrating though. The multiplayer is really fun. You can also play alone in a deathmatch, which is really fun also. The game never gets old though.The horror level of the game is fun. I was scared by it when I first tried the game(i use to be weak) but now it is easier. Mostly I was a little scared because I couldn't aim at zombie's heads for anything. Still, the game does a great job of combining fun, some suspence, humor, and good ol' action.Another great thing they did was add in the war. Once you get to the war the action increases and the game really does a great job with it. The end of the war part has a really good message when our hero saves the day and narrowly conquers all. Conker and another stare back at what just took place, and talk about how cruel it is. This is a really great scene that shows that the game is also slightly emotional and isn't all comedy. I beat the game in 5 days(of constant playing) but eventually bought it because it was so much fun.Swear words? Yea theres swear words. Could a younger gamer deal with it? Yea, but they may not be able to do well on this platform/action game. Is there nudity? Slightly. A flower naked which is basically alright for gamers 10 and up, and some little dudes bootys, which is fine. Theres one other part but they block it out and you can't see anything which is fine. Is there violence? Yea, alot. Heads can get shot off, and lots of blood. Unless your an uptight parent, you probably wouldn't care because its all cartoons. This stuff ends with the game and unless your some kind of lousy parent, your kid should know not to be an idiot with guns.The games fun and I would reccomend it even though N64 is done. Mabye if it was brought to GameCube(Please Nintendo, read the review and consider converting the game over to GameCube). If it was though, they shouldn't alter this game because it is the greatest achievement the N64 ever accomplished.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2003"}

Smail \"Smailien\"","summary":"Only halfway through but in love.","reviewText":"It did not take long for me to realize how amazing this game is.  The city is enormous, it would be big even on a console.  The missions are surprisingly un-repetitive, veterans of the series will know what I mean.  The city layout is very unbalanced, which I mean in a good way, being that the everywhere is pretty unique.  I never feel like I am going around in the same places, there are areas that I can recognize and anyone can become familiar with the city.  It would probably take awhile though as it is fairly complex.The controls are excellent, movement is very easy after awhile and driving is amazing.  The only problem is that aiming weapons can be a tad tough, the targeting system is a bit problematic as it homes in on one target, then you can cycle one at a time to the left or right.  It isn't particularly easy to get that one guy bothering you behind your back.  Manual aiming can be preferable, but I wish there were sensitivity adjustments because trying to make quick adjustments, well, isn't doable.There is still a huge variety of vehicles and weaponry, plenty of costumes, and quite a good bit of \"GTA Politics.\" (Rival gangs will shoot at you and friendly ones will occasionally help you out)I have been playing for about 5 days now, with a lot of time put in and I have only just hit the 50% mark for the story completion.

It is crucial to help Amaterasu make the world a place where all living creatures can dwell once again.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"A masterpiece on the PS2 and maybe even games in general","reviewText":"In an interview, David Jaffe, the man behind the overrated/slightly enjoyable God of War said that game execs were thinking in terms of franchise and sequels rather than creating something good and original. We have Okami from Clover Studios which not only has a quite striking and beautiful graphic style but a unique gameplay idea which made many magazine and website people make it a buzz game and a must play. It's certainly a great game and one that, unfortunately, probably won't get as much attention as it should.Story: In Kamini Village, it became a tradition to offer a maiden to the dreaded demon Orochi. But when one maiden is picked which a swordsman named Nagi harbors a love for, he steps in to take him down only he's not as powerful. A white wolf named Shiranui steps in and helps and vanquishes Orochi before Shiranui succumbs to his injuries. 100 years later, Orochi is reborn and the white wolf is brought back with the spirit of the powerful god Amaratesu and with the help of a companion Issun, the mystical Celestial Brush and Nagi's descendant have to once again bring down Orochi.Graphics: I always grow suspicious of game creators' claims that a game is a painting come to life and whatnot but with Okami that's literally the case. It makes you feel that you're literally inside a painting and such scenes, such as restorations of cursed areas are quite beautiful and awesome. And I never got tired of seeing them either with probably my favorite effect being the water splashes and waterfalls. This is an example of a game creating an atmosphere and not needed expensive flashy FMV's to do it.Sound/Music: Similar to Animal Crossing, the characters don't necessarily speak in English but in gibberish with English text provided. While it is disappointing that there's no voice, it probably would've took too much space anyway but seeing a dramatic scene and see character ramble like they're intoxicated is kind of odd. The music though is quite appropriate and even lovely in places.Gameplay: One of the 2 aspects to get attention, one of which being the graphics, was the Celestial Brush. Basically you can unleash your inner Picasso where pressing R1 turns the screen into a canvas where you can draw certain shapes. Enemies can be cut by drawing a straight line, trees and flowers can be fully restored and bloom by drawing a circle around it and there's others but I don't want to spoil them. While there's not a lot of variety in the patterns, it's still quite a cool gameplay idea that never gets stale or useless.The game isn't really chockful of sidequests where you have to hunt down certain people or do certain things to get anywhere but instead it offers a whole range of stuff to do that is optional yet recommended. Certain actions, such as feeding animals or restoring trees and cursed grass nets you Praise, which you can use to upgrade your guy, by getting him more ink or more health. You'll become a bounty hunter going after certain enemies on your wanted list and filling your fish catalog when you go fishing. There's so much to do that it seems daunting but that's ok, it works just fine.Should you play Okami? Definately. Like fans of Ico who didn't get it upon initial release. Okami will probably get fans that way as well, unless people find its merits right from the get-go.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2006"}

Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both?

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

The gameplay is great, the battles are awesome (especially the bosses), the graphics are top notch (though wasted thanks to a fixed camera) and the weapons are cool. But it feels like there's something missing.The story is pretty good but sometimes it feels as if the game forgets that there is a story. Like both are two people walking together who sometimes forget to hold hands. Things will go along smoothly for a while, but then you find yourself trapped somewhere, solving puzzle upon puzzle, fighting hordes of things and then solving even more bloody puzzles. Then the game will be like \"Wait, didn't I have a story to tell?\" and quickly go and find it again.By the way, I'm not a big fan of puzzles. I find having to go through some huge, elaborate bull crap just to open a damn door a bit annoying. This game has WAY too many puzzles that are ridiculously illogical. I mean who the hell designs their living rooms like this? I have to turn a couple cranks, push a few crates, pull a couple chains, fight a demon horde plus a chimera or two, scale a damn wall, ride a few harpies fight the cyclops and turn another crank... just to get to the DAMN FRIDGE!!!I also am getting very, very, VERY tired of button mashing just to do menial tasks like opening a crate, or another damn door. Who the hell makes doors with cranks in this day and age? I'm looking at you Resident Evil!My biggest gripe isn't the story or the structure of the game however. Fighting the hordes of demons is fun, the puzzles are clever at times and the story is quite good, but fans will probably find more than a few plot holes and missing characters to complain about (Where's Atlas? And what the hell was Zeus doing this whole time? And don't even get me started on the whole time paradox thing). My personal gripe has to do with the incentive to replay.I continually replayed GOW2 to unlock the many different skins and cheats available. Seven awesome looking skins (Athena being my favorite) each with their own specialities plus the six hidden Urns, each acting as a cheat to give unlimited magic, the ability to turn enemies to stone with each hit, unlimited rage, etc.GOW3 on the other hand was woefully barren. Sure you have the 10 godly possessions (which are great btw) that you find in-game, but unless you pre-ordered or bought the ultimate edition, you only get one extra skin. ONE! There is virtually no reason why you should play the challenges or the main game on an elevated difficulty. Why should you if there is nothing to unlock?!? Ever since this DLC thing came into effect, game developers have gotten lazy and greedy (I still haven't forgiven Street Fighter 4).I know this sounds like a small gripe and it is. The game was fantastic, but not full price. I love unlocking things. I love cheats and I love skins and every time a game comes out with neither, I loose interest, regardless of how good the game is. It's the only reason why I haven't bought Batman: Arkham Asylum yet. Yeah it's a great game but other than that one bat armor, what incentive is there to replay? Trophies? To hell with trophies! I still don't know what good they are!Look all I'm saying is, if Bayonetta can afford to give me 20 different costumes plus a couple cheats, and Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 can give me 12 or so costumes with 3 extra characters to play as plus a couple other stuff, then what the hell GOW3? Are you too good for us now? Is that it? We no longer deserve free costumes, we gotta pay? I could've been playing GOW3 as Aphrodite! Do you have any idea how awesome that would have been!?!Buy if you absolutely love the franchise. If not wait for the price to drop. In my book the only games that deserve to be purchased full price are games that do everything right and gives you  everything plus the kitchen sink.Metal Gear Solid 4.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2010"}

You are the leader of a growing gang, fighting rival gangs, buying real estate, stealing cars, boats, helicopters and more. We have beaten the game - but it took a solid week of playing to do so.If you have not played this style of game before, the first thing to know is it is solidly mature rated. There is a steady stream of swearing and violence. You are shooting cops, bashing in heads, stealing whores from rival gangs, driving around vehicles while \"escorts\" go to work in the back seat, and much more. This isn't just an R rating. It is solidly for mature audiences only.That being said, the game is amazingly fun for that audience, if you enjoy movies like The Godfather and TV shows like The Sopranos. Even better - the experience is fully interactive and customizable. You start with your character - which can be male OR female! You can be a variety of ethnic types, customize yourself down to your eyebrow shape and cheekbones. There are a variety of hair styles, tattoo options, and a plethora of clothing styles. Your character can be EXACTLY who you want him or her to be.Now you're launched into the world. You break out of jail and have to rebuild your gang from the ground up. There are a number of rival gangs to take on. On one hand the game is linear in the sense that there are scripted sets of events to go through.

If your target is to blow up a limo, you can use a rocket launcher, or chase it on a motorcycle while carrying a machine gun, or any other combination of techniques. It is completely up to you how stealthy or Rambo you choose to go.They did an AWESOME job with the involvement of these storylines. The character movement and \"acting\" (motion and voice) are really great. You start to get emotions for these characters - either for or against. Some of the scenes are pure poetry in motion. It really is like being in a well done movie.In addition to these main storylines there are also a wide variety of side missions. Steal whores from enemy gangs. Repo random cars from delinquent owners. Take on hitman assignments. Do timed boat races. Some of these tasks are rather challenging.I love the plethora of \"in jokes\" all over this game. There are numerous references to other games, to movies, to TV shows. Many of them are laugh out loud funny.  It's well worth it to read a walkthrough after each mission to see what things you might have missed about it.Down sides? I was let down by the ending, but of course I won't say why. The rag doll physics were a BIT extreme. I suppose it's better than having stiff-as-board characters but they went a little too much on the wet-noodle effect. The game froze on us several times during playing, and we're rather sure it's not our XBox as we use this thing non stop all the time for our reviewing and haven't had issues with it before.There's the usual continuity problems. You'll be looking at a vehicle, turn your head, turn back and it's vanished. A plane will be landing, you'll drive to get ahead of it and BLINK it'll be gone.Up sides? I love the get-injured mini-missions where you try to get yourself tossed in the air by car crashes. The fact that you can customize your bodyguards to all wear SWAT uniforms or ninja outfits is a lot of fun. They did a great job with the extras in here.  I love that you can go walking down the street and randomly run across singing barbershop quartets (who sing lovely harmony!) or tai-chi enthusiasts. Plus the music track is awesome!All in all the game is incredibly engaging, should last most gamers weeks if not months of fun gameplay and has a wealth of tiny details in every corner. The fact that they can have an enormous map like this, with waving leaves on trees, buildings you can go running around inside, no loading screens during normal map travel, fading shadows, rain, sun, steam drifting up from manhole covers, an overhead train, people hailing taxis - it really does feel like an active, living, moving city. It is awe inspiring to me, having seen computer games \"grow up\" from the Pong level, that we could even look at a game of this complexity and consider it to have flaws because the people are a little wiggly boned. It is in many ways a gritty, urban, hard core work of art.Our full walkthrough goes into the details of actual missions and playability but feel free to ask questions here and I'll try to check in to answer them.Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2008"}

Resistance (Greatest hits, Resistance 2 (Greatest Hits), and Resistance 3. they're all separate and the voucher is external! this is whats called a collection not 2-4 games jammed into a single disc!Now lets get to the games. i will review them all as one game because they're parts of the big picture. even tho they're 3 different games. their campaign completes each other. The game is awesome. very challenging and has many fun to use weapons. also many enemies! you play as the same character in the first two games. and then in different characters in the last game. The third was great! it had really good effects and a couple of weapons and some enemies. other than some graphics. all of them are one game. after finishing them all. i wish there was a 4th game. it is the best shooter when it comes to campaign! BUY IT NOW IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT!Now lets get to the DLC. anyways. this is not the best game for Multiplayer. at least. Resistance Fall of man and Resistance 2 do not have good multiplayer.ALL the DLC for the first two games are Free anyways on PSN store. and most of Resistance 3 DLC is free except Brutality and Survival pack which are $4 bucks each(included in the vouchers). i did not buy this game for Multiplayer. i heard it had a nice campaign. but i was amazed. its too good. and i am a campaign player.How long does it take to beat the games?Well. i received this collection four days ago. Resistance fall of man takes about 8-12 hours. i played them all on easy because i wanted to blast through them and school is coming so i don't want to waste time.Resistance 2 takes about 6-10 hours depending on the difficulty.Resistance 3 takes about 6-10 hours too. depending on the difficulty.you might think this is no big difference than Call of Duty. but this is all hand-on gaming time. about %50 of the time on COD is basically sneaking around enemies,cut scenes, planting bombs and following enemies and not shooting. COD has about 3 hours of real gaming. but this game is all gaming. enemy waves keep coming at you. it never stops!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2013"}

To provide larger storage capacity and faster access rates--PlayStation2 cards transfer data 200 times faster than cards for the original PlayStation--PlayStation2 developers have upgraded the technology for the new memory card. The 8 MB Memory Card uses Flash Memory, the storage technology that's revolutionizing handheld computers, digital cameras, and MP3 players. In contrast, the 128 KB memory cards that were designed for the original PlayStation use memory blocks. While large files can spill over several blocks, you can't store more than one file per block in that design, no matter how small the file.

{"product_name":"B00005B8G1","description":"The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

For a thousand years, three opposing forces have waged war for what they believe is true. There can be no room for compromise: their way is the only way. Dubbed The Infinite War, this devastating conflict has taken its toll on a once-peaceful galaxy and has only served to deepen the hatred between the factions.    After centuries of struggle, the battle for supremacy has at last reached a turning point. Under your strategic command and leadership, will your faction will reign supreme? Will you be victorious and elevate your race to domination? Or will you lead them into the hell of defeat and ultimate extinction?","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"space_hamster\"","summary":"Uncomprising and unconventional game for hardcore RTS players only","reviewText":"Supreme Commander doesn't have the charm of Company of Heroes or Dawn of War. The only concession to aesthetics is Jeremy Soule's soundtrack, which still isn't as good as his opening theme for Total Annihilation.The unit composition takes awhile to get used to. Inexperienced players may find balancing their power/mass consumption extremely difficult at first. It's important to note that the game focuses on strategy, rather than tactics. The emphasis is on large troop movements rather than close quarters combat. A large amount of time is spent on the zoomed-out view supervising your forces. Players used to admiring eye-candy and micromanaging their units may not like this.I found the user-interface and commands to be excellent. It's extremely easy to carry out complex commands that are impossible in any other game. Examples include automatically transporting units directly from the factory to another landmass via air transport. Setting complex patrol paths. Or setting up coordinated attacks.The Single Player campaign is, to put it mildly, lacklustre. The missions are predictable, and consist of either attack or defend scenarios. And having piecemeal access to the Tech Level 3 units until late in single-player only makes it more boring. Skirmish is much more fun, as there's more room to experiment with different tactics.In summary, Supreme Commander is one of the most unforgivable and uncompromising RTS's that's ever been released. It fulfils the goals of its developers, but runs the real risk of alienating a great many RTS players. Supreme Commander is a game you can admire and respect for its abmition and scale, but it's not a game you can fall in love with. Based on my own experiences, I'd only recommend this game for hardcore RTS gamers who are looking for a strategic challenge.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2007"}

I've been a fan ever since the day he wouldn't put on those glasses. He is one of the greatest voice actors, so to see him add his talent to the Saints... that being said.This game reminds me of \"Dead Rising 2: Off the Record\". It added new, crazier game play, fixed a few bugs, but was pretty much the same game as Dead Rising 2. However, DR2:OTR didn't try and call itself a sequel. It was something like a third of the cost of a full game, and yet it brought more additional story than this SR4 does from SR3. Where missions in SR3 were very story driven and unique, it seems most of the missions in SR4 simply point you to what were side missions in SR3.This game is fun, don't get me wrong, however, without enough storied missions, or much improvements to the engine (such as look or feel), it just doesn't feel like a full, standalone game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2013"}

On one hand, you've made a game thats incredibly addicting, fun, imaginative, and an all-around blast to play.  But on the other hand, I'm hoping that you fire the sadists who designed most of this game.I'm glad you made a sequal to Jak and Daxter, a fun and lighthearted game that was arguably one of the best family games in a long time.  It's great to go through more adventures featuring Jak and the adorable Daxter.  Moving from a jungle world to a city world was an interesting move, and it works for me.  Haven city is an interesting place, and enjoyable to go through, but I did notice that there's really nothing to do.  No shops to go to, no gyms, no resturaunts.  All one can do is just walk around and enjoy the sights.  Though I do admit, the palace is awesome!But oh, what sights they are.  Jak II gets a perfect score in terms of graphics.  Everything is very detailed and glorious to behold, especailly when you're high above the ground, and have a bird's eye view of the city.But...Naughty Dog, I have to ask you something.  Why did you make this game so f***ing hard?  Really, why did you?  The difficulty in this game is simply unacceptable.  The game's missions are frustrating excercises in trial and error, where the game forces you to memorize a certian pattern with no room for error.  Make one, ONE mistake, and you fail and start over.  Video game developers, please take note of this.  TRIAL AND ERROR, MIXED IN WITH THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL FROM HELL, IS NOT FUN!I can't even begin to describe how many times I smashed my controler on the ground, screamed curses at the television screen, and generally prayed that Naughty Dog would go out of buisness.  At times I felt like I was Dark Jak, running into the Naughty Dog offices while yelling \"Hulk smash!\"  and tearing everything and everyone to bloody shreds for making such an insanely difficult game.I don't ever want to do those F***ING RACES EVER AGAIN.  EVER.  Those stupid, insanely difficult races that you have to win to advance in the game are almost impossible to beat due to racers who almost never make a mistake, and have reflexes six times as fast as a normal human.  There's one race where you have to race the city champion through the city and beat him.  Naughty Dog, I have never experienced so much anger and hatred at a game before in my life.  If it takes me sixty attempts and three hours before I can complete a mission, especially this race, I think you made a big mistake in terms of difficulty.  I think you should stick with platforming and abandon racing forever.  I'd rather lick the inside of an exhaust pipe then do another race in this game, or any other racing game that you develop Naughty Dog.Oh, and Naughty Dog, people got sick of racing through pink cirlces about a decade ago.  In your future games, please do not have any races where you have to go through pink circles.  Insanely bad.And the strange thing is that while the game is unforgivably difficult, I found myself wanting to come back and keep going for more.  I don't know why either.  Maybe it was just the fact that I wanted to see what was around the next corner, or how the story was going to go.  Talk about heroin!  It destroys you, yet you always want more.So while the game is unforgivably difficult and at times infuriating to play, the visuals and sound are top notch, and I found the story to be quite fascinating, with several twists that I never saw coming.After finishing the game, I have mixed feelings.  I think i'll like going through the city for quite some time, just to look at the sights.  And while there are a lot of secrets to unlock (by collecting precursur orbs), I don't think i'll try to unlock most of them, simply because the tasks you must do to unlock them are more of those insanely difficult missions.  Why do you love to torture me Naughty Dog, by forcing me to get exact times on those F***ing races to earn orbs?  To be blunt, your races suck.  Loosing them over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again for hours is not fun.  Ever.  It's a waste of time.  I hope you fire the sadists who designed the races, and all these sadistic challanges that you have to do to get orbs.So do I commend or condem you Naughty Dog?  In the end, the answer is neither.  I'll play Jak 3 because I do really like this series, and I want to see where it goes.  But I hope you learned a lot from this game and the feedback.  So the game gets an A+ in the visual and audio department, and a D- in the gameplay department.To people who are considering this game(or those who have severe anger management issues), I strongely suggest you rent it before you buy it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2005"}

And, unlike one review states, there is zero need for micro transactions. The game pays you bonuses for actually playing it, you get cars for passing completing various challenges and some of the seasonal events come with enormous rewards if you do well so I never felt cash-strapped.

Sherman \"The Critic\"","summary":"All the Taste, Half the Fat","reviewText":"While its main competition, the Playstation Portable, tries to become a portable home entertainment system, the Nintendo DS stays ahead in the handheld race by providing innovative new modes of gameplay.  This review will weigh the pros and cons of the more compact DS Lite.First, the pros.  Smaller, slimmer, and lighter than its predecessor, the DS Lite maintains its clam shell design which protects its dual screens, minimizing the need for protective gear.  Though the hinge where the system opens is made of a softer material, so far it disproves the infamous \"Stress Crack\" defect.  And closing the DS Lite (when it's on) places the system in a power-saving \"Stand By\" mode.The system's two LCD screens provide impressive 2D/3D graphics and let you view actual gameplay and your progress at the same time.  Plus the brightness of both screens can be adjusted to four levels.  Not only that, but the DS Lite's Touch Screen allows you to modify and even play games with the stylus stored in the system.  The built-in microphone used to play through speech and sound is also included.  And so that Nintendo can keep milking the success of the Game Boy Advance, the DS Lite is backwards compatible with all GBA games.  When not in use, the GBA slot is shielded from external hazards by a removable cover.  To top it off, the DS Lite is also region-free, meaning that your handheld can play games sold in other countries.  If all that isn't enough, the system's wireless capabilities not only enable multiple gamers to play a game with just one game card but also download content from special hotspots (in my case, the GameStop game shop).And now for the cons.  While you can also play online through Nintendo's free Wi-Fi Connection and chat with other players via the embedded PictoChat software, you may have to hunt a little--or a lot--to find players within your range (who will want to play and chat with you).  And because they require game link cables for two-player action, any GBA game used on the DS can only be played in one-player mode.  The microphone can be unresponsive at times (and talking to your video games in public doesn't help either).  All social difficulties aside, the brightness of the DS' screens consumes more battery power, and fast-paced games can create situations where looking at both screens at once can prove fatal.All the pros presented here are proof that Nintendo has done it again with the DS Lite, the latest in the company's long line of highly acclaimed portable gaming systems.  The validity of the cons, however, all depends on you.This review will be revised with further testing of the product.Because playing video games can put considerable strain on both the hands and eyes, this product is recommended for players over the age of 7.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2008"}

And now those moments are just a distant memory now that the games went 3rd person. Re4 i played when i was 14. I enjoyed it then, but now i look at the game and think wow why did i ever like this game with it's cliche castle setting and worse villains in the series. Then 5 came along and yes its one of the best co-op games to date but thats all i can say good about it. Now 6 still not being as good as the old ones is easily the best since going 3rd person. They brought back the cramped almost claustrophobic feel of the environments and the darkness. And the environments looks many people complain about them, but i personally think they are the best looking since the originals. The only problem i had was with the chris campaign was just a giant action packed run around with an ai squad and kill everything. Leons was dark and had the return of zombies and the first level i felt like i was in raccoon city again! A feeling that i loved! And jakes campaign was fun since he has fun melee and interesting character development. Something rarely found in the RE universe! So i would say since its a low 20 bucks this game is well worth it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2013"}

You roam around a huge map and do missions or take on challenges or try to collect things, or you can blow up monuments for rewards. Pretty much all the buildings are destructable. You get to carry two weapons, plus grenades. The controls are very good, I never have a problem with them, especially since I've played Star Wars Battlefront a lot and this is from the same people. I was disappointed in the lack of a side-roll, but I haven't actually needed it during any of the many firefights this game has.Hijack flying helicopters, run up the turret of a tank and throw grenades inside, level cities, and pretty much destroy everything you see.

Much more so than MVC2.  Requires light-speed reflexes and focus to compete at the higher levels.  Forget playing online unless you have some serious hours/years invested since the people rated as beginner will rip you apart in a matter of seconds using seemingly endless unblockable combos and specials.  HUGE time commitment required to get proficient at this game partly due to the massive number of characters.  Even if you only use a few you will need to learn all of their attacks and styles to defend against them.  If all this sounds good to you it really is a great game.

{"product_name":"B00020BV1A","reviewerName":"Kyle Slayzar","summary":"Welcome to the Darker Side of the Star War Universe!","reviewText":"I was wondering when the more militarish side of Star Wars would emerge, Republic Commando brought exactly that.  With a mixture of elements from Halo (Shields), Rainbow Six (Squad Tactics and aiming), and Unreal Tourny, you get a mixture of some degree of realism and tough gritty warfare.The graphics are pretty good, but not steller.  A few things I liked was getting blood, grease and rain on your windshield and your helmet automatically wipes it off; whoever thought of that was pretty creative.  I also loved the helmet tactical HUD feature, which displayed numerous gauages and dials but didn't take up an unnessesary part of the screen like in soo many movies, it really went well with the helmet.The voice acting and dialogue was hilarious.  Between the nonchelant Fixer, the creepy sniper Sev and the I-blow-stuff-up-but-Sev-creeps-me-out Scorch, you've got quite a trio of comic-relief characters that say the whackiest things such as, \"Never say no to bacta,\" or, \"Sir, with all due respect but what the hell are you doing.\"  You almost get a sense of brotherhood from your fellow commandos.The gameplay is fairly well done; the squad commands are comprehensible and easy to use during a firefight.  When using hand gestures, you temporarily lose control of your weapon, which adds to the realism, which many games ignore.  There are only four commands (Hold position, take offensive formations, rally and form up) with the exception of pointing to a position and telling that commando to do an action.  It's easy to set up door breaches and they execute many manuevers like real US Special Forces do such as the door breach and movement to contact.However, the AI can foul up every now and then and a commando may get caught on a corner and not move.  To counter this, punch the guy till he goes onconscious, then revive him and his action will reset.I think it's kinda cheesy that you can \"revive\" your teamates infinitely and they can revive you, but it's Star Wars and they can get away with it.  When you're down you can tell your commandos to back off, attack of come revive you, which is a cool feature since most games (such as Rainbow Six) call game over when the main hero is down.The music is incredibly well done.  It is quite a mixture of choir and opera singing that gets your blood boiling and, of course, they mix some of it with the old Star Wars music.The enemies can be relentless and either extremely easy or extremely hard dependind on the dificulty level.  The Super Droids are nasty in groups so beware, however, the Droidekkas arn't that nasty so it can be weird sometimes.Aside from that, the only beef I have is that the ending comes aburptly and downright sucks.  The game seems too short for what it's worth, I hope they make a sequel.All in all, an 87%.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2005"}

Those Men-In-Black type people will get on your last friggin' nerve, but it's cool to always have an enemy presence you know you want to avoid.  Since it does not have a \"save anywhere\" or checkpoint throughout the missions, I gave it 4.9 stars.The only thing I would've liked to see is red blood coming from humans instead of green.

Also on the day of release it was almost impossible to get in a game but now its ok. Also the installs take a long time first the install(which for a reason took very long to pull up the percentage bar on my ps3) and then the patch that takes a long time to download(400 mb or around).Well after that lets review the game, the game is tactical team combat so going out guns blazing isn't very wise. The headset comes with the game so talking with your comrades is the key to victory. Its very fun to dominate using teamwork, and seeing the enemy disappear one by one. I also LOVE the maps its one of the best things about the game it gots perfect sniping points and has very good physics and destructible environments although a snow map would have been nice. The graphics ain't that good but they are neat and do their job. The sound of this game is perfect and guns sound very realistic(since they recorded the sound of the real guns) every bang and explosion is superb and the game is realistic as well. There are a handful of modes and rescuing the hostages is one of my personal favorites, and again if going out guns blazing is your style don't buy this game. Well those were my experiences with the game and if yours differ feel free to leave a comment, I really love to play this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2008"}

It's a much bigger, open ended affair than Arkham Asylum. Asylum has the better, tighter story of the two but Arkham City's story is good enough that you'll want to play through to its very surprising ending. Arkham City gives you a few characters to play as and plenty of missions and collectibles to busy yourself with. This edition gives you the ability to play not just as Batman but also Catwoman, Harley Quinn and Robin. Every character has tons of stuff to do in various modes. Just collecting the Riddler trophies and completing his challenges is enough to keep you busy for weeks. It's the kind of game where you can just coast on it for a while and not worry about playing anything else due to the sheer amount of activities you can involve yourself with. The graphics and voice work are top notch and the surround sound is also pretty awesome (there's a nice little touch where when Mr. Freeze puts on his helmet and speaks, his voice suddenly seems to come from every speaker in this dead, robotic voice... love it).It seems like just about every facet of Batman: Arkham Asylum has been improved upon with Arkham City. The combat especially is even smother this time around and it's a blast to master Batman's repertoire of moves to take on a bunch of goons all at the same time. I always find it funny that these same goons would even bother trying to take this guy on but hey, there would be no game if they all persistently ran away from him. It's challenging but not too challenging that it ever gets exceedingly frustrating. All in all, it's a very enjoyable ride with very few flaws to mention.This Game of the Year edition of Arkham City is a totally worthy purchase and comes loaded to the gills. If you liked Arkham Asylum, this one is a no-brainer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2013"}

Samus simply looks awesome in this game.  The map is HUGE and you will spend hours finding hidden stuff and more enemies to blast.  There is also a wall jump technique here that's introduced.  I was also enthralled by the EXTREMELY LARGE bosses in this game.  These are probably the biggest bosses in any game.

As the samurai Samanosuke,  players volunteer to rescue the kidnapped princess Yuki. No surprise  that the ultimate goal (and the entire story line, for that matter)  falls by the wayside as hordes of demons converge on the player hour  after hour. The weapons system benefits from the flashy graphics--as  players discover and add gems to a gauntlet, weapon upgrades increase  firepower with increasingly dramatic effects.Graphically, the game is stunning. Carving through the levels--forests,  tunnels, and the requisite dark, dank castle environment--isn't  anything less than a spectacular experience, thanks much in part to the  game's unusually high production values. Character models are built  from up to 10,000 polygons each--high detail, even for a PS2 game.  Subtle environmental effects--the wind flowing through the trees, for  instance, ripples the fabric in characters' clothes--furthers the  game's realism. The game's backgrounds are painstakingly detailed and  nicely enhanced by dynamic lighting effects.The talent behind the aural effects is just as impressive.

What's disappointing though is that when you break it all down and strip away the cinematic moments of the game-there's really just not much game here.  Don't get me wrong-what's actually present in the game is very good.  The controls are perfect, the combat has been fleshed out and both the new and the familiar characters from the Batman Universe are exciting and handled well.  But at the end of the day, Arkham City still feels like a gyp.  It's just a little too insignificant.  It feels like something is missing.  Sure, in addition to some side missions (most of which are just sort of \"meh\") there are lots of boring things to collect if you're into that.  For me personally though-I'd rather move onto something else then spend mind numbing hours collecting riddler trophies.  All in all-AC is worth a rental but that's about it.  The main quest is just too insignificant to warrant a purchase.  Plus, the open world element really doesn't add much to the game except to artificially lengthen it.

The days of the rare Guitar Hero are long gone, and everyone and their mom plays Rock Band, but DJ Hero was a spark and a light to revive this, and while it didn't it does offer a different and new approach to rhythm games. Like the title says you use your turntable like a DJ and scratch, crossfade, and freestyle your way to the top. There's a lot of songs, and the game requires some hefty skills to master.Like Guitar Hero you must use both hands in unison to hit colored notes at the right time to score points. The notes are presented on a record on-screen that is in a semi-half circle and when you see jagged notes you press the button down while turning the record. Some times you'll have arrows that are up or down to just scratch quickly in that direction. The left or right notes will always have a line going down and when they move to the left or right (looks kind of like a bracket or a quick 90 degree bend) you move your crossfader in that direction. This can be tricky especially in the higher difficulties since some times you'll have to scratch, and crossfade at the same time, but over time you'll nail it. You can do some mixing with the effects knob, but this seemed pretty useless. When the red line gets larger you can press the red button freely and select one of your effect noises, but this just seemed stupid and I never really used it.If you nail highlighted areas you can use Star Power, and your button on the turntable will turn red. When you activate this the game will crossfade for you, but the fatal flaw here is that if it ends in the middle of a fade and your slider isn't in the right position it'll kill your multiplier, so you have to babysit it anyways. One last feature is the ability to rewind back the track a little bit to add to your score, but this isn't as neat as you think. While the elements are nailed there's still a few issues.There's no real way to express your creativity since the freestyle is so restricted. There's no freestyle zone where you can scratch and crossfade at will. While the song selection is large a lot of the mixes are repetitive and grate on your nerves after a while. It feels more like quantity over quality here. You have big names like Eminem, Jay-Z, Grand Master Flash, Run DMC, and some other rock groups mixed in, but only a select few are worth playing multiple times.The game's pretty customizable with lots of characters, skins, tables, stages, and all that good stuff so it makes you really want to try for five stars. Other than that the only thing is multiplayer which allows you to use a guitar controller on songs with rock bits. The game looks like any of the recent Guitar Hero games, but the price of admissions is pretty high. As of this review the price has dropped almost double, but upon release it was $130 and that's pretty steep. I recommend DJ Hero even to people who don't like rap music because there's a lot of fun and skills to be honed here.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Make no mistake, though:Final Fantasy Chroniclesmarks the first time this pivotal installment of the cherished game series has ever been available on the PlayStation. InFinal Fantasy IV, players take on the role of Cecil, a loyal captain who questions the orders of his king, and for it is sent to slay a mysterious beast in a nearby valley.InChrono Trigger, Chrono must follow princess Marle's teleportation through time and locate her before an intergalactic parasite arrives to destroy the world.

{"product_name":"B00006M3R6","description":"Metroid Fusionis a side-scrolling action game that's more in line with the series' NES origin than its GameCube contemporary, the first-person action gameMetroid Prime. In this one, players take the bounty hunter Samus on an extermination mission through a research facility to kill X parasites--nasty creatures that absorb and assimilate the powers of their host. After she survived an X attack through the use of a vaccine made with X parasite DNA, she can now absorb the parasites to regain health and obtain special powers, like the morph ball, space jump, and wave beam. The problem is that the parasites are quickly making their way through the research lab's many dangerous projects and subsuming their abilities.As a special bonus to GameCube owners,Metroid PrimeandMetroid Fusioncan each unlock special features in the other game via the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance cable. For example, by completingMetroid Fusion, you can unlock the original NES version ofMetroidinMetroid Prime. By completingMetroid Prime, you can unlock Samus's fusion suit for use inMetroid Prime.","reviewerName":"Ella C. Weidman \"beawei\"","summary":"The Best GBA Game!","reviewText":"Metroid Fusion will pull you in from the very first seconds of gameplay. Whether your a veteran of the series, like me, or a newcomer, seeing Samus fly and sumersault from platform to platorm always looks amazing. Not onlt that, but she can now bounce off walls and handholds, making every fight fast pace and just plain cool-looking. This new installment in the series follows off where Super Metroid left off, having Samus get infected by a newly discovered parasitic diesease. Miraculusly being saved by a cure made from the metroid larva, She now is sent to investigate a reasearch facility that has just been strucken by this diesease. I will admit that Samus now has some strange purple goo left off from the diesase and that looks a little silly, but, as mentioned above, her fast paced jumping moves look as cinematic and cool as ever, kinda like Dante (From Devil May Cry) and that Contra character no one can remeber the name of. It has the dark, moody inviroments although there not quite as scary as the abondoned, dark and bug-infested underground bunker of Super-Metroid, but an abondoned and quiet space facilty with mutated people walking around it and strange opvergrown vegetation crawling up the walls can get one just as emotioanlly involved in as the enviroment of Super-Metroid. Theres also a Samus clone that you constantly either sneak quietly and stealitly past, or make an epic and dramatic run from that always seems to end in a close call. Most of the most frantic and exciting moments of this game come from encounters with Samus's clone. The bosses are also some of the greatest I've ever seen in a 2D game. They all feel big, no, huge and sometimes gargantuan and look very intimidating. Plus, there are no real corny or fake-looking ways to beat them, once you defeat one, the fight will look very real and you'll beleave that it would be possible for a lone and small Samus to defeat such a large and overwhealming enemy. The endings (There are five of them), are also climatic and dramatic, and just like the clone encounters, always seem to end in a spectacular close call. Metroid Fusion is my favorite Metroid Game, and has instanly become my favorite GBA game. This game is very amazing, the strange and creepy enviroments are very compelling, the storyline could become a great Scince Fiction movie, Samus's sumersault moves are dazling to look at, and the bosses are the best looking and most fun to fight ive ever seen in a video game. You can really think about it hard, but never think of anyway this game could've been better. I have had a great expereince with this game, one of the best I have had with a handheld video game. Please, Nintendo, never abondon your Metriod series again. This game is a great game for anyone except the very young ones (8 and below) who get scared by movies. I think every GBA owner who met that above reccomentdation should have this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2003"}

Mario Kart 7 is just another fantastic entry in the racing game that's easy to pick up and so, so hard to put down. Like its older brother, the first DS entry, the great thing about Mario Kart 7 is that its portable. It keeps gamers entertained on long trips or the morning commute. And with both card to card and download play available, the next race is always right around the corner.Mario Kart 7 is strong because it continues to bring what has worked in the past while throwing in just enough to keep the game fresh and not throw long-time fans off their pace. MK7 brings many of your favorite Marioland residents back to race while introducing some new favorites. There's also a great mix of long time, fan-favorite race tracks, while introducing some new challenges. By the way, I was really glad to see the Coconut Mall back from the recent Wii outing.Although the game does have a new cockpit perspective, most are probably going to want to continue with the classic third person view. The game plays as it always has... pedal to the metal, and grab those power-ups. Speaking of which, this time out we get the fire flower and the all new \"7\" power-up. This new addition gives you a smorgasbord of destruction from red and green shells to bananas and the invincible star. The good news is, it only pops up once in a while, so you won't feel like its always there to help - or hinder - you.Toss in a great new set of Kart chassis and mods and this game is good to go. You'll be ripping up the track, flying through the air, and splashing through the water in no time. If you love Mario Kart and you've got a 3ds, this one is a no brainer.

I loved Infamous 1 and 2 to the point no one will ever replace Cole in my heart.  Cole was THE MAN!  Delsin Rowe would have to be pretty awesome before I would embrace him as the new face of Infamous.  Delsin Rowe is no Cole and I'm happy he never tries to be. Delsin Rowe is his own man.  Cole was pragmatic almost sensible unless you made him mad.  Delsin Rowe is younger and more a wisenhiemer, always ready with the smart*** wise crack.  Tagging every nice spot he see's. Delsin Rowe is a young guy who makes up his mind he is not going to put up with the crap DUP is doing to otherwise good people.Delsin Rowe is smart enough to resist the DUP brain washing news spin cycle that labels everyone with unique conduit powers an instant bio-terrorist.  I love the message in Infamous that says do not be a sheep.  The other totally cool thing in Infamous Second Son is that it lets you choice your moral nature.  I was not always a paragon, I was not always the good guy.  Sometimes I killed a few good guys who got in the way to get the bad guys.  I love how Infamous teaches that despite all our humanity none of us is perfect.  Infamous Second Son gets me viscerally excited often during the game my true darker passions are at play which sort of shows me how much work I have to do in becoming more humane.  Oh yeah I love the story, I love the character its all good.  I upped my rating to reflect new information I was provided.Some reviewers say Infamous Second Son is not funny.  They must not have done any of the Spray Paint mini missions.  The graphic spay can art is funny.  The fact that you must start the artwork is fun.  The fact that the final concept is revealed only after a blackout screen is hilarious.  Delsin Rowe says more than his share of funny things.  Also when Delsin Rowe does the power dive as he becomes the BOMB his grinning I really love this facial expression is priceless. I like that Delsin Rowe is so laid back.  I enjoyed killing all the drug dealers whenever they appeared.  I enjoyed blowing up those DUP sentry towers and their crawer squad vehicles.  The fact that Delsin Rowe's lady friend calls him as he is climbing the \"Space Needle\" was awesome and funny.People say Infamous Second Son was repetitive well you are fighting an army of occupation.  Occupying armies are not known for their inventitiveness. Ask anyone who has been in the real army.  Armies are about olive drab sameness at the grunt level. Armies of occupation thrive on maintaining the good order using the exact tools seen in the game.  Checkpoints, street level traffic control.  Solders walking around their posts being borded stiff most of the time till you show up to blow their shift with life treatening excitement. All the battles were just right in their difficulty. Oh man this thing has replayability all over it. The graphics were first rate.  The game play mechanics while not perfect were a great improvement over Infamous 1 and 2.  The Delsin Rowe character is more sticky, agile and quick.  The Delsin Rowe  responds better to controller input than any Infamous game ever.  As for frame rate drop or lagging of any kind performance issues I have not seen none.I waited for Second Son patiently for years.  At first Second Son was scheduled to release in December 2013 I brought a PS4 especially to play Second Son.  They pushed the Second Son release out to April and I returned my PS4.  The ONLY reason I brought my PS4 a few days ago was so I could play Infamous Second Son.  Yes I love this Infamous franchise that much. I di dnot expect to really like Delsin Rowe since he was more young and wild than Cole.  To my surprise I ended up loving Delsin Rowe  like a member of the family, he earned his place in my heartfelt respect on his own merit.  I paid full price for Infamous Second Son and I do not feel ill used at all.  Matter of fact Infamous: Second Son is one of the best video purchases I've ever made.  Now all I must do is wait for MASS EFFECT 4 and Borderlands 3 in PS4 format.This Infamous Second Son ROCKS some reviewers think otherwise but, in my honest appraisal I can't find much to hate about this game.  Bring on the Downloadable Content and give me an excuse to play Infamous Second Son again and again!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2014"}

I was annoyed at Nintendo as well for ignoring the console and I still am. So a couple weeks ago my ps3 kicked the bucket(old ylod model that I was sick of fixing). I went out to replace it with a new model. I figured I could sell my ps2 library and deal with the ps2 classics on the psn. When I went out I saw that the Wii u bundle and the ps3 were the same price(Not the amazon list price it was $299.99) I paced around for almost a half hr thinking of what to do because I knew the Wii u had a small game library and I may have to re-buy games. I took the chance. Holy crap is this console amazing! I had the original Wii and I hated it! It had a few games that were actually excellent but that was rare. It mostly had those stupid cooking mamma games that i'd rather eat a box of nails then play. However it did have the Zelda games and Mario. What's great is I can play that small library of excellent titles that I missed after selling my Wii! In 1080p as well!(It's upscaled) The Wii games look sharp and the Wii u games on the game pad is sweet! The gamepad is not a gimmick! It's actually very useful! I like taking my games into my bedroom with my better ac instead in my living room with crappy ac. Also laying down on my couch with the gamepad playing next gen games rules! The big screen is nice but sometimes I feel like laying around like a lazy bum! The TV function is great as well! I didn't expect it but it's awesome! It won't replace your remote but it won't get you killed when you need the remote to adjust the volume either! Basically if i'm playing call of duty online and the volume is too loud i just tap the TV button, lower the volume and tap it again. Then i'm back to yelling at cod for lagging as well as making up excuses for my bad playing. =) The virtual console is a nice touch to but could use a larger library. You can however access the Wii virtual console which has n64 games and a decent amount of retro titles you can play. You can also use your tablet controller as a display for Wii mode now. The tablet controls can't play the games so you still need the wiimote and nunchuck, as well as the classic controller. You can also add up to 2tb of external storage to install Wii u games onto. Oh and the console does not have hdcp so if you like capturing gameplay you are free to do so and even if it did it supports component cables. It does need some bugs ironed out of the OS but so far it's one of my favorite Nintendo systems. I like the hardcore titles as well as the Nintendo titles and the vc. It gives you a good variety of gameplay. With Microsoft and Sony most of there exclusives are shooters and the third party games are also shooters so it made me wanna quit gaming.

{"product_name":"B003Q53VZC","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Mefford","summary":"A big let down","reviewText":"With the departure of Infinity Ward from the Call of Duty franchise, I have been looking for the next great franchise.  Unfortunately I fed into the media blitz put on for this game.  Big mistake!The story is visceral and engaging but not for the faint of heart.  Much of the imagery is disturbing and gruesome.  What was there was pretty well done for an initial release, but there just wasn't much there.  I was just getting the feel for the game when the campaign/single player ended.  I was in shock as it was only my second session with the game, meaning I finished it in under 5 hours.At this point I moved on to the online campaign.  After selecting XBox Live I was prompted for to purchase or redeem an online code.  What?!  I just bought the game why would I need a code.  Its not a PC, its a console, this is odd.  But sure enough I found in my game case the required online access code.  Without this code you can only play up to level 5 in multiplayer.So with a 5 hour campaign and a required code to play online this game is going to be a real bummer for anyone who buys it used.  They will have to pay to be able to play it online.  If there are multiple people in your house with different Live accounts, they will each have to buy their own code.  This is the most absurd thing I have ever seen with a console game.  With all the compromises that I deal with for console gaming, the one thing I expect is a level of trust that I am not stealing the game, but apparently that is now gone too.A couple of other pet peeves with this game.  The game would have been even shorter if I had not had to sit and wait seemingly forever for the NPCs to open a door and walk through it, at times right after a checkpoint so that you get to enjoy it multiple times if you die.  That is even if you know exactly where to go and what to do, you have to wait for the NPC to open the door and saunter through it, and then the next NPC to follow before you can then walk through the door.  If you try to go earlier you just get in the way, are not allowed to proceed and slow the progress of the NPC, and ultimately your own progress.  Another annoyance was points of infinite spawns in the game where if you attempted to pre-clear an area you would never finish, had I just moved up at first try the game would have been even shorter and I would have had more ammo.  Finally, there is a sniper mission where you must wait for the NPC to identify the target, and finally give you the OK to fire.  If you shoot anytime before the final OK, you will have to restart the mission.  While this might be OK, it is not made clear until you drop the first target.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2011"}
{"product_name":"B003Q53VZC","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Posey","summary":"Homefront - First Impressions","reviewText":"Homefront is not your typical war FPS.  Instead of taking place in some desert country with Taliban like enemies, the war takes place on US soil.  North Korea expanded outside it's borders after the death of Kim Jong-Il and began systematically taking over the world.  After unifying all of Korea and taking over China and Japan, Korea set it's sights on America.  With America in turmoil over $20 gas prices and an influx of people heading for the borders to leave American soil, the stage is set for the first bloody conflict on US soil in over 200 years.  Can THQ take this awesome setting and make video game gold or does it fall a little flat in comparison to some of the other shooters on the market?  Keep reading to find out in my first impressions.Homefront starts off in one of the brutal ways possible.  You wake up in your apartment to find Koreans kicking down your door and taking you prisoner.  On the transport bus to a labor camp, you see some of the most brutal displays of violence on the American people ever portrayed in a video game.  I won't spoil it for you, but be on the lookout for one particular gut wrenching moment when a family is torn apart as soldiers kill a man and a woman who are trying to calm their crying toddler.  After their deaths, he runs over to \"wake\" them as the soldiers leave him there.  It's from this moment that you realize something special in the game...you HATE the Korean invaders.  I can't say that I have ever particularly hated an enemy in a game before.  Sure, you want them dead to make it to the next checkpoint, but in this particular game, I wanted to do bad things to them.  That's an amazing accomplishment from a game developer and it's something you don't often see.  Kudo's to the developers for creating this sort of anger and dread throughout the first five minutes of the game.  Throughout the game, this anger only intensifies until it's almost palpable.Unfortunately, the game doesn't go much deeper than that of a typical shooter.  The ambiance is amazing and the visuals really make you feel like you are reclaiming America town by town, but the game mechanics are a little dated.  Picture a typical shooter with a limited supply of ammo and you have Homefront.  This isn't a knock against Homefront though.  There are some really good FPS games out there and it does a solid job of mimicking them, it just doesn't go much deeper after that.  The areas it does shine in involve vehicular combat and combat drones but this isn't enough to rise it out of the mediocre shooting mechanics the game employs.  It's really a shame too since the game started so strong and gave that anger the player could have built off of.  But just because the shooting mechanics are so so, there is a lot to like to in the game.  It does do a little more than the typical shooter to make you feel like the world is a living breathing entity.One thing that really put me into the story was the fact that the game often had breaks in the action where you would interact with people.  It was never more than pressing a button to talk to the person a few times and you were usually following someone at the same time, but it did give the game a little more personality.  You will recognize the characters and as things begin to take form and characters begin to grow and become more involved in the action, you'll feel for the loss of a teammate or ill decision of someone who responds off of anger.  The game does a nice job to really show off the fallibility of man, especially during a time when their livelihood and country are being torn asunder.The graphics and sound in the game are both pretty good.  You won't see any Uncharted 2 type graphics or be blown away by any particular sound work, but it's serviceable and does the trick.  Destroyed buildings and enemy encampments come to life with minor details in tact.  Propaganda coming from the radio makes your blood boil and collectibles strewn through the level teach you about the history leading up to the invasion.  These small attentions to detail really prove that the developers put a lot of time and effort into their game and fleshed out a nice backstory to accompany their game.I was able to play a few rounds of multiplayer last night and from what I've seen, it's pretty good.  It's got the Call of Duty points system people clamor for but it also uses vehicles.  These vehicles are unlocked on the battle field and allow you to hop into them straight from a spawn point.  They aren't too difficult to figure out how to use either and you can be soaring around the battlefield in no time dropping missiles on unsuspecting targets.  The only game type I played was a capture point type game but there are others.  I don't think it will make you leave your current game of choice, but it will provide a brief stint of multiplayer action before moving on to the next game to be released (or returning to your old game.)So, do I recommend this game?  Sure, I'd recommend it.  As long as you aren't a FPS snob who pays critical attention to shooter mechanics and expects something revolutionary in each game to hit the market.  The shooting you've seen before, but hell, is it even possible to make something new nowadays?  Shooting is shooting and it's just like in other games minus the supply of ammo.  You will be scrounging and picking up enemies weapons to stay alive.  The story, ambiance, and overall emotions this game embarks upon the player is more than worth the price of admission.  While you will probably beat it once and then never come back to it, the multiplayer will provide a short respite from your game of choice and maybe even pick up a few players for longer than that.  So, pick it up, and take out those invaders and save America.  Because no one, and I mean no one, blows up a Hooters and uses it as a battleground.

{"product_name":"B00005ME8S","description":"Originally released in 1998, the PC version ofHalf-Lifechanged  first-person shooters forever by proving that a compelling story can be told within  the genre. Prior to the game's release, first-person shooters were mindless  action games.Half-Life, while containing its fair share of action, also  contained plenty of exploration, puzzle, and story elements. Now released as a  PlayStation2 game,Half-Lifehas never looked or played better. This  version contains the outstanding single-player story mode, as well as a few new  ones. While the new additions aren't so great, the story mode is one of the best  escapades available on the PS2.The game follows the adventures of Gordon Freeman, a young research associate at  the Black Mesa Federal Research Facility. A typical day at the office goes  completely awry as numerous alien life forms invade the facility. The fate of  the facility, and quite possibly the world, is in the hands of an unlikely hero.The graphics here trump the original's (understandable, as more than three years  have passed). The character models have four times as many polygons, as well as  smoother textures and animations. The sound is also very good, with some of the  funniest voice acting yet heard in a game. Of course, the single-player gameplay  is excellent, thanks to some very well-developed enemy artificial intelligence.Unfortunately, the new modes aren't nearly as brilliant. Decay, the new  cooperative mode, seems like an afterthought and pales in comparison to the  cooperative modes inPerfect DarkandHalo. Deathmatches only  support two players, which is incredibly lame considering many PS2 first-person  shooters support four. Despite these flawed modes, the single-player story is so  superb that it totally warrants a purchase.--Raymond M.

Therefore I decided to wait until the price dropped.I finally picked this up new and started it.  At first I was blown away with how absolutely beautiful this game looks.  But as started to play it, I didn't really like it. It felt a little weird and linear at first.  The world looks so amazing with so much detail, it feels jarring that you can't interact with any of the people on the streets, etc.  The gameplay felt strange as I never played a game like this that has you create your own combos.  Also the camera felt off to me.I thought I might not be able to finish the game due to my initial feelings toward it.  Still, i continued to play it hoping it would get better.  And it did and by the time I got to the end I was in love with this game.Here's the thing about &#34;Remember Me&#34;... it does not play like any other game (that i know of).  So what I decided to do was clear my mind of any predisposition's and expectations that I had from other games and approach this one with an open mind.This seemed to work well.  As I played more, I began to get a better control of the camera and before I knew it, it was no longer a problem in the game, even in tight spaces.The combos are fun once you get the hang of them. For me, I created a combo to restore my health, one to speed of up the cool down of my special moves and one to do hard damage with each attack.As the game went on, they made more interesting puzzles and the rewind memory change sections, though few and far inbetween were nevertheless awesome and unique. Just wish there was more.The story was actually very engaging for me and I enjoyed it all the way to the end.Once I beat the game, I was surprised to see that I wanted to start it over from the beginning again.  This game is really underrated and I hope it gets a sequel.  It's nice to play a game that doesn't try to mimic other games and is daring enough to go out on it's own and create it's own style, which is always welcome to me.If you haven't played it yet, I'd say give it a try. The price is so cheap now, it's more than worth it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2014"}

{"product_name":"B000P297EI","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"Aging Formula","reviewText":"Devil May Cry 4 is a game of contradictions. For every instance where the developer improved the DMC formula there is an opposing area where things have remained untouched since the original game dating back to 2001.I'll begin with what players will likely notice first about DMC 4 - the graphics; simply put they are gorgeous. Throughout the game the player will be treated to an assortment of environments from urban to jungle and even arctic. Each area is rendered beautifully and I found myself stopping to admire the scenery several times. However, as much as the environments have improved graphically there is one glaring issue, they're still pre-rendered static backgrounds. Just like the original DMC on the PS2, the backgrounds provide no interaction, other than a few props like chairs and benches nothing in the environment can be affected by the player. No matter the level of destruction you render on your opponents - and some of the combos in the game are fantastically destructive - you'll never scratch the environment around you.The pre-rendered backgrounds also present another problem - the camera. Although certain environments do allow the player to adjust the camera for a better angle of the action around them, many areas do not. You'll be stuck with the same fixed camera featured in games like Resident Evil. I can't for the life of me understand why Capcom loves these fixed cameras. The frustration of repeatedly failing to make a jump or accomplish a given task because of the poor camera is only amplified when you're faced with fighting multiple enemies. Often times you'll be completely blind as to where your enemy is, resorting to mashing the attack button in hopes of escaping the area alive. The camera in short is simply not up to par with the attention paid to the graphics.The game includes 2 playable characters - Nero and Dante. Both have their unique weapons and combinations though Dante is clearly the more diverse character with access to far more weapons than Nero. Here again the graphics for the combinations are spectacular. The unfortunate part of the combo system is that it's mostly centered around a single button. There are some slight deviations based on what character your using but nothing very diverse.As I mentioned the game features 2 characters. At some point in the story you'll switch control from one to the other. Without wanting to spoil anything I'll leave out most of the details, suffice to say though that it marks a huge disappointment in DMC 4. One you do advance far enough into the game to switch characters be prepared to travel back through the exact same landscapes only in reverse order. You'll be seeing the same environments and inexplicably battling the exact same bosses that you just defeated. I feel as though Capcom finished the game and realized that it was far to short to sell as it was and made the player trudge through the game again just to artificially lengthen it. To make matters worse you'll be fighting the exact same bosses a 3rd time before the game ends.The music and sound effects in game are merely passable. There are moments where the soundtrack is actually quite good and fitting for the cut-scenes. However, when in combat the exact same terrible heavy metal track plays over and over again. It's aggravating having to listen to the same song time and time again.Speaking of cut-scenes Capcom included an abundance of them throughout DMC 4. They are generally quite good in terms of graphics and voice acting, however, the love story infused with a generic betrayal/revenge subplot falls flat. I found myself caring less and less about the confusing story as the game progressed. It basically boils down to \"kill the bad guys, save the girl\". Nothing revolutionary here.Aside from the revamped graphics and some slight online implementation in the form of leader boards and achievements there isn't much new to the series. I keep reading in various articles how western developers are pulling ahead of their Japanese counterparts and I think games like DMC4 are a prime example of why. Instead of changing the more trivial and frustrating aspects of the game Capcom has only wrapped them in a prettier layer. I lost count of how many times I stumbled into a new area in the game and was sealed into the room by a \"ghost web\". The only way to proceed was to destroy the enemies in the area. Why is there a need to even have something like that? There are many other ways Capcom will test a gamers patience as well. A confusing layout to some of the maps, random mazes that have no logical reason and don't fit into the game are everywhere. It seems like Capcom just threw these things in to lengthen the game. The worst part is that you'll have to clear these areas and mazes more than once since you're forced to play back through the same areas you cleared.Devil May Cry 4 is worth playing and die hard fans of the original game will likely be satisfied but there are far better games out there. Try before you buy, even at a discount price, it may not be worth admission.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2008"}

Its precise combat coupled with stringent combat made for a very interesting game. Its difficulty wasn't brutal because it was cheap or needed you to do quick button presses (a la Ninja Gaiden cheap), but because it required you to approach every single fight with patience, precision and concentration. A slight lapse could mean death in 2-3 blows or fewer and loss of all souls - the currency in Demons Souls.Now, we have its sequel - Dark Souls. However, this game, although having almost the same combat mechanics, is more difficult and unforgiving than Demons Souls. The enemies gang up on you faster, the areas are darker, scarier and more brooding. This means several hundred deaths may stare at you before you're done. I feel this game is unfair at times given how many enemies pounce on you simultaneously and the camera lock on makes it useless since you lock on to only one enemy exposing yourself to vicious attacks from others. Couple that with no Mana bar and fixed # of spells makes this game tougher, more challenging and ultimately less fun. Hence I deducted one star from the game.Thus, I'm not having as much entertainment as from Demons Souls. Still, it is a very good game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2011"}

Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"AC4 Black Flag:  A TON to do, but left me a little wanting","reviewText":"Along with Marvel Super Heroes, Angry Birds Star Wars and NFS: Rivals, I got Assassins Creed 4 Black Flag for my PS4.  And it's a stunning achievement.  In the cutscene after the first part of the game, the level of detail on the characters are incredible; for the first time since I started gaming, I could have mistaken the skin for a REAL person.  And this is just the release window games!  I can only imagine how much developers will draw out of the PS4 in the coming years and it's exciting.Now, I had only played about an hour of Assassin's Creed III prior to playing this game, so no, this reviewer is not enough of an AC expert to explain any nuiances between the titles.  I'm sure there are other reviews that can satisfy this.There is a crapton of things to do in this game; I got to Havana and was overwhelmed to be honest.  Do the side quests?  Look for all the shanties?  Get all the observation points?  Continue with the main story?  Let's put it this way:  If you're an AC fan, hated III and are worried, DON'T.  You will be in heaven with this game.Around the 4-5 hour mark (if you go through the main story only) you'll unlock your ship.  This is where the game really opens up.  Now when you put naval warfare (very well done, BTW), and combine that with searching on foot, you have a game that really sets sail.However, as other reviewers have mentioned, the controls are really bad in spots.  Too often I'd want to jump off a building and it wouldn't respond.  Or I'd be sprinting, barely bump a building and now I'm climing instead of running.  You would really think Ubisoft could get this right after so many years of making games but it's still a sore spot.Still, understand what you're getting.  It is a massive graphical and U/I improvement in the PS4 version.  The game runs at 1080p and is stunning.  There's a ton to do.  There's no slow down or lag whatsoever, at least what I noticed.If you love adventure games or were an fan of other A/C games, this is a must-buy.  Just be prepared to lose a lot of sleep and/or invest a lot of time in the game if you want to see everything! :)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2013"}

I have Pentium IV 2.66mhz, 512ram, 128 NVIDIA Geforce FX video card, and DSL and this game stinks.Heres what is good:1. Great soundtrack. The music is awesome.2. The idea. the idea is great. The way it plays out is not.I first decided to play the single player mission to get the hang of the game. The graphics weren't very good and even this part of the game lags. The movements are jumpy and it takes along to load. So I decided to try on-line and see what it was like.I couldn't even log onto a game because I had the wrong version. I just got the game that day and it hadn't been out long. Plus this game comes with some software called Acegain Liveupdate. It is supposed to automatically check and download any patches and updates. Well, it didn't. So I said OK to update. I waited and waited and waited and finally after 1/2 an hour, I cancelled it and went out on the internet and looked for the patch. After waiting a little over an hour, I finally got the patch and loaded it. The patch did let me enter an on-line game and it did help with the graphics, but the game was way too laggy. According to my ping, I was running less than 70 and I had the 3rd best ping out of 16 people and I still couldn't move very well. I was warping all over the place. So I tried another server and another server and after 17 tries, I found a game with only 5 other guys. And guess what? It still played like crap. Not sure how the other 5000 + people that are on everyday keep playing this, but they are.I thought the idea of doing helicopter drops and firing weapons from a helicopter and some of the booby traps you can set sounded cool. And it looks like the maps were done very well and there was lots of potential here. But somewhere along the line something happened. And it isn't good.I have also read some reviews here that said you had to have certain video cards and computers. Why? This game should have been made to work with computers no matter what they have as long as they meet the minimum requirements. My computer which is a Dell beats those requirements and the recommended requirements by alot. But the game still lags on single player and multi player. It is just unplayable. I have not had this problem with any other recently released games and should not have had a problem with this one. But it sounds like I am not the only one.Having been a pretty big fan of Battlefield 1942, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone right now. Maybe more patches are on the way but after trying to play this game for around 12-15 hours, I just can't do it anymore. I will keep checking for new patches to see if it improves, but for right now, I would tell you to wait for Battlefield 2 which is coming sometime. Until then, I will get back on-line and continue to play Medal of Honor.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2004"}

One of the games that caught my eye was a game entitled Killzone and playing it was a great experience. When the game series continued on the PS3 I was really excited and couldn't wait to play it. And then I heard about one of the better games of the series called Killzone Mercenary but will this game be one of the best games in the series? Or should you just pass this one up?The events of Killzone Mercenary take place after the first game and in other missions scattered throughout the games. You are put into the boots of Arran Danner who is a former UCA soldier and takes on jobs that pay the most. A routine mission to evacuate a Vektan Ambassador seems to go south and you wind up his son. Not only will you be fighting along the ISA forces as in other Killzone games but the Helghast as well. This is the first game where you can do this as you can customize your loadout with various weapons and tools of the trade. Being a title that is available on the Vita this game makes use of both the touchscreen as well as the rear touch panel.One of the biggest problems that I have for this game is that is an exclusive for the PS Vita. This seems to be a really excellent game but you put it on a failing system? This is where Sony seems to have dropped the ball and they should put this game in the PS3 Store so everyone can play it. If you're a fan of the Killzone series and you want to play this game you are going to have to get a PS Vita.However, this has some great concepts and allows you to fight for whoever is paying the most cash. Is this a great game for the series? Yes. But making it an exclusive for a system that is not doing very well seems to be a very poor choice.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2013"}

Latching onto a minor character - Vincent Valentine - we now find out what happened 3 years later.Vincent is older than the typical Final Fantasy Teen character - more along the lines of Auron from FFX. He loves to dramatically swirl his cape as he moves. He is dark, brooding, and ruthlessly efficient in his attacks. I like all of this.The cut scenes are simply *gorgeous* at times.  The movements of characters is just amazing. The small motions, the emotions shone, this is a work of art.Unfortunately, given these great achievements, the actual gameplay really doesn't hold up well for me. I understand that this is not a RPG - it is a combat game. You go around attacking enemies, little numbers of damage bounce over their heads, and you reduce them to zero. The \"world\" is a Final Fantasy world, but it's not really a Final Fantasy game. It's about building up gun components, shooting, and then shooting some more. Puzzles involve getting cards to get through doors, and figuring out how to kill enemies.The in game graphics are much less impressive than the cut scenes. Your character is reduced to jumping and walking. There's no diving, rolling, or other special moves. Even worse, there are incredibly numerous long pauses as you go between gameplay and cut scene. There must have been a better way to integrate those quickly, especially as many of the cut scenes are just brief little \"thank you\"s.Also, while I know Vincent is a dark, brooding type - a type that appeals to me a lot, by the way - I find him a bit too uncaring about the people around him. He seems often to get involved reluctantly. He almost seems to dismiss some people as being beneath his notice. This isn't a kind of hero I appreciate.In general, as much as I tried to get into this new style of game, it just didn't work very well. There are many other combat style games that involve characters that can creep, roll, dive and use great combat moves. With Vincent doing these things in cut scenes, he should be able to do them in actual gameplay as well.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2006"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"BillofGoods","summary":"I'll Give It 5 Stars .....","reviewText":",,,,, let me start off by saying I still have the original Xbox (yes I own a 360 too) and one the very first games I bought when I purchased the original Xbox 10 years ago was the original Halo. I have all of the games in the series and I was a bit hesitant to buy this game since there was a new designer involved. My overall impression is very good so far .... I've only played the campaign up to this point, and I have yet to dive into any multi-player.Let me say the graphics looks great in this game and I am really enjoying the story so far.  Like most games I am playing my 1st play-thru on Normal difficulty. Halo 4 has all the feel of the previous installments IMHO, but one thing that bothered me were the checkpoints. Its not major but the checkpoints seem very inconsistent. If there is anything I dislike in a game its when you have a series of events to complete an objective ..... then fail when you're 75% (or higher) of the way thru it, then have to start over from the last checkpoint. I don't need a &#34;savied check point&#34; in a hallway as a I run thru it, I'd prefer it after winning a series of battles and moving on to the next area.  The best thing about the game ? ..... I have to say Cortana !! They made her look very &#34;attractive&#34; in this game. I don't normally mention things like that in a review but I couldn't help but notice her &#34;eye-catching' appearance !!. 343 Infinity has done a nice job of making the story revolve around her, and they do so in such a way where she doesn't become annoying.In closing I will add that whether your a fan of the series or new to Halo, I would highly recommend Halo 4. As far as price and shipping I felt Amazon did a great job with handling the entire transaction and the delivery was fast.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"A great revamp, a touching experience","reviewText":"I've been a longtime fan of Halo (Halo 2 being my favorite of the trilogy, until now).  Needless to say, after seeing the announcement of Halo 4 at E3 2011 and helping put on an event during E3 2012 for Halo 4, I was more than a little excited to say the least for the game.  That, and nervous as many Halo fanatics were after Bungie left Microsoft to pursue other ventures and 343 Industries took over.  Is Halo 4 a dud?  Certainly not.  In actuality, it's one of the best games in the series (again, the story line of Halo 2 is so nostalgic it's hard to surpass), if not the best thus far.  Graphics are terrific, the voice acting is the best of any of the series thus far (Cortana shows emotion this time around, something she lacked in my opinion except for sounding ever much like a \"sidekick\") and the story delves into the emotional side of Master Chief and Cortana.  Did I get a little teary eyed at the end?  Oh yeah, and I'm not afraid to admit it.  Halo 4 possesses everything that made Halo, well, Halo in the first place, but 343 took it and ran with it even further, becoming much more serious and dark in nature.  In the end, it's arguably the best game in the Halo series and promises much for the future.  In two words: GET IT.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"MK37","summary":"Good Halo quality campaign.. but short. (update)","reviewText":"I am one of the 11 year played/read everything Halo veterans. I have beaten the campaign on Heroic and currently playing it on Legendary.Campaign:So first thing this campaign is top notch. It is definitely Halo quality. There is a great story here (you have to watch the terminal stories in Waypoint). The new enemies are a great change of pace and something I think was needed. 343 also did a good job of capturing some of the old Halo feel. The level you are riding along with a giant vehicle is one of my favorites. I dont really want to give away much but it is definitely a worthwhile campaign. I cant say it is the best one of all time. First off being that it is a shorter campaign. Dont expect Halo 3 or Reach length of a campaign. Also this is not a difficult campaign. There are a couple of difficulty spike points especially when they throw multiple Knights at you but other then that it is smooth sailing. There are other things i can say but I wont go into such a deep comparison... Just know that this campaign is worth playing and a good start to a trilogy.Spec ops:Umm saying it short. This is kind of a waste of time. The 5 very very short episodes add nothing to the game. They are kind of fun but i beat all of them in under an hour playing coop on heroic. Maybe after they are all out there will be some good content but for now Firefight was a much better option.Mulitplayer: more detailedOk so this is where my review moves from being a 5 star to being a 4 star review. I will be playing the multiplayer over the next 2 weeks and if my view changes then I will definitely update my score to a 5 for this game... So first impression.. This is not Halo as it has been. That can be good or bad for you. This game has some of the same qualities of Halo but it is no were near as well made as the previous games high standards. High standars being Halo 3 if you dont like AA's or Halo:Reach if you do. This game has mixed in way to much Call of Duty. Halo is built on the balance of shields to weapons and the trinity of gun, grenade and melee. Halo 4 breaks this to become more dumbed down. Yes there are a bunch of unlockables but most of them we just automatically got in Reach. So it is a false level system in that sense. Plus there are perks like unlimited sprint or faster recharging shields. That breaks the Halo mold. Now some of my bigger complaints. Loadouts I do not like because they take away a fundamental element of Halo. Finding and picking up other guns. Yes there are power weapon drops but THEY SHOW YOU WHERE THEY ARE! stupid. Flaw of the game, if I have a DMR and a Pistol and now I need a Plasma pistol to take out this annoying Ghost. Guess what.. I cant unless I die and change my loadout. Another complaint 343 has basically now given me 2 armor abilities that I have to fit on this controller with all the other buttons but I still cant set up my controler exactly how I want it. I have always been able to find a control set up that I like but I am coming up short so far in Halo 4. Also the hit boxes in this game are ridiculous. I am getting headshots with the pistol without even trying. If i am aimed anywhere near the other players head...gameover... Ok so I could keep going but I will just say one other thing. From what I can tell so far the melee combat impact in this game has been taken away quite a bit. I could be wrong so let me know if you see it diferently but I dont have to worry about people getting close to me in this game. The melee does not lunge forward like it use to so I dont worry about people trying to get that last hit and I dont use it as much. It is kind of sad because it takes that aggressive play out and changes the Halo game. I could be wrong on this and will update over the next few weeks.Closing:Fantastic campaign and well worth playing for anyone. More casual multiplayer aspect that I am not a huge fan of so far. Halo has always been my preference but so far it would not pull me from other mp games.Let me know if you have any constructive feedback!Update:Campaign: So I finished the game on Legendary. More challenging but still not difficult. So I have noticed a few more things now. This game is still fun but really lacking in \"Halo\" moments. There is nothing that stands out. There is no \"Last night of solace\" or the last stand level of Reach. There is no massive vehicle level or overarching story like in halo 3. There is no detective element with multiple stories coming together in the end like ODST. This game has a blandness to it. The enemies are way underdeveloped, the music is under par comparitively and sound effects are just ok. The game is like the chief is made out to be \"Robotic\" and like Cortana it is losing itself. In this case the heart of Halo. I am not going to knock it down any further in stars because it is good enough to be 4 stars but never 5. Not by a long shot.Multi: coming soon.. still not the same as before. Nades and melee are weak.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"Thomas Riccardi","summary":"One of the better Halo games to date","reviewText":"There were more than a few games that sell systems whether it be Mario Brothers for Nintendo or Sonic for Sega. One of the reasons I went and got myself an XBox 360 was because of a small title called Halo. I remember getting a copy of Halo 3 and thinking to myself `this has to be one of the best FPS games in the history of gaming.' But when the game ended everyone wanted more and wanted the story to continue. Now players are getting their wish with the release of the newest in the series called Halo 4.Halo 4 has you returning to play as master chief as you are going up against a new enemy in this installment. The forerunners were an ancient race that came before the Covenant and were presumed to be wiped clean by the flood but that's not the case. Now they are back on an alien world called Requiem as this is a source for a few of the forerunners bunkers. There are eight missions in all as you will be battling across this planet trying to figure out what is going on and how will you survive.Master Chief might play a big role in this installment but it is also Cortana the AI construct that plays a bigger role as she is past her prime. AI like Cortana are supposed to exist for several years and has reached a point in her life where she has gone off the deep end. Cortana is prone to emotional outbursts and will sometimes crack or skip when she is talking to you. Also the graphics in this installment seem to be superior to any of the other games in the franchise (and dare I say even superior to most of the XBox 360 games).Multiplayer has become a big part of the Halo franchise and this one delivers as the armor ability has made a comeback in this installment. There are some of the old favorites that you are used to but there are some new choices to be had as well. Also there is a perks system in place (like the ones in Call of Duty) but it meshes with the game so well you won't even notice it. Ten maps come with the game as well as 3 forge levels so you will be able to bring the pain to people from around the globe.If you are a fan of the series this is a no brainer run out and get a copy today. If you are new to the Halo franchise and are thinking of getting into it this is a perfect place to start.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}

The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission. Train and equip your team to survive insurmountable odds.Explore the Galaxy- Scan planets to uncover unique secret missions in theMass Effectuniverse.Integration with OriginalMass Effect- Players of the firstMass Effectcan import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

I have not played such a fine RPG since SW:KOTOR series. Trust me! You will be blown away. Let's get down on the specifics.Pros: Excellent voice acting, great dialogue,  good character back story,  fantastic STORY line, cool leveling system, armor customization, combat abilities, great replay value (I'm on my seventh replay..so many choices).Cons: Mako(controls a little flimsy at best), buggy textures, some minor bugs, the combat system is a little under-developed, besides the crucial plot-moving planets... all explorable planets seemed to be the same, some repetitive dialogue.Overall, this game was fabulous. Even four years after it's release I go back for more. SURE, it had its bugs...but don't all games? The storyline and voice acting more than make up for the times when I was flat on my ass in the Mako, or when I was observing NPC's eyebrows disappear and then reappear before my very eyes. Mass Effect was innovative and just a genius game. One of the best games by Bioware...EVER. The ME trilogy is amazing and will be STILL impacting the gamer culture years after it is done.

But its really like an FBI warning at the start of a film.:DBtw if you don't like the review don't read it, its called an opinion. And opinions are like #$#holes everyone has one, much like the people who have to bash you and call you a liar for not liking the game. It was closer to six, about 5hrs and 45minutes, for those people who have to be so precise. Excuse me. Go bash someone else about there review. Its a shame no one can have a negative opinion.So many games seem to be based on the end of time, or the apocalypse hereafter, i think this market will be quickly dried up much like the FPS genre. You fight as a guy named War(pretty catchy huh) as you are sent back to earth to seek revenge on angels and demons from heaven and hell. While this sounds interesting at first, the game quickly disapates into a regular hack and slash fest that takes its toll on you after about an hour. The game itself is only around 5 hours long, so you really don't get your moneys worth. The controls are hit and miss, the graphics are decent, and there are some interesting puzzles to solve as well, this however doesnt change the fact that this game was rushed out to compete with other games in the same vein. God Of War 3 has been hyped up, and pushed back for around 2 years now, so many developers seem to try to compete with its gameplay, and somewhat with its story line. So far we have Darksiders, Dantes Inferno, and God Of Wars 3 all being about the same, in terms of battle, bosses, and stories. So who will win the prize this year? Well i think its pretty obvious, but i did like the Dantes Inferno demo every bit as much as the God Of War3 demo, so who knows. Darksiders is at its best Mediocre, some will praise it, some will hate it, i for one enjoyed it for around an hour or so, but went ahead and finished the game since i did pay for it. It was a task to finish, and in the end i really felt nothing, just like i had completed yet another God Of War clone.

It has all the blood, gore and language one has come to expect from a GOW game, the weapons have been tweaked, and there are plenty of new baddies.  There are plenty of places to trade out weapons, reload, etc. If a situation is challenging, there will be ammo crates nearby.  After a couple of chapters I realized that when I came across a few crates in the same place, there was going to be an especially challenging battle or boss coming up.  I was actually surprised how readily available ammo and weapon-types were.  I only ran out of ammo a few times and it was a simple matter of swapping out the Lancer for any weapon the baddies dropped.  The types are varied - shotguns, grenade launcher (well, a \"Digger\" launcher), handguns, etc.The Gorgon SMG, Hammerburst II and Gnasher Shotgun are my most often used weapons.  The One-Shot sniper rifle is a blast and can be carried in addition to other weapons. When you're in a situation where you have to defend the high ground, there will be sniper rifles and usually a one-shot around.  If the situation could benefit from a Torque Bow, there will be some nearby.  So you can drop and swap weapons frequently.I expected Hardcore to be much more difficult, but with the exception of some especially tough bosses, I rarely died in battle. That darn Berserker was a real pain to kill, primarily because all his glowing fluids were toxic.I'll probably play it again a couple of more times - gotta get all the achievements possible!One caveat - the cinematics are overdone.  Do we really need to see \"Cole Train\" having what appears to be an acid flashback for around five minutes? It may have been shorter, but it seemed like 5 minutes.  I was thinking \"Wow - they must have blown a ton of money on a rendering-farm so have to justify it!\" Thankfully you can skip them.Edit: 10-13-2011Have spent many hours in munti-player. The lost connections common in GOW 2 are gone. I have played over 500 games and never had a dropped connection or noticeable lag!

You'll improve fast, earn medals and executions, and become a much better player. Set all the weapons to the one you want to master. Play for a week with all sniper rifles and Hammerburst.

{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"JoshJosh","summary":"unbelievably huge game with something for everyone","reviewText":"Guild Wars 2 is a very special game. It's huge, deep, nuanced, and offers something for every gamer. Most importantly, it's just a blast to play.If you're a big fan of MMO gaming as popularized by EverQuest and World of Warcraft, Guild Wars 2 offers an enormous, beautiful world to explore with tons of content. The way Guild Wars 2 plays out in regular player-vs.-environment play is broadly similar to most MMOs, although it lacks the quest structure that World of Warcraft popularized. Instead, there are two main threads: one is your character's personal story, which is customized based on answers given to quests at character creation. The story features a cast of NPCs, high quality voice acting, and even cinemas. The other is events in the world - an early example would be, for example, near a farm. In a WoW-type MMO, the farmer would have an exclamation point near his head and offer you a quest or a chain of quests. Here, you venture onto the farm and the HUD tells you what to do - rather than \"kill 10 squirrels\" or somesuch, it is more like \"feed the cows, water the corn, and flatten wurm nests.\" It's fast and fun. Oftentimes, fun dynamic events pop out of nowhere and change things up a bit. There are tons of these events, for practically every square inch of the world.What makes the player-vs.-environment especially fun is that the game scales your level. A max level character could go to the starting zone and it would still offer a challenge. The idea here is that you can always play with your friends and the whole world is open to all players at all times. Opinions will vary of this design, but I think it's a great idea.If you're a big fan of PVP, Guild Wars 2 has a great arena mode, which ArenaNet dubs \"structured PVP.\" Here, the game scales every character up to 80 and gives them all skills for that class, along with standard equipment. You go to arenas and play capture-the-flag. It's fast-paced, tons of fun, and most importantly - balanced. The standardized equipment and lack of experience means that ArenaNet can balance this mode without affecting the others. Instead of building up experience, you build \"glory\", which allows you to purchase cosmetic upgrades for your character.If you're a fan of world PVP, Guild Wars 2 has a jaw-dropping mode for that. Here, you fight on HUGE battlegrounds with and against hundreds of other players in other servers. The maps are full of castles, farms, keeps, bridges, and strongholds. You lay sieges to enemies and use powerful siege weapons both on offense and defense (cannons, trebuchets, burning oil, battering rams, etc.). The game even has supply lines, as animals ship supplies between the keeps - and a team without supplies cannot hold on forever. In this mode, GW2 scales you to level 80, but you don't gain any additional skills. A character at level 2 has all the hitpoints of a character at level 80 but lacks the bonuses from gear and skills that the level 80 character would have.The game is designed so a person can spend their entire playtime in any of the three modes. So far I have played about 50% world PVP, 30% structured PVP, and 20% PVE (PVP would be higher if not for server queues and outages). If you don't like one mode, there is still a huge game for you. If you like them all, even better. You can play with your friends or on your own. Guild Wars 2 is a game that, first and foremost, respects the player. It lacks the annoying timesinks of most MMOs, and the world is built for efficient travel. The interface is also extremely efficient - for example, you have bank access right at the crafting screen.Of course the feature set wouldn't matter if the game mechanics were lousy, but they are not. ArenaNet has made a fast, fun game. The combat is great (and features real depth), the crafting system is addictive, and the world is just fun to explore. It's also fairly challenging - I've died after getting ganged up by 2 or 3 guys - which is something I could rarely have ever said about World of Warcraft.If Guild Wars 2 was priced like a typical MMO, I would pay $15 a month without hesitation. But it's not - it's all in the one purchase. That's amazing to me. ArenaNet has made an incredible game and is offering it at an excellent value. The other MMO developers should be very worried about Guild Wars 2.edit: after playing it more, I continue to be impressed by it. The combat system opens up and becomes far deeper and more complex. The game's combat is fast-paced, cerebral, and strategic. The combo system is awesome - basically, you can combine effects. What makes it even more interesting is that you can combine effects with other players - rewarding teamwork and high-level play. In the original review I noted that the game is tough when mobs start to gang up. Well, that's true - but skillful use of movement and attacks can tip the scales. That is commendable for a MMO game.If I have any complaint, it's that ArenaNet built all these cool, subtle nuances into the game but do not really explain them. The crafting system, for example, is far more interesting than it first seems... but it's not obvious. It's like that with everything in the game. Some may see this as a strength, but I feel like a bit too much is hidden away here.All in all, this is a great game and I would totally recommend it to anyone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2012"}

Hayes","summary":"Exceptional Fresh IP in the Japanese RPG Genre","reviewText":"Resonance of Fate is one of few fresh new RPG's in this age of sequels for the X-Box 360/PS3 generation of consoles. With no previous entry, it sought to find a place in gamer's hearts by uniting quick fast paced gameplay with a interestingly designed world and characters. How did it work? Well it was exceptional.The story takes a back seat in this game leaving us with essentially experiencing one year of the three main characters lives. Through their interaction through doing missions and helping to close out the story of one of the characters lives and through a non playable characters eyes of him coming to grips with the way the world is, a dazzling and interesting story is told. The highlight with the characters is their interaction. In battles they make interesting conversation with other and have excellent interactions that it becomes one of the most memorable aspects of the game. I had a few favorite lines with my favorite line of dialogue (and one will hear it quite often being).LeAnne: So do you want me on offense or defense?Vashyron: LeAnne goes both ways, thats good to know.Zephyr: Save it, will'ya!There are also many others that do bring smiles to my face (especially that involve Zephyr). The story as a whole though requires playing through twice and in quick succession (a second playthrough can take essentially eight hours or less) so it becomes a quick scene of cutscenes that weaves together into an interesting plot. I enjoyed it.Gameplay wise it is essentially a turn based action orientated RPG> Characters can wield/dual wield, machine guns (that do scratch damage), hand guns (direct damage, will convert scratch damage to direct damage), and grenades (can do both scratch and direct damage, and inflict status ailments). All can be leveled up and are directly dependent on customization options (guns can be customized, better grenades can be generated). The customization system is extensive and directly rewarding to those that engage in it (it makes a world of a difference in battle). The game could explain it better but it had a decent in game explanation. Characters level up by the number of times they use the weapons, with each one able to go to level 100, there is an arena too for training, and world map hexes (zones on the map) can be linked together for numerous benefits such as better exp gain. Essentially, with a weapon that deals tons of hits and double exp rings (give more exp to the characters) and the exp zone on the map with a double effect too, I was able to quickly raise characters levels in my first playthrough, maxing them out before the final boss.  There are other intrinsics to the battle system that are explained well in the arena's tutorial so if one explores it the game can become a highly involving and quick paced game.Ultimately, the game looks good, sounds good, and with characters jumping and running with numerous animations, it is a fresh experience. Purchasing apparel in the game can affect the characters appearance during cutscenes and looks nice in battle and out. Enemy designs never feel old or look like early game models late game with just a fresh paint job.  The game explains everything well and features addictive fast paced gameplay. I found the battle system addicting, played through the entire arena (at least 10 battles per the 50 ranks) and bonus near end game \"realm\", and finished the game in 170 hours, but a playthrough can be completed in just 30-40 hours if one rushes and doesnt level. Enjoy it if this appeals to you!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000087H7T","description":"Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands.

This was the fourth entry in the Call of Duty franchise, and the first of the &#34;Modern Warfare&#34; trilogy spin-off of the series. Released in 2007, the game was a massive success and sold millions of copies and it deserved the success and praise it got.The media frenzy, cultural impact it had was nearly unprecedented and the feel and controls that COD4 had were unrivalled by any game I had played before and in the years since, it has remained my favorite game of the series.Although the game's title says &#34;Call of Duty 4&#34;, the story line completely breaks away from the World War II themes of the first three and is set in the then-near future with a bloody civil war erupting in the Middle East, and also another civil war in Russia between a weakening government of moderates and 'loyalists' on one side, and a vicious ultra-nationalist movement lead by a ring leader named Imran Zakhaev and a British Special Ops team is sent out to track down a nuclear device that has gone missing and attempt to stop the ultra-nationalists from taking control of Russia.The story mode of the game built on what is now, a kind of stale theme plot, but back when the game came out, it was very well-written and lots of fun to follow as well. The characters, although a bit hard to follow immediately eventually became very 3-dimensional and eventually to where you wanted to learn about their histories.The graphics are absolutely amazing, even if the game now shows it's age and the sound effects were groundbreaking and very realistic. This made the game one of the most intense and adventurous military shooter games of all time in the closing months of 2007 through the middle of 2008.The multiplayer was so much fun and had really amazing sound effects, excellent and very detailed (By late 2007-standards) graphics and realistic looking sceneries, and very brutal, realistic sound effects which made it worth the many hours I sank into playing it. It's a shame that now many mods and hackers have made it almost unplayable nowadays but playing &#34;COD4&#34;'s multiplayer was great fun back in the day.I've for the most part have now moved on from the &#34;Call of Duty&#34; series but &#34;Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&#34; and it's two sequels remain staple favorites on the Xbox 360. Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2014"}

It's one of the games with best graphics out there, has a very interesting story and a solid gameplay that can be quite fun if you have the patience. This is what I like from the game. But there were serious complaints about MGS4 that kept me from buying it before, until It got to this price point, and I'm glad I waited. To me, this game idn't worth the 60$ price tag.The BIG flaw with MGS4 is, like may have read in any other bad rating review, the super long in game movies. I can deal with long movies, but in this game long becomes ridiculously long. I'm talking I  sit down to play and I have 2 or 3 hours free for playing, and the minute I load the game a movie starts. 45 minutes later I think When am I gonna play?! finally after a 50 min movie ends, theres a screen saying \"press start\", I say, ok lets play. After I play start another movie kicks In and lasts 25 minutes more. By the time I finish watching MGS4 movie for about 1 and a half hours, Im already bored, save the progress so I dont have to see this movie again, and load another different game in my ps3. According to the game stats Ive played about 15 hours so far and In in the 3 chapter (out of five), so I must be half way through the game. Im almost sure over half of these 15 hours have been gone watching the movie, and not playing the game.At least some of this movies are interesting, but not more interesting or fun than actually playing the game. The only way MGS4 saves from being rated 1 star to me, is because when Im PLAYING it, its a 5star game. Its excellent. But I have to sit and wait for over an hour for 15 minutes of play time. This must be the longest loading times in videogame history.Recently, IGN published a list of PS3's best games in history. They put MGS$ #1, Uncharted 2 #2, and god of war 3 #5 I think. To me, MGS4 could be in the top ten, but in #10, beneath Uncharted 1 and Resistance FOM.PS: I bought This game \"used like new\" from Amazon. I have to say, excellent service. The games are almost as good as new, sealed, booklet in perfect condition, and I saved about 15$ I can use for other games. I plan to buy used games from amazon in the future.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B003O6G5TW","description":"","reviewerName":"Live Player \"GAMERFIDE\"","summary":"Battlefield 3: So many issues!","reviewText":"Let me start off by saying that I am a gamer; I have been since the Colecovision came out back in the 1982. That makes it about oh say almost 30 years? I have owned almost every system since then including (NES, Genesis, Sega CD, Jaguar, Neo Geo, Panasonic 3DO, Playstaion (all of them), Nintendo 64, Dreamcast, Sega Saturn, Xbox, Xbox 360, and I'm probably forgetting a few (not in any particular order). Throughout the years I have also owned a lot of hand-held devices. Now just about any game worth having on any of these systems I have played, and it has been wonderful to see the progression of games from Donkey Kong to now. It's pretty sad I know, but Video Games has been a big part of my life. That being said I would like to review Battlefield 3 now. I would like to add a side note, and I apologize if what I say is untrue, but the first few reviews sound like they have DONE BY SOMEONE WHO WORKS AT EA, OR OTHER BATTLEFIELD 3 ASSOCIATED COMPANY. I mean come on, just read them. Especially the first and second \"top\" reviews. They are either professional writers contracted to write a review, or people who work for the company. Now for a real review, by a real gamer who knows what he's talking about.This was a game that I was super excited about. My first experience with the Battlefield series was back on PC with Battlefield 1942. That was back in 2003; I remember having a blast playing that game on my laptop. I had a few other brush-ins later down the road on some friends who had higher-end PCs than me, and I was really impressed. When the Xbox 360 came out in 2005 I was really impressed with the Call of Duty (2?) graphics. Later I bought Battlefield 2 Modern Combat (the first Battlefield on 360), and I had a blast! It was one of the first games where things actually blew up, and vehicles were aplenty. I had hours of fun on the various maps, and the just one game mode conquest (if I'm remembering correctly). The game did have glitches like M1 Abram's tanks getting stuck on 50 gallon barrel drums, what I call the \"Battlefield Shuffle\" or as others refer to as lag, ways to cheat by jumping inside of buildings, and the constant loss of connection to the EA servers (some things never change). But with all its faults Battlefield 2 Modern Combat was a terrific game. I have since played all the Battlefields on 360 (Bad Company 1, 2, and now Battlefield 3).DAY 1 Battlefield Bad Company 2 is a better game than Battlefield 3. EA and DICE are trying to showcase this as a Modern Warfare 3 killer, and I agree with them in theory. I bought the game on release day a little after midnight. With the game as brand new as it could be, I fired up the 360 around 12:30pm Eastern time. When I tried to fire multiplayer up I got the dreaded \"Cannot connect to Server.\" My very first try to play the game, and this \"Modern Warfare 3\" killer can't even be played on LAUNCH NIGHT! I managed to get on after a few tries, and was pretty impressed with what I could play. I was able to play for about 3 hours in which time I got disconnected in the middle of my game about three times (2 disconnects average/hour). I thought to myself, \"Self, it's launch night,so let them work out the kinks.\" I convinced a friend to buy it to play with me that day, and neither of us could connect to the \"DEDICATED\" servers all next day. So it's launch day for your great game, and no one can play it? Someone should be fired for not making sure the servers were working on the roll-out day. Its like buying a brand new car and the thing doesn't even start on the first try (OK maybe not like that but you get the idea). My friend lived in Florida, so it wasn't just the servers in my area.DAY 2 AND BEYOND Battlefield servers worked decently, but I still lost connection about every hour; usually right before the game ended. I kept playing the game the next couple of days trying to give the game a fair chance, hoping that someone was resolving the lag issues, and the server disconnect issues. It never happened; EA posted a disclaimer on there website claiming that \"overwhelming popularity\" or something like that had basically overran their servers. Really? Has your company ever heard of forecasting? I'm pretty sure MW2, and Call of Duty Black OPS had a lot of people on their servers too on launch week (I was on of them). The funny thing about Call of Duty is that I had NO ISSUES during launch week. Sure I would get the occasional disconnect every 4-5 days or so, but not every hour. I also don't remember the Call Of Duty servers going down during launch day.ISSUES - Besides the disconnect there are a multitude of issues with the game. If you can get the muliplayer to even load, you will notice that there is lag in a lot of matches. It's not my internet as I have 15 Mbps (not the fastest or slowest by any means), and I play tons of other games online with no problems. I played last night November 2nd, and experienced what I call the \"Battlefield Shuffle\" in about half my matches. Even when the game doesn't lag there are many bugs in the game. You'll be flying a jet running from someone who is gunning for you in another jet, and all of a sudden just get stuck in the sky (makes you an incredibly easy target, a jet stuck in the sky). Or you'll get stuck in some invisible web while flying along, and simply crash into the ground. I've also gotten caught while flying around, and my jet just stopped flying like the jets were turned off, and to no avail kept inching closer and closer to the ground till I crashed. Other glitches were when I got my Bradley stuck in a truck, and I tried everything to get it out, but nothing worked, or when I shooting at somebody out in the open, and then all of a sudden I'm behind a wall.I am not impressed with their supposed \"Frostbite 2\" engine. Bad Company 2 (the previous Battlefield) was more destructive than this Battleifeld. In Bad Company 2 you were able to bring down whole buildings; especially on the M-Com objectives. Their claim that this Battlefield is truly an \"All explosive\" world leaves me puzzled as half of the stuff in the game cannot be blown up. Many walls in buildings for example can't even be blown through to enter the next building. One time I was flying a jet (still didn't know what I was doing lol), and I crashed full speed into a building around an objective. It didn't even dent the roof. I'm highly disappointed that buildings can't be brought down anymore, and that many things cannot be destroyed. My tank for example got stuck on a small sidewalk billboard. Really? A real tank can drive straight through a building; I don't see anything like that happening here.The online pairing is horrible and not user friendly. You invite someone to join your squad before starting multiplayer, and then join the match together. The problem is usually one of your party will get dropped saying \"Unable to Connect to server.\" The first time I was trying was with my aforementioned friend from Florida, and the game couldn't even manage to add us to any of the servers online. Either I would get connected and be playing, or he would get connected. One of us would always drop out and not be able to connect. So after an hour of this, we tried one more time, and managed to get connected to the same game. We spent about five minutes looking for each other when we realized not only were we not in the same squad, but on opposite teams. So why did the game have him join my squad when we first started? There was 2 free slots on my team, and one on his the next game so we tried the \"Switch Team\" option, but of course that didn't work. The next day, after a few tries, we managed to get on the same team, but not the same squad. There was an open squad space, and I tried to leave my current squad, to join it, so that he could do the same and we would be on the same squad. Wouldn't let that happen either.For anyone who has played Battlefield, you know that being on the same squad with people who know how to play is crucial. This way you can develop strategies in which each player from the four-man team performing a different role (Combat Engineer, Sniper, Medic, etc.). So we tried that for a week, and could never make it happen. My friend got so frustrated with the game that he sold it back to Gamestop for a guaranteed $3o, which is great seeing as how he just payed $60 + tax for the game. Oh that brings me to a BIG FOUL UP on EA's part.There is an online code that comes with the game, you don't have to pay extra for this code, but if you ever sell the game, the person that buys it has to pay $10 for an online code to play the game online because the code that comes with the game is locked to your XBOX!!! Can we see EA's attempt to control the used game market? Not only that, but it KILLS THE RESALE VALUE OF YOUR GAME. Why would someone give you $50 or even $45 for the game if you don't like it when they still have to pay $10 to play online? I can't believe MICROSOFT allows this as we already pay like $60 a year to play online. Somebody needs to step up to guarantee this game, whether it's Gamestop accepting the game back within 7 days for a FULL refund (not store credit), or if it's Microsoft paying EA $10 or even better EA CUTTING THE $10 CHARGE ALL-TOGETHER. I can't believe they are pulling this crap, especially when their online servers barely work! That's why my friend was so willing to take a $30 loss because the $60 was already a SUNK cost, and nobody in their right mind will pay him anything close to $40-$45 (typical craigslist sale of a new release used game). So in essence EA cost my friend money (can we say CLASS ACTION)?My friend went back to Gears of War 3, and here I am writing a bad review for a game that I was excited for. I'm not saying life is horrible (it's actually great), but this game is a sorry excuse for a product of any sort. The server issue has always been an issue with EA, and it seems that it will continue to be one. Currently they have an in-game post that they are aware the \"quick match\" option doesn't work, and that they are doing everything to fix it. Yeah right; the message has been up all week, and even the choose server option fails most of the time. Oh that brings me to another point; the game doesn't come with a USER MANUAL. Apparently game developers have gotten too cheap to provide written directions to play the game. I understand that is probably a reasonable place to cut costs, but I miss the days of having a nicely laid out manual \"in color\" with a story behind the game. Had I had this manual, I would of figured out that you can choose filter options for what servers you want to join.You go to server browser and click the right thumbstick (a very weird way to get in, I would've never guessed). Once there a screen shows up with preferences to select from: Age group to play with (20+ Check!), Maps and game modes to search for, Normal/Hardcore/Infantry?, and there is an option to select a region on what server to play on (EUROPE, ASIA, EAST COAST, WEST COAST, SOUTH, etc.). For some weird reason mine was selected as EUROPE. Now why would I try to connect to a server that is farther away than necessary? My friend's had the same hash-mark on Europe as well. I got excited because I thought that changing this to EAST COAST would solve all my connection problems . . . WRONG!!! I now have it selected to East Coast, and still have the same amount of disconnects, and lag as I did before. I don't know exactly what these options do if anything.I will be going back to Gears of War 3 as I can actually play that game online with some consistency. I can even play with my buddy on the SAME TEAM!!! Imagine that. No more EA games for me; I recommend you do the same. I will be keeping the game in hopes that they will fix these issues, because if they did this it would be the MODERN WARFARE 3 killer it purports to be, but you have to be able to actually play the game first. Then if they fix all the issues it may be able to contend. Huge maps, and tons of variety, and PLAYABILITY!!! would make this game a hit.So end result would I buy it? Yes, but only because I LOVE BATTLEFIELD, and am willing to deal with a little aggravation to play the game. I don't recommend this game for the average gamer because it will make you want to throw your controller through your flatscreen TV because it doesn't work half the time. I'm a very patient person and actually have fun playing the game WHEN IT WORKS! I don't believe unfortunately that the average gamer will find it fun with all the issues, and will be stuck with a $60 paper weight. I would recommend Gears of War 3, or waiting for the new Modern Warfare and seeing how that is.Just my $60 + tax.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2011"}

Darkwatch is a great mindless shooter that has some fun elements. The vampires vs. cowboys plot is somewhat interesting but isn't used to what it could be.You really do feel like a vampire with all the powers you can get. You can choose between good and bad in the game. If you see a trapped soul you can either free it or take it for yourself and you'll either level up your good or bad meter, which in turn, lets you get powers for the good or bad side. The weapons and enemies are actually pretty damn cool! This game focuses A LOT on melee which is rare in FPSs.Every weapon has some sort of blade on the butt of it and the animations for this are cool and it's awesome to slash your foe apart. Speaking of that this game is ultra gory. Nothing realistic just over the top. It reminded me a lot of Painkiller (for you PC players). Enemies range from skeletons with reapers to flying (sexy) banshees. Of course this game is really famous for the notorious Tala Sharp who appeared nude in Playboy and other magazines. Yes she's uber hot and yes she actually DOES something in the game. One great thing about this game is the friendly AI actually HELPS. What can keep things somewhat fresh are the few turret sections and driving sections. Also, you can lose your vampire powers in sunlight and the only way to get it back is to find shadows. Play this for the few hours that it gives. You'll enjoy it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

Now, there's almost no innovation. We've seen it all before. Sure, some of the mini-games (which is the majority of the game) are new, but no stunning new ideas. The controls on some of the games are funky, in particular \"Flip the Chimp\". How anyone plays this game, we have no idea. The idea of the game is have your robotic monkey climb a pole, and flip him from left to right to avoid having his head hit by coconuts by swinging your wii remote from side to side. Plain and simple, it DOESN'T WORK. Also, rowing a boat to get to the finish line first. Just as it sounds, you row with your Wii Remote.

Although the PSP has been more about gloss and the ability to play movies, the DS has brought out much more excitement in the video games. That has definitely happened with the Mario franchise too for DS owners. With the success of New Super Mario Brothers last year, die hard gamers really wanted a return for their cute dinosaur friend Yoshi too. Unfortunately, Yoshi was out of the picture. Nevertheless, die hard fans have waited over a year to see Mario's friend return in another great classic. This time, it is on his own.Yoshi's Island DS return the classic feeling of Yoshi and his baby companions Mario, Donkey Kong, Peach and Wario, as they help Yoshi and his pals try to rescue Baby Luigi from the clutches of Bowser and his minions. The graphics are absolutely amazing, and bring back the feeling of what the game originally brought out from the Super NES era, and again on the Game Boy Advance. There are over 60 levels of platforming action that are absolutely amazing, and really challenge you at times as you work your way during the game. Yoshi also has to battle enemies like he always does by swallowing villains and turning them into eggs, or by stomping and pounding them to the ground. The gameplay is absolutely addictive, and brings out a great deal of challenge. There is one disadvantage, the music is cute, but at times can be a bit tiring. Still, it doesn't interupt the challenge of the game. Along the way, Yoshi and the gang also earn 1-ups, as well as minigames to unlock from a concentration card match, to roulette, and a flutter jump contest.All in all, Yoshi's Island DS is a delightful game for any Nintendo DS owner, and longtime fan of the Mario games. I really love this game, because it is a whole lot of fun to play and really challenging. I definitely recommend this game for anybody who owns a Nintendo DS.

The Environments are well detailed and character models are still very impressive.+ Very clever AI.  Enemies will stay right where they are and shoot you if you're in sight.+ Vehicles, vehicles, vehicles.  Honestly this is what made the game for me.  The amount of vehicles which you had access to while playing through the game was perfect.  In addition to being fun to drive and use they had amazingly tight controls and physics.  Masterfully done on Bungee's part.+ Intriguing storyline+ Excellent musical score.+ Solid gameplay mechanics+ Superb voice acting.+ 2 weapon maximum limit increased the challenge of the game but in a good way+ Using a regenerative force field instead of having to constantly search for health packs was great.Cons- Enemies are a bit repetitive and with little variation throughout the game.- Ending sequence was sort of a disappointment- A few overly difficult parts- Some of the missions felt a bit too linear.- No way to pull live grenades out of your armor when enemies landed them there.- Grunt enemy voices became terribly annoying very quickly.  Not only that but overall they're rather stupid looking.Bungee should be lauded for creating Halo.  To get so much right and so little wrong in a FPS is a rarity.

It also doesn't teach you to go by school rules. Infact you get many missions to break school rules. As someone old enough to not to do what I see on the game though it's a blast. I mean I thought it was a game where you are in school the whole time. But no you can even get out to town eventually and even have missions there. The school stuff is fun but you can get tired of only being there. I also like how the game is seasonal and how it's Halloween on one part and Christmas on another part.Without doing the missions you just have class or can flirt with girls or start random fights, or pick locks to lockers. Plus you can start fights with those hallway geeks who chase you around if you are even a second late for class. They then bring you to class if they catch you. With all the Grand Theft Auto games basically all seeming exactly the same despite different missions it's nice to see a fresh game from Rock Star Games.

I was very impressed. Medal of Honor is a very well made game and is a lot of fun to play. Here is a quick rundown of my opinions on the game:Graphics: The graphics are very good, but I have seen better. (Namely, Return to Castle Wolfenstein) The game somtimes can get very dark in some areas and you have to adjust the brightness level accordingly.Gameplay: The gameplay is great. A great weapons system and the gameplay is easy to pick up on quickly.Storyline: The storyline for the game is awesome as it is modeled after real events of WWII. Right down to storming the beaches of Normandy (which by far is the hardest damn part in the game)Overall: Overall, I think the game is great. It has a few flaws, such as a couple graphic glitches but nothing that can't be overlooked. One of the things I liked best about this game is that it has a lot of variety in the types of things you have to do. Not just shoot the bad guy. You have to steal battle plans, plant explosives, disable vehicles and so on. Very cool.The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of Return to Castle Wolfenstein. MOH is a great game but it just can't hold up to the level that RTCW is at. I would say that this is the second best FPS I have ever played. RTCW being the best. Both games are great and if you're a fan of FPS or WWII games, either one is a safe bet.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2002"}

Select from dozens of fighting styles, including (for example) martial-arts styles (Legendary Strike, Leaping Tiger), magic styles (Tempest, Dire Flame), transformation styles, and weapon styles (Twin Axes, Staff, and improvised weapons like chairs). Each style has its own tactical role and attacks that range from punches and kicks to weapon strikes, mystical powers, and even transformations into supernatural monsters! You can focus on a narrow channel of styles and become dominant in these forms or broaden your area of study to include a wide variety of styles adaptable to many combat situations. Combat is fast-paced martial-arts action, and it is exciting and tactical as you rapidly switch fighting styles to meet diverse challenges.","reviewerName":"twobitcoder","summary":"Very well done","reviewText":"This is a very well done game, with good graphics, effects, animation, a good story, excellent character development. I highly recommend it. But, at this date, it has not aged well and with so many excellent newer games available, it's hard to justify the time to play Jade Empire.

{"product_name":"B003O6E3C8","description":"","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Not a Cakewalk, but Fun & Rewarding Just the Same","reviewText":"If you've already played Portal, you won't be disappointed with Portal 2:  it's more of the same, and then some more on top.  While the difficulty still has to start low and ramp itself up to get new players used to the world, it does so in a way that old players will find new and interesting.  This time around, top-notch voice-acting injects a wicked sense of humor into Portal 2 that is just perfect:  there were times my family came in the room simply to be in earshot of Portal 2's dialogue.While I will go out of my way not to give you spoilers, I will tell you that the storyline for Portal 2 gives us a nice new level of depth while still bringing back some familiar themes.  It removes some of the isolation by making your relationship with your character just a bit more personal:  others who talk to you drop you little hints about your past.  Best of all, Portal 2 adds some very clever new 'items' to your interaction that bring entire new dimensions to the problem-solving you'll have to do.  There is a supporting cast of other characters--some of whom you never actually meet--but just like Gordon Freeman in Half-Life, you still play a silent partner in the story.The concept behind Portal is simple:  you are trapped in a series of areas that have been designed to challenge your brain.  Each has puzzles that require you to do particular actions (press a switch, carry an object, etc.) in order to get to the exit, and each exit leads you on to the next level.  Some have obstacles, some have hazards...and some are downright deadly.Where Portal is different is that it holds a first-person-shooter perspective but requires no fast-twitch skills.  You do need to be able to stomach some very dizzying spins and turns, and you will get at least a bit of vertigo at times when you're hurtling off a ledge aiming yourself at a narrow hole.  The only object you hold is a device capable of opening said hole: \"portals\" are inexplicable holes in reality.  Pop a hole in one wall, place an exit in another, and when you step through Hole A, out you go through Hole B.  Simple?  Not when you have to put a hole in the bottom of a pit, open another in a vertical wall, and then hope you fall into the pit fast enough that coming out the wall above you has enough momentum to throw you onto that platform on the other side of the room near the ceiling.  Not to worry--you won't be straining the laws of physics right away:  Portal 2 gradually works you towards the more complicated rooms at a very capable rate.  Just as in the first game, we have moments where we peek behind the curtain, but stepping outside of the rat-maze doesn't mean you get to stop thinking on your feet.Portal 2 for the PS3 also offers a two-player co-op mode that takes our problem-solving skills to a new level:  instead of a competitive race to the end, it's all about teaming up, working together to get to the exit.  A perfect example of this is that there is one puzzle in which both of you need to reach the goal, and you will only be able too stop your hurtling momentum if each of you times things just right and crashes into the other...causing both of you to drop down exactly where you need to be.Portal 2 for the PS3 comes with an added bonus:  it supports Valve's \"Steam\" system.  While controversial to PC Gamers, Steam is designed for the PS3 to be a point to track your savegames and trophies and upload screenshots.  The bonus comes in when you use an existing Steam account or create a new one:  tying Portal 2 into Steam will unlock a copy of the PC & Mac versions that you can play on any computer.If you enjoy thinking on your feet, don't mind the first-person interface, and want something different from a shooter game, Portal 2 will fill your needs perfectly.  It is clever, it is funny, and it is paced just right to keep the frustration low and the fun factor high.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMB3","description":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timemay be the greatest single-player video game ever created in any genre. It's that good. Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide. WithThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Nintendo has come up with an all-consuming adventure title that will provide days of engrossing gameplay.--Eric FredricksonPros:Best single-player video gameFreedom to explore a rich, complex worldHelpful fairy guide gives hintsCharming, humorous, lighthearted, yet challengingCons:Some puzzles can be frustratingOnly one saved game per player--don't save when you're stuck!Much more fun with Rumble Pack","reviewerName":"Robert Evans \"Robert\"","summary":"The greatest game of all time","reviewText":"Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is a classic.  It should be played by every Nintendo fan and fans who are not big on Nintendo.  The Zelda series is infact a big popular series but this one defys all of them.  Ocarina of Time is a stand alone Zelda classic.  It is not only the best Zelda game but it is possibly the greatest game ever created on a console.  The story line is oh so brilliant and the graphics(even for todays standard) are unbelievable.  Anyone who owns a Nintendo 64 needs this game.  This game is pretty old and pretty cheap(I lost my game so I baught one for 5 bucks at Gamestop)so it won't be hard to find.  This game infact shows what the Nintendo 64 is capable of.  The game is very well made as you play through a huge world...well not that huge..  And I will say this..(I may be exagerating this though) But the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time has one of the best \"boss battle finale\" ending ever..Ubelievable..Graphics in this game a superb.  There were parts in the game were I would just stand there and stare at the ocean, houses anything cause it looked so beautiful.  I loved how they created the bosses especially the last one and it was amazing how realistic they made the horse look.  Nintendo scores big with the graphics.  The gameplay is magneficent.  I loved how it was all made and done.  I really can't get into this one, you'll just have to play this part for yourself....The sound is..My god...It's beautiful I even downloaded all the songs.  I loved the song were your in the temple and you get the Mastersword cause they made that song really well.  The music in the farm were Epona is was made extreamly well and was just BRILLIANT!  As I've stated the story in this game is just plain good, though it obviously has the \"save\" themed plot as you all know and I won't really get into the plot since there is already like 500 reviews saying what the plot is about..Sure the game is old and outdated, I guess..But so what..The game is still one of the greatest games of all time.  I'll put it in simple words for you, the game is flawless!  The game has an amazing plot that will suck you in, the gameplay is fun and classic(as well as riding Epona the horse)and music is just plain beautiful, the enviroments and atmosphere of the game as just as incredible as the game itself is and as I stated before...Ocarina of Time is simply the greatest video game ever made(and if it's not possible then it has hands down the best video game ever made, no the best video game OF ALL TIME)....Get this game you will not regret it!5 out of 5!!!!(if I could I would give it 100000 out of 5)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2004"}

I have to say I am not disappointed.******************************Pros**************************************- High Definition Screen and Graphics: This is the greatest strength of PS Vita. I love the high resolution graphics on Vita. Sometimes they are indistinguishable from PS3 games. Can&#8217;t describe in words how nice games such as Killzone and Wipeout look on PS Vita. It is unbelievable that a handheld can have such graphics.- Controls : Gotta love dual analog stick. Sony took a while but finally brought it on the handheld. Bravo.-Touchscreen: I really like the interactive touch screen menus. It makes navigation a lot more intuitive then going up and down the list using analog or side buttons. Also in many games they make the gameplay more interactive.- Quality of games: This is one of the main reasons I had to buy it now. With Killzone, Persona4Golden, Uncharted, Sly, Soul Sacrifice, Resistance, Walking Dead and PS3 ports (FFX/X2 HD, Injustice, Ratchet) there are enough games to last me for years.-PS4 Remote play feature: While I don&#8217;t have a PS4 (yet), I tried it on my friend&#8217;s PS4 and it works great. Definitely a very useful feature.-PSP Titles playability: I haven&#8217;t tried this either but I read that you can download PSP titles on PS Vita. I am happy I purchased some PSP games digitally. Hopefully I will be able to play them on Vita-Recent Price drop: Definitely helps.-The Holiday bundle: 4 free games and 3 of them being hit titles. Why not?******************************Cons**************************************-Memory Cards: In the era when you can download full games, Sony should provide big memory cards at cheaper price or at least give option to buy memory cards from other companies.******************************Conclusion**************************************I didn&#8217;t buy Vita so far because I felt that it may not survive competition against 3DS and to be honest it is still doing bad compared to 3DS.

Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game.

I'm an older gamer and love and miss the 8 bit retro games I grew up with. I bought this game primarily for this reason. I initially plugged in my classic controller and thought to myself, another Wii hardcore game wannabe piece of garbage. 5 minutes later I used the Wiimote and nun-chuck and finally saw why all the gaming sites gave this game a 9 out of 10. I quickly learned how to power-up my katana by quickly shaking the wiimote holding down the 1 button, and loved the thrill. I also didn't have any problems with the camera, as I just pressed Z to lock onto enemies. The game is totally awesome if you play with this configuration, otherwise it really isn't so much fun in my opinion.The minigames were hard to control, but so were the games I used to play when I played the Atari 2600 or NES. It had a nostalgic feel to it. I had a little trouble controlling the Pipe Mania clone, but once I figured the controls out, it was okay. The minigames were a lot of fun, and at the now low price (under thirty dollars), a lot of people should consider it to even just to play these mini-games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2010"}

If you die in a Capcom game, it's generally not the fault of the game, but the fault of the gamer. Their games, such as Onimusha and Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts, require you to get improve your skills in order to succeed. Unfortunately, that's not the case in Devil May Cry. A majority of the time, the game is at fault for your death. Poor camera angles are at fault most of the time. You'll find yourself fighting a lot of enemies who are not onscreen, and many times they get a free hit or two on you because you don't see them coming. Yes, enemies do make a noise to signal an attack, but that's hardly helpful when you're concentrating on those enemies that you can see. This is worse when fighting some of the bosses, such as Griffon and Nightmare. There will be times when you are blasting away at them while they are off screen. Shooting at the edges of the screen is not as fun as shooting actual enemies that you can see.There is a point of frustration in which a game can get away with, but once in a while a game will break that barrier. The point of video games is to have fun, not to stress you out. Devil May Cry is more stressful than it is fun. Though most levels are only ten minutes long, you will die so often they take much longer than that to complete. And along with poor camera angles, another reason you will likely die so often is the speed the game plays at. Things happen so quickly in Dante's world that it would seem Capcom made this game for people with short attention spans. To focus on one enemy for more than a second means you will likely lose your health to another attacker, but to take your eye off the one enemy means you might miss a surprise dodge and attack. I wish Capcom at least allowed blocking, as it would be far more convenient than trying to jump every enemy attack. However, that would slow the game down. This is a pure action game. Strategy is not required, or welcome. This is a game meant for somebody young, with quick reflexes, and an attention span trained on Saturday morning action cartoons. If you do not have those qualities, I would not recommend this game.Not everything is bad in Devil May Cry. For one, the graphics are very nice. The character animation is so brilliant, I was almost convinced that I was fighting real demons. It's a game that screenshots do not justify. You have to see it in motion to realize just how good it looks. Also, the controls are very well done. Capcom expertly creates a control layout that allows you to fluidly shift from firing a stream of bullets to leaping in the air and slashing an enemy with a sword. I just wish the game was more fun and less frustrating because it has so many excellent ideas. I am willing to admit that the game probably just wasn't made for me. I'm more casual gamer than hardcore, and this is the type of game hardcore gamers relish. It provides a very difficult challenge and requires lots of time and practice be put into it. As a gamer who finds that age has slowly taken a hit on his response times, I find it difficult to recommend the game to people who aren't highly skilled in gaming, or whose skills have dulled. If you want to enjoy a game, there are plenty better games to choose from.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2013"}

I still stand by my initial assessment that the A.I is horrible and predictable like before. The graphics are very much improved though thanks to the excellent Q3 engine used this time. I did find the game to be a bit more buggy than I have been accustomed to seeing from the Q3 engine in other games that utilized it as well.  I got frustrated on several levels of the game that required stealth. You don't have any silent weapons that I have seen except the knife and a pistol with a silencer on it. The problem I have run into though is that any little action or movement you do sets off the alarms even if the soldiers don't know you're there so it makes it near impossible to complete these levels. The first time I played the game it took me 20-30 times each to finally finish the stealth oriented levels. It just boils down to poor organization in parts of the game. Overall though it was a great game. It has a great plot and an engrossing storyline. That combined with the great graphics made it an excellent game to play.

A lot of the newer (Shaun White, Amped) games are a little more polished (and damn, they should be, they are on next-gen systems!) but frankly, not a whole lot more than this game was on the PS2.Graphically, its strong.  While not photorealistic, the imagery serves the purpose, representing the over-the-top world that the Mountain is. The frame rate is fast, and you are moving down the mountain at blistering pace.  The controls are easy to master, but challenging enough that pulling off that multi-combo trick is still a feat. The world is large enough that exploring it all takes quite a while, and the individual parts (terrain parks, pipes, avalanche-prone backcountry) keep it interesting and varied.  The weather changes, the atomosphere creates a sense of fun or urgency, and the cities built on the slopes are cool, cool, cool.Lastly, the music still ranks, in my mind, as the best overall soundtrack in a videogame.  Indie music, rare remixes, and multi-genre tracks make this game as cool and outsider as the sport itself used to be.This is a rare game that I think trumps most releases I can think of in the past decade in terms of overall playability and repeat play value.

{"product_name":"B000UH5C5Q","reviewerName":"TRFB","summary":"Fun game, but for a short while...","reviewText":"It was difficult to review this product only because the controllers, or the game, not sure which, malfunctioned.  The game itself, when I was able to play it, was very enjoyable.  The levels are fun and there are enough of them to keep you coming back to play.  I tried it with my 7 and 4 year old kids.  Sure, they got mad at each other because you get to throw bananas, knock your opponent out, and so forth.  But, they wanted to play again.  So, it was a big hit at our house.  Unfortunately, the kids wanted to play again and so we hooked up the contoller to the USB port and that's when the controllers no longer worked.  They began choosing options on their own and it went into a big \"loop\" where the same buttons where being chosen and so you couldn't start the game.  And since the controllers were all linked on one \"hub\" you couldn't unplug it to troubleshoot which controller was bad.I e-mailed Amazon to see about getting another controller so that I can write a fair review, but they haven't gotten back to me.  But, it is the holidays and so, I forgive them for that.  They are usually very attentive.  Especially being a Vine member.I gave the game a 3 star rating.  The game itself deserves a 4.  But the controllers themselves, don't seem to be working so to me that's a very big part of the game.  I give it a 2.  So, I met in the middle of the two ratings.Now, if my paddles worked with no problem, then I'd give the game 4 stars, only because with this type of game, it requires paddles and you are at their mercy.This game itself deals around monkeys in the jungle.  Problem with this is that it can get kinda old seeing monkeys on every level.  It would've been better to change from monkey's, to hippos, to other animals for some variation.  The games themselves are pretty easy to start and get acquainted with.  Simply press the correct color or buzzer on your controller.  This is a good concept, and they should develop more games that use this method of play.  This would be good for \"Jeopardy\" type games.The paddles themselves look rugged, but as you can see from above, mine stopped working after only 3 times of playing.  And it wasn't very long either.I also judge a game on whether or not, I need instructions to learn how to play.  But, with this game, I didn't even look at the instructions once.  I was able to start the game and play with no problem.  So, the controls and game play are intuitive.You may need to explain to the younger kids though.To sum up this review, I recommend this game for you and your family for some good, clean, Playstation 2 enjoyment.  But, keep in mind the paddles are a key component.  No paddles, no game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2007"}

As these survivors' allies mysteriously fall victim to dementia, it becomes clear that protecting a young girl granting them a bizarre immunity may be their only hope for survival in a struggle that could have implications for all of humanity.GameplayAlthough designed to preserve the feel of the action of the original game, gameplay inExtractionis also quite unique. First, the player perspective has been changed from third, to first-person, placing all the action right in front of you. Also,Extractionis a 'rail shooter,' meaning a shooter game where most of the action engaged in and paths followed are programmed into the mission play, instead of the freeform wandering ability built into the considerably larger Next-Gen and PCDead Spacerelease. The combination of these two changes funnels the players focus onto the combat options available in the game. In dealing with the danger of the alien Necromorphs swarming the game space,Dead Space Extractionutilizes the precision of the Wii Remote in variety of ways. Weapons like the Plasma Cutter can dispatch these enemies from a distance by taking advantage of the remote's pointing targeting ability, while a quick wave can activate weapons like the Ripper, a guidable spinning saw blade. The Wii Remote is also handy for picking up items and hurling them at enemies using the power of Kinesis.Other gameplay changes include new play modes. The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn't become too easy. In addition,Extractionalso features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed. Taken together all these changes add up to more action, more fun and moreDead Spacefor players on the Wii.Key Game FeaturesAn All-New Prequel Exclusively for the WiiFollow the lives of several different Aegis VII colony members as they carve a bloody path to survival.Meet a new cast of characters, destroy fearsome new enemies, and wield brutal new weapons.Real TerrorStunning graphics, panic-inducing audio, and a frenetic first-person perspective thrust you headlong into the terror.Play through an engrossing, interactive horror movie experience that raises the bar for storytelling in video games.Intuitive ControlsStrategically dismember your enemies with pinpoint control using the Wii Remote.Wield a powerful arsenal of abilities and weapons to freeze enemies, manipulate gravity with telekinesis, solve puzzles, and fight off attacks from every direction in zero gravity.Co-Op GameplayTeam up with a friend to fight off the invasion on the USG Ishimura with jump-in cooperative play.Combine efforts on engineering puzzles or determine specific roles to create a unique experience with each play session.","reviewerName":"Nerrel","summary":"phenomenal shooter","reviewText":"like 90% of wii owners, i passed on this game the moment i heard it was a rail shooter. no matter how good it may be, $50 is just too much to spend on a halfhearted cash-in that will last you for 6 hours of repetitive blasting, right? well, like 90% of wii owners, i was wrong.the first thing that needs to be known is that this is not a conventional rail shooter like house of the dead the resident evil chronicles, but more of a genre defying shooter like sin and punishment. the gameplay features unique twists that deepen the strategy beyond just shooting everything that moves, giving you an arsenal of mostly impractical weapons and enemies that can't be killed with straightforward shots; you'll have to target an enemy's narrow, flailing limbs in order to take them out, which becomes a tense challenge when the screen is full of charging monsters. luckily, your controls are up to the task with a wiimote scheme that matches metroid corruption and resident evil 4 in demonstrating the obvious superiority of IR aiming.the game makes heavy use of story and exploits the on rails gameplay to set up cutscenes that wouldn't work in-game otherwise, controlling the camera so that all the sights eurocom want you to see effortlessly unfold before your eyes. the camera pans so naturally during gameplay that you often forget the game is on rails at all, feeling comfortably under your control without any player input needed. the production values are amazing, with far above average acting, great art direction, stunning graphics, and an orchestrated score that easily bests the ones heard in most actual films. from the first few minutes alone, it's clear that extraction isn't another halfhearted attempt to capture the wii audience without making a full game; it's something special all on it's own, and in my opinion ranks beyond metal gear in pulling off convincingly cinematic gameplay.the game's 10 chapters will take you through a gruesome and compelling story that clocks in around 7 to 8 hours total; if that doesn't sound like much, it's important to stress that it's quality and not quantity that matters most and extraction packs enough into those few hours to satisfy once the game is done. outside of the story, there's a challenge mode that places you in one of 10 different locales from the game against hordes of necromorphs to try for a high score, although shooting waves of the same enemies gets a little redundant early on.there are a few incentives to replay the single player missions such as finding missed upgrades or data files, but the main replay value is the great gameplay itself, which will more than likely pull you in more than once. my only complaint is that due to the real time nature of all the cinema scenes, none of them can be skipped the second time through, but when they're this well done it could be worse.extraction is one of the few examples of an effort on the part of a 3rd party developer to make something truly great on the wii, and at it's current price there's no excuse for any wii owner to pass it up anymore. not only do eurocom deserve the sale, but you owe it to yourself as a wii owner to play one of the very best the system has to offer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2010"}

The apparent marriage of Disney fun to a RPG scenario was a marriage made in heaven and left gamers clamoring for a sequel to KH thanks to the ending.Well, Square Enix has given gamers a little teaser of the future of KH2 with the release of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, but this game is being made exclusively for the Game Boy Advance portable system.  KH:COM is a \"bridging\" game, meaning that it takes place virtually after the end of KH1 and sets events in motion for KH2, which should be out HOPEFULLY this year.Sora, the Keyblade-wielding hero of KH1, has returned to his world after virtually saving 2 worlds from utter destruction by the Heartless that threatened his world and the Disney world.  Donald and Goofy have also returned with him, but Sora feels as if something is missing since the others that help him in the final battle did not return with him.  A mysterious stranger appears and tells Sora that he can regain what he wants but in return he must be willing to lose something valuable and warns that when he returns from the adventure he may not be himself.Sora, Donald and Goofy later finds themselves in a place called Castle Oblivion which somehow replicates the worlds and people that Sora visited in KH1 and so the quest begins to regain what he wants, unaware of the loss that is soon to come in return.The graphics of KH:COM are stunning for a GBA game, especially the opening cutscene movie.  Also, the play system is a real-time card system where you use cards to attack and execute special abilities like healing and freezing enemies.  You'll run into more than 100 different Disney characters and build Sora to prepare hime for the final battle to take down the Castle and prepare for the future (KH2)All in all, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories could be considered KH 1.5 but this game is definitely a great taste of what is to come in KH2...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2005"}

I started by getting the original Dragon Age: Origins preowned, and within a week, I knew that I would be purchasing this copy. It simply offers too much downloadable content and expansions at too great a value to pass up. I will rate the game as a whole, for those of you who don't know about Dragon Age.Graphics: I have often heard people speak ill of the graphics of Dragon Age. I suppose the graphics are only slightly better than that of Xbox 360 games that came out on release day, but definitely not as poor as PS2 graphics that some people claim it sports.Considering what they have done with the game, I can't say I would complain about the graphics. Every single piece of armor shows on every character on every cut scene. Cut scenes change based on what you have done and who is in your party, and every dialogue piece changes depending on who is in your party. It is remarkable to see little details such as what boots a character is wearing showing accurately in every scene. I consider this to be an impressive game. And it may not be FF 13 graphics, but it does some far more impressive things than FF13 ever attempted.Glitches: Yes the game consists of glitches, are any of them game breaking? I haven't run into any as I had with Fallout 3. The glitches are sometimes audio fails to properly trigger, some characters outfits or beards tend to fall into each other, there was one scene where my character performed the killing blow on thin air because the monster had already fallen, so glitches exist, and they can be distracting. Once again, I point to the shear magnitude that this game accomplishes, and can forgive that some dialogue doesn't match up right, or a codex is inaccurate, given how much the game possesses. Compared to shorter games like Gears of War, Halo, and Darksiders, the game has considerably more glitches, and you will run across them. However, other than being minor inconveniences, I haven't experienced anything. Just follow the rule of save frequently, especially since the games autosave feature isn't quite as frequent as you would probably prefer.Environment: This might be some of the reason people hit so badly on the graphics. The environments are pretty bland. You aren't going to see very much in the ways of surreal, artistic, landscape. Once in a while you might see something pretty cool, like in the deeproads, but for the most part, I have found the landscape to be relatively bland.Appropriateness: Most people are curious about the content. A lot of games are labeled M for mature, but that can go in a lot of directions. In general, there is no swearing in the game, the characters rather using the softer words like \"Sodding\" when they swear. With regards to nudity, there are various enemies that will be fairly bare. Desire Demons typically where nothing but a loin cloth and some \"nipple covers\". A certain monster shows more boobs, but there was nothing sexual about a broodmother. You can have sex in the game, but it is done fairly tactfully, and every character wears underwear, the loose, unexposing kind. Homosexuality, threesomes, foursomes, and more stuff can occur in this game as well. With regard to violence, the game revels in how it shows blood. Your characters will become covered in blood after fights, and certain items have the unique ability to be \"messy\" and have more blood. Enemies will have pools of blood around them too, and will quickly decay into skeletons after a kill. So violence is a yes, although you can't just attack and kill anyone like in oblivion... in this game you would have to challenge and threaten to get into fights, and even then it doesn't always work. So yes, a violent, sexual game with surprisingly decent language. The environments are typically OK, I didn't see too many scary environments or inappropriateness like in Fallout 3. In one or two areas, you might see a few people hanged from hooks, but nothing like Fallout 3 does. There was one area that freaked me out and was scary, but that was the only area in the game I found to be that way.Difficulty: I found the game to be pretty easy, but I suppose that depends on your experience with RPGs in general. I play on normal mode and might crank it up for my second playthrough. There were some challenges, but the more I play and get used to the controls, the easier it gets.Variety: The game offers a fair variety of gameplay. Most of the time, it is simply clicking A to kill all your enemies, but there are plenty of ways to shake things up. If you are a mage, you will need to balance and run through your spells constantly. You can lure enemies into carefully constructed traps if you would like, causing them to fail miserably as they charge you. A boss or two require unique strategies to kill. So if you want to just hit A until it is dead, you can, or you can use your abilities strategically, the choice is yours.Other characters:You have the ability to fully control any member of your party, so don't think you are going to be helpless like in some other games. You can create fairly complex AI controls so that your ally acts exactly how you want him to. Learning to set these up properly is essential to the game. The redial menu is your friend, and while I originally tried to get away without it, I eventual realized it is a necessary part of the game. You will quickly learn that you can't learn everything, so you are going to have to give some of the slack to your allies. One of them will need to learn herbalism/trapmaking/lockpicking ect... you can't depend on the warden to master them all, making teamwork in your party essential, something I have not felt in any game for a while.Improvements: My only two improvements that I think would have added greatly with the game is 1) allowing a second player to take control of one of the allies, which would have been remarkably easy to set up and 2) Perhaps a few less glitches would have been nice.Overall: Other than that, I found this game to be the best game I have played in some time. It is fun, giving you an open game feel without the \"I have no idea where to go, what to do\" feel oblivion sometimes gave. Most of your paths are linear, and I can't say I felt like I missed too much without a strategy guide, but it still gives you options and multiple paths in any given dungeon/city. The additions were all great, and I enjoy awakening just as much. The addons are definitely fun and worth adding on, although I don't expect many of them are worth it to buy individually, they are a great deal within this edition.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2010"}

Here almost every enemy use forces shields, force sticks and many rare things.- My system crash one time when I was fighting against some troopers that suddenly appears and disappears.I don't like to make a critic to the developers because it seems that the do many things good but other things have changed but not to make improvements. This kind of games must remember that many fans associates assault troopers with the future army so fire arms, cannons and machine guns are very important.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

That game was (and still is) the bomb. And now, 11 years later we get Doom 3. After reading reviews and seeing screenshots I was convinced that I had to get my copy on its release day.Well now that I have it and I have played it, all I can say is wow. The graphics are stunning and smooth (around 60 fps, 54 with explosions and such) on my P4 2.8 (OC to 3.3) and my 6800 GT. This game does not run very smoothly however on my dual Athlon MP 1.9 with a Ti-4600, so it is obviously not going to run smooth on older graphics cards.The sound is just intense. The sound is what makes the game and sets the mood. I was originally skeptical when I found out that the single player mode maps would be played without background music. I thought, &quot;how cool could that be?!&quot; But it is intense. I must say that this game is the only one that has successfully scared me $!%&less.; A combination of the sound, graphics, and the eerie, dark levels sets a perfect tone.This game brought back to me the memories of playing the original Doom. The only difference here is that the graphics are so much better, as is the sound, and they actually give you a storyline. That's right! They finally give you background information into the time and place of Doom!!!In general, this game is absolutely incredible. If you haven't upgraded to a next-generation video card yet, this game WILL convince you that NOW is the time!

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"Nate Great \"Nathan\"","summary":"Quite honestly the best game to exist","reviewText":"How can anybody not like this game? It's amazing, it's fantastic, it's beautiful. I can't wait for Brawl to come out. Anyway, back to the game.Graphics: 10/10The graphics have increasingly improved tremendously from the original Smash Bros. Instead of bright blue overalls on Mario, it's dark blue overalls, and you can see the strings on the overalls. I think the most improved is Fox.Sound: 10/10It's fun to listen to, very catchy as well. I love the theme song. All the songs from each world fits perfectly.Characters: 10/10There's no good or bad character. Some people might say Jigglypuff is the worst, but what about her down B attack, that's like the home run bat. It's like each character's movements and are naturally different and their personallties are all different too. Some characters are like blobs such as Kirby or Mr. Game and Watch, but some characters are highly detailed, such as Link or Ganondorf.Stages: 9.5/10I loved most of the stages in this game, but alot of them were the same thing except with a samll twist to it. Battlefield and Foutain of Dreams are pretty much identical, but I do like all the new stages. Their all incredibly filled with action.Controls: 10/10They work instintly, and the basic controls take no time to learn. Once you start to learn the really hard moves, like catching items in the air, the advanced moves are, well, advanced.Single Player:I'm just going to write short summaries on the single player.Classic: 4/10It's the fun the first time, you'll fall asleep the second time playing it. There's absoulutly no replay value in it.Adventure: 4/10Once again, it's the first time, you'll be bored the death the next time. I wish all the characters had to like 3 missions, but the missions were different for every character. For example, Mario had to go through Bowser's castle to rescue Peach, or a mission something like that.All Star: 6/10It's better then Classic and Adventure, but not by much. There's more replay value, but it really dies down quickly. You play all 25 characters, and that's it.Event Matches: 6/10There's a good amount of replay value in these event matches. But I do warn you, once you get to Event 30 and up, they are downright impossible. The fun is still there though. I like having to do certain missions, but then again, it just dosn't keep it's value, that's what happens with all the single player modes, and that's sad.Home Run Contest: 6/10Very Challenging to get a high score. You can unlock trophies and a stage, but after that, there's not much worth of playing it again. It's very hard to get over 700 feet, for any character. I had to go online to unlock the stage and the trophy.Target Test: 8/10This is just my opinion, but I say there's lots of replay value in the target test. Some are easy, some are hard. When I mean hard, I mean \"have to go on internet to find how to do it\" hard.Multi Man Meele: 7/10There's 3 minute Meele, 15 minute, Endless, about 6 to 7 types of this, but even bringing it all together, it only equals in even 7. With 100 Man Meele, you can unlock Falco, and for 15 Minute, you unlock a stage. After you do that, there's no point coming back to it.Training: 0/10They try to incourage replay by trying to get you do the most, COMBOS!?!?!? They cheated through Training, it's boring as it is, and it really dosn't help you throughout the Meele matches at all.Trophies: 7/10Their cool. There's lots of them. What I like the most about the trophies, is reading the info about the trohies. Sure their 3-D and detailed and stuff, but they don't move or anything, so there's not much of a point collecting the trophies either.Multiplayer:The best part about this game, the multiplayer.Meele: 10/10Who couldn't rate this a high score, it's the best part of the game. Lots and lots of replay value. I don't find computer players very fun in most games, but in this one, it's just like your friend, almost! It's hard to describe. Their's Timed, Stock, Coin Mode, where you try to collect the most coins in a time limit by hitting the player, and bonus mode, where you go for the highest score.Tournament Meele: 10/10I love Tornument Meele! There's so many options you can pick from, you can even play 64 people for crissakes!( even though you probulay wouldn't want to watch every single match if you do the 64 option) It's really fun and it's value is always there, no matter what.Special Meele:I'm not going to write about the special Meele's, I'm just going to give them ratings so you guys don't have to read so much.Camera: 7/10Stanima: 10/10Sudden Death: 7/10Giant: 8/10Tiny: 7/10Invisible: 3/10 (trust me, not seeing is not what you call fun)Fixed Camera: 5/10Single Button: 5.5/10Slo-Mo: 9/10Ligthing-Mo: 8/10It's very neat to have all these special playing options, even if a few of them are not fun at all (Invisible, Single Button). But I'll admit that this was a very innovative idea, or different.Unlockables: 9.5/10Lots, and lots of it. You might think unlocking every character and stage, and beating all 51 event matches is beating the game. You are wrong, you need to collect 249 trophies still! There's plenty to unlock this game and that keeps me playing it.Other Stuff: 9/10There's not much else to write about, but you can write your name. But only four letters.Overall:10/10There's no point in renting this game, just please buy the thing. Wondering why the game is still $30.00? Buy the game to find out, if you have it, good. And that's my review, on one of the most funest games ever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2005"}

Jury \"dsunglasses\"","summary":"Not Bad / Falls a Little Short","reviewText":"A solid effort that fails to deliver in a few areas. If you are a fan of mafia related things or 1940's & 50's era history, especially cars, you may find this game more appealing then I did. You will spend most of the game driving from point A to point B, and the rest in shootouts. Intermixed between those are animated scenes, which are the highlight of the game. Both graphics and voice acting are good. The story wanders a bit, but ranges from decent to good and is far better and more coherent then anything you will find in a Grand Theft Auto game.However the games does have flaws, especially when compared to GTA games. You cannot keep playing after you beat the game, and there are no side or miscellaneous missions to go on. The game pretty much forces you to focus on completing the main storyline of the game. However you can get around that by simply putting off doing the next step in your mission, and going to do whatever you want. Similarly after you beat the game if you want to play more, just load a chapter and drive around doing what you want. The problem is, there isn't really anything to do. You can rob stores and steal cars, and drive around aimlessly and crazily, but at least for me, this get boring pretty quickly.There are a few things you can do a little differently on some missions, but otherwise there will be no real variety between playthroughs.You can also collect things like wanted posters and nude playmate pictures for some reason. The playmate pictures have nothing to do with the game and seem like a sleazy add on, but I'm not really complaining. I will point out for the curious that the game features at least one character \"reading\" a playboy magazine and numerous playmate pics scattered around the game, however playboy wasn't actually founded until 1953 at least a couple years after the game ends.Beyond that there is already some DLC content available to buy, that may add a few more hours of game play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2010"}

I got turned onto the PS3 because of my good friend Steve plus he also turned me onto Uncharted. I played the first one and I was in shock. it was such a long time since I played a game that grabbed me and held me into it until it was over. Plus trying to find the treasures added to the fun. When I heard that Uncharted 2 was coming out I personally thought it was going to be impossible to overcome what had already been done. Well let me tell you I was wrong. In a big big way. This game is an amazing game. I have played my share of video games but this one is high up there. The gameplay is fantastic there is little to no change from the first game which is a good thing for a gamer. The graphics rival a blu-ray movie and I am being honest. The cut scenes look fantastic even the gameplay graphics look fantastic. The storyline grabs you and won't let you go until you have finished the game this is how good this game is. I highly recommend this game to anyone that has a PS3 even if this is a game that you're not to sure about it is worth the money. This is my first time writing a review so I hope I got my point across and this drives you to buy the game. This is a fantastic game and worth the money. I highly recommend it.

But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros.

Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros.

This is one of those times I shouldn't have trusted the 5 star reviews on here, most of the time they are spot on. Dragon Age Origins has got to be one of the slopiest slop fests I've played on PS3. First thing I noticed after popping it in was the PS2 graphics, I thought I was playing PS3, my bad. Then there's the gameplay, oh the horror. If you couldn't stand FF13 being linear then this is the ultimate claustrophobic RPG out there. Start at point A, then run down a tight path to point B. Then 20 minute cut scene. How can people actually enjoy this? To me it's just torture. Also the game installed itself for 10 minutes upon inserting it into the console, then has the decency to lag like crazy during gameplay. Not only do character animations lag, but the camera has a weird hickup when moving. Why in the world this got past the QA testers at EA is beyond me, you would need to close your eyes or pretend it's not there honestly. My final verdict for Dragon Age would be 3.5/10 and that's being generous, because I'll admit there are some real top notch voice actors in this game. Also the music is pretty decent.

{"product_name":"PlayStation 3 40GB System","summary":"Just a Great Gaming System","reviewText":"For me, there is no better gaming system than this. I got the spider man 3 edition of this. My main purpose for this was to get a Blu Ray player.  Looking at the other choices out there for blu-ray players, this is a no brainer.  you get a top notch gaming system with the latest games (such as guitar hero III and Rock Band) along with a computer to browse the net via wi-fi, and the all important Blu Ray.  The added bonus is to update the firmware, you just connect via wi-fi and download it, keeping your blu ray up to date.  My other alternative was the x-box 360, which i really like the game selection and set up, but they had went with HD DVD which is a dead format, so I bought hd player dirt cheap separately, and let the x-box idea go.  If you want a gaming system that is currently cutting edge, and an excellent blu ray player, than look no further, great value. fyi-only the older 60gb systems and a few of the older 80gb systems paly playstation 2 games, otherwise, PS1 games work fine.  Currently there is really no advantage between the 40gb and 80gb systems.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2008"}

Its a gorgeous looking game by the developer of Rez. It uses amazing visuals and great music to tell a stor of saving a project from a virus attack. You sway your hands around to shoot. Its a rhythm action game that makes music on objects you shoot at and destroy by using your hands to aim and shoot. Its one of the most artistic looking games I have ever seen.The game consists of 5 unique levels with their own visual style. Their styles can range from a futurastic look with robotic like elements to one with sea life to another with flowers and such. They all give the feeling of peace as you play. Its a very stress free game even but at the same time can get intense at moments. It can feel stress free because the music often feels like that and the enviroment your playing in looks like such.The game can be really challenging but I never felt frustrated making faster progress and the levels are fun to playthough over and over again. This game is very different so it might be too different from the norm of what people enjoy. I think it has fun gameplay, incredible music and visuals, and its very creative.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2011"}

Over time, you'll do battle on the front lines of both sides as this shift reveals high-stakes arms threats and a terrifying glimpse of the future.HAWX: The Elite, High Altitude Warfare eXperimental SquadronYou'll begin the game as former U.S. Air Force Pilot David Crinshaw, assigned to provide air support for the well-known Ghost Recon team. You and your fellow HAWX pilots are some of the most highly-trained specialists in the world. Based out of Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, you're tasked with everything from testing secret and experimental aircraft weapon systems to carrying out combat and recon missions, training other top pilots, and attempting to capture enemy technologies.With the rise of the PMCs, your unique skills in higher demand than ever before. And with 49 playable planes available in game, plus additional planes available to some pilots through pre-order bonuses or VIP memberships, there's no shortage of sleek, fast, deadly aircraft at your disposal as you put your skills to use.An Iconic, Enhanced Reality System to Help You Deliver ResultsWhen you're in the midst of a firefight, E.R.S. in-game technology can help anyone survive, if you know how to take advantage of it. Featuring incoming missile detection, an anti-crash system, damage assessment, a tactical map, and weapons trajectory control, E.R.S. even allows you to issue orders to your squadron and other units, much like the iconic Cross-Com system in other Tom Clancy games. When you're getting started, you can ease into the rigors of flight and gain confidence by using a special assistance mode that offers support through the E.R.S. This mode can be switched off at any time, deactivating safety features and allowing you to perform advanced maneuvers.Cutting-Edge Realism and Innovative Multi-Player ModesWhether you're in a classic F15 Fighting Falcon or a new-generation Gripen, the controls and flight graphics are designed to keep you on your toes.

This air combat title sees you take a different perspective during the Ghost Recon and End War time period as you are the air cover for the Ghost Recon team and also provide your air skills to defending American soil from a full blown military strike. The plot is quite silly and doesn't really make much sense when you look more into it, but that lack of plot is forgiven thanks to some brilliant game play especially when in the mode Assistance OFF, which allows you to go a bit crazy with your flying skills.The plot first starts off in the year 2014; you are a skilled former U.S. Air Force Pilot by the name of David Crenshaw who is now a part of an elite unit called H.A.W.X. (High Altitude Warfare eXperimental squadron) which provides fire support for the Ghost team on the ground in Mexico. Shortly after your first mission in Mexico the Air Force decides to put an end to the H.A.W.X. programme thus putting Crenshaw out of the job. His skills are immediately recognised, however, and he is recruited to the PMC Artemis who apply his skills to carrying out a number of missions protecting and attacking numerous bases and enemies. All goes a bit sour and Artemis and the U.S. government have a falling out over a conflict in Brazil (isn't that always the case?), which then leads to Artemis and its board members going a bit nuts and attacking the U.S. and you re-join the Air Force to defend your homeland.The plot is really basic and actually doesn't make a whole lot of sense as you have to question why the writers of the plot thought a PMC would under any real circumstances pledge a full scale military assault on its fellow countrymen. As far as I could tell it wasn't run by an evil James Bond-like master villain. H.A.W.X. is set in the sky and that's really where you should stay if you don't want to spoil the graphical beauty of the land which you can enjoy when you are quite high up. When you get closer to mother Earth I found myself noticing and cringing at the lack of detail on the ground which was quite disappointing considering the generation of gaming we are in. I wasn't expecting to see little people waving out their windows at me, but I expected more substance to the landscape as I got closer.The machines are detailed enough for you to look at them admiringly as you spin around and blow the hell out of the guy who's been following you and trying to get a missile lock. I mentioned the Assistance OFF mode and this is really when the game starts to shine and becomes the most fun. Instead of the usual cockpit or third person type view you may be familiar with from other games of the same genre, when turning Assistance OFF you take on the view of a kind of spectator as any devices within the machine that will ensure your safety whilst flying are switched off and you are given the freedom to spin, dive and flip your way through an army of enemies. This is usually the best way that I can find of losing the missiles when they have locked on and been fired at you without using your flares.The multiplayer is fairly basic with an online co-op mode in which you can engage in the campaign missions through online and can also take part in death match and team death match games. It's a fun game with some excellent game play but is let down by a glaringly ridiculous plot that fails to capture even a single iota of my interest. Some of the missions are a bit tough but easy to get the hang of and overall the game is a worthy addition to any game collection.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2009"}
{"product_name":"B005185SDA","description":"","reviewerName":"paper tiger \"Adriel August\"","summary":"Phenomenal Multiplayer. Single Player is Lacking Depth","reviewText":"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that StarHawk is a solid multiplayer game and has less of a focus on single player. Both aspects of the game are good, however the multiplayer is outstanding.I bought this game from GameStop, not Amazon, simply due to the extra features and bonuses in the Limited Edition which is only available at GameStop. I feel ashamed because I am a very faithful Amazon shopper, but for this release Amazon did not offer what I wanted and what I would have expected.First off the game takes up a good 2.5gigs, there's already a new update, and you need to have an online pass to play online, which is included. But keep in mind that if you buy it used you will need to purchase the online pass from SONY for $10.Below are my pros and cons. Though every game has it's cons, I can tell that Starhawk is an instant classic just after my first few hours of game play.PRO's:+ Amazing Multiplayer! Probably the best, most unique I have ever played. A lot of fun!+ The campaign story, style, and cut scenes remind me a lot of Infamous. Voice-acting is quite good.+ Simple easy to use menu system. There are many options for online play. Everything is so very well integrated.+ Graphics are quite good, very smooth and fast. Control and vehicle control are perfect in my opinion. They are tight and come very naturally.+ Soundtrack rocks. Very unique classic, yet modern style. Meshes well with the game.CON's:- A little more attention should have been paid to single player, however multiplayer shines so well I can forgive that.- You cannot play the entire single player campaign split-screen. Only multiplayer and co-op are available split screen, and a playstation Network account must be active for the second player.- Single player campaign is 4 hours long at the most and the A.I. seems a little dated at times.After my first few hours of playing I loved it, for the single player but most of all the multiplayer, which is intensely addicting. For those who didn't have the opportunity to play the beta, the style of Starhawk reminds me of a mixture of Halo, Infamous, and a 3rd person Borderland, but it also has a weird futuristic western style all its own. You can run on foot or use your power orbs to generate/spawn an array of land and air vehicles, walls, turrets, shields, or weapon bunkers. The more power you have the more vehicle and weapon choices you have, which is very helpful in multiplayer. It is a lot of fun and gives you different options of how to play. No, it is not a stealth game, however you can be a little sneaky at times. Or you can just fly your hawk in and destroy everything and everyone.I must highly suggest this game for all of you multiplayer gamers out there, as this is a must own. I would not recommend this simply for the single player campaign, while it is good, it is not $60 good, or even $40 good. I would hold out a few months until it goes on sale, or simply rent it as you can finish the campaign in a weekend. Multiplayer is where Starhawk shines and it is very much worth the cost.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000HGOHWO","reviewerName":"Steven Herring","summary":"A Great Tactical FPS.","reviewText":"This was one of the first titles I bought for the PS3. I had played some of the other Rainbow Six games, but I never really enjoyed them that much. Then this game came along and now I'm a lifetime fan of the series. This game added a cover system to the table, and wow that made a difference. The cover system has now been adopted by a lot of games since. It's smooth and it really helps the overall play of the title. There are awesome co op modes. You can play through the campaign with some buddies, or try some terrorist hunts. I love terrorist hunts. I would have liked a respawn feature, when you get killed by a spawning enemy. That was fixed in RSV 2. The graphics are pretty well done. They could've been crisper and had a little more detail, but they didn't distract from the amazing game play.Presentation- The menus are pretty standard, the music is where this title comes into its own. The music just has an epic quality I can't explain. There is an annoying feature though. When you're in the helicopter flying over the city and you have to wait to repel down. This does show some nice visuals of Vegas, but it gets annoying waiting to get into the action. 4/5Graphics- As I stated above the graphics are overall rather well done. They're not amazing by any standard, but they don't distract from the fun. 4/5Game play- The cover system has added a lot of fun to the series. Being able to take cover and switch cover smoothly is a big advancement. Also the AI themselves are pretty smart. They also have some of the funniest phrases in video game history. The terrorist hunts though sometimes frustrating are a lot of fun. 5/5Story- I played the campaign through co op, so I got none of the story. I refuse to rate this section.Lasting Appeal- This game will be fondly remembered for a long time. I love to this day to play terrorist hunts with my cousin. The online is also pretty smooth, with few glitches or issues. 5/5The Verdict- This was a great first installment in the Vegas franchise. It only got better in the second. The terrorist hunts were challenging and a lot of fun. The graphics and a few other problems hurt this title, but not enough to keep it from being a worthy title. Overall a great game and should be picked up at this low price.  4.5/5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2009"}

Alone, or with a friend, you could tackle giant rats, undead monsters, dark elves, and even a white dragon, as you uncovered a plot against the good city of Baldur's Gate. But the ending indicated there was more adventure to come. Fans were worried that the sequel wouldn't live up to original's promise when the original design team jumped ship to work on Sony'sChampions of Norrath: Realms of EverQuest. They need not have worried;Dark Alliance 2is a worthy successor, retaining the weapons, monsters, Dungeons and Dragons action and rules, sharp graphics, responsive controls, and high adventure of its predecessor.The plot is a bit darker this time, but you're given a wider range of character classes to help face the elevated threats. There's the mighty barbarian, a dwarf rogue, a cleric, the monk (a martial artist), and a necromancer. The quest is huge and there are character-class specific side quests you can embark on--an extra incentive to play again as a different character. The level design tends to be a little too maze-like, and there's lots of boring backtracking, but the annoying jumping puzzles from the first game are gone.The biggest problem withDark Alliance 2is that it doesn't measure up to the competition. It's a 2-player game, whileDungeons & Dragons Heroes(on the Xbox) andChampions of Norrath(on the PS2 and Xbox) allow four-player play. Then again if you plan to play solo, or with a single friend, that shouldn't keep you from coming to the city ofBaldur's Gate'said once again.--Andrew Bub","reviewerName":"Caraculiambro","summary":"not nearly as good as the first Dark Alliance","reviewText":"The first Dark Alliance had far better graphics and more interesting monsters.  Plus, while the story was corny and cliched, there still was a story.This has pretty much no story at all, the monsters are lame, the graphics are forgettable, the settings are dumb (or inappropriate for D&D;), and the gameplay monotonous.  The ending has you going through the very same Onyx Tower as in the first (although the story explains this well), and the final battle is largely identical to that in DA I.One oft-heard criticism of Dark Alliance I was that it was too short:  if you sat down in the morning with it, you could definitely get through the game in one day, by afternoon or early evening.  I think the gamemakers took that criticism to heart when they made this sequel:  no getting through this one in a day.  Unfortunately, that was accomplished not by adding more mazes and monsters but simply by having each level by interminably long and repetitive.  Bigger mazes are not necessarily better, especially if it's just the same ol' stuff over and over again.Whenever I get in the mood to play hack-and-slash, I always play through the first one.  Whenever I continue on to the second one, I always regret it.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000R39GPA","reviewerName":"Bearcat","summary":"Good story, decent game....star wars fans will enjoy it.","reviewText":"I think Star Wars fans will be pleased with this game.  It is much better than the typical junk Star Wars games that have been coming out for years so that's refreshing.  Not everyone will like this game but I think it's a pretty solid title if you can live with some minor annoyances.  I was playing this game last night and as my wife was watching she said, \"boy this is a boring game.\"  While it is a lot of this....\"run to next set of enemies, force push them, force throw things at them, use your lightsaber, run to next set of enemies, rinse, wash, repeat\".....I still found it quite fun.I really enjoy using the force powers, especially the one that allows you to pick things/people up and toss them around.  I just can't get enough of it and I find the force aspect a lot of fun.  Sure this game is probably average but throwing crates into tie fighters and blowing them up or picking up a storm trooper and throwing him into the abyss is just so much fun I could do it for hours.  So my summary is....Star Wars fans will like it a lot, non Star Wars fans should rent it first.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2008"}

As such, it is really not much more than an add on to the old game.  Graphics and gameplay have changed very little and storyline is mostly the same.  Really the only thing that makes this game a must buy for all RPG loving Gamecube owners is the fact that Skies of Arcadia is great.  Peroid.Following the basic guidelines set by the beloved Final Fantasy series, Skies of Arcadia starts with Vyse, a young Blue Rouge sky pirate.  Over the course of his adventures he will meet new people, gain new powers, and kill entire populations of random beasts.  What makes Skies so much more than a FF rip off is the setting, a world of floating continents and powerful flying warships.  Few games place the importance of exploring like Skies.  You will literally need to fly into every corner of the map if yu expect to win the game.Combat is a slight twist on the standard fare.  Both ship and personal combat revolves around the idea of placing in commands then letting the move play itself out.  Fastest charaters go first and slowest last.  Its fun and useful and if you want to go get a drink, the action can continue without you. Ship battles are only slightly different but even more fun to watch.The story in and of itself is a great one and will keep you well interested throughout.  Although Vyse is placed on a very set path, at any time a player can leave it and go off in search of battles and \"discoveries\" which can be found by searching the skys.  The new Wanted Battles also allow a bit more variety in movement and a new set of powerful foe.  Although the ending is not nearly so twisted as FFVII, it is plenty interesting.The only real problem with Skies is the high level of random encounters and their monotony.  Though lower than the Dreamcast title, you still only have about 15-20 seconds to fly around before you are attacked by another dozen enemies.  If you are trying to find discoveries or treasure chests, this can quickly become annoying.  Fortunetly the new \"moonfish\" quest will give you a way out of this fairly early, if you should want.Overall, this is the best RPG for the Gamecube to date.  This is not suprising because Skies was the best RPG on the Dreamcast to date(minus Grandia II).  If you like RPG's or even like a bit of flying around and exploring, I highly recommend this game for purchase.  Like it, Live it, Love it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2003"}
