They don't allow you to save yourself. They only do autosave. I hate games that do that!I read that this game is optimized to be installed on your Hard Drive. Normally, that's a good idea for any game, but this game in particular. It'll be about 20GB after installing all 3 discs (6.6GB each).I love this game cuz of several reasons. For the city being as big as it is, the graphics are very impressive! Also, it's a very challenging game, mainly cuz I don't think many people can pick up on facial expressions & other things that people do when they're lying.Before this game came out, I read that Rockstar has some cases that they couldn't put on the final game, so it'll be DLC. I see no reason why they wont put it out in like 2 weeks. It's already done. I'm just waiting. & I have plenty of space on my HD, so I'm ready!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2011"}

Takes the best qualities of the Harvest Moon series and adds more animals, more vegetables and more drama.","reviewerName":"sporkdude \"sporkdude\"","summary":"The Perfect Antidote to the Tired Video Game Re-treads.","reviewText":"This game is the anti-thesis of all those old, tired, formulaic video games out there.  I think most people are perfectly sick of going through the same type of level in first/third person, fight small aliens/monsters/demons along the level, and be frustrated with the major boss at the end of it.  We've all seen this a thousand times?  Where's the originality?  There is nothing more frustrating than investing so much time in a game just to stop because a particular puzzle/monster/boss is too hard or the AI is too cheap.  This game is the answer to those who feel this way.When I first got this game, I was a bit skeptical because it's a farming RPG.  How fun could that be?  Well, guess what, it is pretty fun.  You start off as a young man who was left a farm.  You're job is to feed yourself, know you neighbors, make money, marry someone, and raise a kid.  It sounds boring yes, but the enjoyment comes in learning how to accomplish everything.  You explore, make friends, experiment, etc.  There is no need to worry about dying or messing up.  All you have to do is live your life.In terms of friends and family, you meet certain individuals and try to make friends with them.  You also have your choice of three eligible bachelorettes to marry.  In the first year, you must pursue the particular girl you want by talking to them, giving them appropriate gifts, etc.  The next year, you have a kid.  During the later years, your kid will grow up and pursue a certain career, depending on your wife, friends and own actions.In terms of money, there are numerous ways to make a living.  You can milk cows, sell animals, plant crops, plant trees, sell vegetables, fruits, wool, eggs.  You can fish, produce seeds, butter, or other food products as well.  The possibilities are numerous.  In the beginning, you hardly have any information.  As time progresses and wealth improves, you can start doing more and more.There are a few bad parts to this game.  You live in one small town and after a few days, there is not much to explore any more.  The town could have been more lively, with more buildings and people.  The monotony is also apparent, especially while farming.  In Harvest Moon time, there are 40 days in a year, and each day takes about a half hour to complete.  Much of that time will be doing the same routine over and over again.  The worst example is watering the plants.  You need to water each sapling/tree/root individually, making it very, very dull at times.In the end though, it's a neat, relaxing video game that sure is a nice break from all the other crud produced out there.Pros:Exploring and learning is fun.No set-backs (backtracking, dying, etc.).No set way to do anything.Cons:The monotony is truly boring at some points.The town in quite small.Frustration Level: Low/MediumDifficulty Level: LowTime: 20 hours to play a year (8 years max)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2004"}

You can't remember anything at all, and nobody can see or feel you. It's as if you don't exist. Then, out of nowhere, a girl forcefully asks you to 'form a pact' with her so you won't get 'erased' by the 'noise.' Not knowing what the heck is going on, you just kind of go along with it, because you learn that you are dead... but you have been given the opportunity to earn a second chance at life.That's the premise of The World Ends With You (WEWY). Neku Sakuraba is thrown into the Reaper's Game, not knowing anything, and he needs to survive the game for seven days to get his life back. Aside from that I really don't want to spoil anything, because WEWY has one of the best stories you will ever find in a video game. It's deep, emotional, suspenseful, shocking, and very intriguing. The characters are surprisingly deep and likable as well, and are each packed with unique personality and become different people as the story progresses. There is a lot of swearing in the dialogue, though, which I really didn't enjoy putting up with. The story is actually the best thing about WEWY, and even if you don't like the rest of the game the story is interesting enough to keep you hooked all the way through.WEWY takes place in Shibuya, the bustling shopping district of Tokyo, Japan, unless I'm mistaken. Rather than involving swords and armor, WEWY uses power-granting pins and stat-increasing threads, giving it a modern theme uncommon in RPGs, let alone one from the creators of Final Fantasy. Everything from the environments to the way people look to the way people talk is totally as it is today. The theme is worked with very well in every area, making the game feel like a comfortable change of pace for the renowned RPG creators. It's an interesting twist for the genre, and it works quite wonderfully.Complimenting the game's modern theme are the areas of graphics and sound. The game's visuals look kind of like anime, especially in the sections of dialogue. This helps the modern theme along even more and gives it a fitting visual style. The graphics look very good for the most part, with well-drawn environments and characters, but sometimes the characters look blurry when they are closer to the screen. WEWY's sound effects can get a little annoying and repetitious at times but they are fitting to the occasions. There are actually come clips of voice acting that are surprisingly well-done, something I'm not exactly used to in video games. The game's music is a mix of hip-hop and rock most of the time, and while it's definitely not my kind of music I didn't mind it because it compliments the game's theme so nicely.WEWY has an interesting system of powers that can be used for battle. Neku (who you play as for the entire game) can equip pins to use in battle, each containing an ability called a psych. These psyches do a variety of different things, like making Neku slash an enemy or shooting lightning bolts. The psyches are activated by various touch screen motions or even by blowing into the microphone, and the controls make just about every use of the DS' unique capabilities. Sometimes pins have the same or very similar activation control, though, which causes a few issues in the game until you unlock the ability to assign pins to subslots. WEWY has a massive amount of pins to use, giving you tons of options as to how you approach battles. Mastering every pin in the game is a near-impossible feat, though, given the factors of pin evolution and the sheer number of existing pins. Many pins also have the exact same psyche as well, making pin mastery a sometimes tedious task. Finding your favorite and most effective pins isn't very hard, though, and it is fun to try out all the different psyches.The most notable pin in the game, though, is Neku's black Player Pin. With it, Neku can scan the area and use it to read peoples' thoughts, imprint ideas into peoples' minds, and look for Noise (the game's enemies) to fight. Reading peoples' minds is only fun until you keep finding the same thoughts repeatedly (which doesn't take long), but imprinting is of particular interest. There are limitations with imprinting, but you can still make events go in different directions on some occasions, especially when replaying the game.WEWY's battle system is very unique and mostly great. Battles are fought against the Noise, which take the forms of animals such as wolves, frogs, kangaroos, and several other beasts. In battle, Neku is controlled on the bottom screen and his partner fights on the top screen. Of course Neku uses the pins you equip for him, and you control him with the stylus. Top screen combat involves using the D-pad to navigate through a combo map, and by certain means (depending on your partner) you can unlock a powerful fusion attack. The combat takes some getting used to because you are expected shift your attention between screens periodically, which can be pretty challenging. The top screen goes to automatic controls after a few seconds without your input, though, which is good because sometimes the lower screen combat is very fun and exciting and you might even forget the other part of the battle exists at times. Overall the battle system is unique and fun, but definitely takes some getting used to.And the battle system isn't the only somewhat complicated thing about WEWY; actually the entire game is pretty complex and confusing at the start. You are quickly introduced to the game's battle system, pins, trends, and other concepts one right after the other, barely allowing you to ease yourself in. Even near the middle of the game you are being introduced to new things or new twists on established concepts. Once you grow accustomed to the game, though, its intricacy becomes something to be appreciated rather than something too complicated, because the depth is eventually part of what makes it so enjoyable.WEWY only has one save file per game card, which is somewhat disappointing. However, the game is loaded with replay value that more than makes up for this slight hindrance. The main quest takes roughly 15-20 hours to complete, and the story will keep you hooked all the way through. After you beat the game, you can revisit any chapter of the story you want, and each chapter has a few bonus missions to clear. These involve destroying particular types of noise and collecting special items, which is really quite fun and challenging. You also continue the game with all your stats, items, and pins, which makes it all the more enjoyable. Top all that off with a bonus chapter that ends when you want it to and you get a game that's fun and rewarding to replay.Another very noteworthy feature of WEWY is its difficulty system. There are four basic difficulty levels to unlock (easy, normal, hard, and ultimate) which makes the Noise more or less powerful. However, to add an extra layer to the difficulty customization, you can lower your level at any time. This makes your HP go down considerably, but playing on level 1 also greatly increases the amount of pins enemies drop. So dropping your level and playing as a weaker character is actually very rewarding and adds an extra layer of challenge for those looking for it.The DS isn't exactly struggling to host great RPGs at this point in its life, seeing as it has plenty for any fan of the genre, but WEWY is something much different than your typical RPG. It incorporates the traditional elements of the genre with new twists, making it a very refreshing experience like none you have played before. The elements all add up wonderfully to make WEWY an intriguing and exciting game for the DS.Positive:+ incredible story and great characters+ modern theme is worked with very well+ great use of the DS' capabilities+ battles are enjoyable and exciting+ lots of depth+ tons of replay value on top of the lengthy story+ impressive difficulty systemNegative:- early control issues and sheer complexity make it difficult to start the gameLAST WORD: WEWY is one of the best DS games available, and is a very unique and exciting RPG. Next time you're looking for an RPG for your DS, look no further than WEWY for something fresh, gripping, and fun.9.1/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2009"}

Simply put: This is the best game I've ever played on the DS. It ranks right up in the Top 3 I've ever played.I am mainly writing this review for all you casual gamers out there. This game walks you through the steps and actually teaches you what to do PLUS you get practice time. One of my big issues with games is the frustration level since you don't know what to do or where to do it. I bought a DS and a Wii as a way to play more with my kids, since they prefer video over board games (board games are what I grew up with). In an effort to spend some more time with them doing things *they* like to do I started playing the DS. We have found a few Wii games but the majority are only so-so. I was very worried that the DS would have the same problem but we've found quite a few excellent games that really are varied. I have to say this 40+ year old mom has a new love.Back to the game: I cannot express how awesome this game is. As a FIRST TIME RPG/Action player I have had no problem picking up all the skills needed to play. It is varied and has many options for difficulty. In fact (much to my surprise!) I have been doing much of the game at all 3 levels in order to collect the most pins and level them up. EDA: There is an Ultimate level you get to after beating the game--I've played it as well and it is far more challenging but quite fun!For any type of gamer I highly recommend TWEWY. I can only hope they make a sequel.Edited in 2010: This game remains on my top 5 DS games. Since I wrote this review I've played many games for the DS and become much more of a gamer with a particular focus on RPG, SRPG, and Puzzle games. TWEWY's music, characters, unique battle system and storyline are still amongst the best I've ever experienced on the DS. It really is the package that puts this game above so many others--individual games may have strengths in one thing or another but I have found few that can put it all together and provide you a memorable game experience. There are so many little things in this game that make a difference--from the catchy unique music to the way you can aquire experience by taking a break from the game. This title retains its place of honor amongst my games. If someone is looking for an RPG that's not like the others this is still my top recommendation!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2008"}

Movie to game (and vise-versa) transitions are great. You feel like you really are playing the movie.Sound/Music: 9/10- Really good. Music always fits the mood and sound effects are great. The reason I didn't give a ten here is because it isn't perfect and Gandalf sounds like a Hobbit when he grunts (which happens a good amount).Gameplay: 10/10- Fun as hell! Its hack-and-slash, but more complicated. Killing orcs (etc) never gets old, due to the fact that there are many sick combos to purchase with experence points and pull off. Co-op is great...this might have gotten a nine or eight if it weren't for the co-op mode. (The levels are the same, but you progress differently). As you go you will unlock many DVD-type extras such as concept art, interviews, and sound tests. There are also three hidden characters and two secret levels. Starts off slightly slow (Helm's Deep and The Paths of the Dead are the first two levels but also the worst...still good though)Replayability: 9/10- It hasn't gotten old for me yet, even three months after beating every little bit of the game. The levels are unique and fun to go back to. Co-op will please you as long as you have friends and/or family to occaisonally play with. The only prblem is the long cutscenes that are amazing the first five times get old, usually you can skip them though.AND1HOMERUN'S RATING: 10/10- If you like video games and/or the movies even the slightest bit you'll enjoy this. Gauntlet fans will be sucked in especially. Nothing to turn off younger players either, though it is rating Teen (due only to the fact that swordfighting takes place, though nothing graphic is seen). Use yyour judgement but I would say anyone over the age of 10 should be fine.BUY FOR ACTION AND ADVENTURE FANS, FANS OF THE MOVIE, AND/OR OLDER CHILDREN (AGED 10 UP)--------------------------------------------------------","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2004"}

Never played half life, halo, call of duty, or the bajillion other soldier games, so my knowledge and skill at the genre is limited. Having said that, the game is surprisingly fun! I die frequently, but the check points are close enough that it's not detracting from the game. Graphics are amazing, effects are great. My only real complaint is the characters repeated use of f-bombs and othe swearing. Yes, I realize they use it to be &#34;realistic&#34; but it's a GAME. They should at the least have an option to censor the language. I'm not a prude, and myself am quite liberal with my curses, but that doesn't mean I want to hear my video game characters use 5 f-bombs in 30 seconds... Almost like a 5 year old who cusses to get attention.Other than that, it's a lot of fun. Haven't tried the multiplayer, coz I'd just be sniper food since I suck at the game, and they don't have special servers for those of us who are middle aged men with worn out gnarled thumbs.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2013"}

(BTW- this module works much better if you make a NEW character...)","reviewText":"Man, these reviewers are harsh!  Stop freaking whining about all the little items you wanted to import from the last game (which will easily be replaced with new and more powerful stuff), quit crying about how you want to go look for Morrigan, and freaking play.If you do play, you'll find a great story, interesting new characters who are fun to use in combat, amazing battle situations, lots of new items, specializations, skills & abilities, and plenty of play time for your money.  The new enemy types are great--powerful and fast, the sub-quests are pretty cool, the loot is plentiful, and the art direction and creativity of the new environments, locations and such are, if anything, better than the original!People are complaining about the length-- when most games cost $50-$60 and give you about 6-9 hours of play time, I don't know what the problem is here.  With the ability to create a new character from scratch adding even more replay value (in addition to playing through with any/all your characters from the first game) what the heck is there to complain about?In short, go in with an open mind, and don't focus too much on a couple of character-importing details/glitches, and you will have a blast with this add-on.  I will say that having played this both with imported characters, and with a newly created one, it works MUCH better creating a new one.  The story makes much more sense, the process of equipping your character makes more sense (bringing in all that powerful stuff from your original game imbalances this one), the game is more challenging & balanced--things just click.I sincerely hope they keep churning these out, I'm happy to pay for more time with one of the best video games ever made...spoiler--->> the only bad news is that the finale of the game really seems to put the nail in the coffin of this tale, bringing everything to a close and basically letting you know that your character's adventures, and the threats to Ferelden seem to be over.

{"product_name":"B001HWB68K","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"ODST - Overpriced Dark Short Tale","reviewText":"Concept: 7/10Halo 3: ODST introduces a new Special Forces Recon Soldier for the Halo Universe. The Orbital Drop Shock Trooper is a darker, ligher armored version of a Spartan with silent weapons. That's pretty much it.Story: 9/10The story is very well written, well told, and well acted by Firefly and BSG veterans. It is really entertaining and one of the best parts of the game. However, it is told through flashbacks and is somewhat difficult to understand your first time through. You might be confused at times, but in the end, it all makes sense.Gameplay: 8/10It's Halo 3, with a couple new guns and a slight improvement to the health system. Your character sounds 'in pain' when your health is low, reminding you to stay behind cover. There's also a night vision visor that you can toggle on and off. Unfortunately, the game seems too dark if you don't have your night vision on, and if you use it in areas that are fairly well lit, you're almost blinded. In the end, the night vision seems extraneous. The game would have been better if the dark areas were just a bit brighter, but still cloaked in shadows.Level Designs: 6/10There is an open ended city area where you can explore and Convenant troops are being dropped in to battle. This is new to the Halo Universe and it works quite well. Most of the game takes place in New Mobasa, a futuristic African City that is being invaded by the Covenant. The look and feel of the city is pretty impressive, but overall, the levels feel redundant. Fight in corridors, defend an area... You know you've got problems when the Campaign is only 5 hours long, and the Missions feel repetitive.Sound: 9/10The music is foreboding and adds to the grim atmosphere while the effects bring the battles to life.Replay Value: 7/10You can start the campaign after lunch and finish it before dinner.There is a Firefight Mode which is like Gears of War 2's Horde Mode, but ODST features an additional challenge where each wave of enemies has a special behavior like \"Dodges Grenades.\" This mode is for friends and invites only. I understand that Bungie is trying to prevent the Leroy Jenkins of the world from ruining the fun, but it really sucks to not be able to play a pickup game.There are 3 new Multiplayer Maps for Halo 3, too.Maturity - The game is rated M because the Halo series is rated M, even though the action is pretty tame.Overall: 7/10Buy this game if you're a Halo Collector, you've got a bunch of buddies that still play Halo 3 and will use the Maps and Firefight Mode.Rent this game if you just want to play the Campaign. It's only 5-6 hours long.I'd recommend waiting for the price to drop before buying ODST because if you spend $60, you're going to feel ripped off.$35 for this game feels about right.NOTE:  Amazon and a bunch of other stores are selling ODST for under $40 now!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2009"}

Paslay","summary":"Dig a little deeper","reviewText":"This game has been getting fairly horrible reviews. The problem is not THIS game, the problem is all the other games. See, we're so used to a game holding our hands through every little facet it has to offer us that when a game comes along and gives you little more than a few tips and a control scheme we think it's just thrown together. When you approach your first troll fight the game doesn't pause and provide a detailed tool tip on how to defeat a troll, YOU have to figure it out. The same goes with most things in the game. It's a game requiring alot of trial and error. You know what though? Figuring everything out is a hell of a lot more rewarding than having everything explained.At first Too Human comes off as a button mashing loot fest. It can be very frustrating getting through the first few hours. On the surface it seems like the enemies are a bit overpowered and SK used the Valkyrie mechanic to avoid having to balance the game. Once you realize that you're not dying because the game is unbalanced, you're dying because you suck at the game, it gets a lot better. This is a game about strategy, each situation calls for more tactic than power sliding into the fray and mashing around the right control stick. It also requires careful planning of your skill point trees to compliment your play style.Some people claim the game is too short. This is a game where you CAN sprint through it in around 8 hours and have a character around lvl 18. ?However, my first run through I logged 14 hours and had a level 30 character. Exploring the game isn't necessarily encouraged, but it is most definitely rewarded. I faced enough extra mobs by taking time exploring and trying to get the most out of the game to achieve an extra 12 levels over those who just rushed through it.The story comes under fire a lot as well. First off, if you don't know anything about norse mythology then the story isn't really going to shine. I think it's funny that people are talking about how stupid or corny the story is when it's all actual Norse mythology that's altered slightly to fit into the sci fi world. To say that the story's stupid, is saying that the Norse myths are stupid, so you can't really blame SK for that. I thoroughly enjoyed the story. It was pretty fleshed out, it does take a little bit of walking off the beaten path and talking to the other Aesir even when not prompted to. Before you play the game (or even after if you're not happy with the story) go ahead and Wiki Baldur and Fenrir and some other figures and stories from Norse myths. You'll probably appreciate it a lot more. I thought the ending was great and really set up the rest of the series.There are some problems with the camera angles as most have stated, but I really only had issues a couple times once I got used to it and trusted it to show me what I needed to see. What game doesn't have camera issues though? Another issue I had was with the auto target on the guns. It's really tough for you to pick out a specific target. It's not a huge deal, usually targeting anything that moves is fine, but there were a few instances where I wanted to pick off a certain mob to weaken the group and had difficulty.Summation: This is a great game and it's really too bad that a lot of people are going to pass it up due to reviews. It takes a few hours to get used to it and figure everything out, but when you do the game really shines. It clocks in at about 8 to 12 hours depending on how much exploring you do, 10 hours seems to be the norm for most games these days. The story is great, but may get lost if you don't do a little research first. Strong replayability. I'm still working on my Defender class. There's a lot to go back and unlock. If your friend has a copy you can do co-op over live for hours of goblin bashing, loot grabbing goodness. It's not perfect but it's a fresh title that's loads of fun and a unique take on an old story. 4.5/5.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2008"}

I think people like the darker, more violent side of Batman as opposed to the goofy show and comic book that started it all like 55 years ago. Well this one takes the cake if you wanna take a walk(or flight) on the dark side of the bat. Great graphics, gameplay, and a superb sense of atmosphere make for a great gaming experience. I especially liked the boss fights, many are huge and you have to really use your head to take some of them down, unlike a lot of hack and slash games where they just have an energy bar. All the cool x-ray vision effects and ways to take down your enemies are very well executed. Also the control scheme is cake, compared to a lot of platformers out there and you don't have to try 40 times to get it right. So play the demo, or just pick it up, even with no demo at all its still worth the price, which now it about 39.99.

There is no better console deal available for Black Friday than this. For only $199, you get four games and a brand new super slim PS3 console that is only currently available through bundle deals. Currently, the standalone console of the older model PS3 goes for around $250. At the time of this review, the value of the games this console comes with range between $40-60.You may have noticed that Walmart is selling the same bundle, with a headset and a game for only $20 more. This does seem like a greater deal than the one on Amazon, however, you must consider that with Walmart you have to pay for tax boosting the price up at least 10 more bucks, not to mention shipping (Unless you use site-to-store). Even if you were to sell the games it comes with at a much reduced price and only got $25 out of it, you would still have purchased this console for only $175. Personally, I look at this PS3 as a very unique situation. You can play the system as long as you want and enjoy it, and if you are ever ready to sell it, you can easily make a profit, or at least get 100% of your money back once you are ready to let it go.There is rumor of a Playstation 4 coming out either next year or the year after, while this is all speculation, you can assume that there will be another price drop on the PS3 once then PS4 is announced. If you did not manage to pick up a PS3 now, you'll have many more chances through Cyber Monday (I am sure this deal will pop up again), or through a future price drop.You may be in between consoles at the moment, wondering whether to get an Xbox 360, PS3, or Wii U. First off, without seeming too biased, I would like you to lose any and all considerations you have for buying a Wii U. Although it is the first console of the new generation, it has very little improvements over an Xbox 360 and PS3. There are no good games out for it right now. Nintendo is too risky, they seem to throw out all their good games a year or two after launch. Unless you're a diehard fan of one of the games (in my case, Zelda), then I wouldn't tell you to buy it. In fact, you should wait until there is more variety and more games on the system.Now, as far as Xbox 360 and PS3 go, i've always broken it down into two questions. Are you buying your console for the better online experience? Or are you buying your console more for entertainment, but still want all the benefits of a great gaming console? It's hard to honestly say that the PS3 has better online than the Xbox 360, it just wouldn't be true. There is a price however, $60 a year to be precise. The PS3 is all free, and the price you pay here is a limit on your experience with the community. You cannot join a voice chat group, you cannot do a private voice chat unless you are not in a game. People are forced to do voice chat within the game itself. Also, there is a larger tendency to hear background noises and breathing through PS3. The microphones are too sensitive, and often times, they voices come through chopping and robotic.I can't say for sure which console is better for you, the individual, but I can tell you one thing. This deal is simply better than any Xbox 360 deal that has come up. The money you put into this console is money that you can easily get back after the madness of Black Friday and Cyber Monday has died out. Everything will slowly go back to the original prices, and people will be willing to pay more for this system. I am sure you could even buy the console at its great low price, and turn it around for profit if you don't open it.The possibilities are endless with a PS3.PS3: \"It only does everything\"","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2012"}

Everything is explained and in the comic training missions (separate mini-games), you get the background and origins of each hero.I also liked the fact that this game, along with X-Men Legends 2 and even Justice League Heroes, isn't just a fighting game like Mortal Combat, which can get repetitive, it's more along the lines of an RPG (Role Playing Game) with great action. And unlike Justice League Heroes, you can choose which characters (as long as they're unlocked) in any stage, except for the very beginning of the game, which is more of a training excercise than the actual beginning of the missions.If I had to gripe about one thing, it's the mutant powers buttons. You can assign different powers to each button, but there's no description of the various powers unless you go to the Hero Management screen. Not good when you're in the middle of a fight, but that's a small problem and doesn't get in the way of game play.All in all Marvel Ultimate Alliance is great fun and keeps you hooked until the end. I've finished very few games in my time either because they became boring, too hard, too frustrating or whatever, but this wasn't one of them. And that's saying a lot!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2007"}

{"product_name":"B001ASJIS6","reviewerName":"J. Urban \"U2fan4ever76\"","summary":"Prince of Persia Returns With A Giant Leap","reviewText":"I have to admit when I read previews of the simply titled \"Prince of Persia\" and saw the screenshots I thought why mess with the look of the 3 PS2 games and do a \"cell-shaded\" game. After loading it up and starting it, I was amazed that they really put out a fun game. Now many complain it isn't groundbreaking or very deep (combat and story) and they would be correct. But is it fun? Yes. Is it exhilarating running along mountains and jumping from cliffs and battling enemies? Yes. Do the graphics and sound fit into the next-gen category? Yes.The game plays out like a free-roaming game where you can decide on certain areas you can explore. There is no real order and the only catch is that the area has to be unlocked by gathering enough orbs to get a new power for your female sidekick, Elika. (It kind of resembles the relationship in Ico, as you have to have her along for the whole ride and most of the time that is a good thing as you need her powers to get you to new areas.) I liked being able to re-explore sections and it not being so linear like other games.The graphics, particularly the backgrounds and settings, are gorgeous. The cel-shaded characters are okay, but it is kind of gimmicky. If they wanted cel-shaded, they should have rendered the entire game that way, not just the characters.The music is moving and inspired and sound effects are dead on, particularly the sounds of the various material you are climbing or walking on.The combat is a weak point with the game. You are immediately moved into a fixed fighting stance, which makes moving harder than necessary. Also, the combo system, while sounding great, really becomes a button masher of a game as you block with the shoulder buttons and press square, x, circle or triangle for various attacks and combos. Most fights are the same, whether minor enemies or bosses. There are some context sensitive button presses (think God of War) during boss fights, but they are easy to miss and then you pay the price. Also, good luck with getting the trophy for having less than 100 saves from Elika. Instead of dying in the game, she basically revives you or reverses time to bring you back (kind of like in the other Prince of Persia games). I literally fought every character the same way and I wished the game forced the player to be more creative.The only other quibble I have is the jumping. Many times you are pressing the stick and button to get onto a wall and it will have you jump the other direction causing you to \"die.\" A game that is fast-paced should be controller friendly.Overall, it is a worthy successor in the franchise with great locations to explore, tons of trophies, an interesting chemistry and dialogue between you and Elika, and great graphics. It's far superior to Assassin's Creed and virtually glitch-free through my 12hr. playthrough. If you liked the PS2 games, you'll like this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2009"}

David Swan","summary":"Unbelievably Overrated","reviewText":"I bought this game with high expectations. Aggregates scores from professional reviewers put Might and Magic among the highest rated RPG's ever for the DS. Unfortunately it didn't even come close to meeting my expectations; in fact there were moments in the game where I seriously loathed it.**** THIS SECTION INCLUDES SOME POSSIBLE SPOILERS ****My first issue is with how completely linear the game is. Not only is the plot linear but even your very footsteps are linear. There is almost no freedom in movement. You move from space to space in a very stiff fashion. As with every RPG that has ever existed you start the game at level 1 and work your way up. I leveled my character up and finished the first section of the game only to be given control of a NEW character starting back at level 1. After leveling this one up, I got a third character again at level 1. I Leveled up and was given a FOURTH character at level 1. By the time I reached my FIFTH new character the game was kind enough to start me at level 7 for whatever reason. You can only ever level up to 10 maximum which again puts serious limitations on what you can do in the game. Finally, let me say that fighting an opponent several levels higher is nearly impossible and several levels below is very easy and often boring. All of this adds up to the most claustrophobic and constrained RPG I have ever played.**** END OF SPOILERS ****I haven't played a lot of RPG's on the DS because very few have gotten better than mediocre scores so maybe I'm out of touch but I did not expect to see load times at the beginning of battles. I think back to GTA on the DS which created an entire city for the player and still maintained an excellent frame rate yet Might and Magic needs a few seconds to set up a small battle. The combat itself is something I've never seen before in an RPG and it's probably the greatest strength of the game. The battlefield is essentially a grid that operates somewhat similar to Tetris or Doctor Mario. Get three creatures of the same color in a row and you can create a wall or a battle unit that can attack the opposition. There are also more powerful creatures that can be used to attack when combined with smaller creatures of the same color. It's fun for awhile but about halfway through the game it started growing tedious and tiresome. The game is sort of a hybrid RPG/puzzle but it doesn't do either exceptionally well and in the case of the RPG I would argue it performs poorly.This is the most disappointing video game I have played since `No More Heroes' on the Wii which was another dud that got great reviews from professional reviewers. I never got into the story one bit. Switching from character to character only left me caring about none of them and the game committed one of the worst infractions a game can commit, it became a chore to play. I kept expecting that I would get past the slow start and the game would pick up but it never did and when I defeated the final boss I was pleased to put the game away for good. I really regret buying this one instead of the new Zelda game for the DS.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2010"}

Is it the graphics?  No. Graphics alone don't make a great game.  Is it the sound, or the game play, or the level design, or the overall emensity?  None of these things defines a great game in and of itself, but all of them come together in &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; to fit pefectly into place and form what is the essential game play experience of the last five years for me.  Now I realize that people have their preferences as far as games are concerned.  Yes I played &quot;Super Metroid&quot; on the Super NES back when it was new, and I liked it.  At the time I thought is was great.  The truth is, &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; capitalizes on the things its predecessor did so well, and then puts it to shame.  I haven't been this enraptured with a video game since playing the original &quot;Thief&quot; on the PC several years ago.  These games have little in common outside of the fact that both of them really made me feel that I was the main character more than any other games ever have.  The world to explore is huge, the bosses and enemies are smart and challenging, and the game is addictive as any can be.  I actually enjoyed it so much that while I progressed, a small part of me was sad that I was that much closer to the end.The bottom line is, if you own a GameCube, you owe it to yourself to own this game.  It is the best available for the system.  If you don't own a GameCube, I will not try to convince Microsoft and Sony faithful to convert, but if any Nintendo game can rightfully tempt customer loyalty, &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; is the one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2003"}

Few shamelessly embrace the dark side and squeeze its blackened fruit for all its nectar. Even fewer allow their brutality the unbridled gusto of cinema. Well, fans of the grim, in the school of horror-flick-gone-interactive, Condemned: Criminal Origins is the disheveled kid in the back of the classroom with \"Slayer\" scribbled on his notebook.Mannequins: You're Ethan Thomas, a forensics agent at the bureau who, for unknown reasons, has been tagged as the next big thing. During a routine investigation into a string of bizarre serial killings, the tables are turned and Ethan finds himself on the wrong side of the law, taking a grotesque romp through the mind of a serial killer with a mannequin fetish. His quest will take you through all manner of sewer and slum where you'll rub rebar with some of the city's most desperate.Hand to Pipe: In fact, sledge hammers, 2x4s with nails, 2x4s with bolts, locker doors, fireplace pokers, lead pipes, and fire axes are all ripe for bashing against the skulls of bloodthirsty thugs overcome by rage. While the few guns you'll pick up have only one clip before they must be dropped, the environments provide ample blunt trauma fodder. You're never empty-handed when you can rip a piece of conduit off the wall one second and plant it between the eyes of a delinquent the next. The number-one rule of Condemned is: if it's not bolted down you can smack someone upside the head with it. In other words, there's little need for a rule number two.The immediacy in this game--it's all set from a relentless first-person camera--leaves you little time to think. Enemies lunge from shadowsor hide behind pillars just waiting to floss your teeth with a road sign. The ferocity of the attackers is trumped only by the satisfying feeling of momentum when you land a blow or perfectly time a block, which is by no means easy to pull off. Groups will swarm your position, and your only recourse is liberal use of a taser to slow the onslaught. A shot to the chin will sometimes drop attackers to their knees where a snap of the neck or a punch to the temple will finish the job.Foren-Sick: Well, sort of. To truly finish the job you'll have to use alternative lighting to find clues, snap photos of evidence, and otherwise be the forensics expert the FBI used to pay you good money to be. The good news is that a lab tech back at the bureau believes in your innocence and processes evidence through your PDA. The bad news it that your hand is so thoroughly gripped during all the forensics investigation that it ultimately becomes a distraction in a game that otherwise keeps consistently cranking it up a notch.How nice can a sewer pipe covered in sludge look? If Condemned is any indication, pretty damn good. While the character models are a little awkward, there's no denying that the environments are wonderfully dressed for the macabre. Though you'll be exploring a haunted mansion, a deserted grade school, a dilapidated shopping center, and all manner of the run-down and dragged-out, the oppressive implementation of light and sound permeates every setting with a consistent feeling of dread. Voicing is solid, but unremarkable, yet it's never so stilted that it pulls you out of Condemned's haunting grip.Just when you think Condemned is starting to become a squatter, the script is flipped, a new enemy comes traipsing up from the muck, or you perfectly time depositing the business end of a pipe into some mug's ear. The combat and weapon system are innovative, and when it seems they begin to wear out their welcome the game spirals to an abrupt conclusion. Many will say the game ends too abruptly with its nine-hour length, but there's no other experience like Condemned: Criminal Origins for those who can handle its savage disposition.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2006"}

NO AMMO.  huh?  you mean this is a shooting game where you end up using a freaking KNIFE and he can't even move while he's swinging this knife?  you got it!  our \"hero\" has to get up really close to the evil zombies and swing his knife while standing still.  personally, i just don't find that very fun.  i think the guns are a lot more fun to use.so this is what happened to me - i was playing through this game like a normal gamer would, by using all my handgun and shotgun ammo up.  since you can only find ammo in barrels and boxes, it's very scarce even after you explore all the areas.  that's right folks - YOU CAN'T BUY AMMO.  you can buy guns, first aid.. hell you can even upgrade your gun's firing power and reload speed with money, but you can't BUY AMMO?!?!?!  what kind of a freakin' game is this?!  you can't move with a knife in your hand and you can't buy ammo?  umm, ok.  anyway, this resulted in my INESCAPABLE death because i had to face a strong zombie with a chainsaw.  the only way you can take this dude down is with a shotgun.  i tried shooting him with my meager handgun ammo.. he lived.  so then i had to use the knife.. but that means he quickly sawed my head off with his chainsaw.  game over.  to beat this jerk, i'd have to start the game ALL OVER and start killing zombies with the STUPID KNIFE to get anywhere.  but wait.. how do you know when it's OK to use your handgun or shotgun?  joke's on you, gamer, because - YOU DON'T!

{"product_name":"B001NX6GBK","reviewerName":"J. Lethal","summary":"I've been to the tenth circle: this tedious game","reviewText":"First let's get the obvious out of the way.  This game is a shameless God of War ripoff.  Turning cranks while under attack, annoying flying imps, rotating bridges, button press minigames, very weak enemies that serve as fodder for your hack and slash attacks, orbs that lead to powering up your weapons, etc.  There's even an area where they blatantly had Typhon the Titan from GOW2 blowing wind at you in a cave.  If it was any worse it would border on copyright infringement.  However, I don't care how derivative a game is if it's good, so this is the last mention of those similarities.  BTW, I've never read Dante's Inferno so there will be no observations about how close this is to its source material.Each circle of hell is themed with a different sin for which its inhabitants are being punished.  Unfortunately there are actually very few themed enemies in the game.  Most of your time is spent taking out standard undead soldiers and horned demons.  The stages themselves mostly feature black, nondescript backgrounds and very uninspired music.  The gluttony circle has mouths on everything, but most other levels were very drab.  The graphics are decent but look very unpolished, especially compared to other new PS3 games.  There's simply no attention to detail.  At no time did I ever feel nervous or like I was actually in hell.  The combat itself is really run of the mill, with individual scythe attacks having to be bought with the \"souls\" you collect.  Your projectile attacks stem from your cross, and I used those most of the game because at least they're a bit different from the standard fare.Another issue in this game is the difficulty.  There were early times when it spiked as I was under siege from so many enemies, including some offscreen (how widescreen games in 2010 can have that issue is beyond me).  Most of the game I was able to use my powered up cross-themed projectile attacks to easily dispatch the waves of standard enemies from a distance.  A couple boss fights were frustrating as I tried to figure out what to do, while others were too easy.  I ended up beating the final boss on the first try, and that's always a very bad sign.It's hard to believe that EA, the same company who made the bone-chilling Dead Space, could fail so spectacularly at setting the proper mood for this game.  The plot is razor thin, with Dante simply seeking to save the woman he betrayed.  There are some simplistic moments where his sins are brought up, but nothing that ever feels connected to the gameplay.  I always felt like I was simply dispatching foes to progress to the next bland area.  Cheap platforming deaths abound, with bad camera angles making it unclear where you need to land.  Then there was an area near the end which is icy (yes, ice in hell).  You have to walk slowly across an ice bridge, with sections shaking and breaking loose, dropping you to your death.  It was designed to make people throw their controllers in frustration, and is one more demonstration that people who hate gamers shouldn't be allowed to make games.I never saw a single bug of any kind, and that's the most positive thing I can say about this game.  It only gets three stars because there was technically nothing wrong with it.  Without spoiling anything, they even had the nerve to directly hint at a sequel in the end.

{"product_name":"B00000J9J9","description":"One of the best things about the Game Boy Color is that it's  basically an original Nintendo Entertainment System that can fit in  your pocket. What this means for gamers is that many of the great games  for the classic system are being ported to the Game Boy Color, giving  us a chance to re-play (or in some cases discover) the best game titles  from the '80s.Nintendo's ownSuper Mario Bros. Deluxeis among the first of  these conversions, and it certainly remains one of the best. Actually,  calling this game a conversion really doesn't do it justice. This  version actually contains more levels than the original game, including  the entire Japanese version and a slew of extras (such as a two-player  mode).The controls in this game are easy to grasp--even for novice gamers.  All Mario can do is jump (and shoot fireballs with the right power- ups), but it is amazing to see how much gameplay can be squeezed from  these simple actions when the controls work in direct harmony with a  player's thoughts. The only element of this game that could have been  better is that the Game Boy Color's screen isn't quite large enough to  show the entire layout of the original game screen, so players may  occasionally need to press up and down on the control pad to see some  offscreen action. While this can be distracting, it ultimately has  minimal impact on gameplay. If you are looking for the quintessential  side-scrolling platform game, you can't do much better thanSuper  Mario Bros. Deluxe.--T.

I can't believe this is what they put out, seems to lack any type of quality control.  Thankfully I bought this when it was priced at $45, otherwise i'd be SUPER pissed just because of how bad Road to Glory is.  Along with the micro transactions, which is just insulting.Road to Glory:- Coach Trust is the glaring flaw that I just can't stand in the game, how coach trust is gained and lost is just mind boggling.  If i call a fake snap and get the defense off sides for a 1st down...why do i lose 20 coach trust points because the off-sides defender broke up the run play causing me to be sacked...it was a defensive penalty resulting in a 1st down (on a 3rd and 5).  How does that lose me a coaches trust?  Throwing an interception loses you 100 points of trust, but a touch down is only 25 plus yardage, throw in the fact that you are throwing in practice every play from 35 yards from the goal line, and the fact that the defensive settings are super aggressive for interceptions and it is a lost cause.  I get picked off at least once per practice, and that is throwing against very conservative routes where my receiver has a good gap between himself and the defender.  Once the ball is thrown my receiver is in molasses and the defender has hyper drive to get a pick.  Throw in the fact that I end up with over 350 yards passing, 3 passing touch downs, a rushing touchdown and 2 interceptions...but I have negative coach trust at the end of a game?!?  Really?Due to the coach trust system I am 3/4ths of the way through my Junior year, with the best stats on the team, and cannot start a game because I can't maintain coach trust.  (I started 2 games, both with decent stats and lost coach trust each time)  Which brings Skill progression...- Skill progressions literally takes less than a season, only practicing to have an overall 99 parameter.  by the time you are a mid year sophomore you are a true beast because of how they dole out the upgrades.  Thankfully the XP is not tied to coach trust, or else i would have a negative set for XP due to the above.Beyond that the mode seems like it would be fun...if it was manageable.  I have heard similar stories about RB's who get hit behind the line constantly because of the bad blocking...which is expected when it is the scout team playing the 1st string defense...which also might be why I get hit with so many INTs.Exhibition:Exhibition modes are good for 1 vs. 1 games.  Only complaint here is the slow menus.Haven't played anything else with this title yet so can't say what else I like or dislike.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2012"}

Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"An absolute platforming and action masterpiece","reviewText":"When I first put this game into my PS3, I was absoultely blown away.  This feeling only has continued as I've now completed around 75% of the game.Even if you've never played a Ratchet and Clank game before, or if you had played some of the PS2 games, but not Ratchet and Clank:  Tools of Destruction or the DLC Ratchet and Clank: Quest for Booty, the developers put in a hilarious introduction that brings you up to speed on what's going on.Now if you've played one Ratchet and Clank game, you probably know the drill.  Lots of goofy weapons, coins everywhere, golden bolts to find, and places to explore.  The environments are incredible, but in my opinion the best parts of this game is when you go to different planets in space, where it's hard to pay attention to what you're doing when you're gaping at the graphics.Some may not like the back-and-forth with playing Ratchet one minute, and Clank the next, but I thought they were very well done.  The more logical people will like Clank's sections; the action fans will like Ratchet's part better.Add in all the skill points to be earned and weapon mods/ship blueprints to find, and you've got an adventure that will last you a long time.Graphics:  10/10I have no clue how they'll top this one.

{"product_name":"B000095ZH6","reviewerName":"Anthony J Sasso","summary":"Better than most of the garbage being released...","reviewText":"The Suffering is a decent game. It's not absolutely amazing or groundbreaking, but it is definitely more entertaining and worthwile than most crap-action titles being released right now. With dime a' dozen shooter games hitting the shelves en masse, The Suffering mixes things up a bit. It couples intense horror sequences with satisfying shoot em'up action, creating a well balanced blood soaked blend. And it is indeed well balanced. This game puts its best foot forward as a melting pot effort, combining massive amounts of gore and profanity with a decent story, and some good ol'fashion disturbing imagery. I felt that if ever the shooting and fighting grew a bit repetitive, the game's freaky/disturbing context prevailed and pulled the game through. As much as you run around chopping up demons and blowing them full of holes, the 'darker' backbone and theme of the game is always right there making itself known.  Like I said, it's a mixture; You never feel too overwhelmed with the bulletfest or the brooding story elements. The graphics are run-of-the-mill PS2 quality. Nothing to boast about, but nothing to really gripe about either. The control interface is nicely done and the ability to switch between first and third person view at any time is excellent indeed. There are four difficulty settings - Easy (for your little sister)- Medium (for wusses like me)- Hard (for people who like to get aggravated and swear blood-vengeance on their PS2 - and Insane (for people who like getting splattered thoroughly and quite often.) The game's difficulty is balanced well, and the medium setting provides a challenge without overwhelming or enraging you. Also: weapons and provisions are well supplied throughout your adventure. - It isn't one of those action-horror titles where you have to be sparing with your loot. If anything, this game encourages you to hose down everything in sight, as there is always plenty more ammo to be found as you progress. My next topic of discussion is The Suffering's use of decision based story progression, and how it ultimately determines the ending of the game. Put simply: You run into people during the game (officers, inmates etc) and you are faced with choices - You can either choose to help them and follow the, dare I say 'light' path - or you can choose to be evil and cut them down and continue on your way. One nifty element the game designers have employed here is the use of voices that your character hears inside his head when faced with such decisions. One voice is his dead wife, urging him to do the right thing... the other voice is the voice of insanity, urging him to go Scarface on everyone. It is a neat little perk and one of the game's more memorable and fun features. And the choices you make regarding people who need your help will determine how the story ends for you, as the game features multiple endings. The demons/monsters you face in the game are pretty cool and some are definitely on par with the grotesque freaks found in Silent Hill. The voice acting is well done and very entertaining at points. On a similar note, if you play this game all the way through you're going to hear the F word about 300 times. - As well as some other choice phrases that helped The Suffering earn its well deserved M rating. So I guess that's either a boon or a disappointment depending on your tastes. In closing, I recommend this release. Fun if you like blazing guns action play, and fun/intriguing if you're a horror game fan. If you have the cash to spend, I'd say go for it. There's replay value and some great action/horror elements that make this title a satisfying stand-out. And let's not forget the blood... buckets and buckets of blood.  ;)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2004"}

I generally like every year's edition, but this is the first year that I've nearly regretted my purchase.  Overall, it's still a quality game.  It's got all the teams, stadiums, etc.  The big thing I like is the introduction of multiple commentary teams.  It helps keep the same old soundbites fresher, so it doesn't feel like I'm hearing the same commentary all the time.The new defending mechanics are convoluted and I feel like this is the trademark EA \"big change\" to the game, but lacking in substance.  I can still tear chumps apart with simple through balls and as they switch players to defend, I'm one on one with the keeper.  The button layout for defending is not as intuitive as it once was and now I feel like in their effort to improve the game, it's far more complicated than it should be.Online matchmaking is still not what it should be either.  '11 was terrible in online play.  People were rage-quitting, matchups would fail, and it would freeze.  '12 is a huge improvement in that I can get online and play much more easily than before.  I feel like I'm still having to connect 2-3 times before I get a game going.

You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or braving it solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support.Multiple Controller SupportMonster Hunter Trifeatures a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes. And finally the Wii Remote allows the ability to save your character&rsquo;s information directly to it, just as is possible with Miis, so you&rsquo;re always ready to play at a friend&rsquo;s house.Key Game FeaturesHunt Together- In the hunt, you&rsquo;re never alone. Hunt together with up to 4 players online or take on arena quests with 2-player split-screen action.

The environment is detailed and sensible, monsters react to each other, natural resources and to the player in a logical and semi-realistic way.Combat takes some getting use to, and there are no character levels, so essentially besides gear upgrades, the player his or herself virtually 'levels up' by getting better at controlling the character.Unfortunately, the Wii is not HD capable, in fact with my widescreen HD the game actually looks much worse, more grainy, than screen shots taken from non-HD screens.The classic controller is not the highest quality, and ranged attacks in zoomed in mode, basically like a first-person shooter mode, are not as fluid as it would be  with a xbox360 or a ps3 controller.The story is light, so it is not a typical RPG in that sense, but there is so much to do and experience, to include a wealth of quests, so much so that any player will always find some rewarding enterprise to undertake.I certainly recommend this purchase highly, and will likely invest hundreds of hours in the game myself. I have  yet to try online play because I feel like I need to practice in single player first, but I can see how playing with a party can be very rewarding, possibly even necessary.BTW I now reserve 5 stars for only what I consider masterpieces, this game is truly amazing, but with the few minor flaws I can not justify a perfect score.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2010"}

Some of the games it plays match up quite well to video games that come out for TV systems. Some PS2 games, and heck, PS3 GAMES, would also be released for the PSP in a beyond-identical fashion. The PSP is that powerful! And if playing console-quality games hadn't garnered enough appeal, the PSP also had the ability to play music and movies/TV shows! It's literally like putting together an iPod and a portable DVD player into a video game machine. And as can be expected by now, the playback quality is excellent.Have you ever noticed that the PSP never seems to get as many or as vast of a game library as, say, the Nintendo DS? It's odd, but the PSP has a big lack of third-party support in comparison. While companies like Namco and Capcom have given their two cents with console ports of Pac-Man World 3 & Rally and Mega Man remakes, respectively (and there's a bunch of RPGs available), there still isn't really the extra \"oomph\" given to other game systems.I think it may be because of one incredibly fatal oversight on Sony's part: The Memory Stick Pro Duo. As one can expect, it does its job as a memory card just fine. However, players can oh-so-easily nab PSP game files from the Internet, drag them onto the memory stick, and play them straight from there on the PSP. Basically, the PSP is a cheapskate's paradise. Not only can games be downloaded, in fact, but also emulators for classic systems, and even Playstation 1 games that have been converted to play on the PSP.Yeeeaaah.......I'm pretty sure the third-party companies wanted to SELL their games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8LR","description":"WhenLuigi's Mansionwas first announced, many assumed it would  follow in the legendary footsteps ofSuper Mario WorldandSuper Mario  64. The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

The visuals are impressive, but there isn't a lot of music.  The mansion isn't quiet however, as the ghosts pop up and holler to make Luigi yell, and there's some frantic music when you vacuum up the ghosts.  Luigi hums and whistles a tune nervously as you roam the halls, and he calls for Mario when you press A.  It's one of the better launch titles, and an enjoyable walk through a haunted mansion.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2001"}

Lighting effects (especially the sky!) are great. Overall, not the best on PS3, but very good.- Gameplay Depth: Enormous world to explore, tons of weapons, objects, and people to interact with, many quests to complete and tons of magic/spells. Quests vary from quick 5 minute tasks, to 2-3 hours - nice variation. I also like that you can choose from many different quests at one time, no need to follow a strict order of events. This makes the game very open ended.- Character Creation: At the beginning, you create your character and can choose many attributes, races, etc. This adds a lot of depth and is very easy to use.- Sound: Great use of Dolby Digital surround sound. Voices move around the speakers corresponding to player location. Overall sound is nicely done.- Simple menus: easy to find/equip weapons, magic spells, etc. Player stats and character development progress well displayed in easy to read graphs. Fairly easy to use maps and quest descriptions.- Quick load times (for PS3 anyways).THE BAD:- Some graphics draw problems - objects/buildings pop up on the horizon. This takes away from the game's overall refinement, and the realism of the environment.- Some annoying cut scenes, dialogue, but I expect this in a role playing game.- No game percent complete - big mistake in my book. How do I know how close I am to beating this game?- Map is a little difficult to navigate, no zoom feature.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00D41GCVS","description":"Sonic moves like never before. Vault over obstacles, free run up and along walls and sky dive between islands at lightning speed. Plus the Spin Dash is back.","reviewerName":"evani1997","summary":"The Blue Streak Continues!","reviewText":"With Sonic Colors and Sonic Generations, it&#8217;s safe to say that over the past few years the Blue Blur has been doing pretty good for himself. Now he seeks to make a new hit with his latest game, Sonic Lost World. As part of a partnership with Nintendo, SEGA has released Lost World exclusively on the Wii U and 3DS. Though I haven&#8217;t played the 3DS version, I can say that the Wii U version is another one of Sonic&#8217;s great ones.The story starts with a sky battle between Sonic, in a plane accompanied by his trusty sidekick Tails, and Eggman, who has a bunch of creatures called flickies captured in a capsule. Sonic seeks to free the flickies, but Eggman decides to drop them. Sonic saves them, but the plane they&#8217;re on breaks down. They crash land on a planet known as the Lost Hex, where they meet enemies known as the Deadly Six. It&#8217;s up to Sonic and Tails to stop Eggman and the Deadly Six from accomplishing their unknown goal.In terms of story, Sonic Lost World has sort of a mixed bag. On one hand, you have six new villains who just aren&#8217;t that interesting. On the other hand, they make the story feel fresher, and lead into an interesting twist in the plot. Like the past two Sonic games, the tone is fairly goofy, with characters cracking puns every now and then. Unlike the other two games, this one is more adventurous with some actual serious moments taking place. Though I appreciate the slightly more serious tone, it does make the goofy moments seem more out of place.Sonic Lost World&#8217;s gameplay is very fun. The game follows the same basics of most Sonic games. You run through a level at high speed while collecting rings and jumping on robots heads with a lock-on move called the Homing Attack. However, this game offers plenty of new things to make the experience new. First, the levels are designed to be spherical, like Super Mario Galaxy. Every round platform has its own gravitational system. This allows you to beat the levels in a variety of different ways.Second, this game adds a new attack. In pretty much every 3D Sonic game before this one, you would attack enemies with a Homing Attack. In this game, the Homing Attack returns, but a new move is added, which is a kick. The kick makes things more interesting and allows you to do things like take out multiple enemies at once by kicking one into the others.And third, this game allows you to choose when to run fast. Sonic now runs fast when you hold down the ZR button. Otherwise, he runs like most platformer characters. This takes away most of the frustrations of being out of control and is a welcome addition to the series. What I also like about the run button is that it creates what the game calls a parkour system. Simply put, it allows you to run on walls and things of that nature. This adds another level of depth to the gameplay.There are some things that I&#8217;m sure that people will find annoying. You&#8217;re probably wondering:  Are there cheap deaths? A few. But what Sonic game doesn&#8217;t feature a cheap death or two? All this game does is reduce the number of deaths thanks to the run button. Is Sonic slower (as IGN pointed out)? Yes. But he still has a great amount of speed and is still a lot faster than the average platformer character. As a Sonic fan, who has had a lot of experience with the frustrations of previous games, these things were easily overlooked.The only thing I really dislike about the gameplay is the boss battles. Most are overly simple and can be beaten in the first try. This in it of itself is rather disappointing. Then one of the final bosses is overly difficult. It required me to do something that I never had to do earlier, which, as a result, had me forget how to do it.The graphics are absolutely beautiful and excellently showcase what the Wii U can do. All of the characters, levels, and items feature a great amount of color that few games have been able to match. The game runs at an impressive 60fps, with virtually no frame rate drops. Edginess is kept to a minimum, with the only visible edginess being on a big screen when characters are close to the camera. Though the graphics aren&#8217;t over-the-top realistic, the artistic style shows very few flaws and is a very good fit for our favorite hedgehog.The level design is also great. Despite using some clich&eacute; themes (such as desert, forest, etc.), this game makes what should be quite bland look very good. As I said earlier, the game uses a gravitational feature that allows extra exploration. Not very many Sonic games have as good of level design as this.The voice acting is&#8230; good. When compared to that of Sonic Generations, it&#8217;s getting better. Characters like Amy Rose who had horrible voices are now at least bearable. Mike Pollock&#8217;s Eggman is as usual great, and Roger Craig Smith and Kate Higgins do a good Sonic and Tails. Still, it&#8217;s times like these where I miss the previous voices, considering how well they fit the characters.Fortunately, when it comes to music, Sonic once again delivers. Lost World&#8217;s music is much more orchestrated than the previous games and features one of the best themes in a Sonic game. This game has a soundtrack where the main theme will play over and over again, but because it&#8217;s so good you really don&#8217;t care.Sonic Lost World has become one of my favorite Sonic games and currently my favorite Wii U game. When compared to Colors or Generations, I honestly couldn&#8217;t say which is best. Wherever I would put it, it would definitely be up there with them. The gameplay is fun and exciting, the graphics are practically perfect, and the soundtrack is great. SEGA really did a good job making Super Mario Galaxy for Sonic. As I said, there are some frustrations, but being as those are common in Sonic games, I&#8217;m not too upset about them. But with those frustrations in mind, I can only truly recommend this game to those with previous Sonic experience.Final Score: 9.3/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2014"}

The gameplay here is excellent. Let me first say I would have liked some of the features in Revenge carried over to Burnout Paradise ...... like the Crash Mode puzzle solving, which can be (and often is) over the top with the crowd cheering. Who ever thought of putting this in a game deserves a medal because its just plain fun. The traffic check is also a blast ..... the object is to hit the cars which feels a bit abnormal, but once you start doing it, it becomes addicting and feels awesome to just cause destruction !!Even though this may be an older title the gameplay and graphics are still very good and hold up quite well even by todays standards. The sense of speed is incredible and doing takedowns is just as fun as always (no matter what Burnout game you're playing).

Mostly.","reviewText":"It's probably more accurate to call this game Marines vs. Aliens vs. Predator. The single-player campaign is divided into three perspectives. You can play as a Marine, an Alien, or a Predator. Each species' campaign takes place in exactly the same locations, but since your abilities change from species to species, the game-play in each mission remains fresh. As a marine, you're limited to the ground. As a Predator, you gain vertical mobility, since you're capable of jumping short distances to higher locations, such as tree limbs or ledges. The Alien's perspective is truly unique, as you can climb along any surface and jump short distances. Seeing these environments from the ceiling, and thus upside-down, is quite interesting.It's important to point out that both the Alien and the Predator incorporate a level of stealth. As the Predator, you have a cloak which renders you nearly invisible to most enemies. As the Alien, you can easily hide in dark corners or on ceilings, where most enemies can't find you. The marine, by contrast, seems mostly helpless, without any stealth and virtually no cover-system.None of the campaigns are masterpieces at storytelling. The marine campaign starts off as most Alien-related stories do. And, as a matter of fact, ends mostly the way Aliens ends. There are two halves of the Marine campaign - it's almost as if there was a change in story or development. Your squad-mate \"Tequila\", ends up harvested and pretty much disappears from the game after you get 60% of the way through. It all makes sense in the end, but the transition seems unnecessary. By contrast, the Predator and Alien campaigns are fairly cohesive, with clear goals and objectives. However, each of them require taking your objectives from on-screen prompts, since technically neither the Predator or Alien speaks \"English\". As the Predator, I often found myself missing objectives because sometimes this information was communicated in the middle of action. It's really hard to read scrolling text and watch the action at the same time.From a control perspective, the Marine is the easiest to handle. Movements are smooth. Targeting is spot-on, with excellent hit detection. Only the rifle allows you to closely target your enemies, but in this type of battle, you wouldn't expect to slowly take aim with an assault rifle and target aliens who are charging toward you. The aliens move fast, and you'll be spraying bullets.  The Predator allows you to target a specific enemy or location to which you want to jump. It was really difficult, however, trying to find a branch or ledge to which to jump - it wasn't always clear. Like the Marine, the Predator is mostly FPS. The Predator also features a weak and strong attack - however, connecting with the strong attack is difficult. Overall, the game seems to suffer from a distance-perspective issue - it's not clear how close you need to be to an enemy to hit it. The best part of the Predator is the battle disc - a small glaive-like disc that you can hurl at enemies and have return to your hand, much like a boomerang. If you ever played Dark Sector, it's much like the glaive from that game.The alien's controls? This definitely takes some practice. Transitioning from the floor to a wall requires you to press the right-trigger. Holding the right-trigger indefinitely actually just makes things easier, so it's hard to understand why Rebellion just didn't make surface transition automatic. Unlike the marine and Predator, the Alien has no weapons. You are limited to strong and weak attacks, and like the Predator, I found it extremely challenging to connect with strong attacks. Many times, I just lashed-out with a string of weak attacks. Fortunately, unlike the Marine and Predator, who both require \"health packs\" of sorts, the Alien regenerates health.The game features some really challenging but not-impossible-to-beat bosses. You'll feel satisfied after these fights. From a replay perspective, there are some decent Xbox 360 achievements to pursue. Each species has its own collectible - the most interesting of which are audio diaries that you collect as a marine. These help to fill in the back-story. The collectibles for the Predator and Alien are uninspired, but finding them all is a must for completionists.Technically, the game is superb. The audio is extremely well-engineered - it sounds exactly like an Alien-franchise movie. Graphically, it looks great on current-gen consoles. The aliens and Predators look and move great. Lighting is eerie and appropriate. After nearly two play-throughs of the marine campaign, I did not encounter a single graphical hiccup. It's a smooth game with lots of polish.Is this a game you should play? Definitely. It may not be able to hold a candle to other FPS titles, but it's not really trying to be an FPS. What this game offers is fun - you'll be tense, sweating, and probably cursing at times. It offers just the right amount of frustration and challenge.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2010"}

Very smooth running game for such a detailed open world.+ Amazing storyline, but not to overwhelming to get lost in.+ Auto-save feature is perfect. Saves every time you do anything.+ Side missions are vast and huge, which greatly add time to Arkham.+ Once you complete the story mode it opens Arkham City in a free roam.+ Soundtrack is great! Perfect for a Batman game, very atmospheric and moody.+ Over 400 Riddler Trophies to find hidden and in puzzles.+ Playing as Catwoman greatly adds depth to the game and is a lot of fun.+ A lot of challenges once you complete the game.CONS- Actual story is quite short. I beat story mode in 3 days. However side missions will keep you busy for weeks. All depends on how you play it.- Combat can get repetitive, just like in Arkham Asylum.First off, I have completed the entire story mode, which I did in less than 3 days. However I skipped some of the side missions. There are many side missions which can be quite time consuming. Really, Arkham City is what you make of it, how you play it. You could take your time and get a good 25-30 hours out of it. Or you could just rush through and miss half the game in side missions. I have completed all but a few side missions and found a vast majority of the Riddler trophies. I would say I have put a good 20 hours into Arkham City thus far.Arkham City is a pretty large city. When I heard it was open world I expected a bit more area, but really it is more than enough considering the mayhem on each street corner. Gliding above the city listening for an act of violence to swoop in on is a lot of fun. When you're not focusing on the main story missions there are at least 12 side missions as well as assaults to rescue people from and Riddler trophies to find and solve. There is a lot to do.Arkham City took everything we loved about Arkham Asylum and made it so much better and gave us more of what made it so great. Although Arkham City does have it's frustrations at times, it has very much gone up in my favorite games list. Very much worth owning. I will be playing this again and again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2011"}

{"product_name":"B006GHA8EE","description":"","reviewerName":"Evildead11","summary":"Fantastic RPG","reviewText":"Over the last few years, The Elder Scrolls have pretty much held the heavyweight title for \"medievil\" or \"ancient\" RPGs, with some arguing that maybe Diablo being the best.  I played through Oblivion and have played hours of Skyrim.  Without a doubt both games are excellent.  The Witcher 2 is every bit as excellent.  This is a game with a great story line, great graphics, great voice acting and a very good control scheme.  The game can be fairly complex and takes a little time getting used to.  You aren't simply going to hack and slash your way through it.  It provides a challenge that is not overly frustrating, but not easy.  This makes your accomplishments that much more satisfying.  Like Oblivion and Skyrim, you make various in-game choices that both form your character and decide the ending.  Although you take control of a default character, Geralt, you have the freedom to form his persona.  You can choose to be a drunken womanizer with a mean disposition, or perhaps a hero that lives by a code of ethics.  You can shoose to be an expert swordsman or a dominating sorcerer.  It's up to you.  You eventually have the option to have a band of friends that travel and fight along side you - and they fight well.  They are not your typical idiot AI.  They are lethal and make good decisions.  The missions are fun, the environments are beautiful and the sound - from the forest noises to the Olde English accents - is fantastic.  This is truly one of the best games I've ever played.  You would be well served to pick up a copy if you are into RPGs.PROS:- Beatiful graphics- Great controls- Epic story- Colorful characters and intelligent AI- Excellent sound - ambience, voice acting and musical score alike- Perfect balance in terms of difficulty- Hours upon hours of gameplay- Fun side missions- Deep, deep gameCONS:- NONEBuy it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2012"}

{"product_name":"Assassin's Creed III Liberation PlayStation Vita Wi-Fi Bundle","description":"","reviewerName":"Alex Gomez","summary":"Great Game But Too Many Bugs + The white vita is so nice!","reviewText":"The Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation bundle is my first foray into the PS Vita world. I was a huge fan of the PSP, and although I was initially excited for the Vita, it's launch price kept me at bay. The AC3 Liberation bundle solved that issue however. So now I finally have my hands on this magnificent machine.The bundle includes:1.) Crystal White Playstation Vita2.) Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation (in a crappy plastic case)3.) 4GB memory stick (with AC3 in the same crappy plastic case)4.) USB Charging cable5.) AR CardsReview of the PS Vita system:Upon taking the system out of it's box, I was astounded at its weight and size. This thing is huge! Its at least 2 times the size of my PSP 3000 and twice as heavy as well. It even dwarfs my old PSP 1000. The buttons are tiny and probably half the size of the PSP's. The same goes for both analog sticks.As I mentioned earlier, this bundle's PS Vita is crystal white. Very nice! I just can't stop looking at it! It is very beautiful. Oh and the screen? Exquisite! Its the most beautiful screen I've seen in any handheld gaming machine.Here is a screen issue that may stump some new PS Vita owners as it did me. Whenever you play it at night, dark blotches will be visible all over the screen.. When the game enters a black screen, the blotches (at least on my system) will seem to be in the dozens, covering the whole screen. However, the game will display perfectly during gameplay.. At first I thought my PS Vita was defective, but after a little google search, I came to find out that it was actually a normal feature of OLED screens. The system's safety guide even describes this issue in page 8. So if you find dark blotches on your screen while playing at night, don't panic. It's normal :)The system itself gets 10/10 stars. It is the handheld gaming system I have always wanted; powerful, dual analog controls and incredible graphics with the potential to provide a true home console experience on the go. Its too bad that it just isn't receiving the love it deserves. Here's hoping that the Vita will pull through and be even more successful than the PSP, which I also love.Assassin's Creed 3 Liberations Short Review (You can read my VERY LONG review of this game at the AC3L page):7/10 - Very good game but I think it could've been handled with a little more care. The bugs don't kill the experience completely, but the amount of glitches that are present in the game makes you wonder who the hell was in charge of quality assurance. The story though presented well, is uninteresting. The gameplay is very very fun. Overall I would recommend it, but be aware that you WILL come across many bugs. The game would be an 8/10 were it not for these glitches.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2012"}

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system.

Cole AKA Electric Man has many different electricity powers that adds a lot of depth. Also the side and story missions are deeper and more involved than the ones in Web of Shadows. Lightning seems like a better weapon to use on enemies than webs anyway. It is an open world game like Web of Shadows and you can choose to be either good or evil which will alter your powers just like in the spiderman game. Cole has no superhero outfit or a secret identity, but he does have a lot of cool powers. Even the city, Empire City looks like it could be the layout for an actual city; impressive. This game will defenantly be one of the best action adventure games of the year.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2009"}

The replay with different teams of characters has so far been high.The only drawbacks to the game are the dark backgrounds which seemed to appear after the X-Men series and the cumbersome inventory systems for the boosts. I did try the game on more than one TV and the backgrounds are dark. Not a huge issue overall and you get use to it.Other than that MUA2 offers all the button matching fun from the first two X-Men games with updated graphic, sounds, and character utilization. It's also good to get through Marvel's Civil War without Captain America dying.Minor issues: As with all the titles in this series playing the character Wolverine can speed you through the game with little challenge. As mentioned earlier the dark backgrounds and cumbersome inventory systems for the boost of the characters.I know some are not happy with this but I enjoyed it and much improved from the first version. I recommend it to any fan of the Marvel Universe and if after reading various reviews, borrow a friends copy or test it somewhere before you purchase","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2009"}

The game also let you play Ladder mode, which is the classic arcade mode MK had on the 90s.The game also has Online, which I couldn't try yet because of PSN breach.In Multiplayer modes the game lets you fight ONLINE and the common 1vs1 OFFLINE modes, in addition it also has a TAG TEAM mode, which let you play with up to 3 more friends OFFLINE in tag teams and ONLINE with on friend in a duo.The game also offers the krypt which is a nice form to buy unlock with MK money earn through the game. In the krypt you can unlock things like Extra Fatalities, Extra Costums, Concept arts and music themes. The way you select alternate costumes seems like MK will offer extra costumes DLC and characters making the game's value bigger than what currently is.GAMEPLAY:The basic mechanics rolled out to the ones implemented in 90s, but with some nice improvements, like a meter that let you perform cool X-Ray moves, the meter balance the fight because the character which recives more hits fills its meter faster.The special abilities aren't too hard to perform as other fighting games, it doesn't include half tube commands, neither those like Forward Down Forward.Fatalities are more gory tha previews games, are more realistic and provokes more reaction to players.GRAPHICS:Clear and neat models and backgrounds. Graphics are stunning, anti-aliasing engine works great, nice lighning and filters. Great implement of blood.OVERALL:The game is a AAA title, the production value is high and the playability will last long.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00009WAUL","description":"Hone your skills as a military strategist as you battle your way through encounters with wizards and dragons.","reviewerName":"CG","summary":"Wish This Had Been Brought to NA Earlier!","reviewText":"I try to be honest in all of my reviews, and this will be no different. I wanted not to like Fire Emblem. I assumed that there had to be a really good reason that a strong-selling title from a beloved Japanese series would not have made it to North America. As you can tell from my score, this was not the case. I absolutely LOVED every minute I played this game, and continue to play it at least once a week.StoryTo discuss the story in great depth would certainly lead to spoilers. I do not want to ruin the intricate attention to detail that the authors have so lovingly crafted into this title.Without going into great story-ruining detail (beyond the ''Tutorial'' chapters), you are placed in the role of a Tactician. As such, you are responsible for assisting Lyn, a woman who is attempting to rid her locale of invading hordes. Along the way, you meet up with several like-minded characters who wish to help you with your quest. Some first appear as enemies, however. If you choose to attack them rather than talk to them (which are different menu commands), you will find yourself possibly missing out on their contribution to the storyline.As your cabal increases in number, you have a choice as to which characters to choose from. There is an ''old woman'' who can do a reading for you where she occasionally recommends that you take someone along (usually because they will be needed to talk to another character). This ''Augury'' costs you money, but is very helpful to the newbie turn-based strategist.CharactersThe story really has strong character development, and a wide range of characters you will encounter:* Archer* Cavalier* Paladin* Monk* Magician* Lord* Wyvern Rider* Pegasus Knight* Nomad* Fighter* Thief...Most of the characters have a deep back-story that unfolds throughout the game. Like many RPGs, the characters level-up through an experience-based system, which automatically improves their personal statistics as well. Items throughout the game also act as power-ups, allowing your characters to evolve into a ''super'' class based upon those which they started from.GameplayThis is a turn-based strategy game. When two characters are near one another, they have the opportunity to attack one another (depending on their attack range). Each class of character has their own type of attack (largely dependent upon the weapon or magic that they wield).The fighting in the game is based upon a triad, much like rock-paper-scissors:* Axes beat Lances* Lances beat Swords* Swords beat AxesThe same can be said for magic, where you have 3 types of magic and each has one type that it is strong against and one that it is weaker against:* Elemental Magic beats Light Magic* Light Magic beats Dark Magic* Dark Magic beats Elemental MagicThis makes for very interesting gameplay, as you can have a relatively low-level character with light magic beat the heck out of a higher-level Dark Mage, simply because of the magic balance.SNES Level Animation and Good Attention to DetailI expect GBA games to have decent animation and sound, and Fire Emblem does well on this platform. The music is great, the sound effects are appropriate and well-timed.What really caught my eye was the attention to detail. If a unit is holding one type of weapon, when you cut to the battle sequence, they fight with that weapon (not their default). I was especially impressed with the fighting sequences, although I eventually turned them off for the later chapters so I could spend less time watching fights and more time strategizing!A really great feature of this game is the ability to save almost any time. At any time that you are in control (e.g. not when computer or ''other'' is moving), you can choose to ''Suspend'' your game. This means that all moves up to that point will be saved, and you can continue from that point on. This was very important to my enjoyment, as later battles can take upwards of an hour a piece. If you want to try a silly ''blitz'' approach to map out the level, you can have a throw-away save spot and use it to store your explorations.Well worth noting is the automatic saving feature. A couple of times I found myself up very late at night, trying to finish a level before the power of my GBA ran out. Ignoring the orange light, I continued to battle. When the machine ran out of power, as all batteries inevitably do, I was very worried that my progress would be lost! Luckily, all moves up to the point that the power went out were saved to the slot I was working on. I wouldn't recommend this approach, as I am sure I jeopardized the stability of said save file, but it is good to know that if you get too involved, you won't lose everything!Will This Gather Dust?It certainly won't in my collection. I have played this game to death, and still have a few chapters left to conquer. This is the kind of game you play, then rethink how you completed the chapter...could I have saved more guards if I had only...could I have reached that village before it was sacked by barbarians???Well worth its price, and I do truly wish this series had been brought to North America earlier. I look forward to the next Fire Emblem game reaching our shores!Overall Recommendations:You'll like this if:* You like RPGs.* You like medieval-themed games.* You liked Warcraft I or II or StarCraft.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2004"}

The critically acclaimed Metal Gear Solid franchise has entertained fans for decades and revolutionized the gaming industry. Kojima Productions once again raises the bar with the FOX Engine offering incredible graphic fidelity and the introduction of open world game design in the Metal Gear Solid universe. This is the experience that core gamers have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"D. K. Malone","summary":"MGS BS","reviewText":"I knew what I was doing when I bought Ground Zeroes. I openly admit that I have no self-control as an MGS fan. I wish I could have avoided purchasing it, to send Konami and the rest of the video game industry a message by voting with my wallet, that I refuse to let them rip me off. The spirit is willing, but alas, the flesh is weak. I had to have this in precisely the same way that I had to have the free MGS1 demo that came included on a CD in PSM. The free MGS2 demo that came bundled as a bonus with Zone of the Enders. The same way I had to have the free MGS3 demo that came on one of the DVDs that used to come with OPM. I had to have it, or else I would DIE. And Konami knows this.OK, so Konami refused to give the new MGS demo away for free this time. Fine, that's their prerogative. But they went too far here. The Ground Zeroes mission itself would have been perfect as a $15 download-only item on PSN and XBL. Putting it into retail packaging and tacking on five silly little mini-missions, all of which are merely quickie recycle jobs of the main mission, and charging $30 for it... is just plain bull poo. Anyone who says otherwise is either a Konami plant/shill, or a fool who doesn't have the balls to admit that they're an MGS fanboy with no self-control... like me.Criminally overpriced or not, Ground Zeroes is MGS as the top of its game. This tidbit of game play is some of the best ever in the entire franchise. I couldn't get into Peace Walker and I was never all that interested in MGSV because it's so clearly and unabashedly Peace Walker 2... but it's so good that I can't turn my back on it. The worst thing I can say about it is that UI, is a little lacking in polish. Or maybe the word is lacking in \"style.\" Then again, it may actually be intentional. The Solid Snake games, MGS1, MGS2, and MGS4, they had very slick looking menus and UI. When MGS3 went back in time 40 years to the Naked Snake era, the style went from being slick and shiny to being far more military and utilitarian. Perhaps they wanted to follow up on that. Whatever the case, the subtitle font in MGSV is fugly as hell and I can hardly believe it was approved to appear in the final game. Again... these are the worst things I can say about this Ground Zeroes. Everything else about it, the game play and the presentation, are top notch. When I think about how this is barely the tip of the iceberg of what we'll be getting in The Phantom Pain... suffice it say, if we have to wait more than a year for the \"To Be Continued\" follow-up... I may have to do something drastic. Like, say, cut myself. Or flip off a box of kittens.EDIT: Another thing I wanted to mention- I remember when Sony unveiled the PS4, they made a big deal about how you can actually play games WHILE THEY ARE INSTALLING TO THE HARD DRIVE! WOW!!! That did sound like a pretty cool feature. Well, this was the first game where I actually tried that. Long story short, I'll never do it again. I didn't even realize it was installing when I first started playing, all I knew was that the game ran so poorly I thought my PS4 was dying. It would run normally for about 5 seconds, then freeze up for more like 10 seconds. Then it would run OK for another 5 seconds, and then freeze up again... Repeat ad nauseum. But after it finished installing, it ran perfectly fine. Not exactly a great feature there, Sony.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2014"}

Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Good solid fun","reviewText":"Dragon Quest 8 is a good, solid RPG that any fans of the genre should be playing. This review is just to let potential players know what they are in for. I won't go into the story, but to help you decide, I'll just list the features that my be the make-or-break factors for your enjoyment.Battle style: Traditional turn-based, although you enter all character commands at once and then see the results. Depending on abilities, the turns may not come out on screen in the order you enter them, and monsters will take their turns dotted between those of your team. This can be a problem if you cast a attack-building spell on your strongest character, only to see his turn come up before the person casting the spell! Also, some reviews of the game mention that there is an AI setting for your team members so that you can let them fight by themselves and only control the team leader character directly. Well, there is but it's entirely optional, and for me that is not what an RPG is about, so I never used this setting once. Total manual control all the way, thank you.Random battles: Yes, frequent. The world is large and getting from one place to another can take a while, so expect a lot of fighting. It's also very sprawling and confusing and you don't even get a world map for the first few hours of the game (arghh!), so expect much roaming, searching and getting lost. You'll want to kiss the character who finally gives you the world map after the hours of wandering before then (don't worry it happens at a set point in the story, and can't be missed!)Transport: Yes, after you reach a certain point you gain access to a ship to cross the seas, and later on you are even able to fly. Plus, instead of all that running, you also become able to ride sabretooth tigers, which makes land exploration far less tiresome (you still encounter monsters but can cover ground much faster if you're just searching for treasure chests).Saving: In a word - Argghh!! Which is because you can only save (and rest) in towns. So all the dungeons ending in a boss have to be completed in one sitting, with every recovery item you need taken along with you. This sounds like a harsh feature, but in return, you are given skills that allow you to do two important thing: you can instantly warp to the dungeon entrance at any time, and when on the world map, you can instantly warp to any town. So if you play deep into a dungeon and want a rest or are too beaten-down to face the boss, you can always warp out and recover, then come back to the front door and make your way through again - hopefully more swiftly this time, as any solved puzzles or unlocked doors will stay solved if you've done them once. And you can even cast a spell to cut out random battle encounters for a few minutes at a time, which makes these repeat trips through the same dungeon less irritating. So that's not so bad, then. I wouldn't cut out random battles too often though, because the levelling up system in this game is sloo-oow. After a brisk start, the required experience to gain levels starts becoming larger and larger, and you may be forced to do many loops of monster hunting to gain points before facing the more difficult bosses.Items: Phew! There are hundreds of weapons, shields, clothes and accessories, plus the game features an \"Alchemy Pot\" which will allow you to combine items and turn them into new ones. This echoes the \"Inventions\" scheme of Dark Chronicle, and the \"Item Refining\" of Star Ocean. It's deliberately vague, presumably to encourage experimentation, and can turn into a huge side-game by itself. For those that like distractions, this could be a very large one, as many of the advanced recipies for alchemy are cryptic or just plain secrets. I guess it all helps towards the sale of strategy guides...good luck!Which leads me on to...side-quests. Yes, we have plenty of those, one of which does not appear until you have beaten the game once. My favourite is the entirely optional Monster Arena...extra-strong enemies, a bit like mini-bosses, can be seen roaming around the world, and they can be recruited once beaten in battle, to make up a \"monster team\" that you can enter into tournaments for big prizes. Of course if you can find the really strong ones ( along with actually defeating them) in the far-flung corners of the world, you can form a real killer team and earm some great rare items. Plus your team also become available as a \"summon\" in battle, and this turned out to be a life saver for me in some tough fights, as your monster team can really come to your rescue and dish out the damage - and withstand it - in some of the harder battles of the main game storyline. Plus it's very satisfying to see a monster that took so much effort to beat go out there and use those powerful offensive moves for your benefit - I almost found myself cheering when my top team won some of the arena battles! They are real characters to watch too, because they act of their own accord in battle. When you let them fight (in the Monster Arena and as your support summon), you can only start the fight and then cross your fingers as the team make their own decisions on how to proceed...hopefully they will make mincemeat out of your enemies, but some of the more dopey monsters will choose comedy actions like doodling on the floor (Squiggles), or staring into space and scratching himself (Klub Kong). This can be hysterical to watch, but it's hardly a winning battle stategy!That aspect leads me to the sense of humour present in this game. There's a lot more fun in the random battles in this game that I expected. Whoever wrote the script for them has a great sense of the absurd. First of all, the magic spells have been given comic book names like \"Thwack\", \"Kaboom\" \"Squelch\", and my favourite, \"Oomph\"! Plus the monster enemies are pretty daft too, and you'll be up against things like purple apes called Pink Pongos, or Puppet Masters whose attack is to put on a little puppet show for you. Then there's the Tap Devil can perform an attack called \"Underpants Dance\" in which he does a kind of disco shimmy, and then pokes his backside at you. The first time I saw this, my male characters were unaffected, but Jessica fell to the floor in shock...and I was laughing my head off. Other comedy came from some sexy witches who do a bewitching attack called \"Puff-Puff\"...which is basically some fluttering of eyelashes and bust-jiggling while a cheeky parp-parp noise plays on the soundtrack...it can entrance the male characters, but if tried on Jessica it will fail, and the caption says \"Jessica has won the battle of the bulges\"...And in addition to all this madness, the voice acting is British! People talk in a wide range of comical accents ranging from broad cockney to the overly affected, they call each other \"dearie\" or \"old bean\", and talk about tea and say things like \"posh\" and \"cor blimey\"...it was all very accurate and authentic!The above examples should let you know that Dragon Quest can be a very entertaining game as well as a challenging one. But don't let all this fun fool you - some parts of it can be tough and there are times when you may think the enemies being thrown at you are unfairly difficult. So be prepared for a challenge. Interestingly, the game never ends after a party defeat, you will automatically be resurrected at the last place you saved - but minus half your total money holding, which is harsh indeed if you have saved up a small fortune to spend on expensive weapons and items, only to see it completely halved by one defeat. But again, the game is not really unfair, as I already mentioned that if the going gets tough, simply take a break from your current quest (flee current battle, call Monster team, etc), by immediately warping to a town to recover and save. There's no need to risk the next random fight if you are near death with no magic or healing items! However, you may be well prepared but still fall in the face of a particularly unfair match (I've seen battles with up to TEN opponents squaring up to my team of four!!), but to ensure your finances, the game has banks in certain towns for you to deposit money in, rather than carry it around, and this is NOT lost by a party defeat. So be sure to drop off large sums regularly - its free! Plus defeat and ressurrection does not rob you of any experience gained up to that point...so put that together and I hope it all sounds like a fair trade for the harsh save system. I appreciate the thought put into these settings, as I feel they are fair enough to stop unexpected death being a total waste of 3 hours play without saving, but strict enought to make you cautious, and learn when to retire and re-group. It only took me two cash-draining downfalls to never forget it!Take all this in, and the game becomes totally addictive. It looks good, plays smoothly, and it's a long one too. Be ready to give up a lot of your social life!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2006"}

{"product_name":"B0088I7L76","description":"","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"Good game but needs a more serious story and tone","reviewText":"This review is from a person who is not much into fighting games.  I purchased this game solely because I liked the story leading into this game and flashy devastating attacks by different characters I saw in the trailer. After finishing the story and few missions, this is how I felt.******************************Pros**************************************-Great stage settings: Simple I liked the background design of different stages. From Batcave to Fortress of Solitude, I loved how they include different characters and objects from DC comic universe. Also liked how in each stage you can run to an end of the screen, deliver a punishing blow to your opponent leading them into a different part of the stage.-Interactivity with background: This is the best thing for a guy who doesn&#8217;t like fighting games. You can use various objects in the background to your advantage. If you are a super-powered character then you can slam them into your opponents, if you are a more human character then you can bounce off and get behind the opponent. Pretty interesting-The characters and their designs:  You have decent selection of characters with popular ones like Batman, Superman and Joker to some only known to DC comics fans. For most part I liked their designs and different skins the game provided.- The story  (good): I had the highest expectations for this, but it didn&#8217;t quite meet it. It is still good for a video game story.-The fighting mechanics: I won&#8217;t be a good judge for this, but as a noob I enjoyed it and people who like fighting games say that mechanics are pretty good.-Missions and online play: Both of this add great longevity to the game.******************************Cons**************************************- Childish PG-13 tone: This is the worst thing about the story. When you read comics leading to the story, you have Superman punching through Joker&#8217;s body, crippling someone dressed up in Iron man suit, but in actual game story they leave blood and violence out for the most part. Someone actually get their brain fried in the story but animation for it is so childish, it doesn&#8217;t bring any seriousness to the mood. Very disappointed.-The story ending: Another thing that just didn&#8217;t do it for me.******************************Conclusion**************************************I definitely liked the fighting gameplay and story up to the certain point. Online matches and missions are also good, but I got bored after a while. If they make another game, they should definitely make story more serious instead of cartoony. I would give this 8.2/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2013"}

The answer is everything.","reviewText":"Veteran hardcore FPS fans will have fond memories of the original Deus Ex - a game which has easily stood the test of time. It's successful combination of Role-playing and First-Person elements won many admirers, and its labryinthe anti-terrorism storyline is extremely relevant to modern events. So when a sequel to this classic PC game was to be produced by Warren Spector and the developers at Ion Storm, what could possibly go wrong?Unfortunately, the answer is - almost everything. The biggest innovation in the original game were the modifications you could make to both your players skills and his physical abilities. This was implemented using a point system - the points were acrued as you successfully accomplished mission objectives. Another cool innovation was the use of biomods, which you could use to add deadly new abilities to your character. The second game has an inferior dumbed-down version of this system - the points system has been completely eliminated, which effectively destroys the role-playing element which made Deus Ex such a huge success. Unlike the original game, the sequel doesn't allow the player to adopt different gameplaying styles to accomplish the same goal. In general, it seems that sneaking and sniping enemies is more rewarding than outright combat. This essentially limits the number of useful biomods that a player should use during the game - hacking and bot domination being compulsory.Music is also another big letdown - it'd be hard for any player to forget the wonderfully thunderous bombastic theme that played over the menu of the original game. It seemed that every single map and situation in the original Deus Ex had a piece of music composed for it. It's fair to say that music in the sequel is either non-existent or played so softly it virtually becomes background noise. The only time it's allowed to come to the fore is during the NG Resonance sequences.Apart from the lack of a points and sophisticated biomod system, the biggest fault is the level design. The opening map of the original Deus Ex was absolutely huge - it comprised the Statue of Liberty, the interior of the Statue, the Harbour, and the entire surrounding environs of Staten Island. And that was just for starters. In the sequel, we're expected to believe that the entire German city of Trier consists of only four blocks of streets - which is patently ridiculous. The sequel's storyline demands big levels - especially during the latter half of the game. I suspect this design decision was possibly due to the perception that the XBox would not have the required processing power. Anyone who has seen the massive levels in Knights of the Old Republic or Halo will realise this is simply not the case.The biggest mistake Ion Storm made was to simplify the game for the X-Box. As both Bioware and Bungie have proven so successfully with both Knights of the Old Republic and Halo, it isn't necessary to remove or simplify gameplay elements, simply because it's being ported to a gaming console. The result is an insult to the old fans of Deus Ex, who expected the same sophisticated user interface and role-playing elements. It's also an insult to the X-Box crowd as well, who have been lumped with a diluted gameplay experience.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2005"}

While the graphics weren't pretty, even for it's day, the gameplay definitely made up for the experience. A deep game, easy to play and yet difficult to master, and indescribably addictive. When Civ III came around the bend I was really excited to see the new improvements but was let down by what appeared to be a hopelessley buggy game with some serious corruption and unit imbalance issues. I finally threw my hands up in frustration after a month or two of trying to beat that game and swore off all future Civilization releases based upon my experiences with it.My brother purchased Civilization IV when it came out and told me how great it was. I was immediately skeptical and this was further compounded when I saw all of the glowing reviews it was receiving in the various PC games magazines, all of which had said similar things for Civ III (I suspect a lot of times when magazine folks review games they may give it extra points for the popularity of the developer, and Sid Meier is almost a deity in the industry) and opted not to get it. Due to my brother's hectic college schedule he approached me one day and said something to the effect of \"I know the last one sucked, but try this, I swear you'll like it\". So I loaded it up over a year ago, and I am here to tell you that this is one of the greatest games I have ever played.The basics remain the same. You choose a civilization (Aztecs, Romans, Spanish, etc.) and build your capitol city, striving against the CPU opponents to spread your civilization across the globe while trying to maintain a lead, or at least a competitive level in military might and scientific progress. One of the carryovers from Civ III (and one of the few plusses I found in that game) was the addition of borders, basically explained as the 'culture' of your civilization. A colony of the English, for instance, that is surrounded by larger Spanish cities is going to have a much harder time keeping a hold of it's British roots as it may quickly get inundated with that of it's surrounding neighbors.Another carryover from Civ III was the idea of resources appearing on the minimap. These range from useful metals like copper or gold to luxury items like sugar cane or silk. In Civ III these resources were not permanent and could (and all too quickly did) run out. This has also been corrected in Civ IV, and it definitely gives one incentive to go out there and spread your civlization as getting your mitts on iron, copper, and coal are going to be nothing short of a necessity to your continued existence in the game as time goes on. If all else fails though the Diplomacy model has been reworked thoroughly (I can't tell you how many times I wanted to physically maul Hiawatha in Civ III for his lopsided \"business\" deals) so you can trade for much needed items if need be. The individual match setup is very intuitive and I find that anything past the \"Noble\" difficulty setting is basically an exercise in how long one can survive.In previous games one could build temples and other religious edifices but it largely had the effect of appeasing the masses when they got ornery (Good grief...New York is in rebellion again. Ok, here's your Temple). There was no named religion, per se, more or less just the accoutrements of a generic one. In Civ IV they've added the major world religions, and while one is not really better than any other, if you found one you'll find that it can seriously help your civilization in the long run as a source of extra income, diplomatic heft, and research. The CPU players tend to make a beeline for Hinduism and Bhuddism at the very beginning of the game, so acquiring those requires one to move pretty quick.Occasionally you'll get a random \"quest\" that your civilization can partake in. These range from building 5 libraries (one in each city) to the intriguing and difficult \"Holy Mountain\" quest, which requires you to plop a city down next to a mountain sacred to your civilization. That's not an easy feat as all of the other civs are champing at the bit to expand and may settle next to your mountain before you do. Succeeding in a quest typically nets you a reward along the lines of making a permanent free experience level for your military units, or boosting the research value of your libraries. It's a nifty gimmick in the game and I find I rather like it.But the single greatest part of this game has to be the music. From the intro screen you're greeted with the best original game music I've ever heard (\"Baba Yetu\" by Christopher Tin, with a melody that gets in your head and stays there) in my gamer's life, and that's no easy feat. Much of the music you hear in the game is timeline specific, from tribal types in the beginning to Baroque music in the Renaissance period, down to the wonderful Classical selection they have in the Industrial period, featuring lots of Dvorak, Beethoven, and a little Rimsky-Korsakov. I could spend much of the review on the music alone, suffice it to say that I find myself listening to the tracks in my offtime and plan on shopping around for the complete works as the game music tends to be certain movements from each classical piece, not the whole thing.I did not play this game when it first came out so I cannot speak about the bugs and imbalances that seemed to plague it when it was first released. What I can say is that one of the most infuriating aspects of the game is when I see an enemy unit armed with a sword taking down one of my Cobra gunships. Thankfully this is pretty rare now and like as not will happen when you have an already severely damaged unit that's doing the attacking. This was a huge issue for me in Civ III and the single biggest sticking point in that game. (And yes, I know there are multiple cases of folks with inferior arms taking down superior forces, but I can point to many more than that where it was the use of superior arms that won the battle, see Rorke's Drift, among others).Overall this is wonderful and addictive game, and one can usually find me plodding away trying to conquer the world on an almost daily basis. It's like I've run across a secret stash of heroin I'd forgotten about.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2008"}
{"product_name":"B001IK1BWC","reviewerName":"Dan Leithauser","summary":"Fantastic Fun but initially frustrating","reviewText":"In a prior review, I indicated that there were significant problems with the combat system --mostly due to the fact that I was not used to this type of strategy control based type game.  You see, for someone who just started playing recent PC games in late 2008, this type of D&D; strategy with complete control over team actions was confusing and complicated.  The games I had played were more FPS, where control was direct and I guess, if you will, hack and slash.  Dragon Age threw me for a curve.Well I wrote the review and was kindly flamed.  Yes, the criticism was merited.  Although I still think EA's advertisements and marketing were pushing this game to Fallout 3, Oblivion, and even Halo fans.  A little more research on my part probably would have made me avoid Dragon Age, realizing that this game is not like any of those games.  Oblivion has similar atmosphere, but Oblivion's control system is strictly FPS (or third person) -- not strategy based team fighting.  Avoiding Dragon Age would have been a mistake on my part -- I would have missed a lot of fun.  I deleted my prior review and wrote a new one.With that said, and some tender commentary flames licking my boots, I persevered and played to learn what all the great reviews were all about.  What I have discovered is that Dragon Age is a very fun role playing game with detailed and spectacular graphics which immerse a player in a fantastic story line that is just complicated enough to hold attention and keep you playing.Some of the battling requires little planning, and I found the key-more difficult battles fun to lose a couple of times to find the strategy that works.  As with most battle oriented games it pays to avoid overwhelming odds and draw fights into managed bits, Dragon Age takes this a bit further especially when you have to coordinate movements and actions of people by periodic pausing, and even changing strategy mid-battle.  For someone not used to this system, it did come easier with time.  I was pleasantly surprised that even if I died and moved into another character -- as long as one of us won in the end, all of us would come back (with some injury, but still back to life!).  I like this type of recovery in a game.As for the cinematic immersion that makes this game great, Dragon Age runs just fine on my laptop running on Vista 64 with 4 gigs of RAM, and a Nvidia 9800m GS graphics card.  I can run Dragon Age at the highest graphic settings available without stuttering, lockups or other obvious problems.... As far as I can tell, Dragon Age was fully vetted prior to release--there have been no unrecoverable errors or game shut downs.  Action or cutaway scenes all run perfectly.There are still times when I struggle to control the camera angles or playing field, but in my view, it is certainly better to have that level of control than let the AI choose.  I am glad I tried this type of game, even though I was initially frustrated.  For people that are more confused than I was, or find the game complicated, I would give you the same gentle flames that drew me closer to the fire -- keep playing and learning -- you may find Dragon Age to be one of the most fun games you will play in 2009-2010.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0050SWUTQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Chevy","summary":"This IS Dead Space ---4.7 out of 5 stars (Updated) - Awakened DLC  is a mind-bending horror show","reviewText":"This is the best looking Dead Space yet.  I'm playing the single-player campaign first.  I'll update this review later once I get a chance to try the co-op campaign.Dead Space has evolved.  The original was the scariest game I've ever played.  The second moved on to a larger environment, updated graphics, and gave us more Zero-G along with more outdoor space time, and the third installment gives us an even bigger environment, more Zero-G space time, and a planet to explore all to a full orchestral score.Dead Space 3 is bigger than the first two games combined.  It has a new weapon crafting system and upgrading weapons is different than the past two titles in the series.  A rover bot is added to the mix that is hand-held and used like a scanner to find resources.  When the signal is strongest, just set it down and it goes searching.  The bots are used to get resources that Isaac can't see or retrieve himself.The single-player campaign is just that.  There is no A. I. character that follows you around.  I know this was a big concern for a lot of people.  Co-op was added so we can play with a friend.  There are more powerful enemies and better loot.  It's really like a second game.  Co-op offers additional things that you won't see in the single-player version.The graphics are about the best there is for this generation.  It runs native 1080 and everything looks amazing.  Visceral did a great job putting detail into every little thing.  I appreciate the fine details.We have some new necromorphs that look awesome.  They are no longer a mashed up looking clump of flesh like in past games.  Some of these necromorphs are extremely fast so expect fairly frequent use of stasis.  You'll recognize similarities between some of these necromorphs and some from past games.A large part of the game is in outer space where you get plenty of air time to explore.  There's a graveyard of space ships and space stations to explore with plenty of creepy moments reminiscent of Dead Space 1.The ice planet looks awesome and the weather effects are nothing short of spectacular.  Even outdoors, you'll get a lot of scares.  Necromorphs pop up out of the snow or come from holes in the cliff's walls.  They might even climb over the edge of the cliff to get at you.There are many blueprints unlocked from the beginning, but you can't use them until you collect enough resources; that's where the rover bots come in.  Start using them early.  You have 2 weapon slots and most weapons use an over/under system ala Alt-Fire.  I have a carbine with a shotgun attachment and a line gun with a force gun attachment.  You can craft your own weapon from scratch with tons of choices.  You can even add attachments that add shock or acid damage to your rounds, for example.There is a story and it doesn't suck; it just doesn't make you care for the other characters so much.  It tries to at times, but doesn't quite do it for me.  The story for this game is one of self discovery.  Rather than being character driven, it unfolds through your actions.  The more text logs you read,  audio logs you listen to, and the more you explore away from your waypoints, the more the story is revealed.  You get certain parts of the story from the characters, usually through objectives.  Isaac's mind has healed a lot since Dead Space 2.  He still has episodes, but not near as frequently.  He can decipher the marker's symbols to discover hidden messages now.  Maybe since Visceral has mastered graphics and combat they will focus more on this issue for the next Dead Space title.Combat is dead on, not much more to say about it.  The combat is solid.  I even liked scaling the icy mountainside while avoiding falling boulders and fighting necromorphs along the way.I think this is by far the best game in the series.  It's not constant stress and fear like the first Dead Space, but there is still plenty of it.  Visceral did a good job of giving us some breathers between shots of intensity.  A good series should evolve and not be exactly like its predecessors.  Dead Space 3 does it well, while still keeping to its roots.I have to recommend Dead Space 3.  If you haven't played the previous two titles in the series (I highly recommend them) you will still have a lot of fun with this one.  With side missions and some extra exploration you can easily pull 25-30 hours out of this game and that doesn't even count co-op.  It has high replay value because of game+ mode, which allows you to keep your tricked out gear for another play through.If you're not sure about a purchase, at least rent it, but try this game out.  It's unique.Oh, and one last thing--when you finish the game--let the credits roll to the end because this is one of those games that has a little something after the credits are over.Update: Co-Op Review:I spent some time on the co-op campaign.  You can run through the entire campaign this way if you like, but there are only a few extra areas that you cannot explore in single-player.  I was curious to see these additional areas and find out more about the story.  I spent four hours in co-op and we got to Chapter 5.  I got to see inside a space ship that was unavailable in single-player.  I wish all areas were available in single-player.It's fun playing with a friend and the new area that I explored was interesting.  It seemed similar to the other ships that you get to explore in the game, but there are new artifacts, voice messages, and text messages that add to the storyline.  Puzzles that you could do by yourself in single-player are now designed for two people.  There are times when some puzzles can be solved with one person while the other defends the area from attacks.  I played with my nephew and he seemed to get his kicks by not telling me when a necromorph was standing right behind me.  There were also several occasions when some necromorphs ran right past me to go after him, but there were more that came for me anyway.In co-op, necromorphs are more numerous.  I understand that they are supposed to be harder to kill, but since I was playing game+ on normal difficulty they didn't seem any stronger to me.  Perhaps if I started a new game from scratch then I would notice the increased strength of the enemies.I recommend turning on the \"player locate\" and \"player rescue\" features.  I may have misnamed those two things, but you'll see what I mean when you check the menu.I still have two other co-op only areas to explore, but having had a taste, I can say that the game is fun in both modes, single-player and co-op.Awakened (DLC)Wow!  I was not expecting this.  Awakened picks up right where Dead Space 3 leaves off.  Things take a bizarre twist as we make a major discovery regarding the origins and purpose of the necromorphs.  The moon has crashed into the planet causing a catastrophic end-of-world scenario and you need to find a way out.There are some new gruesome necromorphs to deal with and a cult of Unitologists who are severely twisted.  They mutilate their bodies to make themselves look like necromorphs.  It is a horrific sight.  The origins of the necromorphs are stronger than ever and reaks havoc on Issac's mind.  He has episodes and visions where the world he sees becomes veiled in red, almost like colored smoke enveloping the area, which seems to indicate that different dimensions in time and space are merging at that moment.  Enemies appear from thin air.  Issac's visions focus on the original source of the necromorph outbreak revealing a hefty story line.  This is one mind-bending horror show.The DLC is worth every bit of the ten dollar price tag.  It doesn't take very long to complete.  You can easily run through this in under three hours, but the additional story is monumental to the series.  I can't wait to see what happens next with this franchise.  And if you feel like it was missing something once you play through it, don't be quick to judge.  It's better the second time through.  You will notice things that you missed on the first run.  I highly recommend Dead Space 3: Awakened.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2013"}

I played about 2 hours of it, now now just you wait it was enough to get the just of the game. You spend like 15 mins in the city at first which gives a bad start off for the game this is dead space not resident evil 6 lol. Then finally you get to space and it starts to feel like dead space all over again . Well after things pick off it lends more into a lot of chatter and action where you're just shooting enemies after enemies instead of setting the creepy feeling and wild cutscenes. That's where they dropped the ball, it's like they went Hollywood with this game adding the stupid weapon upgrade build your own weapon mess which you really don't know what you're doing other than mixing random stuff together hoping a new weapon will be made while on dead space 2 every 30 mins you had a new weapon then spending more time upgrading the power of it, so yeah the weapon system is poop on here, along with too much shooting but not enough of the scare tactics to go with it. Sadly the game has suffered from going Hollywood so they feel they could change so much about the game people would still love it since dead space 2 sold well but not that much. Anywho this doesn't feel scary like the first two and it doesn't do anything new other than making a painful weapon system that made me take this game back in 5 days to GameStop.

So when the Xbox One came out, I found this and had it preordered here at Amazon.Then the supposed shipping day came and went and it went from the estimated date of 4 December to a generic &#34;unknown&#34; so I was fortunate enough to find one of these at the local brick and mortar.It doesn't fit quite as well as the one I have for the original Kinect.  It's like it isn't quite lined up right in production or something, but unless you're standing at the edge of the TV looking, you can't tell, it functions fine.  I've been unable to find a setting that allows the Kinect to sit flat though, it has a tendency to tip backwards a bit.  I'm planning on using a little bit of rubber mat between the TV and the back piece of this to help it fit better and give a better angle so the Kinect will actually sit flat.

If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will.

It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies.

And they never stop. If you're as poor at quick times events as I am, expect to have approximately half your time taken up by them. Of course, I kid, but only slightly.However, after finishing Ninja Blade, I was actually rather happy with the game, and can absolutely see myself putting it in in the future to pick up some of the achievements (less than half) that I'm missing. Sure, the quick time events are harsh, but the ability to replay them with little ill-effect tones the frustration down.I also rather liked the story, which reminded me of The Third Birthday and Drakengard (keeping in mind that I read an English translation of a Nier book).With the exception of weapon switching, which is mostly due to the 360's inferior d-pad, the game was also rather fluid, suffering from only a bit of slowness at extremely 'intense' periods of activity.If you like Ninja Gaiden's game play, and aren't afraid of fairly intense quick time events, definitely give Ninja Blade a try.4 of 5 stars for a difficult, but rewarding, and replayable, game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2012"}

The game follows the story of an ex-bank robber, a vigilante cop, and their battle against Charlie Jolson, a notorious crime boss of London's East End. This game will inevitably draw comparisons toGrand Theft Auto IIIandMax Payne, but its ambitious scope puts it in a class by itself.","reviewerName":"N. P. Stathoulopoulos \"nick9155\"","summary":"Mark Hammond is no Tommy Vercetti, but he'll do","reviewText":"I'd rank this closer to 3 1/2 * than to 4, but whatever.Like many new and hyped games appearing for the PS2 now, The Getaway takes elements of recent great games and combines them with some new twists.  The Getaway has some of the shoot-em-up, two-gun style of Max Payne, the character control of Metal Gear (including hiding, ducking for cover, peeking, stealth), plus some of the all around street chaos of the Grand Theft Auto games.I can't say it's significantly better in these departments than the games that inspire it, but on the whole it's a lot offun.Basically, this is a very Grand Theft Auto-esque crime story.  You're a gangster in London whose wife is slain by a crusty crime boss (who seems based on real life \"retired\" London gangster Dave Courtenay).  Now you have to do him favors to get your beloved son back.  And that's it.  He's got you on a string, running around town doing jobs.  This usually involves you whacking out a lot of people; gang members, mobsters, cops, whoever gets in your way.  Again, very GTA stuff.On the other hand, The Getaway does not stretch the comic book violence and game play as far as the GTAs, which made those games so high on replay value as those games don't require you to have a specific mission to go around causing havoc.  (Most of the GTA appeal is driving or walking around shooting things and people, stealing, etc.)  The driving, for one, is more realistic, with cars taking far less abuse and being slower and more difficult to handle attimes.  This is refreshing in its own way though.  The shoot-outs also have a more realistic edge (as realistic as a game like this will get).  You take far less damage, though you can take a \"rest\" to repair the bullet holes in your mod suit.  A lot of two-gun action here, though the game play can get jerky.  (Cops get near you and suddenly you're being arrested by a female cop with a truncheon, even though you just gunned down about 20 people(!))Pros:There is something like 40 sq. km of London mapped exactly to detail in this game, with streets and shops, etc.  It's pretty amazing actually.  You'll recognize all sorts of locales, with excellent scaling.  The violence is pretty good, too.  Borrowing heavily from Max Payne, people get splattered when shot and do some good John Woo imitations.  (There is no bullet time, however).  Also, the shoot-outs take on a heavy Hollywood action feel, with hiding for cover, shooting blindly around corners, escaping in hails of gunfire, and pistol-whipping anyone, period.Cons:Bizarre controls include the inability to look behind or around you when driving or even when walking.  This is a major advantage of GTA as you can really outmaneuver other cars in that game and cause all types of insane accidents.  Again, you can get seriously ambushed by criminal or cop from only three feet away which gets frustrating.  There's a lack of weapon selection here, as you basically fire off the same handgun (Glock?) to the same effects.  Your character is unable to jump or even beat people with fists.  You can't shoot out of a driving car a la GTA.Overall, though, I would recommend the game because it's just plain fun, even when you have to replay a mission over and over (as long as said mission involves shooting up a bar, museum, etc with plenty of goons).  Don't expect this to be anywhere near the overall unmatchable effort of the GTA games.  (No radio stations in this game, less of the silly, fun and very un-PC attitude of the GTA games).  Also, the extended cinema screensare absolutely annoying because you have to watch them over and over and can't skip them.  But I did enjoy and appreciate the great effort they put into this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2003"}
{"product_name":"B001AWBYNE","reviewerName":"Matt32 \"LIGHT WEIGHT\"","summary":"3arc did get this one right","reviewText":"This is IMO the best COD game.  Its simple, stripped down and yet its still a challenge.  The story mode is very well put together with a lot of change in environments, characters, missions, and weapons.  WaW's storyline is also fun to follow, WWII wasn't called \"the good war\" for nothing.  One map you are burning out Japanese in trenches, the next you are clearing German foot forces out of buildings.  Great stuff.  Russians are always fun to play as.Zombie mode made this game.  Its what started many people to playing COD and in my case, playing PS3 period.  The concept of an unbeatable game that just gets harder and harder was kind of new.  Hoard modes really weren't popular until this either.  Zombie mode is something that is the same concept, but different everytime you play it.  With 4 rather large maps with different aspects (traps, perks, weapons, interaction) this mode alone makes the game worth playing.Online play will test your skills.  Killstreaks are classic 3kill, 5kill, 7kill setup.  There are no overpowered weapons (most people will argue the MP40 ruined online, but a small highpowered SMG was required to counteract the increased health Juggernaut perk IMO).  There is a lot of gore.  The perks are balanced.  The sniper rifles are some of the most realistic that COD has ever had as far as damage.  It even seems they have taken into account the type of bullets the guns shoot (I have noticed that guns shooting 9mm rounds will hit their target before guns shooting 45acp)  The maps are really thought out, not ill conceived notions designers have ripped off of story mode.All in all, its worth the buy.  Would I pay 60 for it?  Probably not, but now that WaW has been out, I'm sure you can pick it up somewhere reasonable.  Really, there are too many mixed opinions about this game.  Research it for yourself.  Some love it, some hate it.  I personally see no reason to dislike it.  I go by this:  Can I beat a game, pick it up months after all sorts of new awesome games have come out, and still be like Holy **** this is fun!  With this game, I can.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0088MVPFQ","description":"","summary":"Side Scrolling Nirvana","reviewText":"The big complaint I've heard regarding New Super Mario Bros 2 is that it's the same as New Super Mario Bros 1 and New Super Mario Bros for the Wii U. The comparison to the Wii U is silly because one is a consol and the other is a handheld. Even if they were completely the same (and they aren't) they would still be a different play experience. To those who think the game is the same as the DS version I challenge you to pop NSMB1 in your 3DS and see the difference. For one thing NSMB2 takes advantage of the wider 3DS screen which makes a huge difference and the graphics in general are much better. The side scrolling Mario games aren't about breaking new ground, they're about recapturing the simplicity of the old days and giving a different experience from the 3D games. Given the choice between the New Super Mario series and Mario 3D I prefer the side scroller even if technologically it's somewhat lacking.This is one of the easiest Mario games I've played but I'm cool with that. There is a (slight) reward for collecting 1 million coins but even after completing the game and all the levels I only had about 45 thousand coins so I'm not going to waste my life going for 1 million. What this means, however, is that New Super Mario Bros 2 is LOADED with coins and you will never be lacking for lives. When I completed the game I had well over 300 lives and my skills are nothing spectacular. Even collecting all three Star Coins in most levels was a piece of cake. I used online FAQ's sparingly mostly to get alternative paths but by and large I breezed through the game. One piece of advice I can give. I've never understood why the New Mario games don't allow saves at any time and one easy way to save is to spend 5 Star Coins to unlock a mushroom house. Unfortunately when you defeat Bowser you'll discover a very nice (and expensive) place to spend your Star Coins. I would suggest saving the Star Coins and save the game by finishing a tower.NSBM2 adds one of the coolest Mario transformations of all time, Gold Mario. He basically throws huge golden fireballs that explode just about anything in their path in a shower of coins. Players will love this new addition. There are also loads of new game mechanics including rings that turn enemies into coin producers (yeah, this game has a lot of coins) so NSMB2 is definitely an evolution beyond just improved graphics. One sad thing I have to report is that Mario has now gotten into downloadable content for a fee. The upside is it's nothing I care about anyway but I warn Nintendo that if it ever locks content I care about I will stop buying Mario games. I really enjoyed this game and after a solid week of playing have no qualms with giving it five stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J5UQ","description":"","reviewerName":"PandA","summary":"Very fun, great experience. Play it for something different","reviewText":"First, understand (like I did and many people did) that this is NOT Grand Theft Auto or Red Dead Redemption. It isn't supposed to be. It isn't a TRUE open world game, and it isn't supposed to be.What the game is is a original, fun game that challenges you to act like a detective (read: Good Guy). As you can see I gave it four stars for fun and just three for the overall review. More on my three-star rating in a bit.The animation technology used for the facial features is amazing. This is the best voice acting and facial animation you have ever seen. It is pretty easy to tell if the person is lying or if you should \"doubt\" them versus them telling the truth.... but deciding if it is doubt/or lie depends on if you have found evidence that can prove that they are lying. You must have evidence to back up your lying allegations.The cars, city streets and pedestrians are flawlessly executed as a living, breathing city. The graphics are fantastic.The controls in the game are spot on and feel much better than GTA4. The cars are heavy and fun to drive. For you collection people out there I think there are 50 unique cars to drive and find, newspapers to collect and film reels scattered all over the city if you want to complete the game 100%. Only the newspapers really give any insight to the story (perhaps the film reels do but I haven't found any!).I only gave it 3 stars overall (probably 3.5) because it can be frustrating and repetitive after awhile. This is one of those games that feels like a sequel will be twice as fun. Don't get me wrong, it was 4-5 stars worth of \"fun\" at times, but after I finished it I thought back and realized some of my frustrations. Looking for clues is a pain. You walk around slowing bumping in to walls and walking across a scene waiting for the controller to vibrate. You then have to go back, line it up, wait for the vibrate and then hit the button to investigate the clue. Just clumsy and clunky. Took me 3-4 times to grab some clues because I wasn't in the exact spot.Many times I felt like I read the face exactly during an interview, just to get an \"X\" instead of the check mark. This means I didn't get all of the information I could have out of the subject. You can't really \"fail\" a case, they all end with an arrest or you killing the subject. But you do get star ratings 1-5. The problem is sometimes I felt like I did a good job and got 2 stars, and other times I got 4-5 stars and my stats didn't seem too bad. There is no way of knowing what you must do to get five stars, so even playing through the cases again to try to max out the rating is still hit and miss, because car damage, city damage and missed clue/failed accusations all can cause you to drop stars. But replaying the same interview over and over to get the correct answers is tedious and not fun.There are many bits to the game that adds action, from shootout, car chases and foot chases, and street races, it is really fun when you get in these action sequences. Doing street crimes while driving around the city is a good way to get your hands on the guns and action segments as most of these are quick, 10 minute chases/shootouts.All in all, this game is worth buying it if you enjoy slower, well written games with some action mixed throughout. Think of it as playing an interactive game set during the movie L.A. Confidential. If you are interested in that, buy it today.If you want the next GTA, you should look elsewhere.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2011"}

But although it comes in a small package, this is a full-fledged game that stands on its own. With an all-new, deep story that approaches the familiar sights and sounds of the infamous Liberty City from a different perspective, an innovative control system and multiplayer options,Chinatown Warscaptures the tone and flavors of the long-runningGTAseries in unique ways that both longtime players and those coming to it for the first time will find hard to put down..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Grand Theft Auto:Chinatown WarsPlayers:Offline: 1; Online: 2Gameplay Modes:Single player; competitive &amp; coop multiplayer via Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.Kick some tail as Huang Lee.View larger.Use the DS stylus like never before.View larger.Reconquer Liberty via PDA.View larger.The Story: Left for Dead in the Worst Place in AmericaFollowing his father&rsquo;s murder, Huang Lee is given what seems a simple mission: to deliver an ancient sword to his Uncle Kenny to ensure his family retains control of the Triad gangs of Liberty City. Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement. While driving players also have access to five in-game radio stations and use of their weapons. Your PDA provides efficient management tools for your growing crime empire, including quick weapons switching, a running total of available cash, in-game e-mail and Internet access and nearly instant game saves any time. The control scheme inChinatown Warsutilizes an easy to use and comfortable to play combination of steering via the D-pad, choice of action through the face buttons and/or stylus taps and manual and automatic weapon locks and unlocks via shoulder buttons.Key Game Features:The Largest DS Game Ever- Contemporary Liberty City is a massive world complete with pedestrians, weather and traffic patterns, five different radio stations and four different sprawling boroughs to explore.Endless Gameplay- Mature storyline with over 70+ story missions; plus dozens of side quests, collectibles, contextual mini-games and the all new mission replay feature.Street Economics- Addictive drug dealing side game with 6 different drug types, 80+ drug dealers and a supply / demand driven narcotics economy.Play with Friends- Nintendo Wi-Fi mode for head-to-head and co-op multiplayer mayhem.Bragging Rights- Chat, trade guns and commodities with your friends, and compete for glory via online tournaments and leaderboards on the Rockstar Games Social Club.PDA Interface- Use the touch screen as a PDA device to set GPS waypoints, change radio stations, communicate via e-mail with in-game characters and order weapons on the Internet.Online Bragging Rights and MultiplayerCare has been taken to ensure that players can share theirChinatown Warsexperiences with friends and fellow players in different ways.

Here they can chat, trade commodities, purchase special in-game items with in-game currency, check the leaderboards and compete in online tournaments.

Now it's been released for the DS but don't let this version fool you. This game is just as fun, adult, criminal and addictive to play as the PS3 and Xbox 360 console versions.Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars is an all new game based in Liberty City (Rockstar's version of NYC.) You play as Han, a young guy who just flew in to drop off an artifact for his father, the boss of a dangerous gang. He gets robbed, beat up, shot and dumped in the ocean. Of course, with your help, you break out of the car you were dumped in and see your uncle, who you will start working for. This is where the game begins as your main goal is to find out who ambushed you and who killed your father. I can say that Liberty City is huge and that would still be an understatement. Besides the main story missions, you have so much to do, it's crazy. The main thing of the game is to make money since you will need it to buy everything in this game.Most of the story missions earn you money once you complete them. You can buy property, cars, weapons and drugs. Along the way, you will unlock other activities to do on the side: meeting and completing side missions for random strangers, complete rampage missions, earn money as a cab driver, ambulance driver or a police officer, race around the city and destroy cameras so cops don't see you dealing drugs. Oh yes, you deal drugs in this game and this along has its own elaborate system. You can seek out drug dealers who will buy drugs from you or sell drugs to you. Each of them has different types of drugs and you find out certain drugs are preferred by certain dealers depending on which part of the city they are located. Buy drugs from those who sell it cheap and then sell it to those who really want to make the maximum profit. The cycle keeps going and if you find enough of them, they will send you emails telling you what they want or what they are selling.Oh yeah...you get emails in the game. You use a GPS-like device that shows you the map of Liberty City and as you discover all the side missions, drug dealers, racing destinations etc, they appear on the GPS in categories so save often so you can permanently record their locations. You get emails from your uncle at first that tell you when and where to start the missions. You eventually meet other people that work with your uncle and you get missions from them as well via email. As a bonus, when you beat all of the story missions, you can unlock a few more missions if you find two gold statues located in Liberty City. You'll need to sync your DS to Rockstar's Social Club website to unlock this feature. This game also features a multiplayer mode where you can take on other players in free for all, team based matches and races throughout the city. The only catch is you need to know other people that have this game and exchange friend codes.If there is one thing that I can say is a flaw is that the multiplayer modes are local based only. You have to have people next to you to sync up, exchange friend codes and play. None of these modes can be played online and I feel Rockstar dropped the ball hard. I know many people would love to play online matches with other people but can't because this isn't possible. You can upload your stats via the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection to the Social Club and if you register your friends, you can see their stats as well but that's as far as it goes.GTA: CW is a fun and addictive game that pulls no punches. You have lots of things to do in this game so this will take you a long while to achieve the \"100% completed\" status. This game is rated M so parents, THIS IS NOT FOR LITTLE KIDS. This is for the players who are 17 years old and above. This game is violent, perverted and almost all of the characters in the game curse. Those who are 17 and over and are mature enough to see the fun and humor in this game will be the ones to get the best experience out of it.********HIGHLY RECOMMENDED********","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0001NBNGG","description":"The creepy tale of a possessed Japanese village (Hanuda) told through the eyes of ten playable characters in combination with some impressively innovative gameplay&nbsp;features should totally make my day&nbsp;&#8211; but playing Siren turns out to be sadly different than I was expecting.The game's two big features: sightjacking (where you see through the eyes of other characters) and the Link Navigator (which manages the plot's order of events) sadly don't add to the player's experience enough to justify their problematic existence.Sightjacking is more fun to mess around with than it is helpful to the player. Watching the paths of roaming enemies can offer useful information, but the stealth mechanic is so simplistic that the data is rarely necessary. In many situations, being seen by enemies is something that you can't avoid or recover from &#8211; they will find you, and they will kill you. This is fine by me, but when the only stealth-orientated skill that is offered is a painfully slow crawl (and a distracting yell, which had little to no effect that I could perceive), it doesn't make me want to be all that sneaky. There isn't a sound meter, no real way to know if enemies can see you or not (like a vision cone or shadow meter), and very little chance of distracting them with diversions. It is more fun and more efficient to just run through levels and see what happens than to use the sightjacking feature to suss out a plan of attack.Which leads to discussion of the game's other big feature, the Link Navigator. Siren's storytelling plan sounds like a survival horror Real World season: Pick 10 characters to escape the apocalypse and find out what happens over 3 days through 78 missions &#8211; you could call it Siren: Hanuda. The complication is that the order of events is jumbled and the Link Navigator is supposed to help you keep track. What this means, from a player's point of view, is that the game's story doesn't really get its hook into you &#8211; not even in the first few hours. The tales are too disjointed, the characters too many, and the plot too slow in getting going.The more conventional aspects of this game like sound design and graphics are also something that people will have mixed feelings about. The creatures' insane, maniacal laughs are honestly unnerving, and therefore good for this game. The graphics look to be actual pictures of the characters' faces and lend a realistic, but still skewed version of each person &#8211; they're detailed, but strangely flat. I think that this is a nice subtle touch, but others may disagree.I really, really wanted to like Siren, but in the end, I just didn't have much fun or feel like the innovative parts of the game were used to their advantage. It has good ideas, and I'm glad to see experimentation in survival horror, but this should be chalked up as a failed test in the genre.Concept:Navigate a horrific village as ten different charactersGraphics:Muddy and jerky&#xC2;&#xA0;&#8211; but it fits with the disjointed feel of the gameplaySound:The best part of this game, the sound effects are creepy and (for lack of a better word) ickyPlayability:The context-sensitive menu system is&#xC2;&#xA0;counter-intuitive and the stealth mechanics are pretty archaic and basicEntertainment:I really need a reason to care in a game this cerebral and slow-paced, and Siren doesn't give it to meReplay:ModerateRated:6.25 out of 10Editor:Lisa MasonIssue:May 20042nd Opinion:From a conceptual standpoint, Siren is chock-full of ingenuity, and is a soaring success when it comes to the delivery of unusual ideas. Forming a mental bond with your attackers so that you see the surroundings from their perspective is a great idea that leads to some unnerving situations. This gimmick only goes so far, however. I found its functionality, and the entire gameplay package for that matter, to be clunky, and above all, frustrating. I grew so disenchanted with trying to pick up enemy sight that I avoided using this technique whenever I could.

Willard","summary":"Well done for Bethesda","reviewText":"First Impressions:Visuals:The first impression you get from this game is, it's OBVIOUSLY made by the same people who made Oblivion. I recognised the voice acting very fast. Some of the NPCs designs/faces are the same NPCs with the exact same voice actors from Oblivion. This is NOT a bad thing since Oblivion was well done. I recognised some new big name voices like Liam Neeson and Malcolm McDowell.The GREY tone of EVERYTHING was a downer but it's supposed to be that way. They even mention it by talking about green trees in the game.Controls:Why Bethesda removed the Map/Inventory keys and you can only access it through the TAB (Pip-Boy wrist computer) is beyond me but it's not a big hassle or a complaint. It just takes a little getting used to.The traditional WSAD and click shooting are always welcome and easy to use. You can map keys to 1-8 for what weapon or item you want.Durring the V.A.T.S. combat, you press \"V\" while in combat and go into a freeze screen. Then the enemy has a percentage rate (for chance to hit) for each part of the body you plan to hit. You'll learn that different enemies have different weakpoints.Think of it like Bullet-time.You can target multiple enemies in any order and what body parts to hit first. COOL. After making your choices you press a key and it goes into slow-mo while you take them out in the order you chose. Kinda like an action film with monsters taking the force of a .44 round to the face. Cool again.Bugs??Well, I wouldn't call them crashes but I've had two \"Freezes\" in approx 30 hrs of play. Have the game AUTOSAVE after each new doorway, new load screen and rest period and you only have to go back slightly and redo that part. It's a hassle but I've seen worse.Storyline/Quests:Yes, I agree that I found you can shortcut some quests if you find a building earlier than the game wanted you to but I found it to be more realistic. I was finding clues and hints of my fathers location before anyone told me by finding his recordings/journals.GHOULS are awesome. They look very detailed and well developed. Well, all the creatures are awesome but the Ghouls look cool and you can interact with some of them.Even though, for some reason, my computer stopped letting PhysX work, the game still looks great with my GeForce 9800GT card.Overall this is a great game. I highly recommend it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2008"}

They have been dishin out some sh*tty a*s games lately but this has to be the biggest piece of sh*t squaresoft has dispensed out of their behind. So lets take a look at the title first...A little fruity I know. Ok ok lets take it from the basics. I bought the game a year after it came out....Due to the huge hype about. You know all these little nerds sayin \"Man Kingdom Hearts is awesome!!\" or \"Man I couldn't take a crap without Kingdom Hearts\". Personally I dispiesed the game but you know what peer pressure does to you. Living here in Japan squaresoft was hailed as the greatest RPG maker ever which I can understand i.e. Mystic Quest (Personal Fav) Nevertheless with a name like Kingdom Hearts...Makes you question the game. Know in this day in age when to people use the word kingdom? I've never even heard the word empire used unless people were punning at the united states government. Anyways Kingdom makes you think of faries and nonsense...hence disney and their perverted godness. Hearts makes you think of a smelly old love story..Or a great classic card game!! So if the name doesnt drive you away lets see what does.Upon further dissection the game is simply compiled of a gay character who looks like a cheaply made version of all the Final Fantasy characters. Now for a lot of you readers maybe I should have told you this before but if you don't like Final Fantasy you might...I mean you won't like this game at all. The truth of the matter is, that this game is a fantasy of its own. A bunch of fantasy looking characters hanging out with the queers of Disney. How fun!! So the theme of the game is to search for your gay lover....Actually I never took the time to understand the point of the game though I believe it had to do with searching. Nevertheless the gay characters will pretty much make you want to go and buy Soul Reaver its that bad!! Squaresoft has outdone itself this time. Teaming up with disney must have been a sign of Squaresoft reaching rock bottom. Their time on deathrow was almost up but with Disney on their back nothing is to fear. So they made up some lame queerish characters and made a bad story and whipped it all together...hence \"Kindom Hearts\" How sad. When I remembered great classical games they took time and dedication...This game took a whole bunch of as*holes and just glued them together. The game is retarded as hell and I know for a fact that a 5 year old could throw up a better game then this.For your own saftey I would stay away from this game. Its cheap graphics, gameplay, music, characters....there are just so many aspects of this game that suck its so hard for me to tell you. But seriously if your that bored to buy this game sure do it. But you'll have 50X more fun buy breaking it with a hammer:)","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2005"}

Great graphics, interesting characters, awesome gameplay. It doesn't get any better than this. The weapons-focused combat is also an absolute plus for me.Pros:-Some of the best graphics out there.-Sound is unparralelled. Necrid especially can realy rumble the subwoofers if you have any decent surround sound setup.-Controls are easy enough that new players and button-mashers can latch on instatly, while still offering tons of depth for experienced players.-Tons of unlockables reward you for playing the singleplayer mode, which is fun and worthwhile in itself. Yes, you &quot;buy&quot; most every unlockable in the game- but trust me, the system works.-Lots of stages and unlockable costumes/items/stages/etc make multiplayer an absolute blast.-XBox gets a unique custom character, Todd McFarlane's spawn. With an axe, fireballs, and levitation moves, spawn brings a new twist to Soul Calibur (while remaining a surprisingly balanced characer)-Everything has a counter. The game featues tons of options for sidestepping or blocking or counter-attacking. There is no &quot;one attack&quot; that can win a game. But, every character does have a core set of good moves- meaning everything is balanced and both offensive and defensive tactics are perfectly valid in this game.Cons:-The controls are a little too forgiving for beginners. Some players wind up claiming you can get through the whole game just mashing buttons. And you can, but see my note at the end.-Only one &quot;unique&quot; character per system. XBox got Spawn, and Spawn rules, but if you want Link or Heihachi you'll have to check out another version.-Fans of hand-to-hand combat and &quot;Tag&quot; style multiplayer need not apply. Soul Calibur has tons of modes, just not these modes.Note on button-mashing: Although you can certainly do fairly well, I can personally attest to the fact that someone who masters the controls really has an authorative edge. When my button-mashing fiancee (who could beat quite a few of her friends) told me I wasn't allowed to take it easy on her, I beat her something like 20-0, and did it &quot;playing fair&quot; and choosing random characters. So yes, button-mashers can fair well but they can't hold a candle to someone who bothers to really learn the control system.If you're looking for &quot;that one fighting game&quot; you can play, this is it. The graphics, the gameplay... it's just good. Did I mention there's a decent story line behind it all? SC2 is worth what you pay and tons more- I can't reccomend it enough.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2004"}

Boy, do you want to challenge a play when a defensive lineman hits you when are throwing the ball...so instead of a forward pass incomplete, you get a fumble and they run it back for a touchdown...very frustrating.  Besides that, EA took a lot of other features of game playing out...John Madden himself is not even the announcer now (unless you call his plays when play calling).There are many more they left out of the game, but one of my other biggie was there is NO vibration feedback at all!  EA even stated that they didn't have vibration feedback for this particular game...talk about \"next-gen\" huh.

Graphics are important, challenging tracks, stiff competition, realistic sound.The cars sound realistic and that's it.  The story line and goals are not even clear cut with Undercover.  You are supposed to infiltrate this gang of racers but you don't know where you are on the road to doing that.  After the initial cut screens you are on the street.  You can drive and get the police chasing you.  If you evade you are given wheelman pointts and cash to be used to upgrade your cars later.  There should be a wheelman point tracker to let you know how you're doing with those points you earn.  Or let you know how close you are to earning the trust of the \"organization\".While on the street the down button will highlight with a race invitation against those in the organization.  You press it and are transported to the race without having to drive to the location.I've gotten to level 6 and the races are not challening at all.  In a few you are one-on-one and have to win by 1000 feet driving on a busy highway.  In another one-on-one you have to stay ahead for one minute; the leader can go any route he wants.  In group races it's been easy to dominate and win by 20 seconds or more.  You sometimes get a bonus for winning big.The graphics are lacking considering the PS3 is in HD.  The city you drive in is pretty drab except for the cut scenes.Update:  I've gone all the way through now and am at 31% of going through a second time.  The races get more challenging after level 10-12.  The police get better. A few of the races near the bitter end are elite level.One disappointment is you have about 30-40 cars you can buy but tier 3, 2, and 1 cars are locked for a very long duration.

It wasn't anything special, but it was a fun game.  Then CoD2 on the 360, CoD4 on the same console & the PS3, and eventually Modern Warfare 2.  If you haven't read my review on that game, long story short, I hate it.  So I'm not too excited about playing this for the first time thanks to the nasty taste Modern Warfare 2 left in my mouth, but after playing it over friend's rooms multiple times, I ended up buying the game.I have to say, Treyarch did what Infinity Ward couldn't...make a decent Call of Duty game.  Let's start off with the single player.For one, the story actually makes sense.  It's actually told in past-tense until a certain part of the campaign (literally right before the very end) let's you know what is really going on.  You play a character named Mason who's been tied up in a mysterious room and is being interrogated by two unknown people.  This is how the main menu even looks.  Where it says \"Campaign, Multiplayer\", you can look around the room, and look down at your character as he's tied up.  It doesn't affect my rating, but I do think this was a nice feature.  But anyway, the game takes place during the days of JFK/Lyndon B Johnson's presidencies.  As we all know (or should know) about the Bay of Pigs, this game let's you play as one of those assigned to assassinate Fidel Castro back in the 60's, only to see the attempt fail miserably (in reality, those that participated were executed).  I wish I could go into greater detail, but I can't without spoiling the game.  However I will say that Treyarch made the campaign just a tad bid longer than Modern Warfare 2 (took me six hours on Normal), and the story is easy(er) to follow.  Again, you won't fully understand what's going on until the very end when the game basically goes \"This is why Mason's being interrogated, and this is why everything happened the way it did up to this point\".Now for those that couldn't care about the singleplayer, this part is for you.  How does the multiplayer compare to Modern Warfare 2?It's amazing!  For one, the online is more balanced than Modern Warfare 2.  No longer can you do too much with everything while people abuse it.  They also took out the perk that increased bullet damage (I can't remember the name of it....that's how much I miss it), but kept those that allow deeper bullet penetration, Ninja, Scavenger, and just renamed some perks that do mostly the same thing as the ones in Modern Warfare 2, but with various twist.  For example, the one that lets you have two attachments to a gun also provides you with two Lethal projectiles (Frags, Semtex, etc.) and two Tactical projectiles (Nova gas, stun grenades, etc.).  Combine that with Scavenger and you can continue to replenish your two projectile types.  It doesn't get abused due to the fact that using them doesn't always work to your advantage, even if you're smart and cook your frags or wait to use them.  If you throw two flash bangs, you can still be shot straight through them and be killed (I would know..I've done it), and frag grenades don't always guarantee a kill.Another thing that's done right is the reduced lag compared to the last CoD.  Yes, it's still there, and yes, sometimes the host will quit the game, but being stabbed miles away from the person no longer exists, people hardly camp in every corner on maps, and you can't have shotguns as secondaries anymore.  Machine pistols have also been eliminated.  One thing that is a negative is bullet registration.  While not as bad as MW2, sometimes you can shoot at someone directly, but still miss.  This is mainly due to the insane recoil experienced while being shot.  It'll turn a chest shot into one that goes inches above the head, resulting in a death.  Other times, like when using the M16, shots just won't register at all, and you have to fire another burst to kill them.  While annoying, it doesn't hamper my playing style, and you learn to work around it (such as aiming down at the feet, just in case the recoil sends your gun upwards).  Also, the maps are more open instead of being closed off like MW2.  By open, I mean there's alot more room to run around, but not alot to sit there and hide from people.  They also included Wager Matches, games you bet your COD points (monetary system in the game), and placing Third or better grants you a profit.  Gun Game pits you against five other players, and the first person to get a kill with all 20 weapons (once you kill someone with a gun, they give you another one), wins.  Another one is One In The Chamber.  This game gives you three lives and one bullet to work with.  Killing people (shooting them or stabbing them) gives you another bullet, and the last man standing wins.  So you have your usual Domination, TDM, CTF, and Headquarter games, but they also threw in a few new ones to keep the online fresh for months to come.The only reasons I gave this four stars is the bullet issues mentioned above, issues with lag are still there, and the campaign is still too short for my liking.  It's understandable to focus on the selling point of the game, but that doesn't mean the game can't have an amazing campaign.  It's great, but not an \"OMG!! I wanna play that again\" campaign.

Frye","summary":"An awesome Zombies mode is backed up by some of the best competitive multiplayer on the planet.","reviewText":"I was cautious upon buying Black Ops, mostly due to my reputation of the original Modern Warfare. I bought the original Modern Warfare a few months ago, and it was decent, but was still a letdown. The campaign was fun, but the competitive multiplayer was terrible, with unbalanced gameplay, and mediocre maps. Since I figured MW2 would be the same (they share titles), I skipped it, and went on to Black Ops. So, was Black Ops another letdown, or was it fun, enjoyable, and balanced?Black Ops is some of the most fun I've had in a video game for a long while, and even that might be an understatement.Not that it's perfect; the campaign leaves much to be desired. While MW1 had terrible multiplayer, the campaign was a blast. The campaign in Black Ops, however, is a boring and bland experience. The story didn't grab me and pull me in like in MW1. After I completed the Vorkuta level, I just gave up on it.None of these problems carry over to the online componet of the game, however. This is some of the most engrossing, action-packed competitive multiplayer on the planet, and it's complemented with a host of features, such as the groundbreaking Wager and Theater modes, fantastic maps, and plenty of unlockable weapons, attachments, camoflouge, face paint, perks, equipment, killstreak rewards... I could go on and on.The variety of game modes at your disposal is staggering. My two personal favorites are Domination (capture three flags. Earn points for holding them) and Sabotage (A neutral bomb is placed in the middle of the map. Grab the bomb, and plant it in the enemy base within the time limit). If these modes don't catch your fancy, you also have game modes such as team deathmatch, free-for-all, demolition, etc.Wager match is another cool feature. After every match, you gain a type of currency called CoD points. You can use these points to buy new weapons and gear, or you can gamble with them in Wager match. There are four game modes in Wager match, and they are all unique twists on free-for-all. One in the Chamber is a mode where you are restricted to a pistol. You start out with a bullet and three lives. You recieve one bullet after each kill. This is by far the most tense of the four, and is as hard as it is fun. Sticks and Stones has you equiped with an explosive crossbow, and knife, and a tomahawk. Tomahawk kills reset an enemies score to zero. This mode is fun, but not quite as appealing as the other three modes.The last two are the best. Gun game (my favorite) has you starting out with a python. With each kill, you get a different gun. Knife kills demote players to their previous weapon. The first person to get a kill with every weapon wins. This is a tense and rewarding mode, and the best of the four. And finally, Sharpshooter startes you out with a weapon. Weapons switch every 45 seconds, and kill streakes earn you perks. Highest scoring player wins. This mode is very similar to Gun game, but is still entertaining.Remember, you're gambling in these modes, so it costs a certain amount of Cod points to play. You can select between low, medium, and high buy-in fees; the higher the amount paid, the bigger the reward.Another feature worth mentioning are contracts. You can pay a certain amount of CoD points to get a contract (it varies depending on the contract). A simple contract might ask you to get two kills from a far distance, while a more expensive one might ask for 11 headshots in a row with a certain sniper rifle. This system is a nice addition, but is ultimately unneseccary.And now we come to Theater mode. This might be the most groundbreaking feature Black Ops has to offer. The game saves every game you play. At any time, you can go back, rewatch a match you played, look for a cool kill, record the kill from either a first-person, third-person, or free camera perspective, save the clip, and upload it to the community to share it with friends. That is incredible. You can also pause time and take screenshots, and view the game from another players perspective.So, I've covered all of Black Ops. Or have I? Yes, there is even more. There is the epic Zombies mode.Zombies mode is exactly like it sounds: survive a horde of zombies. This doesn't exactly fit with the rest of the game, but when it is this fun, who cares? You can buy weapons on the walls with the points you earn for killing the zombies. The zombies grow in both strength and numbers as the rounds pass by, so if you have medical problems when under pressure, be sure to check with your doctor before you play.If it's not the bliss gameplay of the Zombies mode that make it fun, it's the hilarious dialogue that the characters constantly say. The mode is four player co-op, which means there are always four people saying the most hilarious things. Try the zombies mode in the pentagon for example. You have J.F.K, Robert Mcnamara, President Nixon, and Fidel Castro constantly talking. And it is flat out HILARIOUS!!!!!!!I would pay full price just for the zombies mode. I am not kidding. There are three different scenarios to fight zombies in (five, if you count Ascension and Call of the Dead, DLC maps), and each one is massive. Expect a lot of replay value in Zombies.Overall, this is one of the best games I've ever played, and certainly an impressive game. While the campaign is not that great, the multiplayer and Zombies are truly some of the most fun I've ever had. This game is an absolute must-have, whether you like zombies or competitive multiplayer action.PS: You might want to rent it if you are a solo player. This is pretty much an online focused game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2011"}

Not recommended unless you have not played the console versions.","reviewText":"This is a review strictly about the quality of the port. Borderlands 2 itself is an excellent game that deserves 5 starts. If you want to read a review of it there are many good ones under PS3 or X360 version.Let's keep the review short:The good: a full game, comes with all DLC so far, and it's enjoyable as always. Co-op is here, even though it is reduced to 2-men. Cross save is a nice touch, I can just use my max level characters from PS3.The bad: The graphic quality is just OK. I'm not expecting console quality but even for a handheld game it is very muddy and the texture resolutions are reduced drastically to accommodate the VITA's ability. Some changes are very noticeable such as enemies just vanish into a blood stain when they die. Sound quality also suffers. Music, voice over and sound effects are noticeably low bit-rate.These issues I can tolerate, however frame rate issue is a DEAL BREAKER. I played the beginning part of the game to Sanctuary, which is roughtly 40 minutes of play time. The majority of time the FPS is below 30, probably around 20 per my guessing. Low FPS in first person shooter makes me feel dizzy. Also it even lags at times, for instance you shoot a bullet to an enemy 10 meters away, roughly 0.5 second later you see a \"critical hit\" pops up. This should happen as soon as you pull the trigger. Hiccups are here and there: when you pass a save point, when multiple enemies in the screen, even when you bring out your character menu, you notice a small slow down.I was really looking forward to enjoy my handheld borderlands experience, but the technical issues, specifically the frame rate issue, made me regret making the purchase. Unless you have not experienced the game at all, I won't recommend you picking this up, at least not a full price $39.99.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2014"}

I sucked at it and it took over a month for me to finish it. But what an experience. I can still remember the intense moments where I had to jump off cliff, solving a puzzle by death or fighting a T-rex to survive. Now I am over 30 and I still like gaming. Things have turned into well.. things quite differently. This Lara is not the Lara I remember of course. The story actually contradicts to what I have learned about Lara and her history (by playing through 5 games of early Tomb raider series including the one with teen Lara).  This game is interesting and it took a lot of elements done right by some other games. I had good time despite a few moments where I find the story a bit underwhelming.

I played only the original Rayman on the PlayStation way back when, so this revamp of the character was a fresh and colorful experience. I wish Crash and Spyro would get the same treatment, which they inarguably deserve (Skylanders doesn't count).The first thing to jump out at you is the lush animation. It's top-notch, and combined with Rayman's tight controls and environment it's a rich game overall. The sequel is great and begins not too long after the first game. The introduction of more playable characters and the over-world map and paintings (a la Super Mario side-scrollers and Super Mario 64) make the game overall tighter to play and easier to keep track of your 100% goal.It's brutally easy in the beginning, but that's if you're not looking to get everything. There are certainly challenges for every level of skilled gamer, and the controls are just like a Mario game: a dream and an extension of your muscle memory.Age-wise, it's perfect for anybody. The gameplay, humor, and absolutely gorgeous graphics should no doubt appeal to all gamers, especially fans of the older Rayman games. And those who haven't played Origins, it's not necessary to play it before Legends although I strongly recommend you do.I have the PS3 version, obviously, and it looks great on my LCD TV.

You may call it SvR2005 if you want. It sure was a big improvement in a lot of areas over the previous 3 Smackdown games on PS2. However, how does the game pull up now that it's had 6 sequels come out since this release? Well, lets put it this way, if you had never played a SvsR game, or owned one, and you asked which SvR game I thought was the best, I would recommend highly to go with 2007, 2008 or 2011. However I would still recommend this original version over 2009 & 2010.Having started later in the series with these games, I was going backwards catching up with earlier titles, yet I was surprised even tho the controls keep changing and not for the better, 07 & 06 still had some redeeming qualities about them to give them the thumbs up and not say they are the outdated inferior versions. 2006 I found as a breath of fresh air because of a certain outdoor Wrestlemania arena which is something that every other version of this game really needed. An arena that didn't feel like every other arena you play in. However in 2005, this game, there is a few things THQ tried out that make me wonder why they never tried more with it later on? In most of the SvR games if you head up the ramp and towards the stage/screen area, you are limited to where you can go. Something I had no idea why they did, since the early Smackdown games allowed you to even exit to backstage from there, but here in 2006, not all the arenas are exactly the same. In a few areas, you might find the announce table is up in a pit between the stage, the ramp and the audience. So it just makes me wonder why THQ never further developed these areas and instead ignored that area completely in future games.In SvR2006, you had to use 2 buttons at the same time to Irish whip an opponent, however, here in the original, it's a one button whip. Why would they change that for 2006? They had it done right, right here already. bone head mystery that one.The legends in this game are a decent selection. The Road Warriors (Legion of Doom), Bret Hart, Superfly Jimmy Snuka, Andre The Giant, Brutas the Barber Beefcake, Mankind, The Rock, Masked Kane and Legend Undertaker. Keep in mind, some wrestlers where still active at the time, so HBK & Triple-H are not left out. However it does surprise me ALOT that Stone Cold Steve Austin is nowhere to be found in this game. I don't know if there was a conflict at the time, or not, but it was a dumb idea to not include him. Least he's in the next one and most of them after that. There is also No Hulk Hogan! However, I don't think he was still with the company at the time this game came out.Some interesting inclusions are also in the game. It's the only one with Sable in it. Even tho her representation hardly looks like her. I don't think Molly Holly had been in any other SvR, however, even with the inclusion of great wrestlers to play as, we have to go onto the controls and game play now.The controls are not the worst, however some things are pretty poor. Striking moves have too much of an arcade feel to them. It feels like the original smackdown series on PSX. Heck, it even seems like WWF Warzone/Attitude on 64/PSX. The pace needed to be slowed down alot, and not be rushing like everything has to be played in fast forward. It's something these games didn't get quite right until 2007. Next is the way standing finishers are performed. You have to have your opponents sort of stunned before you can do it, and it's annoying you can't always get it off right. This was the only version of the SvR game where i felt the finisher situation was a bad idea the way it worked. Even the original 3 PS2 Smackdown games had a bad way to do finishers, but in this one, you couldn't even reverse an irish-whip to get into that state, so it went down hill compared to the previous games.This is also the only SvR game that has the official Bra & Panties match. 2006 did have a fulfill your fantasy match which was similar, however that match is probably the dumbest idea for a game version in the history of wrestling video games. The one here in 2005, the second. It's a pointless match where you just rip your female opponents cloths off to reveal their undies to win the match. Glad it was never brought back in any other version of SvR quite frankly.Graphics: Compared to the original 3 PS2 Smackdown games. The graphics have been improved a lot. Then again, compared to the other 6 versions, they are the worst.Sound  : Sounds are OK, however the commentary is very buggy and half the time you hear Tazz talking and replying to no one, as Michael Cole's audio seems to be missing half the time. The music is the wrestlers music of the time, with a couple of actual band songs and what not, same as every other version. Ric Flair's music seems to be a generic versions of his 2001 Space Odyssey theme... guess they couldn't obtain the rights? LOD is not the original theme, I think it's LOD 2000. Wish they had included the original instead, sounds much better.Overall: I would recommend you try just about every other version of this game before this one. And then again, only go back to this one if you have played the heck out of every other version, and are curious to know what it started off like. The only cool thing really to check out is the way Arenas where set out or try out the wrestlers you couldn't in other versions. But put it this way, even tho this is not the worst in the SvR series, it is far from being the best. Especially since you can't adjust AI settings, and the computer can be annoying taking over and reversing everything, or pulling a finisher out of no where. Not to mention just wont lay down or give you time to set anything up.Ranking from best to worst.#1 - 2007#2 - 2008#3 - 2011#4 - 2006#5 - Any of the original 3 Smackdown games.#6 - 2005#7 - 2009 + 2010However, some people may not feel the same way about 2009 & 2010 as I did, but making a glitched game and then almost cloning it the next year doesn't make me want to place them higher than 2006's position.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2013"}

But when it pops in (you could wait a while) it looks good, if not great.Another problem is the hit detection. Normaly in games one hit with a shotgun is enough to kill someone right? Not in killzone it isnt! You have to shoot them three to four times with it before they die! This is perhaps the most agravating thing about the game. If you are sniping, it takes three headshots to kill someone! WTF?? Then it takes one hit in the arm with the pistol to kill someone???? Need I say more??If you take away all the glitches, it is still a fun game worth a rental.Concept- Make the one and only Halo killer, but fail misriblyPresintation- 8.5- The Menues are nice and are simplistic. Box art is good too.Graphics- 7.6- The indoor levels get a 9.0 cause it looks good, but the outdoor parts of the game is unbearable.Sound-9.0- Easily the high point of the title, the ambient sounds are great, the voicovers a little corny, but otherwise great.Playability- 8.0- It is easy to controll, but the hiit detection fricken sucks!Entertainment- 7.7- It overall an above average game.Replay Value- 8.0- It has good multiplayer modes, but once again, the hit detection sucks.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00DC7G0GG","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Among the Best the Wii U Has to Offer","reviewText":"The Good:+The perfect blend of 2D and 3D Mario action+Really creative levels+New power ups are welcome+Lots of levels to explore and secrets to unlock+Simple gameplayThe Bad:-Some jumps are easy to misjudge-There is a really low challenge level to the game.  Lots of fun, but there's no need to coddle inexperienced players by giving them an item that completely takes away the challenge when the challenge here is fairly lowA couple of years ago on the 3DS there was a game called Super Mario 3D Land that came out, sold millions of copies and was regarded as one of Mario's finest adventures.  It was the perfect blend of what made the side scrolling Mario games so good mixed with the fun and exploration of the three dimensional Mario games.  It was a great hybrid that help remind us that Mario games are still fun nearly three decades later.  Super Mario 3D World continues what Mario 3D Land started, but it's a lot more creative and a lot more enthralling as a result.  Make no mistakes, this is one of Mario's best outings.One usually doesn't pick up a Mario game expecting story.  The same is true of 3D World.  What does change, however, is that this time Princess Peach isn't getting kidnapped.  Instead, Mario, Luigi, Peach and Toad are out exploring when they meet the Sprixie princess.  Suddenly Bowser shows up and kidnaps her.  So Mario and company go to the Sprixie Kingdom to save her.  As I said, Mario is never much for story.  It's all about the gameplay.  And here things go quite smoothly for Mario.  For those who picked up 3D Land everything about the basic gameplay will be familiar.  There are a couple of tweaks and additions that are nice, however.  Some that you might be wondering why Mario didn't do this ages ago.Like before, there is a world map.  Although this time around you aren't confided to just the basic path.  You can free roam the map and play some levels out of order. Each level has three green stars to collect, which more or less replace the star coins found in other Mario outings.  They help to unlock other levels as you progress.  Roaming the world map helps to establish that exploration is pretty important here and you'll find it in some of the levels as well.  There are mystery houses to go to and sometimes even puzzles to solve.  But best of all, it provides this sense that we're not just barreling down one path as we did before.  The levels themselves aren't too terribly long, but there is a huge variety of them, many of which you'll have to play a second time just to get a hold of all those stars and sometimes just to find things you may have missed.Mario 3D World allows you to play as four different characters.  Mario, Luigi, Toad or Peach.  Like Super Mario Bros. 2 the four have the same basic moves, but have different variations in some areas.  Mario is balanced in everything, for instance.  But Luigi jumps higher and falls slower.  Toad runs faster than everyone else while Peach can hover for a brief period of time.  There are many ways to approach a level, but you'll find that in some instances using one character is clearly better than another.  Everyone does, however, have the same basic move set.  Ground pounds, wall jumps and the like are all present.  Up to four players can team up at once and go around causing mayhem.  You can cooperate with each other and compete.  It's often far too tempting to mess your friends up just as much as help them.  As with New Super Mario Bros. you'll have fun with friends, but the game is certainly far more rewarding a solo experience.  The gamepad isn't neglected.  It can be used to reveal hidden secrets or stop enemies for a time, but it's hardly ever essential to the experience of the game.Returning once again is the &#34;suit&#34; system which allows Mario to transform.  Most everything here is pretty familiar.  Once again you have the fire flower and the mushroom.  Also returning is the Mega Mushroom and the Tanooki suit which will certainly make successful jumps a lot easier.  Most of these are brought directly from 3D Land and New Super Mario Bros.  The newest addition here is the cat suit which Mario and his allies can use to climb walls (or scale a flagpole at the end of a level).  There is also the cherry which make a duplicate Mario that can all be controlled by a single player.  These are awesome additions but they're not mind blowing additions unfortunately.  Mario is still impressive, but there is something to be said about the over-reliance on the tried and true as opposed to adding too many new things.  The level designs more than make up for this, but it's still quite sad that in this regard, Mario has made a significant leap in a long time.  At least it's all fun and really well designed and comes together in a strikingly good way.The only downside to all this is that Mario 3D World can sometimes be difficult because of how it is to judge jumps.  If you're not closely looking at your shadow or have a Tanooki suit you'll find some jumps can feel a bit off.  This isn't a huge problem as it is.  And even if it were, Mario 3D World is a far too forgiving game for it to give anyone any trouble.  The game is quite generous about giving you extra lives.  But more than that, Nintendo persists in giving players a leg up should they fail too many times.  If you die too often you'll get a white Tanooki suit which makes you invincible and able to coax through the level with no worries whatsoever.  You aren't obligated to take this option by any means... but by now the idea of the &#34;Super Guide&#34; (or pity token as I call it) is just sad.  In a game that gives you so many extra lives and isn't that punishing in the first place, players aren't likely to actually need this.Visually Mario is much more reliant on its aesthetic quality rather than it's outright power.  It's definitely a great looking game on all fronts, but the levels themselves and the characters benefit more from their artistic design.  It's got that charming cartoony look to it.  It's a good looking game with some really well designed stages.  The soundtrack, as always, is catchy.  Providing us with some nice new tunes while remixing familiar ones.There are some pretty cool creative choices and leaps for Super Mario 3D World.  The only thing that really keeps it down is that while it has some nice new additions, so much of it is relying quite heavily on what we've already grown familiar with in the Mario realm.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing because the levels are still fantastically creative.  Likewise, that blend of 2D and 3D Mario gameplay helps old and new fans alike really jump into the game.  For Mario fans, 3D World is a must own game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

After playing 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, Tactics and the first Tactics Advance game, I must say that this game is still my favorite Final Fantasy. It's spectacular. And while I honestly don't think I could play through the game again today it still holds up as one of the best games I've ever played. Definitely the best RPG game I've ever played. If I hadn't booted it up and played it so much in the past I might feel different about owning it again. However, if you've never played the game (do you live under a rock?!) then it's really a great idea to try it somehow.

Rhodes","summary":"One of the Finest RPG Outings","reviewText":"Pros+A Very Deep, Engrossing and Heartfelt story+Memorable characters+Very Customizable game+Enriching soundtrack+Very detailed cinematics and incredible looking pre-rendered backgrouns+Tons and tons of optional things to doCons-The characters may be memorable, but the game does little to develop them beyond a certain point-There's no big incentive to use one character over another-It may very well be one of the easiest Final Fantasy games in the seriesAfter eleven years, Final Fantasy VII still manages to be a beast in the RPG field.  Boasting a colossal story and a few memorable characters.  Final Fantasy VII is the game which made the JRPG genre big in the West and eleven years later it still ranks as one of the greatest games of all time.Final Fantasy VII centers on Cloud Strife.  A mercenary who has joined the rebelious group known as AVALANCHE, who are taking on the Shinra Corporation, that is slowly draining the planet of its life.  The story all comes together by Cloud's mysterious past, a terrifying villain and some heartfelt characters.  The story of Final Fantasy VII spans so much more than just an evil Corporation.  You'll eventually find yourself on a journey that involves you saving the world.  Even compared to today, Final Fantasy VII is an RPG that breaks the rules of traditional storytelling.  Rather than being a band of teenagers out to stop some evil adults (as the JRPG has been drowned out in in recent years), Final Fantasy VII puts you in the role of characters about something more.  If there were any criticism of the story, it would be that it's a lot to take in.  Some things never really come together in the end and you'll be left with a lot of burning questions.  Much of this, you can bet, is due to some of Final Fantasy VII's shoddy translation.  There were some pieces in the localization process that were left out entirely and make the story come off as a little more sloppy than it was intended to.  Another small criticism comes with its characters.  While they're memorable, they often times take a backseat to some of the stories progression.  Once we learn what we need to learn about certain characters, the game never really touches them or makes them integral to the plot itself again.  If it weren't for their stark personalities, funny quips and own charms, you might forget them.Ever since Final Fantasy IV, the series has used the ATB battle system and Final Fantasy VII is no exception.  Every character has an ATB gauge that lets them take action once it's filled.  Pretty basic, but Final Fantasy VII gets a bump by being very customizable.  The Materia system allows for nearly endless possibilities for its characters.  There are several different kinds of Materia.  There's your basic magic materia that give you spells to cast, but there is also materia to give you more battle commands such as being able to steal or throw items at an enemy.  There are other materia there just to boost your stats and others that enhance your spells by giving you the ability to hit all the enemies at once or to absorb health from your enemies.  There are far more in each category and they give you infinite ways to play Final Fantasy VII.Without materia, though, your characters are naked and can only attack.  This brings about small problem.  The first being that there's is no incentive to use any one character above another.  Final Fantasy VII remedies this by givng its character ultra powerful limit breaks.  Every character has a limit gauge and when it fills up as they take damage.  When full they can let forth a brutal attack.  Characters also have limit levels for different limit breaks and the higher the Limit Level the more damage you have to take before its full.  Unfortunately, this is all that makes any character different in battle.  Materia gives them legs, but you can always transfer over anyone else's materia to anyone else.  In the long run this won't bother anyone, but it leads to a lack of variety in the characters and you more than likely won't need limit breaks that much to begin with.  Final Fantasy VII's pros more than outnumber the cons.  The amount of customization is great, but it still would've been nice to need one character's ability over another.Final Fantasy VII is by no means a hard game.  It is arguably one of the easiest games in the series.  In particular, the final battle turns out to be one of the easiest fights in the game against someone who has often been labeled one of the most threatening in history.  Yet Final Fantasy VII makes for that with several hidden goodies.  You won't find too many optional dungeons in Final Fantasy VII, but you will find an incredible number of optional things to do off the beaten path.  From breeding and racing Chocobos, to finding hidden materia, to taking on ultra powerful bosses and even finding hidden characters who have more than just a face, but actually play into the story itself.  There are more secrets in Final Fantasy VII than even most RPGs of today.Graphically Final Fantasy VII is a mixed bag.  In 1997 these graphics were phenominal.  the pre-rendered backgrounds are still incredible looking even to this day.  The seventh Final Fantasy has a lot of style.  The polygons are charming though they don't look as cool as the rest of the environments.  The FMVs are still amazing and wonderfully detailed for its time.  There are a couple of moments of slowdown with Final Fantasy VII, however, and some of the summon animations can get lengthy and repetitive.  But they don't take away from its wildly detaile environments.The music score may actually be the most rewarding thing for Final Fantasy VII.  The music score manages to fill the situations for the right moment.  But it also isn't afraid to showcase a lot of emotion either.  There are some moments where it can be dark and others where it's very light.  In particular, the character themes are really nice and memorable.  Final Fantasy VII doesn't have the best soundtrack within the series, but it has some of the most memorable music numbers of the entire series.After eleven years Final Fantasy VII is still a force to be reckoned with.  There are a few gaps in its storyline that you may have to read a bit more deeply to learn about (as not all of it is within the game itself, but if anything confuses you there have been countless FAQs written as well as spin-offs and sequels) and it shuns some of its characters at points, but the package is still one of the best Playstation outings of all time, and every gamer should pick up and play Final Fantasy VII at least once.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYV70","description":"","reviewerName":"Bowman373","summary":"Just About the Best Single Player Experience EVER!","reviewText":"SHORT REVIEW:Far Cry 3 is, without a doubt, the best single player I've ever played. There are endless possibilities with how you play, and I can personally guarantee you that no two people will play it the same way. This is a great example of a First-Person Tactical Shooter, as there is an unlimited amount of possibilities with how you approach a situation. The road to liberating all the outposts, activating all the radio towers, completing the main story (not to mention many side missions), and finding all Letters of the Lost and Relics is a long one indeed, and one which will be fun for the entire time you do it. Multiplayer is decent at best, but definitely nothing special here. If you're buying this strictly for the multiplayer (which I STRONGLY recommend you don't do), then it probably won't be worth it. But for the Story? No questions asked, buy this game now.CAMPAIGN: (no spoilers)This was the first Far Cry game that I had played, and while the transition from shooters like Battlefield and Halo was somewhat weird, I got the hang of it in no time. The story of Far Cry 3 is probably the best-crafted I've played! You are Jason Brody, young college student who went on a skydiving trip with his friends. Unfortunately, they landed on Rook Island, the closest thing to hell that they could get. After a daring escape from the ruthless pirate lord Vaas (essentially the coolest character in Far Cry 3), Jason finds himself caught between trying to save his friends and ascending up the ranks of the native tribe on the island, the Rakyat. As you've probably seen in advertisements for FC3, a big focus of Far Cry 3 is internal conflict and insanity, and there's some pretty dark stuff on Rook Island. There's tons of brutal killing, and some pretty disturbing stuff in here. I won't say any more about the story, but the point is, it's FANTASTIC. The voiice acting and characters are excellently played in this game, especially Vaas. Every character has his/her special traits, and you really begin to relate and become attached to some of them. FC3's campaign does a great job with emotion, and you'll feel many different things as you go along. The Crafting aspect of this game is very interesting, and you'll find that even gathering resources like leaves and animal skins is surprisingly entertaining! You can craft syringes for medical purposes along with enhanced hunting, combat, and exploration skills. You hunt and skin animals to make everything from Weapon Holsters, Ammo Pouches, Arrow Quivers, Wallets, and many more. In a sense, Far Cry 3 is all about upgrading your equipment and weapons, but there's a skill tree as well. After earning x amount of XP points, you can pick a skill from one of the three skill trees: The Heron (for long range takedowns and mobility), The Shark (assault takedowns and healing), and The Spider (stealth takedowns and survival). These all help in different ways, and it's completely up to you what path you choose to take, whether you want to specialize in one field or balance out the three. Along your journey, you also have a handbook, which automatically records what you've found out about people, factions, locations, weapons, animals, and many more! You can also track your progress with how far you've made it into the game, how many Letters of the Lost you've found, etc. The guns in this game are very cool, and there's an extremely wide variety of them to find. You can customize nearly every aspect of your gun, whether it's what sight you want on it, other attachments, or paint jobs. It's sometimes frustrating to accumulate enough to money to buy that gun that you've been eyeballing, but it's rewarding and satisfying every time. During (or before) a fight, you can use your camera to tag enemies, permanently marking them on the map (until they're dead, of course). This helps immensely when you're trying to be stealthy or hunt swift wild animals. 34 outposts are scattered throughout Rook Island, each filled with many enemies. It's up to you to liberate them by killing all the enemies there, which makes the surrounding region safe to travel. Each time you liberate one, you unlock one or two Path of the Hunter or Wanted Dead missions. In the former, you're tasked with hunting down either a very rare animal or eliminating a group of animals at a specified point, only using the weapons that are provided for you. Killing and skinning rare animals only available in Path of the Hunter quests gives you an exclusive skin not found anywhere else, which can be used to improve your equipment to its highest capacity. In Wanted Dead quests, you're tasked with finding and killing a pirate leader and his band nearby. You can do what you please to take out his subordinates, but you have to kill the commander with a knife only. You receive a cash reward upon completion of both of these types of quests. An automated store is also available in the outpost, which can be used to purchase or sell guns, attachments, and whatnot. It also provides another Fast Travel point for you, which can really come in handy later on in the game when you're jumping around the island a lot. 18 radio towers are located around Rook Island, each inactive at the start of the game. After locating and climbing (FPS platforming at its best!) these towers, you can activate them to reveal the surrounding region on the map and making a weapon or two available in stores free to buy. All of these objectives, along with the side missions, Trials of the Rakyat (fun little minigames found throughout the island), and  Supply Drop (vehicular quests where you have to drive to a specific point before time runs out), there is a vast number of things to do in FC3's single player.MULTIPLAYER/CO-OP/MAP EDITOR:Although the Campaign is astonishing, Far Cry 3 definitely isn't perfect. Its Multiplayer is pretty bland, not offering many new things to the FPS genre. It uses the same system of rank up, get upgrades, reach max level, unlock some new stuff. The gameplay itself is alright, though, and it can be a fun little amusement sometimes. However, Decoding is a pretty cool aspect of it. Decoding is a system in which after earning a specified amount of Decoding points in multiplayer, you will eventually unlock a memory drive that you can decode. You aren't actively doing it, but you do have to wait until it finishes. It can take 10 minutes up to 8 hours to decode! When completed, you unlock either XP for multiplayer or a free weapon attachment. You can either take these, gift them to a friend, or sell them for extra XP. Co-Op is also available in FC3, and it's a very entertaining side campaign, which takes place a few months before the main story. It can be played with up to 4 friends, and a matchmaking system is accessible as well. This can be a really fun distraction for a few hours, and it really brings the room together at a party. I actually haven't gotten the chance to use the Map Editor yet, but from what I've heard, it's very useful and fun.OVERVIEW:Far Cry 3 is an excellent game. Even if you buy one game a year, then you should definitely consider this one. Campaign is awesome, with its wide variety of things to do and emotion-packed story. Although Multiplayer is somewhat weak, and Co-Op is a short experience, they don't draw back from how good the Story is.95/100","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2013"}

It seems as though every one of the game's elements is incredibly well done, enjoyable, hilarious, and creative. In fact, I will pose no questions concerning the game's quality in this review because that would just feel wrong. Seriously, Bowser's Inside Story is pretty much the best DS game available to date, and is worth owning for just about anyone because just about anyone can find something (or many somethings) to love about it.Bowser's Inside Story's stage is set when a terrible disease called the Blorbs is spreading throughout the Mushroom Kingdom, causing Toads to inflate and become immobilized by their roundness and sheer size. Interrupting a meeting regarding what action should be taken to fight the disease, Bowser inhales the whole gang: Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toadsworth, and others, and then sets out to stop the evil and fury-filled Fawful from taking over the Mushroom Kingdom. The story is great because it's more than the average Bowser-steals-Peach cutscene, and puts more at stake than the Princess' place of residence.Well, the true reason the story is so great is really because it opens up plenty of opportunity for dialogue. The dialogue is just as brilliantly written as in the original Mario & Luigi game (Superstar Saga), causing the game to be just as hysterically funny as it is fun to play. Bowser's attitude is still cocky and his lines hilarious, and Fawful is probably the funniest villain in the history of video games with his many quotable and laugh-out-loud funny lines. Every character in the game also exemplifies a very particular and acute individuality just by the way their dialogue is written, giving the entire game a strong feeling of charm and personality.Bowser's Inside Story also has other strong elements to back up its story, the most important of which is the gameplay. Gameplay is split pretty evenly between Bowser and the bros. who are usually inside Bowser. Actual progress is made while playing as Bowser, but on many occasions progress is hampered by some obstacle or injury Bowser is unable to overcome. At that point, it's up to Mario and Luigi to figure out what's wrong with Bowser and how they can fix the issue from inside of him, which involves navigating a 2-D area of Bowser's body and playing a minigame of some kind. This pattern repeats a lot throughout the game but it works very nicely for balance and creativity.Playing as Bowser is just like playing as the bros. from previous games in the series in that the action is seen with a bird's eye view and 3-D environments. Bowser relies on pure power to get through his sections as he even lacks the ability to jump, resorting to punching and breathing fire. Playing as Bowser is a nice change of pace for the series and even the entire franchise; in fact this game could have just as easily been called 'Bowser's RPG of Awesomeness' (because we all know that's what Bowser would want it to be called).Gameplay as Mario & Luigi, however, involves navigating through 2-D stages inside Bowser, and this is where the game's creativity really shines. Exploring the vast internal structures of the Koopa King is just plain fun, with fresh, exciting, and creative puzzles awaiting in every area. Usually a 2-D section concludes with a minigame that will help Bowser in some way or another, such as activating his nasal passages to make him sneeze a miniature hurricane or reviving him when he has been crushed by a walking castle (believe it or not, there are actually a few of these in the game).Battles are as fun as they have ever been in a Mario RPG. The turn based system works wonderfully as always, granting players the ability to block or dodge enemy attacks and increase attack damage with precisely timed button presses. This timing element is enhanced in this game with a few levels of attack ratings that depend on exactness and do more damage. Bowser has the ability to punch, breathe fire, and summon minions for touch screen controlled attacks that are fun and effective. Mario and Luigi can jump, use a hammer, or team up for bros. attacks. These attacks still aren't quite as epic as they were in Superstar Saga, but they are certainly very creative with attacks that fire the bros. out of cannons and bash enemies with meteors. There are even several scenarios where Bowser can inhale an enemy for Mario and Luigi to fight inside of him, which links the two major parts of the game together nicely. Battles are great fun just as they have always been in the Mario & Luigi games, and the new levels of precision and ability to play as Bowser keeps it fresh. Bowser's Inside Story's gameplay is outstanding both in and outside of battle.Bowser's Inside Story also addresses a common grievance players had with its DS predecessor, Partners in Time, and that is the implementation of the DS' unique capabilities. Bowser's Inside Story is made much more as a DS game than Partners in Time was, using the touch screen in many creative ways. The minigames that aid Bowser are always unique and only have one or two slight control issues. Bowser also fights a few battles that are played holding the DS sideways and use the touch screen for command inputs, and these fights are totally epic and fun due to the sheer size of Bowser and the enemy and just how well they are executed on the part of the game developers. The DS' other unique features are also used well, such as the mike (used to breathe fire in the epic Bowser battles) and the other screen (used as a map).The quest to defeat Fawful's easily takes more than 20 hours. The game seems quite long, but when it ends players should find themselves wishing there was more. Unfortunately there really isn't more, and the game isn't terribly challenging to boot, but Bowser's Inside Story is definitely a game to replay just because of how fun it is. The game's epic moments and loads of chortles will certainly keep me coming back to it every once in a while as long as my DS still works.The graphics in the game aren't amazingly detailed, but they are lively, colorful, and charming. The vibrant use of color helps make it pleasing to the eye and the sharpness of all the objects and animations is fantastic too. The graphics also do a great job of displaying the game's awesome sense of humor, giving every character a unique and likable expression. In the end, Bowser's Inside Story's graphics enhance the game's other fantastic elements even if they aren't completely amazing in and of themselves.Bowser's Inside Story has some great sound effects and music that also contribute their fair share to the game's overall impression. The sound effects are nice and fit where they're placed, and there are even several occasions where a character will say a line verbally. These moments totally confirm suspicions players should already have about what these characters sound like as they fit perfectly to their personality as revealed in the dialogue. The music is also great, with plenty of fun and catchy tunes that go along with the action wonderfully.Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story is simply fantastic, and a complete redemption for the series after Partners in Time, which some players did not particularly enjoy. It brings the series back to the legendary status of the original Mario & Luigi game, almost surpassing it as greatest handheld game ever made. That, in my opinion, makes it the second best handheld game ever made, and the best DS game on the market. Just go and buy it now, because a DS owner's collection is simply incomplete if this hilarious, creative, and incredibly fun game is not in it.Positive:+ delightfully quirky story and hilarious dialogue+ Fawful is the main villain (this game has FURY!!!)+ wonderful sense of personality+ playing as Bowser is a nice change of pace+ many large areas to explore with very creative puzzles+ outstanding gameplay in and outside of battle+ the DS' capabilities are very well implemented+ lengthy quest that is tons of fun all throughout+ graphics and sound perfectly translate the game's personalityNegative:- a little too easy9.7/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2010"}

I had a sinking feeling when I heard that they had been bought out by EA, but remained hopeful that EA would allow them to continue to make the high quality immersive RPG'S I had grown to love. Honestly Bioware is the only reason I even still own a gaming console, but with each game released by Bioware, I am starting to realize that their heyday of making great RPG'S is a thing of the past and I think the Mass Effect trilogy stands as a testament to that. While I would say by comparison to their other games ME1 was mediocre at best it was still a decent overall RPG. ME2 showed a transition to more of a shooter and this one really completes that metamorphosis into a full on shooter.While Bioware games have alway been a bit linear in nature, but I never felt as if I was being forced down a path as you could explore pretty much at will. That's gone with this title and you are pretty much forced down a corridor. To make it worse minutes of dialogue seem to take place without you being given the chance to select what to say, so that element of you being your character has been dumbed down. I don't play shooters to really know, but I would say the mechanics (targeting and such) in this are horrible. Enemies seem to move fast and my aim feels soooo slow for instance.I don't know but after DA2 and now this game, I think it is time to start mourning the loss of Bioware and the top-notch immersive story telling RPG they pioneered.I hate you EA...I absolutely hate you for destroying what Bioware used to be.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2012"}

For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"KMW","summary":"NnyCW for Capcom City","reviewText":"Everyone knows by know the problems with the imfamous Resident Evil controls. But, if you can look past that, you'll find a very intresting, fun, exciting, challenging adventure game ripe with zombies and other creatures just asking to be killed by you. One of the best additions to this game (and one of the most annoying thanks to the controls) is the fact that zombies don't die until they've been burned to nothingness or you have destroyed the brain. Now, while that is great for people like myself who love zombies and love the added touch as it is more accurate to zombie lore, the controls and the fact that you can't your shots at their head means you're going to be using a lot of kerosine to burn a lot of zombies. (becuase of you don't...watch out.)

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs.

If you're one of the teeming fans who eagerly playedCrazy  Taxiin the arcade at a buck a pop, then this game is a must-buy, if only from a purely economic  standpoint. Even those who don't know the difference betweenCrazy Taxiand the long-running  TV seriesTaxiwill immediately recognize the appeal of this game. In fact, this game is so  impressive and addictive that it should easily convince a whole new wave of buyers to purchase a Sega  Dreamcast.What's so hot aboutCrazy Taxi? For starters, the graphics sport the most impressive re-creation of  a living city ever seen in a video game. The level of detail is astounding and never ceases to surprise the  player as block after unique block speeds by. The city is a distilled version of San Francisco with some  landmarks and neighborhoods left intact. Making it seem all the more real are apparent product placements  of real-world retail locations such as KFC, Tower Records, and Pizza Hut. And just about everything you  see on the screen is interactive: boxes, phone booths, and mailboxes topple when bumped or smashed,  pedestrians leap and tumble out of your path, and the myriad of traffic attempts to avoid your erratic  high-speed antics. While some driving games brag about a lack of boundaries, this one delivers--players  drive on the ocean floor, off the second floor of a parking garage, through parks, and down stairs. A helpful  hovering arrow points drivers in the correct direction, but you can truly drive wherever you want at any  time, making for tons of replay value.While the game is a direct port from the arcade game of the same name, there's plenty more depth in the  home version. In addition to the city that appears in the coin-op version, the Dreamcast version also  includes an entirely new city.Crazy Taxiincludes a trunk-load of mini-games that help to teach  drivers how to perform the special speed boosts and maneuvers in the game.Though this game would be plenty exciting without any sounds at all, it has an adrenaline-pumping  soundtrack supplied by punk crossover bands the Offspring and Bad Religion, as well as some good, if  sometimes monotonous, dialogue between the driver and the passengers.--Jeff YoungPros:Wonderful, realistic graphicsEasy to get into, and full of many long hours of addictive playEven more to offer than the fantastic arcade game upon which this is basedCons:On very few occasions players will encounter some graphic slowdown","reviewerName":"clifford goldenberg","summary":"ahh","reviewText":"this game is pretty much the same thing as the arcade version yawn.In fact there is nothing different about the dreamcast version or the arcade version.It was fun in the arcade but anybody who has played crazy taxi in the arcade will find the dreamcast version very boring.For people who have not played crazy taxi at the arcade i would strongly reccomend it but only in that situation.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-22-2001"}

{"product_name":"B00CH923NE","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"\"He has named himself... *dramatic pause*... DREAMY LUIGI!\"","reviewText":"I cannot begin to tell you how much of a breath of fresh air this lovely little gem is. I've had a Mario RPG itch that has only intensified afterPaper Mario: Sticker Starleft me disappointed by its lack of critical RPG elements, but finally, this game has delivered all I've waited for these last few years. While it's true thatPaper Mariowas originally meant to be the spiritual successor to the brillaint SNES gem,Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, it has been the zany, hilarious, kooky Mario and Luigi series that has truly continued the tradition of that SNES classic all those years ago. That makes sense, because the M&L; games have been made by the very same core team that made Super Mario RPG, from the game director right down to the musical composer, and dare-I-say it, this may be their best Mario and Luigi game yet. What a lovely experience, and a fulfilling RPG in general as well. I'm warning you right now, prepare for a detailed and somewhat lengthy review, there's a lot to cover. Skip this one if you don't like long, detailed reviews.The game begins with Mario and Luigi accompanying Peach and her royal entorage on a trip to the awe inspiring and mysterious Pi'illo island. The original citizens of this glorious empire have been gone for years, the story of their disappearance a total mystery, but they left behind ruins that reveal a culture with powers to channel the unlimited potential of dreams themselves. While visiting the current tennants of the Pi'illo kingdom, a new villain named Antasma shows up and, say it with me, kidnaps the princess, and absconds into the realm of dreams. As luck would have it, Luigi is a \"dreamboat\" (it is his year after all) and as such, he can sleep deeply enough to tap into the magic stone pillows all over the place. This allows him to create a portal into the dreamworld that Mario can jump into, and the adventure begins. During their quest to rescue Peach, they just might discover the fate of the true Pi'illo people and even help them. Bowzer may make an appearance or two. It's an engaging ride that you'll enjoy from start to finish. I'll leave it at that to avoid spoilers.As with any Mario and Luigi game, expect the characters to be lovable, the writing to be as sincerely hilarious and charming as you could imagine, and the localization to be among the best in the biz. The storytelling is simply fantastic. The game is quite wordy, sure, but every word will slap a big, stupid grin on your face for the majority of the time you spend playing. Little touches like Mario and Luigi speaking in super Italian gibberish or the two brothers hugging in a dream and Luigi on the bottom screen let out a big belly laugh while sleeping, is just so absolutely endearing. In many ways, Dream Team feels like Luigi's game. His importance in the story is prominent, as is his character development, and it's awesome. I lovedLuigi's Mansion: Dark Moon, but Dream Team feels like it develops him even more and paints him as a true hero even better than that game did (and LM was an amazing game that did this super well, so this is big praise to Dream Team). The way the game portrays Luigi and Mario's relationship as brothers is also quite endearing.The art design and graphics in this game merit a special mention. All past Mario and Luigi games have been entirely sprite-based, a very expressive graphical style to be sure, but a 2-D style nonetheless. Well, much to my surprise, much of this game is STILL 2-D sprite-based despite this being a 3DS game, famous for its, you know, 3-D. The ending result is pretty striking. All of the characters are still 2-D sprite-work, juxtaposed into a 3-D world and the results are stunning. The graphics have an almost claymation quality to them, and it's super unique and beautiful. The 3-D is also used to good effect in some battles where you will be facing the enemies from behind the bros., making juggling shells back and forth more dynamic than before. Everything else artistically is very similar to the past M&L; games, very colorful with excellent classic animation cartoon styles that channel classic Mario elements in new and refreshing ways. Lots of creativity in this game, to be sure. One of my all-time favorite story elements in fiction is when dream worlds are incorporated, because it allows for so much imagination and creativity, and boy are Luigi's dreams fantastically imaginative in this game. It's like Inception starring Luigi. I love it!I have to mention the sound design in this game. Of course, all of the sound effects are appropriately nostalgic for Mario fans, and hearing Mario and Luigi speak in super Italian gibberish still turns me into a smiling fool. That's all great, but the soundtrack is the real highlight. It is absolutely breathtaking. Yoko Shimomura has really nailed it with this one (she also composed the brilliant music for all previous M&L; games, Super Mario RPG, theKingdom Heartsseries, the masterpieceRadiant Historia, she's simply one of the best in the business). Many songs are fun, zany, and joyous as you'd expect from a Mario title, but some of the songs are surprisingly atmospheric and downright moody. I can't really say it enough: the soundtrack is awesome and the compositions are brilliant.Every M&L; game has a gimmick, and Dream Team's gimmick is right in its title. This one is all about Luigi's dreams. Half the game plays outside of the dream world in very traditional M&L; fashion. The core gameplay in Dream Team follows the classic M&L; playbook, and I'm very grateful for this after Paper Mario Sticker Star. The turn-based battle system is back, where you can make button inputs to increase effectiveness of your attacks and defense, while controlling both Mario and Luigi simultaneously. I've always loved the dynamic simplicity of this system. Whereas most JRPG battle systems are static and obviously turn based, M&L;'s battles are frantic, dynamic, and full of kinetic action, feeling very much like a traditional Mario experience. To put it simply, it's incredibly FUN. You gain experience points after battles, you level up, and you can acquire badges that add passive bonuses to your character, and the badge system has had a few overhauls and complexities that makes customization of the brothers a lot deeper than in past M&L; games.The other half takes place inside Luigi's dreams, where traversing the world is a 2-D affair (like it was inside Bowser in the last game) and everything is insane. Mario runs around these dreams in the top screen, while the bottom features Luigi sleeping. When Mario finds some problem impeding his process, try messing with Luigi on the bottom screen. Perhaps you need to yank on real Luigi's MustacheSuper Mario 64opening-screen-style on the touch screen to drag some dream-mustache-vines down to Mario to solve the puzzle. Other places require you to create dozens of Luigi's all stacked up on each other to boost Mario up high, or clump into a giant ball for Mario for run on. These sorts of dream-focused puzzles are so creative and out-of-the-box that it makes the game feel genuinely unique. While in the dream world, Luigi gains some truly epic benefits in battle too. Mario may attack once, but follow up button press attacks may feature dozens of Luigis raining down righteous foot-stomping fury on your enemies. Do you realize how awesome that is? Remember the unspeakably epic Godzilla Bowser boss fights inBowser's Inside Story? Yeah, those return, but this time it's Weegee that gets to duke it out Godzilla style in his dreams. Trust me, it's awesome.Really, the only thing I overtly dislike about this game is that it is a little too tutorial-heavy. Some games have tutorial overkill, filled with \"yeah, I get it\" moments, and Dream Team is definitely one of those games in the beginning. This makes the opening a bit slower and drawn-out than I normally prefer, but oh well. I understand that this makes the game more accessible to younger or less-experienced gamers and I commend that, but in my opinion, it's a bit much here. Still, when your only complaint about a game is that the first two or three hours have a few too many tutorials, that's a sign that the majority of the game is fantastic, and it is here, but I have to find something critical to say, right?I know this review is long, but seriously, I've barely brushed the surface of this awesome game. In an industry where creativity is stagnant at best, all for the sake of being profitable, a game like Mario and Luigi Dream Team is such a refreshing breath of sweet air. While this may feature characters that have been around for decades, it is just absolutely bursting with imagination and new ideas. As a massive fan of Luigi, I couldn't be happier with how much of a spotlight the younger, less appreciated Mario Bro. gets in this game. He truly is the star of the show, and it's really endearing to see that Mario is genuinely happy to step aside and give him his time in the limelight. You'll see for yourself when you get to play it, and play it you should. I know that games in the JRPG style isn't everybody's cup of tea, but Dream Team really feels like an RPG that everybody, and I really mean *everybody*, can and will enjoy to the fullest. I highly recommend this game to any gamer out there who craves a good adventure with some true gaming icons. Buy it, start counting your sheep, and enjoy a truly memorable adventure you won't forget when you wake up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00000K3X9","reviewerName":"Strategos \"The Guardian of Time\"","summary":"One of the best Sonic games","reviewText":"When it came out, this game was HUGELY anticipated. After all, the Sonic the Hedgehog series is one of the most popular in videogame history. Was it worth the wait? Was it worth the hype? Is it worth picking up even now?The transition from 2D to 3D has been much discussed in the past, and you can see why. What works great in 2D doesn't always translate so well into the 3D world. And when a series makes this sometimes awkward transition there are usually a few hiccups.Sonic Adventure attempts to use level design that gives you the speed of the original games, while also featuring puzzle solving and rpg/adventure elements (talk to people, play mini-games, open doors, ect.). By featuring several different characters for you to play as, the game allows you to play a balanced game (sonic), blast through stages with nothing slowing you down (tails), run away like a chicken (amy), shoot everythign in sight (the robot), go on a treasure hunt (knuckles), or spend all your time fishing(?) (big the cat). Each of these elements is entertaining in its own right, but where the game really shines is the action scenes as sonic and tails. The adventure portion of this game suffers from the same flaw as many rpgs (namely, you can't find the stupid key to open the door). So the first time through you may hit a few snags. And the some of the more adventure/platformer elements can get VERY frustrating (I hate the platforming section of the snow level and the skydeck level in particular). And of course, the collision detection, polygon clipping, and camera problems are pretty darn buggy.Still, you've got to love this game. The graphics are great, some of the levels (the first level, windy valley, and speed highway especially) are just plain awesome. Everyone should at the very least play this game, and true videogames fans should own it. It has flaws that can't be ignored, but there are enough moments of greatness (how about the part in the temple where you see the stone carving of chaos destroying the world?!) to more than make up for it. Definitely check it out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2003"}

Yet, with all the hype, there is a lot more than really meets the eye. Nintendo has already ruled the handheld video game category with the triumph and longevity of the different Game Boy's: Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Color, and the original Gamr Boy dating back to the 1980's. However, since Sony has developed a upcoming handheld Playstation video game system that will hit the shelves, a new battle has begun. For Nintendo, they truly have captured the gaming wars again.The Nintendo DS system, is a hanheld gaming system that features a dual screen, and different kinds of games available right now. The controls are very simple for Game Boy Advance gamers, which you can actually play on this system as well as the DS games including the surpringly outrageous revised version of Super Mario 64, Super Mario 64 DS. The game system focuses in on the feel of a stylus pointer pen as a use for touch screen technology, which is found on Pocket PC's, and handheld organizers. The control of the DS system takes a lot of time to get used to, especially for so many who are masters of the analog conrollers, which can be very frustrating on games like Super Mario 64 DS, and The Urbs, a spin-off game of The Syms that is very popular, but the gameplay is just amazing with the graphics and the masterful sound.All in all, with so many desperate for the Nintendo DS system right now, it is just hard to get your hands on one. Yet, it is well worth it for some, but for others that may take a long time. For some, they'll just feel the wait is so long that they might consider the Game Boy Advance SP as a consilation supplement instead. Still, Nintendo's DS is a great system for all to try.Gameplay: BSound: BControl: C+Backwards Compatability with Game Boy Advance: A-Overall: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2005"}
{"product_name":"B004FUI84G","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"A Whipfist To Predecessor's Issues","reviewText":"The first \"Prototype\" was a game that, despite it's amazing potential, fell short of what it was capable of by the last few hours of the game. While it was an enjoyable experience for sure, there was a certain type of magic missing, not to mention a decent mission structure and polished gameplay. This gamer loved it, but knew that there was much more Radical could have done to match the greatness of their fantastic last-gen title, \"The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction.\" But given that people love running up walls and blowing things up in video games historically, it sold well enough for Activision to give the talented developer another crack at the franchise. That's a good thing, because while \"Prototype 2\" will certainly not be the best game you play this year, it will give you some of the best times you're going to have with one.Taking off a few years after the initial entry, this sequel puts you the boots of Army sergeant James Heller, who has lost his wife and daughter to the Mercer virus that has turned New York City into a parasite-infested wasteland. Fueled by PTSD from the Iraq War and rage from losing his family, Heller swears vengeance on Alex Mercer, the originator of the virus. For those unfamiliar with the franchise, Mercer was the protagonist of the first game, and seeing him in a whole new light really broadens the scope and perspective within the continuity. In this, he's a maniacal sociopath who has been corrupted by the virus that turned him into a superhuman, and on a whim, he decides to give this superhuman virus to Heller because he displays a large amount of spunk. This is a big mistake due to the fact that Heller has a burning hatred for Mercer, and what occurs is a fun and compelling revenge yarn between the two men.Unlike the first game, \"Prototype 2\"'s story starts off kind of weak but soon turns into something genuinely compelling and fun. Both Heller's conquest of revenge and his one-man attack against the oppressive Blackwatch military that abducts innocent civilians to test new viruses on them make for some good, B-grade entertainment. The more characters that get introduced, the more perspectives the player is given access to, and watching these different outlooks and personalities mesh makes for a fun time during cutscenes. No character, though, is as entertaining and fun as Heller himself. A walking profanity and trash-talk machine, James isn't written off as the \"stoic and angry African-American male\" cliche that too many games use, and instead is one of the best and most believable Black leads in gaming. While the story isn't really anything groundbreaking or tearjerking (in fact, it's one of the weaker parts of the game), Heller makes it an overall more entertaining experience.But one could ignore the story in \"Prototype 2\" and not miss much from their overall experience, because one element in the game itself is flawless through-and-through: the gameplay. Instead of forcing the player to work themselves up to a level of power equatable to Mercer's in the first title, Heller starts off with the most of the abilities an average gamer had at the end of \"Prototype\", and begins to get stronger at a rapid pace. This gives an untold level of power and control to somebody who picks up this title, which is a treat in and of itself. How Radical takes it one step further, though, is that every little gripe people had about the core gameplay before has been addressed, and now everything works the way it should. Heller adjusts perfectly to ledges he stands on, aiming is far more accurate, and gliding from roof to roof is streamlined to perfection. Vehicle controls no longer feel too sketchy, and doing large maneuvers such as ripping the missile launcher off a helicopter in mid-air or duel-wielding different abilities in the heat of battle can be pulled off with minimal effort. For the first time in my long history with video games, a developer has given a player the opportunity to be a superhuman and not held them back with cumbersome controls or overpowered enemies. Running up the sides of skyscrapers, karate-kicking helicopters hundreds of feet above ground... almost nothing in this game is impossible. Radical finally \"gets\" what people want from a title like this, and so many developers could take a cue from them.Running around with insane abilities is nothing without a compelling setting, and the level designers obviously knew that. New York Zero is a gorgeous city whose imperfections have been coded with loving attention to detail and overall aesthetic. Every crack in the pavement and every hole in the building are all rendered with the utmost care. The same can be said for both the character models and enemy designs. While the NPC passerby are more or less drab, the main characters all look quite slick, with special notice needed to be given Heller's design. Moreso than Mercer, Heller's model is quite impressive, and always looks completely natural with the parasitic attachments his body grows. To top it off, his movement is fluid and realistic, making for a more believable \"hero\" than the previous protagonist. Overall, this is game is very pretty to look at, despite the ugly setting.That's not to say it's all sunshine and daisies in this otherwise stellar game. What really holds Radical back this time around is the fact that their mission structure is questionable, to put it in kinder terms. Which is to say that many of the missions for the approximate first-third of the game are drearily repetitive, to the point where I thought my initial score for the game would be a good bit lower. The majority of these missions involve absorbing a Blackwatch trooper, infiltrating a base, and killing a new enemy/destroying something/absorbing somebody to gain information. It's a cool concept, but it soon wears thin, especially when considering that you're still doing these types of missions near the end of the game. For a game that houses gameplay so wonderful, it's a crying shame to see it getting bogged down by missions that lack creativity. And don't even get me started on the cookie cutter side-missions, which offer little to no incentive outside of gaining some extra experience points. This is a fun game, but the basic structure of the missions might have you believing otherwise at first. Don't worry, though, because when vehicles get introduced, much of this initial boredom is alleviated.The only thing that never really improves is the music. I can't remember one bit of \"Prototype 2\"'s soundtrack, and I just finished the game last night. Nothing here is even remotely interesting to listen to. It's not really bad, per se, more than it is uninspired and very cliche. If you've listened to a big budget action movie with swelling orchestra pieces during crucial moments, then you've listened to the soundtrack for this game. What makes up for the lack of an original soundtrack is the phenomenal voice acting, which possesses the rare distinction of having a perfect actor for each and every role in the game. To be honest, that's one of the things that makes the plot more compelling. In the wrong hands, it would've been revenge tripe addled with cliches. Hats off to the voice director for preventing this work from falling into that lamentable pitfall.A merely functional story, forgettable music and an often boring mission structure still don't hold back this unstoppable beast of a game when all is said and done. \"Prototype 2\" gives gamers more power than any superpower-driven open world game out there, and while it is nowhere near perfect, it's still a fun game that knows all of the sweet spots to hit. If you're willing to turn your brain off and just have a good time, few games come more highly recommended.Plot: 7Gameplay: 9Sound: 8Graphics: 9Overall: 8.25","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8LY","description":"As stranded, miniature spaceperson Olimar, you must find the missing 30  parts your spaceship needs to get you back home. The parts are scattered across  a forested area crowded with giant (when compared to our hero's size) animals  and other hazards. Our hero stumbles across a race of part-animal, part-plant,  all-bizarre creatures he names Pikmin. Olimar has to learn how to lead the  Pikmin around the forest as he uses the abilities of the different-colored  Pikmin to overcome the many obstacles in his path.Learning when and how to make the best use of your Pikmins' skills and traits is  the essence of the game. You can control up to 100 Pikmin at a time while  figuring out which Pikmin are best suited for a particular task. Some are better  fighters, while others can survive in water or handle explosive bomb rocks.  However, even the best Pikmin herder will have to sacrifice a few of the  plant-headed beasts for the greater good. It's the making of new strategies to  minimize losses that makesPikminchallenging and fun.For a first-generation GameCube title, the graphics, sound, and music are  fantastic and show an awesome amount of detail. Though it's noPok&eacute;mon, this game should appeal to wide-eyed younger gamers as  well as seasoned vets. The controls are intuitive and feel perfect for the  standard GameCube controller. However, learning to position the camera can be a  tad frustrating during some of the more tense moments, as it has only a few  magnification levels and needs constant adjustment.The biggest obstacle Olimar faces is time. He has only 30 days (each day is  about 15 minutes in real time) in which to find the necessary parts. While this  keeps the pace of the game up, some may find such limits somewhat frustrating,  as it means there will be a lot of repetition and rethinking of strategy. It  also means that diligent gamers may findPikmina rather short game.At the end of your gaming day,Pikminis one of the best games on the  GameCube.--Mark BrooksPros:Very innovative and originalGorgeous graphicsGreat sound and musicAmazing blend of action and strategyCons:Time limit causes players to repeat tasksExperienced strategy gamers may findPikminends too quicklyDifficult to control camera during tense moments","reviewerName":"David Kauffman","summary":"Can't say I love it...","reviewText":"First off, I would like to say I give this game a 2 1/2 (Not a 2 You can't choose 1/2's on ratings) Second off, before you even you read my review, I just want to make one thing clear: Don't BUY this game. Let me emphesis BUY. I mean do not purchase this game for keeps. I would reccomend renting it, or possibly playing it at some other kids house.This concept of &quot;Pikmin&quot; is amazing. It's a cross between Warcraft and Kirby 64. You control an army of tiny little red, blue, and yellow creatures, while you lead them across vast and magical places. You're ship has crashed, and with the help of your pikmin to find missing parts, you can come home again.What's so horrible about this game? It has every element of difficulty.You are timed, and to make matters worse you must do entire missions over if you don't succeed. Once it has been 12 hours (which is more like 5 mins in pikmin land) you must get all of your pikmin back in the spaceship. If you don't, you lose them.Your pikmin are S-T-U-P...um...oh yeah...I-D. This one time I had a Grub Dog (A monster in the pikmin world) eat 40 of my pikmin. I told them to get a part, so they did. Then on the way back, they walked right into a grub dog. I could've named at least 4 alternate routes! He woke up and started eating all the pikmin. They didn't fight back right away and I had to tell them too! Second, red and yellow pikmin (who cannot swim, only blue can) will constantly fall into the water. It's almost funny how dumb they are when you watch them just walk in the water.Your Pikmin don't exactly follow orders. I will by walking along, and all of a sudden they will decide they'll going to attack a flower that hasn't bloomed. (Which works againts you because bloomed flowers provide more pikmin) Or once I saw 3 of them run off to attack a baby grub dog, who were all immediatly killed.Replay .... WRONG! Once you played it, you played it. I wouldn't spend hours playing the exact same thing i played before, would you?Lastly, By the third level the enemies are 10x stronger! They will things on fire and the mindless pikmin will just go into it.Renting it: fine. Go ahead. You'll some fun.

The story was good (not great; sometimes it seemed contrived), as well as the sound, graphics and playability.  There were some glitches with the pathfinding functions of the game, however; I often found my character getting stuck on a small obsticle that in other Black Isle games (Baldur's Gate series and Torment, in particular), your character(s) would simply walk around it and keep going.  While the over all story was decent, you had to go a long period of time between parts where the plot progressed.  Having only henchman has ups and downs.  I agree with all the other people who miss the  banter between party members in previous games.  That was very fun, and it would have been a welcome addition to NWN.  There was a bonus to this \"deficiency,\" however.  Being able to carry only one henchman with you makes the replay value much better.  The game's dynamics change drastically.  For example, I played through and finished as  a paladin.  Since most of the oponents are undead, the battles were relatively easy.  I took the rogue henchman through and he was able to handle most of the locks and traps.  Another time I played through about half way as a rogue and took the cleric henchman with me.  It was way harder (but very fun).  I couldn't just lung into battles.  I'd have to sneak around them, lure a few away from the crowd and finish them off before attacking the others.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2005"}

{"product_name":"B002BSC54I","reviewerName":"Alessandro Viani","summary":"Great Overall, But With a Few Bugs","reviewText":"Boy did I feel like a kid on Christmas Day when I picked this up last Sunday. I was a bit wary of the fact that it would be almost completely motion controlled, as it can be gimmicky *cough Twilight Princess*.For the most part I can say that I am pleasantly surprised how well it works. It really makes you feel like you're directly in combat and not just controlling an avatar. The motion controls dealing with the sword are advertised as being 1:1, which means if you hold your arm out to the side, Link will do the same; mostly. You can swing the sword in the eight compass directions, and this mostly works, however you must make sure the Wiimote is calibrated correctly or it will confuse a diagonal slash with a downward slash.The controls do take a little getting used to; some of the game can be downright annoying, like flying your bird and using some of the in-game items like the beetle. The graphics are pretty good, it looks like a Zelda game, which is a good thing. Midna from Twilight Princess has been replaced by Fi, your companion. She will warn you if your health is low, your shield's durability is low (more on that in a bit), and even if your Wiimote batteries are about to die.Some elements from RPGs have been added, such as the ability to dash. Stamina has also been added, which is used up by dashing, climbing, and by certain enemies. Your shield now has a durability level, which at 0 the shield breaks. However it doesn't take long for this to happen. The starting shield lasts a depressingly short amount of time. You can shield bash by raising the nunchuk, however this uses durability, and I seem to remember only being able to use it about 4 times before Fi informed me the durability was almost zero. Luckily, there's a potion that can be bought which restores durability as well as 4 hearts. The ability to upgrade items using found objects has also been added.To sum up, gameplay hasn't changed dramatically from past Zelda games, but the motion controls can take a little getting used to. Prospective gamers may not like this, but some of the items which use motion control can be trial and error until you get it right. I would definitively recommend this game to Wii owners. If you're a fan of RPGs, then you won't be sorry. Thanks for taking the time to read this long review. Hope I was able to help.EDIT 12/30: I'm almost finished with SS, almost 40 hours in and the only criticism I have is there is way too much talking. I sometimes find myself yelling at Fi or whoever to shut up and let me kill the boss or get started on the quest. The game seems much longer than Ocarina of Time, and about the same or a tad shorter than Majora's Mask. I've also noticed that the motion controls sometimes get messed up, like it recognizes a diagonal as a side slash, and don't get me started on the thrust...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2011"}

It is great game, although some skills are useless.I began w perception 8 and intelligence 7 and I lacked action  points. I lacked ONE point of strength to use large energy weapons and carry enough (or two? check FAQs), and I had to get power armor early in order to get +3 strength bonus.I got small guns up to 100 and lockpick around 70 near beginning. It is good to have repair 70 too, but that you can build later.Energy weapons are essential, esp when you find Alien Blaster, and it is good to have it at 125 percent, esp before Military base.Don't put skill points in melee weapons or fistfight, you will not use it at all.There are much ways to finish Fallout 1, but (minor spoiler) you can take out Military base firs (forget field disabling, there is bug in game), get robe there, get in cathedral and: go up and find key OR have lockpick skill at 150,  which is usefull later and go to basement.NEVER THROW LOCKPICKS AWAY! Some stuff , like dynamite and plastic explosives were useless as far as I went thru game. It is good to have small and micro fusion cells. Always collect stimpacks and, in battle, go to inventory and click them and use them by highlighting open hand, that's the way u can use em as many as u want.The best weapons are: Desert Eagle, Sub Machine gun, SNIPER!, plasma rifle, laser rifle (for range), gatling lasers and alien blaster if ure lucky.End is unexpected ...Fallout 2is sequel to Fallout 1  and not so cool since solutions were more logical in Fallout 1. Here you CAN use muscular guy with spear and all skills can have use if you combine them. You also must have computers and lockpick around 70 percent, as far as I remember. Sniper rifle is cool and you get REAL weapons after you complete 20 percent of game...you can use small guns only, there is rifle that packs mean punch although its not laser or big gun class...end is satirical...Fallout 2 is more like extension of fallout 1 with more to do, than a game of its own but...its good and its second best old school RPG on PC as far as I knowBUY! It's cheap and I beat Fallout 1 on WIN XP.And one more thing: you can adjust difficulty level, although normal is ok, and you can TURN OFF BLOOD, SWEARING, AND VIOLENT ANIMATIONS(=DYING SCENES A LA MORTAL KOMBAT IN BATTLES).Why didn't I rate this game five star?

It is one of the most highly-rated games on GameSpot's and IGN's websites, as well as many other places. It's called one of the best games ever made, and possibly the best FPS ever made. But I'm afraid I have to vehemently disagree with that opinion.Before I talk about the game itself, let me just say this about the Steam engine: I don't like the idea of it at all, but having said that, installing the game and setting up an account was extremely easy and painless. It was just a normal installation as far as I'm concerned. There was nothing complicated about it. Those who had problems either had a different version, or made some mistakes, or maybe had something like AOL that was perhaps incompatible. I don't know, but don't let the whole Steam controversy deter you from trying the game.Now for the game itself. First off, let me name the good things about this game: excellent graphics, excellent voice acting, nice level variation with vehicles mixed in, and the story develops in an interesting way (rather than cutscenes, the characters walk around and talk with you in the actual game world).Having said that, I simply despised every minute that I played this game. In a way, I almost can't describe why I had such a strong negative reaction to what I was really hoping and expecting to be a great game. But some of the definite things I can say are these:There are absolutely too many enemies! Right from the beginning (which is even worse, since you have fewer weapons) you are constantly bombarded by enemies all around you. You might think everything is clear, but suddenly there are two or three guys way ahead of you, so far ahead that you can barely see them, but they are pretty good at seeing and shooting you. On top of this, there are guys above you (on elevated areas) which are difficult to find, so you are always wondering what's shooting at you, and finally they'll appear behind you as well, even though you've already \"cleared\" the area behind you. And all of this happens *at the same time*! I'm all for an action-packed shoot 'em up, this is an FPS after all, but this is just too much. It was so overwhelming (and right from the start) that I was frustrated nearly every minute that I walked around in this game. I was constantly under fire and taking damage, and there was little I could do about it but try to shoot back -- that is, whenever I could finally find them all.On top of this, throw a few helicopters and spaceships flying above you, constantly shooting you and dropping bombs on you, and for quite a while there is *nothing* you can do about it but take it. It's difficult to find a place to hide since there is so much going on, so you're pretty much at the mercy of a million things at once.Add to this the most annoying enemy I have ever seen in any game I've ever played (that little creature with four \"legs\" that jumps at you). These things are everywhere and they are extremely quick and difficult to target. Until you get a more powerful weapon, they take a few shots to kill, but getting in more than one or two shots before they move again (and lunge at you) is difficult. I wouldn't mind so much if they only existed in one part of the game, but they are everywhere and they are unbelievably maddening to deal with.I'm also not a big fan of driving vehicles in general, and I didn't really like the controls of the vehicles in this game. It didn't feel very precise to me, and often I would have to backtrack or slow down and figure out where to go. It didn't feel like it played out as quickly and as smoothly as it should have.As far as the story goes, there isn't much of one. The way the story unfolds is interesting, as I mentioned above, but it's unfortunate that not too much is unfolding! For the first part of the game you're just told to move from one area to another. Finally a couple of scientists are kidnapped and you have to go rescue them, but I never felt like I was actually *in* this game at all. Of course, getting immersed in a game that is constantly aggrevating you is difficult to do.I should also add, just to emphasize that my reaction to this game was so strong and so visceral, that this is the only game I've ever played where I've actually slammed my hands down on my desk, or thrown them up in the air, and shouted profanity and cries of frustration at the screen. More than once I actually shouted \"I *hate* this game\". I think it takes a lot to actually elicit that kind of involuntary reponse, but this game excelled at bringing it out of me. I truly hated every minute that I played it.Now, given that it's gotten such great reviews, and that my hatred of it is almost too emotional to be valid for anyone else, I would encourage people to still try it. Certainly any game that receives near perfect scores should be experienced for yourself. Perhaps you'll find it much less frustrating than I did.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2007"}

I've also played the Advanced versions of FF1-5 (with the exception of 3, which was apparently never re-released to GBA, which is a disappointment because FF3 was fun, and the first game with the Job System.Like all the other Advanced FF games, graphics are cleaned up (though not so much for FF6 as it was for the others) gameplay is smoothed out, a Bestiary is added (one of my all-time favorite features of these Advanced FF versions!!!) and bonus dungeons are added, as well as some extra... something-something. Sometimes it's all-new items (Final Fantasy I) or new jobs (FFV) but here in FFVI it's the addition of four new Espers - faces that are familiar from other FF games (Why, hello, Gilgamesh and Leviathan!) as well as new ones (Diabolos and Cactuar) There's two bonus dungeons here - Dragon's Den and Soul Shrine.personally, I disliked Dragon's Den immensely. It wasn't because it was challenging, it was because the puzzles seemed pointless to me. You have to go in 3 teams (like you do at Kefka's Tower) and I immensely dislike the 3 teams thing. I can understand it for Kefka's Tower, but a single team would have been much better for the Dragon's Den. The Soul Shrine on the other hand is pretty cool even if it's a bit repetitive (128 battles!) but the low-level monsters are easy enough to beat. You get to face many bosses that had been previously one-time encounters and because of this, several trips straight through the entire gamut of the Soul Shrine can garner you a hefty swag. For example, you could only previously own one Excalibur (back in the SNES version of FF6) but now, you have the chance to go back to the Shrine as many times as you like, and have Locke or Gogo on your team (or both) to steal some pretty sweet swag from all the major one-shot bosses. You also can face the 8 Dragons again along with the Warring Triad (The Trio of Goddesses) as well as some other bosses and keep stealing from them to pad your inventory - extra Force Armor or rare weapons are always handy to have and you can improve your overall armor/weapon stash so that you can have all members of one party equipped with the best weapons/armor possible.The translation to this game is overall faithful but has some subtle differences to the original American version. The storyline is the same classic, so if you've loved FF6., you should like this. I really appreciate the chance to go for repeats of previous once-only items from FF6. I mean yeah, you can use cheat codes to have all items at your disposal, but still... Overall a solid game. I'd have given it five stars if the Dragon's Den had been better constructed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2009"}

This plays much smoother than the BF console installements that came before it.I think over time things will only improve, but for now, it's playable and excellent when you're in the game.  It's a shame they released it in such a gimped form, because unlike games like Ghosts, this really is a step forward.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00D4WTO1M","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Marginally better than the PS3 version, but still BORING!","reviewText":"Thought I'd try this again after a few months - it's actually gotten worse.  Hardly anyone plays online, and those that do are clans.  So, if you're playing solo, expect to have a horrible experience.  If you can get into a match at all.  Matchmaking can sometimes take longer than playing the actual match.  Even playing against bots (wargame), you will wait and wait and wait for enough players to join.  And all the terrible game mechanics are still there; spawning in front of enemy bullets, getting killed 6 feet around corners, lag, frame drops, glitches, host migrations... the list goes on and on.  This game truly deserves zero stars.FINAL ANALYSIS: It's boring, frustrating, and oftentimes maddening.  Activision insults us by forcing these horrible maps on us with the release and then tries to sell us the 'good' maps in a DLC.  And now these new weapons (Maverick and Ripper) feel like pay to win.  Maybe they'll sell perks like \"no-host-disadvantage\", \"frag-the-lag\", \"shoot-first-kill-first!\", and \"dedicated-servers-for-dedicated-players\".  I'm being only half-sarcastic; I really can see this happening, especially with the cast of clowns at Activision.  COD is dead to me now and forever.  Time to move on!UPDATE2: Not only do they keep pushing the cruddy maps (Free Fall has been made universal, so it's coming up MUCH more often), but I seem to be getting host a lot now.  What happened to dedicated servers?!  The game has gotten so bad I'm only playing Squads now.  But even playing against bots is frustrating - they camp just as hard, but they have built-in aimbot and they appear to see through walls.  IW must really want us to buy the DLC for those small and medium maps as they keep pushing the large ones.  Well, no thanks - I'm speaking with my wallet and refusing to buy anymore from IW.  I'm going back to BLOPS2, along with thousands of others.  As of this morning, there were only 40K playing.  Dropping my star rating from 2 to 1.  It's that bad now.UPDATE1: I don't know what Activision is doing, but they seem intent on pushing every one of their bad maps at me, over, and over, and over again.  Siege, Sovereign, Stonehaven, Chasm - it's a never ending repeat cycle. And there are so few players on - just today, it was 45K.  Worldwide.  So, finding a match without a large ping is hard to come by.  And it shows.  This game is absolutely no fun.  I'm dropping it from 3 to 2.The graphics ARE better in the single and multiplayer modes.  However, in MP mode, I do find the extra shading and lighting effects to be distracting and makes it even harder to see the enemy - dark corner McDougal's are even darker!  And the beams of lights blind you - almost as bad as a flash bang.  More deaths that can be attributable to map design, yay.I do notice much less stuttering/lost frames, thanks to the power of the PS4.  But lag compensation will always be with us.  Still too many deaths from invisible enemies.  At least the game is appropriately named - I often feel like I'm shooting at ghosts (bullets don't seem to hit at all) or being shot at by ghosts - bullets hitting me out of thin air.So, this game is just slightly better in the PS4 version.  Is it worth the $10 upgrade if you have the PS3 version?  Sure, why not.  But it's still only a 3/5.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2014"}

Travis emerges victorious and finds himself in the presence of Silvia Christel, a mysterious French woman who claims to be an agent with the UAA.

Gameplay is all about using your Beam Katana (via Wii remote) to defeat enemies.","reviewerName":"Simon","summary":"You Must Experience No More Heroes","reviewText":"No More Heroes is a Nintendo Wii title published in 2008. You play as Travis Touchdown, a stereotypical geek/otaku living out of a suspect motel in Santa Destroy. When you win a beam katana in an online auction, a mysterious hottie suggests using it to carve your way to the top of the United Assassin's Association rankings. Cue violence, gore, and mayhem.This is a game I could talk about all day, an experience so memorable and hilariously unique that any shortcomings are easily overlooked. There's not a lot of games that strike this kind of cord with me, one of the others being the cult hitKiller 7, also helmed by No More Heroes' Suda 51. You can find a little something for every male gamer in No More Heroes, including anime references, wrestling moves, and 80s arcade homages. Heck you main weapon is a Lightsaber - that's gotta be worth at least 100 fantasy fulfillment points right there. And there's also liberal amounts of blood, innuendo, and general butt-kicking, all wrapped in an insanely weird and over-the-top package. What other game can take you from a hardcore assassination mission to mowing the lawn and collecting coconuts for some pocket money?The Wii controls are excellent, saving the motion usage for key gameplay moments like finishing slashes and wrestling moves. Bosses return to old-school levels of skill and pattern memorization, and every fight offers something different. Like Killer 7, No More Heroes uses a cel-shaded look that puts the visual emphasis on style and away from raw horsepower. Voice-acting is top notch - it feels intentionally overacted in that anime dub kinda way and perfectly gels with the tone of the game. Background music is an eclectic mix of rock, techno and hip hop that rounds out the presentation.So what doesn't work? The GTA-style sandbox world is rather barren - there are no random side missions to perform, and it's occasionally tedious to travel around the map. Along with that, you can't jump back in immediately and replay a mission if you fail one - you have to travel back to where you received the assignment, re-activate it, then return to the spot to trigger the mission again. Some streamlining would've been appreciated.But overall No More Heroes is just too much fun to deduct marks for these shortcomings. The game is many things, but most of all it's an intelligent, mature-rated game, a genre the Nintendo Wii is very lacking in. You have no right to complain about the lack of good games on Wii if you haven't tried this yet.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2009"}

I got it on discount and didn't think it would be that entertaining, but it looked different and I was in the mood for something more action/role-playing oriented, so I picked it up.I got involved right after I started and played on and off for three days until I beat the game.  The game is basically an action/adventure game with some extras that make it feel like a role playing game, though as many die-hard D&D; people point out, \"It's not a true role-playing game.\"The plot of the story goes something like this: you're a stranger to the city of Baldur's Gate. Not long after arriving, you are robbed and beaten by a gang of thieves. However, before they can kill you the city guard shows up and the gang runs away. You enter the Elfsong Inn and talked to the woman who runs the place. She tells you she will pay you some money if you will kill all the rats in the basement. You agree and she gives you a rusty knife. That's where the adventure begins. There are three main sections to the story involving somewhere around 30 different levels. Along the way you fight rats, ogres, giants, a beholder, lots of evil men, a dragon, and all sorts of other creatures.At the beginning of the game you are allowed to choose between one of three characters: an elf maiden, a archer man, and a dwarf warrior. Of the three, the dwarf is my favorite because he's able to carry more booty than anyone else. The elf maiden is probably the most difficult character because she's mainly a magician and even when you reach the end of the game, her spells aren't that powerful.  The more creatures you kill, the more experience points you get and the more levels you move up. The higher your experience, the more abilities you are capable of doing.The graphics DARK ALLIANCE were pretty cool and I really liked how you could rotate the screen around to look around objects. However, there are certain areas where this feature is not available. Dialogue between characters is mainly done through an option of selecting some pre-chosen lines. Usually if you choose the first option, you'll hear everything the characters will tell you.Overall, I found DARK ALLIANCE to be enjoyable. It engulfed me for almost three days and I don't regret the time I spent playing it.  Serious role players and serious gamers might not get as much out of it, but for the average joe, it's a good game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2004"}

However, it is similar, yet also quite different. Rather than having most of the skills you need at the beginning of the game, you learn a few in the very beginning, and then learn the remaining skills throughout the first six worlds (there are nine, but they are much larger than the fifteen in Mario 64). Notes are like coins, and jiggies are like stars. However, rather than six stars in each world, there are 10 jiggies to find in each world, and 10 in the witch's castle (much like the castle secret stars). Also, you can transform in five of the nine massive levels with the help of the crazy witch doctor Mumbo-Jumbo. Generally, it will help you get at least 1 Jiggy in the world, and they can do things that Banjo and Kazooie can't on their own. Throughout the game, you get to transform into a termite (level 1), an alligator (level 4), a walrus (level 5), a pumpkin (level 7), and a bee (level 9).The nine massive worlds are each very different from eachother. But how fun are they? Well, they're all very fun to play in, mainly because the tunes in each world really match the mood, from eerie funeral dirges to peppy shipyard music, this game has that and then some.

The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife.

For every good thing about it, there are 2 things that will leave you scratching your head or breaking your keyboard in frustration.First of all, The Story:  there is no story.  It's just a bunch of NPCs sending you to the other side of the map to either A) blow something up B) retrieve an object, or C) kill someone.  That's it.  Every mission is the same, and every area is just a copy/paste of the last one.  There is no variation here at all.  None.  The weapons, yes, but you'll probably find a combo that you like very early on and keep it for the whole game.The Weapons:  There are a lot of them, but like I said, you'll likely find what you like early on and ignore the rest of them.  One thing that really annoys me about the weapon slot system is that if you want to carry a sniper rifle, it will be your primary weapon, which means that you cannot carry a battle or assault rifle with the sniper rifle.  This would be okay if the game were sniper friendly, but it is not.  You will be able to pick off a few enemies before they all either hide or rush you, at which point your sniper rifle is going to do you zero good.  It's nice to have, though, so I use it anyway.  I have the double barrel sawed-off shotgun as my secondary weapon, which helps, but it is horribly inaccurate even at point blank range.  The enemies have a nasty habit of becoming merely wounded from a close range shotgun blast to the head, which is annoying for 2 reasons.. one- because it's unrealistic, and two- because you are often unable to finish them off until they have completed their \"writhing in pain\" and \"getting up to shoot you\" animations.  Your shots will simply pass right through them until they have gotten up and put a couple of rounds into you.  Highly annoying.The Vehicles:  They are nice when they work right, but the roads are too narrow and the map designers were sadistic enough to put obstacles all over the road that will permanently make your vehicle stuck.  It's best just to walk.  Speaking of vehicles, watching an enemy NPC try to drive one is one of the most hilarious things I've ever seen in a video game.  You try to attack an enemy outpost, and suddenly it's BAD DRIVERS TO THE RESCUE!  These guys will come roaring onto the scene - hitting trees, buildings, cars, each other, and whatever else they can find.  They will not get out of the car until they are satisfied that they have run over enough things, even if you are standing 5 feet away from them.  MAJOR LOLS to the NPC drivers in this game.The Combat:  Ok.. this is obviously the whole point of this game.. killing people.  Depending on who you ask, the AI in this game is either completely brilliant or dumber than a rock.  Well, I say it's both or neither.  At times, the enemies do seem to display a realistic intelligence.  They will hold their posts if you snipe someone from a distance, but they will find cover.  On the other hand, you'll see about 3 or 4 of them running around in circles for all eternity until you get close enough for them to notice you.  That's if they notice you at all.  You can be face to face with some of these guys and they act like you're not even there.  Sometimes you can be right in front of someone and they will say something like \"Where did he go?\"  Other times, even the slightest noise will have an entire camp of mercs firing at your exact position, no matter how far away you are or how hidden you are.  All of that being said, the combat is actually quite fun.  The AI is adequate (as long as they're on foot LOL), and even though I would certainly not call them \"smart\", they do provide a decent challenge in one way or another.  It really is quite satisfying to clear an area, because it is quite tough to do at times.  And then comes the disappointment when you walk 50 feet away, come back to the area, and find that every one of the mercs you just killed are back from the dead and ready to fight you all over again.  The respawning enemies in this game are terrible.  It was an awful idea, and it is the worst thing about this game.  Wait.. no.  Malaria is the worst thing about this game.  WTF?  Malaria?  Well at least it isn't AIDS.Other Thoughts: There is a lot of fun to be found in this game, but playing it often feels like walking up a muddy hill in lead boots.  Everything from the lack of inventory screen, tediously designed menus, really weak jumping, gun jamming, and constant malaria symptoms will have you believing that this game was designed to punish you for buying it.  But, the graphics, sound, atmosphere, and unique combat might just make you keep playing it anyway.Is it a bad game?  Yes.  It's a terrible game, but I like it anyway.Why is it called Far Cry 2, by the way?  It has nothing at all to do with Far Cry.  Crysis is more of a sequel to Far Cry than this game is.

Among other things, the Dunia Engine delivers realistic, interactive environments, special effects, real-time night-and-day cycles, and smart enemy AI.Expansive, Realistic EnvironmentFar Cry 2 is set in a fictional region of Africa where you are caught between two rival factions at war. The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah. Wild animals such as zebras, buffalo, gazelle are encountered during the game, with both players and enemies allowed to interact with them.Far Cry 2 features an incredible level of detail and realism, with a minimal in-game interface to detract from immersion. For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game. To fulfill your mission, you need to play the enemies against each other, using both strategy and skill.Huge Range of Weapons and VehiclesFar Cry 2 offers gamers a wide range of weapons, from a machete for hand-to-hand combat, to a sniper rifle that can stealthily pluck off enemies from afar. As weapons disintegrate over time, they might jam or even explode in your hand.There are also a large range of vehicles such as gliders, trucks, cars, and boats that will let you fly, drive, slide, and hover over the open landscapes.Multiplayer Options for up to 16 PlayersFar Cry 2 supports up to 16 players and has four gameplay modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond, and Uprising. Players can choose from six different classes in multiplayer, each with its own set of pros and cons.

In too many other ways, however, it falls very short.  Just for the fun of it, I re-played the original Far Cry before receiving Far Cry 2 even though I knew that Far Cry 2 had no association and resemblance to the original at all.  They are totally different games with different stories, characters and locations with only the name to oddly tie them together.  To be fair . . . there are a few hang-gliders in Far Cry 2, so I guess there ARE a few similarities.  But, unfortunately, Far Cry 2 is a \"far cry\" from the original Far Cry.The basic plot of Far Cry 2 deals with two main warring factions attempting to take control of Central Africa's resources and governmental powers.  The main antagonist is a chap by the name of The Jackel who is supplying arms to both side of the conflict, or so it seems.  The objective of the player's character is to assassinate the Jackel which is hoped will de-escalate the conflicts and bring stability to the region.Some things work in Far Cry 2.  There are very large free-roaming environments and a host of real-world weaponry.  Many of the objects are somewhat destructible.  The graphics and sound designs are good.  There is a form of vegetation regeneration and day, night and weather cycles.  All of that is fine and dandy.  Even the basic premise behind the story is okay albeit under-developed and confusing at times.  A few (very few) of the objectives and missions are fun.However, Far Cry 2 falls short in the following areas:1)  Graphical glitches.  Aside from the \"clipping\" issues (which are in many PC games) I found several odd occurrences and annoyances.  One of the oddest occurred after I strategically eliminated the hostiles in a small guard post.  I was still receiving fire from somewhere, but as much as I scanned, I couldn't identify the shooter.  I eventually closed in on the source and found a hostile embedded in a huge boulder.  The gunfire was coming right out of the center of the large rock.  Occasionally I saw a head and gun poke out of the rock.  I couldn't kill him, so I just left.  There were several similar oddities throughout the game such as floating bottles, and the like.Far Cry 2 also suffers from some general shielding issues.  Most of the time I could shoot through foliage, boards or walls, but there were occasional episodes where a few leaves would block my sniper shots.  On a few occasions I threw grenades only to have them hit leaves in front of me l and bounce back in my lap.  They should have easily gone through the leaves.2)  The main complaint I had about the game is the never-ending repetitive nature.  Dozens of missions were exactly the same. The only variation was the location. I go to the cell tower to get the assassination order.  Then I travel across the map to where the target stands.  The targets all dress in grey suits and carry brief cases or clipboards.  They just walk around in loops until you kill them.  Over and over again it went.  I also experienced some glitches with these missions.  On several occasions, I successfully killed the target, but the script wouldn't activate as \"accomplished.\"  The map still showed the objective as open.  The only way to continue was to accept another mission and abandon the glitchy one.Then there were the \"destroy the convoy\" missions.  Again, most of these were across the map and when you get to the target, you find a truck - usually with one or two guard vehicles - circling an area over and over again.  You blow it up and move on.  After about 20 or so of these missions, I began to think that I wanted my eight hours back.Then there were the idiotic malaria twists the developers threw in (to add some suspense to the boring game, I guess).  You get some transit documents you must deliver and, in return, you get the medication.  Over and over it went.  No matter where you were sent, the buildings were exactly the same with the guys by the door and the same families in the back room.  At this point, I thought that the developers basically scripted three or four missions and then just looped them over and over hundreds of times with tiny variations in location.The only \"enjoyable\" missions were the mult-faceted variety where I had to complete several varied objectives.  These were usually given by faction leaders and, occasionally, by buddies. These were challenging and fun, for the most part.  Also, the very ending mission with the plethora of baddies was a little more engaging (FINALLY some action after 40 hours of gameplay!) Unfortunately, these types of missions were the exception, not the rule.  I would say that 80% of the missions were of the repetitive, redundant variety.The diamonds used for bartering was fine, but to hide them in little suitcases on top of boulders, trees, and rooftops is rather ridiculous and, in my opinion, juvenile.  Maybe that was added to appease the twelve-year-olds.3)  The AI was inconsistent.  Hostiles did pursue and flank, but not smartly. And it was very predictable.  The accuracy of the AI shooting was unrealistic.  Often hostiles ran at full speed while I dodged and swerved into brush fifty yards away and I was still hit numerous times. Yeah, sure.  Sometimes, I had to LOL as hostile vehicles flew off cliffs or into the rivers trying to get to my location. Sometimes unarmed vehicles came at me and all I had to do was to shoot the drivers in the head as they neared.  Idiots!The spawning thing also was an annoyance.  Obviously it wasn't meant to be realistic.  I would destroy a guard post and then return minutes later only to find the exact same guards alive and well again and all the destroyed vehicles fully operable. I must have killed Joey the Guard like 238 times.4)  No widescreen support.  I was shocked when I found that widescreen was just cropped full screen. Using widescreen takes full screen images and slices the top and bottom off and then stretches them to fit the screen.  What kind of cheap developer's shortcut was that!!  I did find a tool to correct it, but I expected something better from a premium 2008 FPS game!5) I saved fairly often - mainly because I didn't want to travel the 40 miles over the barren African landscape over again if I died. But each time you save, the list has to \"refresh\" and depending upon how many saved games you have, the refresh time could be substantial.  I ended up having to visit the \"saved games\" folder regularly to clear it out.6) The night play was too bright. I'd rather have night actually dark.  Stealth was non-existent.  I couldn't tell any difference buying the \"camo\" outfit for cover.  No matter how silent I sneaked up on a hostile and used my machete, the whole camp was immediately aware of my presence.  They missed a huge opportunity to implement a good stealth mode to the game.7)  I was also disappointed that there wasn't more variety in the animals in Africa. I think it would've added a lot of suspense to the game to include a few dangerous animals.  I could just imagine walking upon some lions and then having to run for my life or gun them down.  It would've been hilarious to be trampled by an elephant.  It would've given the game a little more \"edge\" to it as well as some reality to the environment. I also would've liked some moving trains and I was a little disappointed that, at the airfield, I couldn't get into a plane to try to fly it.  Even if it resulted in a crash and death, it would've been worth it just to try to fly it.Because of the tiresome and repetitive gameplay, I have to knock off a good 3 points off the gameplay score.  After playing the game, I am leery about its replay value as well.  There are no \"wow\" levels.  Everything looks pretty much the same.  The missions are very repetitive and redundant.  There are really no memorable moments during the 40 hours or so of gameplay.  Because of that, I have no motivation to play the game again.  Once through is enough.  Without a doubt, the original Far Cry was better.  In fact, I could play that again right now and look forward to every level of that game. I would score Far Cry 2 as follows:Graphics  8/10Sound  8/10Gameplay  6/10Story/Characterization 6/10Replay Value  5/10Overall  6.5/10","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2008"}

As if anyone was willing to stand up to the planet's oppressors.Some have sold out to the off-world fascists, and clips of the frighteningly calm turncoats play throughout cities to further pacify the populace. Impulse and instinct, they insist, are a plague. The visitors, according to the old sci-fi chestnut, are our friends. A mere 10 minutes in, and the latest Half-Life sets its atmosphere with convincing, blood-curdling aplomb. More so than any other game (Halo 2 included), it puts you in the head of its hero, and gets better as you go along. You are Gordon Freeman, science geek turned savior, and you're more than happy to doff the lab coat and lodge a crowbar (or a pistol slug, or shotgun shell, or crossbow bolt--you get the picture) in whoever deserves it. But of all the tools of the E.T.-go-home trade, the gravity gun is your silver bullet. Able to lift and launch whatever you like, it turns debris into lethal weapons and the shooter status quo upside down. The way things fly, catch fire, and fall not only carries consequences that add weight to your war of the worlds, but also creates situations that reward guile, guts, and instinct. Sometimes one broken beam produces better results than a magazine of bullets when the catwalk it supports collapses and crushes your foes.The enemy is smart too, maybe more so than in any other shooter. They'll chase you down as you dash for cover; pin you with fire, then put pressure on your flank. Their helicopters hunt you through warehouses, open up as you pass windows, and blast the roof to bits to get a bead on you. It's remarkable really. In fact, everything about Half-Life 2 is remarkable. First-rate audio effects capture the sounds of spent cartridges clanking on the floor, rifle shots reverberating off walls, and head crabs hissing in corners. Levels range from canals to cemeteries, coastal highways to crowded cities, sewage systems to state penitentiaries, science facilities to strange fortresses--each lifelike and with a feel of its own. Some place you behind the wheel in sweet, plow-suckers-into-street-pizza sections, others put you in charge of fellow freedom fighters and bloodthirsty, bear-sized bugs that eat lead for lunch and ask for seconds (think Pikmin, but with lethal aliens instead of lovable plant people). Gameplay, graphics, you name it, it's top notch. On its own, Half-Life 2 is everything you asked for. And that's only the half of it. Depending on the package you pick, you also get the original Half-Life along with cyber-caf&eacute; staples Counter-Strike and Day of Defeat, all redone with today's technology. Consider those expensive PC parts paid for in full.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2004"}

{"product_name":"B0054IN5AA","reviewerName":"N.

While it wasn't a bad edition of the long running fighting game franchise, it was still mammothly disappointing in terms of included content, gameplay modes, fighter selection, and online functionality.  With King of Fighters XIII, all the rights have been wronged.  More fighters, more gameplay modes, and vastly improved online gameplay options really make this installment a winner.  Graphically not a whole lot has changed since KOF XII, with many backgrounds and sprites recycled from that game, but they seem to be animated a lot better this time around.  Gameplay modes include the standard arcade mode, as well as a new story mode (with a presentation that's reminiscent of Blaz Blue) and the thankfully improved online modes.  The only real flaws about KOF XIII is that I still wish there were some more fighters to pick from (although it is great to see Mai back) and that the online play wasn't as laggy as it is.  All that aside though, The King of Fighters XIII is 2-D fighting at its near best, and deserves your attention right now.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2011"}

With the massive success of Super Mario Galaxy from last year, that showed Mario is still an even bigger platforming adventure hero, and earlier this year with both Mario Kart Wii and the mammoth fighting styles of Super Smash Brothers Brawl, Mario mania has really delivered top to bottom. But, with so many Mario games, Nintendo has shown Mario well with sports titles here, just like they did for the Gamecube and Nintendo DS, and it is now time for Mario again to say batter up!!!Mario Super Sluggers for the Nintendo Wii, brings in the well-rounded success that showed with Mario Superstar Baseball from the Gamecube on the Wii. This time around, it is a bit more exciting, as you play with your favorite Mario characters past and present to a baseball universe that is exciting and brings in the home run. In the game, there are many modes to master, including the all-new challenge mode, which expands well from the Gamecube original, where you can unlock all your favorite characters, as well as brand new stadiums to master you home runs including the all new-expanded Toy Field, the delightful Yoshi Park, which Yoshi made in the style of a cute amusement park, and the nightlife of casinos and Las Vegas at the new Wario City stadium.The graphics for the game are very well-rendered within each one of the levels, and provides a new level of challenges and moves to master, including the all-new buddy jump, where you control the outfielders in the game by making a special over the top leap that can even rob the most powerful hitters a high-flying home run. The control is also simple and easy to master, even for those who've never played the original. You can easily with a flick of the Wii-mote, you can throw a curve ball, or hit the ball into the stands. There is though one big disadvantage with Mario Super Sluggers. Unlike the previous Mario sports titles like Mario Kart Wii and the soccer-style action of 2007's Mario Strikers Charged, you don't have the option of playing against other wannabe all-stars online. That alone is a big surprise that misses the mark in action.Despite that one big problem with the multiplayer action, Mario Super Sluggers is a game that will really bring in the fun for anyone who is not just a fan of baseball games, but for anyone who is new to baseball action. While the game expands well from the Gamecube, it isn't a complete grand slam, but does bring in a few nice walk-off runs to the warp pipe. With only a couple of baseball titles made for the Wii, this is definitely one of the best, and a nice addition to your Wii library.Graphics: BSound: BControl: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B+ for solo players; B for multiplayer actionOverall: B 1/2+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2008"}

The loading times unexpectedly long but once you get to the game you can start having fun right away.While the graphics are not any indication of the power of next generation consoles, it does represent a great technical achievement that you'll notice when you smash through hundreds of zombies on the screen riding a steamroller that spits fire (which sometimes lowers the frame rate that makes you wonder about the X1's capabilities). Yeah, it's as amazing as you are imagining right now.The world is many times larger than Dead Rising's 1 mall and Dead Rising's 2 post-apocalypse Las Vegas but still not as big and beautiful as GTA V's incredible open world.I've yet to find all the blueprints for the weapon combinations but from what I've played, in addition to all the previews I've seen. We're in for some crazy zombie killing spree. A teddy bear with an automated machine gun, pogo sticks, chainsaws, you name it. Few games that show off all their weapon creation features reach the heights of Dead Rising's possibilities. Even more with the Super Weapons you can get by combining two or more previously crafted weapons.The controls is where this game falls short. It's all good and fun when you're in the middle of the zombie horde; a swing of your weapon or two can clear a path for you to run to safety. The imprecise controls will end in very frustrating boss fights that require a little more precise fighting controls.The story is full of clich&eacute;d characters and your typical hero trying to escape the city. Nothing groundbreaking in the story that you'll care very little about Nick Ramos' story and focus more on killing and dismembering the undead and every once in a while think \"Oh, yeah, there's a story to this game\"Some characters might join you in the fight against the zombies and opposed to previous games were the main focus was to save extra characters to complete the missions. This game is all about your killing spree racking up points and leveling up your character. If you're playing on normal, the frustrating time limits are gone, giving you more freedom to complete missions. Some players might like this, some won't it's up to you. If you're more hardcore and like the sometimes maddening challenge, you can play on Nightmare mode for that.Overall I think it's one of the better games of the Xbox One launch lineup. It's definitely fun so you won't regret it. As with both consoles, we're gonna have to wait a few months until the good games come out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

It doesn't take long to level up to max... it can be done in 3-5 sittings.  And it completely lacks a single player campaign.  It's basically a multiplayer only Call of Duty with robots.  If that's down your alley then this game is for you.  But personally, I have a hard time recommending it at full retail price.Visually it doesn't look very impressive, and the framerate can be choppy at times.  After 15 hours or so of playing, I have experienced the framerate dropping significantly where it was an unplayable slideshow, but fortunately these moments were rare.  I'm going to chalk that up to being a bug.  A few reviewers have mentioned this as well (giantbomb), so apparently I'm not alone.  I have also played the PC version and it doesn't seem to have these sort of bugs.  Visually and performance wise, the PC is the way to go if you have a capable machine.So does Titanfall live up to the hype?  My thought is, that would be impossible.  This game was built up to be a game changer, and it doesn't do all that much to differentiate itself from other shooters like Call of Duty.So would I recommend it?  I would say if you spent countless hours on Call of Duty multi-player, then you'll probably be able to do the same here, and therefore it's probably worth the full price.

{"product_name":"B00005UNWB","description":"The publishers ofGrand Theft Auto IIIare back with another game  geared towards a mature audience. But fans ofGTA IIIshould note that  whileState of Emergencycontains adult themes and extremely violent  gameplay, that's pretty much where the similarities end. WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number  of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode,  but it's strictly one player. In spite of these flaws, the game remains  addictive and fun. It bears repeating that gamers looking for anotherGTA  IIIwill not find it here: this game provides an arcadelike experience  that's excellent, but in a very different way. Parents should note that this  game carries a Mature rating for its blood, violence, and gore.--Raymond M.

{"product_name":"B00005RKO7","reviewerName":"Miketheratguy","summary":"The most solid example of SH: Same mood and imagery, but greatest, most coherent story.","reviewText":"THE SHORT: Less gory and satanic than the first game, but with a great story- the most coherent and understandable in the series, and with a fantastic twist at the end. 5 possible endings, great atmosphere. Sometimes frustrating (but adjustable) puzzle difficulty but fairly easy fighting.THE LONG: The original game was great- similar to Resident Evil but unique enough to stand on its own, the game was dark, disturbing and satanic. The problem was, the storyline was so ambitious that it got pretty sloppy and weird at the end, with some plot details (such as a drug cult) not as fleshed out as it should have been. This game fixes things by concentrating on the main character, whose journey to the same town of Silent Hill is brought on by a letter that he received from his wife. Though dead from a fatal illness, her very writing asks James to return to the town, the site of some bittersweet memories for them.As James travels through town, he meets some strange people who all seem to be off in some way. One is remarkably passive/ aggressive, one is suicidal, one is a little girl who seems to know him, and one of them is a woman who looks just like his dead wife, which brings out some conflicting emotions in James. These characters come and go as the game goes on, and they occasionally do some odd things. But the beauty of the story is that, when all is said and done, the motivation for these characters makes absolute sense- once you realize what they mean to James and why they're in Silent Hill in the first place. Whereas the first game unravels with a lot of obscure mythological references to religious artifacts and demonic possession, this one is strengthened completely at its conclusion, a conclusion that makes us rethink the motives and actions of every character in the game.This is true of the game's biggest, most dynamic character- Pyramid Head. An apparent humanoid with a strange, triangular shape of flesh or metal on (or in place of) its head, this character represents sheer malice to James. From the moment he discovers it in an abandoned apartment building to the time he discovers hints of its origins, Pyramid Head is one of, if not the most, creepy of the series' foes. He isn't all over you in the game but instead appears occasionally from the shadows, often when you least expect him, slowly but steadily approaching James as he tries to flee. And once you learn what little you can of him near the end, it adds to the finale more than any of the other characters. Pyramid Head has a purpose, and once it's revealed what that purpose is, that great ending starts to form and you realize how psychologically powerful this game is.All this story would be moot if there wasn't a good presentation, which there definitely is. Like the original game, your character wanders around a misty, fog-enshrouded abandoned town where nothing feels right and glimpses of things skittering about are caught. The game starts slowly, intentionally- don't get too impatient when first running through the woods and into town, it's meant to be suspenseful and build the mood. And by the time you're an hour or so into the game, what a mood it is. This game contains what's surely one of the most unsettling locations in the series- at one important juncture you enter the town's historical society and descend several hundred feet into ground, only to find a morgue, bloody pits that go farther and farther down, and Silent Hill's long abandoned underground prison. This location alone sets some great mood, as you see scrawls of long-dead prisoners and hear things from unseen places (listen for the heavy footsteps of something that seems to be whispering \"Hurt you\").The mood is also heightened by little glimpses of the town that you find. You read about a grisly child killing and hear about a mysterious shipwreck, and learn the fascinating story of why a swamp got its bloody name. Like the first game, things are never quite right- but once \"the darkness\" falls, things get more twisted and you're in a nightmare world. And this world seems tailor made to oppress James.This is the first in the series to allow both free roaming controls as well as the remote-control car style used in the original game, and other things, such as the boxes of bullets and first aid kits, will be familiar to players of the first game. As will the radio that emits louder and louder white noise as you approach, and the trusty flashlight (which you'll definitely be using). So it's the same gameplay to those familiar with the series and other games like it. Puzzle difficulty is actually adjustable and quite easy on the simplest level, so this game won't have you running for a strategy guide. Unfortunately, combat is also somwehat simple. There are some neat boss fights but the rest of the game is more about exploring, not fighting (though there's a lot to fight should you choose). But this lean on exploration is appreciated since this game gives you the biggest glimpse into what Silent Hill is really like.Lastly, there's the basic version of this game and then the updated one for several systems that contains a few new options as well as a new mini-quest revolving around the character of Maria. This is the one to get, as price-wise they're about the same, but don't expect much- the new quest is less than an hour long though it does add some interesting perspective to the game.Long story short, it's the same Silent Hill that you may have liked in part one, and before things got increasingly less Silent Hill-ish with the next couple games. So play this game for the most definitive, moody Silent Hill in the series, and for the best, most understandable story as well- one of the best and most mature game stories in general. After all, Roger Avery, Oscar winning co-writer of Pulp Fiction, is doing the Silent Hill movie- and this one's his favorite too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2005"}

Neither EA nor Bioware have yet to specify anywhere just what circumstances these 3 activations are triggered. Bioware and EA should be ashamed of themselves for subscribing to a DRM scheme that only succeeds in punishing loyal customers and treating them as little more than criminals.Now, onto the game itself. The voice acting is uniformly very good to excellent. The storyline for this game is exceptionally strong. Unfortunately it's conveyed through loads of dialogue, which can sometimes slow down the pace of the game at crucial points. Also, the Mako combat vehicle doesn't handle well over hilly ground in the side-quest maps. Also, I wish the side quests had been used to explore the different cultures of the species more, rather than being told about them via the Codex. KOTOR did this very successfully - why couldn't Mass Effect.In fact, in almost every single area except one - storyline - KOTOR overshadows its successor. The side quests aren't as good. The main campaign is far far too short, with only four...possibly five major planets in the main campaign. And the combat interface is nowhere near as good as KOTOR's.But it's the DRM scheme that is the killer for this game. Is there really any point in buying a game (for full price) that you can only play 3 times before it's deactivated? My advice? Pull out your old copy of KOTOR instead - if only so that you can remember a time when Bioware were a reputable development company, and not slaves to a bunch of Corporate shills.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2008"}

With a few tweaks in the ini file, the PC version looks absolutely outstanding, far better than the ps3 version (didn't see the 360 version but I assume it's basically the same).  The difference is that the PC when used with the keyboard will lack that slow pacing the character can do, nealy tiptoeing.  It's walk or run or sprint, but that's about all the differences.Otherwise, the game looks great.  It's also amazing to see how BIG the cities are.  Usually, in game cities aren't that big (or weren't until gt3).  Not only that, but just about everything is climbable.  Also, this game features probably the most dense crowd i've seen in a game yet.  It's not like a few people scattered here and there or in groups, literally there can be 80 people on the screen (or more with some tweaking).  The combat is simple and doesn't bog you down, as the main objective is to sneak around, kill and get away.As well, the storyline is something that I like.  It's one of the conspiracy story lines that you have to figure things out.  \"You cannot stop us.\"  \"Who?  Who's us?\"  \"you will find out soon enough *bloody cough* haha.\"  That kind.  And that's what this game is full of, on the game front and the story front.BAD:Ok, there is a lot of shortcomings.  One thing I noticed immediately.  It's broad daylight ALL THE TIME.  You'd think that an assassin would prefer the cover of dark?  Well Altir thinks it's best to be cocky and do things during the day, either that or this is the reverse of Dark City and the sun never goes down.  It also never rains.  So we have no day cycles or weather cycles.And though the crowd is big, they're pretty lifeless.  The only adidtions are some people talking (merchants and crowd speakers) and the ones that get in the way (beggars and drunks/madmen).  And about those annoying ones, they only annoy YOU.  They never annoy any other NPC's.  And the crowd, though great, big and immersive and stuff, tends to get in the way most of the time (which can be good or bad).  Otherwise the crowd just walks around, pushing you out of the way and dropping what they're carrying and cursing you for it.  The guards are also as agile as you are.  Yep, templar, full chainmail, jumps around just as well asy ou do, though not with the same pathfinding.  I'd expect them to stumble more when jumping from post to post, but nah.The next thing that is also blaringly annoying is the camera, not just the fact that the camera CANNOT go through objects, move closer or further away from you dynamically, or even move into a first person running cam, it locks on targets during certain sitautions and won't unlock until that person is done talking.  Yes, I know I just rescued you citizen, stop telling me that you're grateful and will go home and will not come out and will find somewhat to pay me back even, just let me start getting out of here already!  Seriously.  That part is absolutely annoying.Also, be gentle with the controls and take things a little easy because altir won't always do what you want him to.  You want him to jump up a wall, he might run up the wall next to it and then you want him to stop and he'll jump off the wall then fall to the street below and get pushed around by a drunk guy.Also read the manual.  There's tips that will really help you out, like you can fist fight in public without alerting the guards.  Nifty.ALSO, those flags you see everywhere, don't worry about them.  That's really for the 360 achievement that, well, you can't get.  They don't have some secret mission that is unlocked either.So what kept me playing this game?  it's story.  I just had to know what was going on.  In the end, it was kind of disappoitned because I had this great idea for the ending of the game (kind of immersive \"bleeding effect\" you'll get to know about, maybe).  But no.  It doesn't end like that at all.  I still liked it, though, just not the ending I had imagined.  Ubisoft has confirmed a sequel but has not confirmed a release date at the time of this review.  I'm a Half-life fan, so I'm used to 5 or so years between releases.Parent Warnings and other Political Correctness: This game is about killing, so keep that in mind.  You can kill women in it too.  There are no children in the game, however, so killing them isn't an issue.  There's blood but no other gore, like dismemberments or guts.  There's no other violence other than physical.  There's no vulgarity either (at least I didn't notice any).  No nudity or other adult content and no mods to give it any.  There are a lot of religious references and slander against/from muslim, jewish and christian.  The religious origin of the main character is not mentioned.  The game does have an anti-religious element towards the end but then takes a step back from it.  It does have some pretty deep plots and things you gotta figure out so may not be enjoyable to younger audiences.Tip: ALT-F4 is a good way to exit the game.  See Tweak guides for a good way to set up the PC version to perform at its peak on current-day equipment.I ran this on: AMD 6400, Vista 64, 8 GB Ran, NVidia 8800gt + Widescreen monitor.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0085L2T0A","description":"","reviewerName":"Evildead11","summary":"Attitude!","reviewText":"It may have taken many WWE releases to finally get it right, but they did, in fact, get it right with WWE '13.  The controls are pretty much the same from WWE '12, which is a good thing.  It's very easy to learn and start competing without getting pummeled because you can't remember the three or four button combo needed to perform a suplex or a body slam.The game has various modes including the normal WWE RAW/Smackdown &#34;season&#34; and the newly added &#34;WWE Attitude Era&#34; mode.  The Attitude mode basically takes you through history starting back with the formation of Degeneration X and the progression to present day WWE.  Now, this is a very cool idea and opens up the opportunity to play as very cool wrestlers such as Mankind, The New Age Outlaws, Stone Cold, etc.  The one issue I have with the Attitude mode is that, if you want to unlock certain bonuses such as new wrestlers, you must not only win the matches set for you, but you must perform certain actions during the match.  For example, you are Shawn Michaels wrestling the Undertaker.  You must win by pinfall...AND you must perform Sweet Chin Music twice, hit the Undertaker with a chair, successfully land an elbow drop from the top rope to the OUTSIDE of the ring and perform at least 3 taunts.  I mean, seriously?  Isn't it enough to just win the match?  Nope.  Some of the matches aren't that demanding in terms of the &#34;extras&#34; that you must perform, but it's annoying nonetheless.And while I'm on the subject of unlocking bonus material, that's another negative aspect of this game in my opinion.  You do start with a decent stable of wrestlers, but there are SO many more available and you must unlock them all by performing various feats in the game.  I guess I'm just an old fashioned MK type of guy who wants the instant gratification of having all available fighters at my disposal.  If your favorite wrestler is Bret Hart, then you want to play as Bret Hart.  Not win the Diva's championship in a lumberjack match to unlock him.  I suppose some gamers consider this a reason to put long hours into the game and look at it as a plus.  I'm just not one of those guys who plays games over and over again to win all of the trophies, so to me, it's an annoyance.Another thing I'd like to see is a living roster option similar to sports games such as NBA 2K13 or MLB The Show.  WWE constantly shuffles its active roster and introduces new characters.  After 3 or 4 months, the WWE '13 roster was out of date.  There is downloadable content available for SOME new wrestlers (Ryback, for example), but the DLC is fairly limited and the updates were eventually halted.  I suppose this is a tactic that Madden fans know well.  Force you to buy next year's edition if you want the new players.  Oh well.Overall, this is a very fun game for casual and especially hardcore WWE fans.  It has the content, the controls, the graphics, the music, the customization and everything else a wrestling fan could ask for.  I can't think of a better wrestling game I've played.Overall: 4/5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2013"}

All-new dungeons and dialogue scenes to challenge and thrill gamers","reviewerName":"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","summary":"Brings back great memories","reviewText":"I'll be the first to admit it- Dawn of Souls doesn't have much new content in it. Save for a monster database, updated graphics and menus, a few new dungeons, and the ability to save anywhere, it's pretty much just a re-release of two RPG classics.However, one must next ask if this is a bad thing. Certainly, I'd have been more pleased to see one of the later titles in the series (say, 3 or 4) released, but this was the next best thing. Anyone familiar with Square's RPG line will immediately recognize the gameplay style, even if they haven't played the originals. As with the later games, you control a party, visit towns, fight monsters, and battle through dungeons. The quests are typical RPG fare. They're not particularly inspiring, but this fact is oddly irrelevant when you're busy trying to survive against hordes of bloodthirsty enemies. Of those there are plenty, as well as scores of equipment choices and abilities.The two games play quite differently when it comes to combat and character building, which should be no surprise to those who have followed the Final Fantasy series in its long, illustrious career. Of particular note is the fact that the second game is the first FF title to introduce characters with distinct personages and stories, which is now of course a mainstay in the RPG genre.Both games have a main plot and keep you at least partially reminded of your goals, but you have a great deal of freedom to roam the world and see the various locations and monsters (and, naturally, the loot they're guarding). Though dated, the graphics aren't an eyesore, and there's enough unique monsters and backgrounds to make exploration interesting.Lastly, there is of course the fact that these are two complete, long, high-quality RPGs in one game that is for an excellent portable console. This really seals the deal in my opinion, despite the recycled content. Additionally, if you haven't played either FF1 or 2, my recommendation is to click the 'add to cart' button immediately. The new areas also add bosses from some of the other FF games, all of whom are probably even harder than they were in those titles. Though not a selling point, it's a great bit of added fun for fans.Dawn of Souls is an excellent throwback title that brings back two great RPG classics. For those that want to relive the adventures with some extra content, or for those that missed out before, this game will surely not disappoint.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2005"}

I found the first couple hours of this game to be boring, to be honest.  I thought the way it starts out, the environments it has you playing in for the first 2 or 3 hours, were very unoriginal.  So much so that I stopped playing it for a few weeks.I popped it back in my 360 this weekend, and played it to the end.  The last 3/4ths of the game were a lot of fun. There are some good set pieces, some fun vehicle combat (the first time I've felt that way in a Halo game) and Halo finally clicked with me.That said, I was surprised and disappointed by the quality of graphics.  They're not bad, by any stretch, it's just they are below average, even compared to what was coming out when this game was released.  They are very sub par compared to what is coming out today.  I only had a PS3 when this game was released, and I remember a lot of people saying this game was comparable to the original Uncharted game on PS3.  That's where I think my expectations were misplaced.  There's a lot of aliasing, muddy textures, obvious geometry, and even some hitching from time to time.Where the game shines though is in the variety it throws at you, in terms of what you're doing.  One minute your fighting through corridors, the next your driving a Warthog and helping an AI character take out the enemy, the next you flying a vehicle and taking out very large and impressive enemies.  The challenge on normal also feels right on, which is an improvement over Halo 1.If you haven't played this game and enjoy first person shooters, this is definitely worth your time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00D6PTMSW","description":"","reviewerName":"W. C. Bryant","summary":"60 Day Challenge/Review","reviewText":"So it's going to take some time for this review to come together, entirely because I intend to add to it once a week over the next 60 days.  Going in I have absolutely no guitar experience at all, and the last time I played a musical instrument of any sort was about 30 years ago -- and then that was an unwelcome piano lesson once a week for a couple months (until I won the battle of wills with my well-meaning mother).  What I'm saying is that you couldn't be much more raw and musically inexperienced than I am.  Today is 12/19/13.  I expect to describe my first week's worth or progress and experiences shortly after Christmas.  At the end of it all, we'll see what the practical results of the 60 day challenge are for at least one person outside of the compelling ads currently running on tv.I barely know how to hold a guitar -- this should be fun.  See you in a week to ten days, and then every week thereafter.--12/31/13 (Week One Complete)--The first week was both exciting and humbling.  Exciting in the sense that I had absolutely no ability or familiarity going in, and as I sit here now I can pluck (out of game) reasonable facsimiles of various chord-less sections of songs out on demand.  Whether it's the simple but recognizable intro to Metallica's One (that just happened to be the first I picked up, happened to stumble across a couple of the notes and decided to piece it together through a process of trial and error), or something basic such as the national anthem, I can find and produce notes reliably.This is really the result of the fun 16-bit style mini-games within the game itself.  These are skill challenges, and without even realizing it you're creating fantastic familiarity and muscle memory, as well as conditioning your wrists, hands, and fingers to move and function in ways that are often foreign to them for the novice.The week was humbling in the sense that the game isn't even a little shy about bumping you up in difficulty level on the fly.  When you're not playing minigames, you're taking little scaling difficulty lessons or working on songs themselves.  In the latter practice, JUST as you start to feel like you're actually mastering the few notes you're being asked to play, just as you think \"I'm going to nail it this time\", the game bumps you up and suddenly there are more notes, new types of notes, chords, and they're all coming faster.  But that's not a negative, that's the joy of this experience, because you start fumbling through those -- and when they give you too many problems, the game tells you what to go practice via minigames, and miraculously you come out of playing those (fun in their own right whether you're shooting blocky little ducks or backing down charging cowboys) with skills and understanding you just didn't have before.  It's all very \"wax on, wax off\", and \"paint the fence.\"  Which is, for lack of a better word, fantastic.--1/7/14 (Week Two Complete)--I'm making progress for sure.  I've broken 50% on a couple songs, and can identify where I'm struggling (chords, bends (ow, fingertips, ow), and tremolo).  Happily the games to work on these skills are fun and satisfying, and I'm trading back and forth on high scores in each with my brother (who was prompted to buy RockSmith and a guitar as the result of my raves).  I find it easy to get overwhelmed at this point as difficulty ramps, but the game is good about recognizing when it's pushing you way too hard (too many notes, shifts, chords, etc., too quickly) and scales back down when you're just missing too much.  The difficulty there at times is just playing through and hitting as much as you can as well as you can, so the game can make informed decisions.  Any perfectionist/completionist/mild-OCD types will be sorely tempted to restart a song -- and there's little harm in that here or there.My fingers and wrists are still adjusting to positions and movement otherwise alien and uncomfortable to them.  At times I feel like it's my own anatomy standing in the way of hitting a chord, rather than an understanding of what I need to be doing; but I'm building muscle memory, I know this, and automaticity and familiarity will come with practice, practice, practice.I'm still doing at least an hour a day.  Often more in one sitting.  I still won't be confused with even a novice guitar player away from the game, but it is all coming together.  I see no reason to drop my initial ratings at this juncture.  As superficial and somewhat ill-informed they were, the 5's stand.  I'm playing a game, learning, but taking away a real world skill.  That's something.--1/14/14 (Week Three Complete)--It's seriously a little hard to type.  I'm not at the \"cool calluses, bro!\" phase with my fingers.  More the raw \"maybe I should type without that finger\" phase.  Playing 2-3 hours a day now because I'm seeing real progress and that excites me.These days I'm mostly going into the Non-Stop Play mode.  I've got all the E Standard songs selected (including several DLCs I've added) and I just do that for an hour.  It keeps things dynamic, which is good because with songs like Black, Creep, Paranoid Android, and Synchronicity, I was starting to be able to play big sections of each without even looking at the screen.  That's great -- but I want to keep working on my hand-eye coordination as it relates to unfamiliar sequences.  I want to find the right strings and frets faster on the fly, and that's happening.Good week for the mini-games.  While I lag behind my (10 year junior) brother in scores, I'm still in the top 100 for both the Saloon and Duck games (something like 16 and 54 million points, respectively).  I really need to spend more time in the chords and scales games, but, ah, competitive spirit.  Likewise, in Learn a Song he's recently broken 70%, and I lag just behind in the mid-to-high 60s -- but he had guitar lessons for a year or so earlier in life, and I (as above) had none.  Still, must beat the whelp.I have good days and bad, the latter where I'm every bit as engaged but just don't feel like it's coming naturally.  Nonetheless, my progress in unmistakable and highly encouraging.DUE TO LENGTH, ANY FUTURE UPDATES WILL BE MADE IN THE COMMENTS.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. Get ready to jump out of your couch cushions!--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessGreat cooperative modePlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multi-player options","reviewerName":"Dave \"odyssasthai\"","summary":"Very polished, very complete game","reviewText":"Doom 3 is an incredibly well made and artistic game, however I don't know that I would recommend it unconditionaly.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"Tony","summary":"I fight so strong and good!","reviewText":"Oh man!  there are so many good things about this game that you should really go out and buy it today for the holidays!

The game itself is pretty cool. I adored the first game in the series. It remains one of my favorite first person shooters I've ever played. The second game was a big step down, but still different enough to be somewhat memorable, and was also a fun game. Crysis 3, despite trying to recall the lush open spaces of jungle and vegetation of the first game, feels much more like the more constricted, urban war zone that was Crysis 2. It's a fun game. The shooting is meaty and satisfying, the nanosuit is always fun to use, and the newly added bow and arrow gives the game a nice boost to stealth that surpasses even the first two games. It's a gorgeous game to look at, even on the ancient PS3, and the sound design is fantastic.Yet in the end, Crysis 3, much like Crysis 2, feels more like a modern tech demo than it does a heartfelt video game. Maybe it was because I played this game so soon after the masterful and amazing Metro: Last Light, but I never really felt anything other than superficial, in-the-moment enjoyment while I played this game. Nothing about it really left a mark, make me think, or intrigued me in any way. The game doesn't really introduce anything new to the genre, while at the same time it really doesn't do much wrong either. I think I'm just at the point where I'm expecting more out of the games I play. Video games have become absolutely amazing fusions of so many experiences, especially in the last three years or so, and games like Crysis 3, while fun in the moment, just don't do much for me anymore. But still, it's a very competent game, and fans of first person shooters should enjoy the campaign, despite it being very short (I beat it in about 7 hours).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2014"}

Wii, like all the previous releases in theSuper Mario Bros.franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiis held sideways, allowing for easy, classic inputs using the D-pad to direct playable characters, the 1 button to jump and 2 button to spit out projectiles like snowballs and fireballs. In addition, players can access powerups with their choice of either the push of a button, or by shaking the Wii remote, again demonstrating the perfect merging of classic gameplay and modern game design which isNew Super Mario Bros. Wii.Key Game FeaturesNew Super Mario Bros. Wiioffers a combination of cooperation and competition. Players can pick each other up to save them from danger or toss them into it.Supports 2-4 players in multiplayer mode.Mario, Luigi and two Toads are all playable characters, while many others from the Mushroom Kingdom make appearances throughout the game. Players can even ride different Yoshi characters and use their tongues to swallow enemies &ndash; or their fellow players.In some areas, players use the motion abilities of the Wii Remote controller. The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"W. McKinney","summary":"Great fun but requires too much precision","reviewText":"I'm not usually deterred by a challenging game, but there's a fine line between challenging and unforgiving. In too many of the stages, the precision and timing required can be frustrating. I've had to complete way too many of the stages using the Luigi Super Guide, which completes the stage for you and then ask you if you'd like to retry the stage or skip it. I kept retrying at first, but eventually I began skipping those I couldn't clear before the Super Guide kicks in. I wish Nintendo would have allowed players to save after each stage. There's nothing more frustrating than finally finishing a stage after numerous attempts only to \"die\" on the next stage and then have to replay the previous stage again. If you love a true challenge, this is your game. If you're a casual gamer who doesn't play that often, this game will likely frustrate you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2010"}

The pinball physics are dead-on as well, and the game's overall presentation is a pleasent surprise as well.  The only real flaws with Pinball Hall of Fame is that more games weren't included on the disc.  It just feels like more tables should have been included here, or at least something else.  Other than that, the Wii motion controls work very well here, although one may wonder if that is reason enough to justify the price tag of the Wii version of the game being doubled.  All that aside, Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection is a sheer blast, and for Wii owning pinball fans, you can't go wrong here at all.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2008"}

Your journey starts off while you are still a citizen of Vault 101. Oblivious to the outside world and to the dangers that await you in the not too distant future you go about the normal teenage rites of passage as you prepare to take on the adult responsibilities of being a vault dweller.  Unfortunately for you, fate has other plans.On your 18th birthday you wake up to the sounds of screams and alarms. You soon find out that your father has left the vault and the effort to stop him has caused other problems as well. As you make your way through the vault you find that your father was part of a mysterious project that he and your mother were working on before you were born. Since it's clear that you are in danger because of your father's escape you know you cannot stay in the vault.  With the help of your friend you exit the vault with security hot on your heels.  As your eyes adjust to the unfamiliar sunlight you catch the first glimpse of your new home, the barren and blasted capital wasteland.As you take your first steps out of the vault, you have only one goal: find your father and find out why it was so important that he leave the vault and you without any explanation.---------------------------------------I can say that I enjoyed playing this game as when I finished I had 98 some hours on my save game.  The game as a whole is interesting and I wanted to go on to see where the story would go next most of the time. The problem with this type of game though is that it basically throws you out in this big world and says \"You figure out how you want it to go.\"  While there are some barriers that you can't get past until certain parts of the story are done, most of the game is open.So you can follow the main story straight through, you can mix and match, or you can do everything and then do the main story. I chose mostly the third option with a little bit of the second, which depending on when you choose to do that can make the game a little more difficult as I ended up having to fight well-armed tanks every couple of blocks after that point. This put a bit of a damper on my exploring ways for the rest of the game.The third option though highlights the problem with the way the story is presented. If you do it the way I like to play you will probably feel like you have been traveling the wasteland for years righting wrongs, making it so everyone knows that being a raider is a very bad career choice, and you know maybe everyone would kind of be aware that you are a force best crossed at their own risk. The thing is, it doesn't really affect the main storyline time line that much if at all. It seems like everything happens over a period of a couple of months, not the time span it should be.One example I can think of is something you're supposed to do at the beginning of the game. I forgot that I needed to go see the bartender to figure out where the characters father went after he left the vault, so if it had been that long for me shouldn't he have had a harder time remembering? I just remember that because I had to laugh because the bartender says something along lines of he passed through this was a few days ago and I was 30 or 40 hours into the game or something like that. I just think it would be neat if he said something along the lines of \"You mean *he's* your father? He went here, let me mark it for you...no, no, I wouldn't think of charging you for that. Actually here I got some spare caps, here you go. You're leaving soon right? It's just a rumor about you making that corrupt mayor walk through the subway with a \"I hate ghouls\" poster...right ?\"Summary:Controls: I couldn't complain. Basic moving around works well enough and the targeting system does a good job of letting you take out enemies.  I did find though that if I tried to play it like a normal FPS my results were mixed. Not using the auto target seems to increase the chance of critical hits, but the controls are a little too clunky to use that method in firefights where there are multiple enemies or the combat is close quarters. I would say stick with the auto target as it slows things down enough where the combat is manageable and besides most shots are in slow mo which never really got old to me.Graphics: I thought they were fine.  There are some nice touches here and there, like the glass sheen that are on the rocks scattered around, but they are not going to set anyone's world on fire I imagine.Game Play: There is lots to do and lots to find.  I had fun with my time exploring the wasteland.  I just wish all the little stories in the game where a little more tied together with the main story.Recommendation: If you like open world games, dungeon crawlers, The elder scrolls, Sci-Fi, grim post-apocalyptic worlds then you will probably like this. If you want that with a more FPS approach, then I would say try Rage. m.a.c","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2012"}

I'm stil trying to come to grips with Hidden&Dangerous2; with its UK keyboard movements...to me it's almost unplayable..the key strokes are all over the place...Sam~So in all fairness, this game really should get the credit it deserves and true fans of first person singleplayer games owe it to themself to atleast give it a look see and the price now makes it feasible...and although it isn't up there with CoD 4 let's say in the Pantheon, it really does stand on its own two legs as a welcome addition to the very enjoyable series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2012"}

This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"J. Black","summary":"PARADISE LOST","reviewText":"As a huge fan of the Burnout series, I regret to say that I am extremely disappointed with this new installment.  What is truly sad though, is to think of how good this game COULD have been.  The visuals are outstanding, the speed is amazing, and all the while the frame-rate is as smooth as butter.  Paradise also boasts smooth controls and a pretty good soundtrack.  But if you loved the previous Burnout titles be prepared for a major shock... or several, as a matter of fact.  Here are my biggest complaints:1) No Crash Mode.  Here's an idea: Lets take one of the series' most memorable and beloved features and give it the axe.  Yes its totally nixed.  Why?  Who knows.2) No \"Retry\" option. Yes you heard me correctly.  If you screw up you CAN'T RESTART THE RACE!  Which leads me to my next complaint...3) Backtracking.  Just lose a race?  Oh well, you'll just have to drive the five miles back to the starting point. What? You can't find the starting point again?4) Awful navigation.  It is way too easy to get lost, and there is no way to instantly \"Jump To\" an event or location.  Furthermore, the mini map is fixed.  Anyone who plays open-world racers knows it is much easier to have the map orient itself to the direction of the car.5) No \"Quit Race\" option. Oops, I didn't want to play THIS race.  I guess I'll just have to meander about until the timer runs down.NOTE TO THE DEVELOPER: Thanks for taking a perfectly good series and screwing it up.  You were so busy trying to jump on the \"open-world\" BANDWAGON that you forgot why fans really loved the Burnout franchise to begin with.  If gamers want to play \"open-world\" racing, they play Midnight Club, Need For Speed: Most Wanted, Test Drive Unlimited, or one of the many others out there.  If they want fast paced arcade style action, and the ability to quickly browse through events they play Burnout... or used to anyway.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2008"}

Marcewicz","summary":"Not COD 4, but it's okay","reviewText":"I'll be honest, I read the reviews on this game before purchasing it; and did so with doubts in my mind. I am stationed overseas and just bought the PS3 the other day, our exchange is severly lacking in video game department so I bought R6V2 just for something to do until my COD4 gets here from Amazon. First, let me say that it isn't as bad as some people have written. I haven't played the story mode the whole way through because I mostly play online, but it seems okay from what I've seen. The grafics are very nice and the controls seem to work reasonably well with the game (could be better). As my review's title says, this is no COD4! This game is fun to play online, but I wasn't terribly impressed. Very glichy, if you catch my drift. Also, I'm not sure if it's my internet connection or the game but, playing online I get this awful repeating noise that lasts an entire battle. No, it's not someone's machine gun shooting me. So, if anyone knows how to solve that problem and wouldn't mind sharing the knowledge, I'd really appreciate it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2008"}

These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"Christopher Manna","summary":"Final Fantasy X: Amazing Game!!","reviewText":"Final Fantasy X has all you want in a RPG.

{"product_name":"B000FQBPCQ","reviewerName":"ahw","summary":"Good, but Feels Like Every Other Zelda","reviewText":"Zelda is probably a fantastic game if you've never played a Zelda game before, or haven't played very many.  But if you're like me, it's still fun, but you'll definitely feel like you've been here before.  This review is from the perspective of someone who's played a lot of Zelda games.Story (2/5)Relatively unchanged since the original Zelda.  Basically, you're saving Princess Zelda and the Kingdom of Hyrule.  Every iteration of the series seems to add an additional gimmick - this time it's the \"twilight world\" and Link's wolf-form.  But nothing groundbreaking or original in terms of story.  But then again, IMO, Zelda has never been about stellar story telling.Gameplay (4/5)Basically recycled from every other Zelda out there.  You run around from temple to temple.  Inside the temple are a series of block-puzzles, or some other sort of mental puzzle.  Every time you beat a temple you get: 1) a new item, 2) a heart piece, and 3) a piece of the triforce/pendant/free a sage/piece of some twilight-y artifact.  Hooray.  Combat is for the most part recycled from the N64 Zelda, but swordfighting is a little more sophisticated with the addition of a few new combat moves executed by an intuitive motion with the wii-mote or nunchuck.  The wolf aspect of the game feels tacked on.  Combat in wolf-form is particular monotonous, consisting of Z-targeting and bashing on the A button to perform lunge attacks.  \"Digging\" in wolf-form is basically Twilight Princess' answer to the shovel of past Zeldas, and the \"Sense\" ability is usually just used to follow a scent (graphically depicted as a line of smoke) to your destination.  Woooo.Graphics (4/5)The graphics are pretty enough to get it done, but nothing awe-inspiring compared to offerings on Xbox360 or the PC.  The architectural designs are pretty cool though, particularly for the twilight realm.  However, I've always been annoyed at the unnatural facial expressions and body movements in Zelda games.  The way Link smiles at the kids from Ordon village would make you think he belongs on a sex offender registry.Music/Sound (3/5)Your standard, but catchy, Zelda themes in bland midi form.  The game could have benefitted from some voice acting, or at least expanding beyond the sort of odd emotional utterances at the beginning of conversations (\"HEEYYYY!\").  And what crazy language is Midna speaking?Fun (4/5)I guess video games really just boil down to the fun factor, and Zelda is a pretty fun game.  Again, I'll bet that it's a fantastically fun game for first-timers to the series, but for people like me who've basically played twilight princess before, it's repetitive.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2007"}

The game is easy but not too easy but does present challenges at some points though. Enemies in groups of about 2-6 are really easy but if you go into a area with around 20 or so it will be a lot more challenging. The games quest ideas are good and a break from the ordinary.

Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"My best keyboard in a long, long time","reviewText":"To state that I am impressed with this keyboard would be almost an understatement. I've been using aMicrosoft Digital Media Pro Keyboardfor the past couple of years and I was very happy with it and, I thought I was going to give this one to one of my gaming little sons but... it looks like I'm keeping it for myself and I'm ordering a second one for him.I am going to state what impressed me or disappointed me as a lite gamer but a relatively heavy keyboard user. Everything else, it's probably available in the official product description or in other reviews.+ Quality build:--------------Unlike what another review states, this is a well-built, well designed keyboard. The plastic does not feel 'cheap'. On the contrary. In addition, the keyboard is so heavy, it 'sticks' to the desk and it would hardly moved when accidentally bumped.+ Switchable and REMOVABLE numeric keypad:----------------------------------------Taking off the keypad is as easy as pulling it. It's kept attached to the main body via a couple of strong magnets so it's easy to remove but, once it's attached it will stick to the body.+ Excellent for typing:---------------------Bing a touch typist I hereby testify that this is a GREAT keyboard. It's not as quiet as the one I am now abandoning (see above) but a little more click does not bother me.+ A large number of easy-to-program macro keys:---------------------------------------------There are 12 (2 * 6) dedicated macro keys on the left side plus 18 keys on the numeric keypad which COULD be assigned to single-key macros, adding up to 30. Multiply that by the 3 easy to switch 'profiles' and there's a total of 90 single-key macros.A rough 'draft' of a macro can be done by simply performing the task while in 'record' mode. Then, the IntelliType Pro utility allows for refinements and adjustments. I was able to build a rather complex macro within minutes of trying one for the very first time.+ Macros aren't for gaming only-----------------------------The macro that I just built is not for game-playing. It's for business use and it's saving me lots of dumb keystrokes and therefore a lot of time.+ Not as many unneeded keys-------------------------It's probably just me but I never use those dedicated keys that would start 'mail', take you to the 'pictures' folder or maybe open a browser. This does have the 'calculator' button and the speaker volume and the play/stop/skip keys but all others are missing. I feel that this is a pretty good compromise.= Backlighting is cool but, why not blue or green?------------------------------------------------I do appreciate the fact that the macro-assignable keys have a yellow backlight vs the the red for everything else but I wish that other color choices were available.- The numeric keypad feels like it's about to break-------------------------------------------------As I mentioned already, it's held onto the main body with magnets. I am not used to my new keyboard yet so, every time I am moving it around, it feels like the right section is about to break.- It can't be raised------------------The only serious issue is its lacking those little legs that would allow me to raise the keyboard a little. I thought I was going to miss it more but, it seems, I'm getting used to it already. However, not everyone may feel that way.Overall, this is an easy 5-star. I am NOT a Microsoft fan but this Microsoft keyboard is a keeper.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2008"}

I was stunned at how terrible the games were, and my expectations were not high to begin with after reading the other reviews. For example, comparing Wii Sports Tennis to Wii Play Table Tennis is night and day. The Wii Sports Tennis actually requires you to swing your arm, you can do a backhand stroke, and real effort is required. Wii Play Table Tennis on the other hand just requires that you slightly move the remote left or right to hit the ball. There are not actual swings and often your movements won't register, or won't register accurately. I found this to be consistently a problem throughout all of the games in Wii Play. My eight year old daughter does enjoy the fishing game, but the rest of them just didn't get played after a couple of days because they really are that bad.I did give it three stars though because the game included aWii Remote Controllerand that was our primary reason for purchase.

{"product_name":"B0041OWQTO","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Way-too-late review: Borderlands GOTY edition","reviewText":"This game came very cheap ($10 new), and since I'd never finished it a few years earlier (due to my PS3 dying via the \"yellow light of death\" midway through the campaign), I thought I'd try to pick up where I left off. I played through the main campaign about as quickly as possible, then slowed down to explore the DLC, which I only perused the first time through.ProsFast paced, intense action. You rarely had to travel far without facing a group of enemies waiting to tear your head off. Between running low on shields or health, hiding behind cover, finding the right gun to take them down or using your special skill at the right moment, the enemies were frequent and the action was intense.Loved constantly upgrading weapons. Think Diablo with guns. One of my favorite aspects of an RPG is that the character (and arsenal) you start with will be different than the one you end with. There's no way I could recall the number of guns I used throughout Borderlands, but it had to number near fifty. At one point or another, I used, as my primary gun, all of the eight weapon types in the game. No two were exactly the same. In addition to damage, other variables included rate of fire, accuracy, zoom range, clip size, reload speed, recoil amount, extra melee damage, elemental damage (fire, shock, acid or explosive) and elemental chance.Huge world. There must have been at least (via load screens) 25 different areas, each a few virtual miles across. The design of each didn't feel very varied, but the sheer size allowed for a lot of exploration.Loved animated look to world. The animated (for lack of a better term) look to Borderlands gave it a unique feel. Instead of going for the same visuals as every other FPS out there, they added a \"comic book\" type aesthetic that gave the game a certain light-heartedness that I found to be a great change of pace.(Slight spoiler) As anticlimactic as the campaign's finale was, the DLC's MINAC made up for it. Let me just say this: the DLC, if played in release order (which I recommend), features an epic final boss battle that makes up for the poor way the vanilla game ended. I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't played Clap-Trap's Robot Revolution, so I'll just spell out the aforementioned acronym: Mega Interplanetary Ninja Assassin Clap-Trap.ConsStory? There was some kind of convoluted story about a special vault and several companies trying to acquire its contents. That was the gist of it. I fought through countless enemies and I had no idea why they were trying to kill me or why I was supposed to kill them (other than some \"crazy\" enemies).Not a large enemy variety. Technically there WAS a decent amount of different enemies; humans, aliens and several native creatures, each potentially with different weapons and/or elemental damage, but it didn't FEEL like a large variety, probably because the vast majority consisted of (usually shirtless) humans, who either ran at you with a weapon raised or shot at you from afar.Travel. Maps and getting around was frustrating. There were occasional poles to fast travel between locations, but all it gave were names, not visual locations on a map. For example, one location was named \"Middle of Nowhere.\" Great. That will really help me remember that area and whether I want to spend several minutes in a loading screen traveling there.Saving in DLC was extremely frustrating. While saving in the vanilla game was acceptable (you'd restart at the nearest save pole), saving and loading in the DLC was brutal: you'd go all the way back to the beginning of the area! And some of these areas were HUGE, requiring driving, fighting and several loading screens to get back to where you'd ACTUALLY last saved.Could've used more big weapons. For a game all about guns and blowing stuff up, there just weren't many `wow' moments or weapons. Even the rocket launchers lacked a certain feeling of power. Borderlands could've used a few special weapons like a minigun, a TOW launcher, or some others of that ilk.Monotonous look to Pandora. Was there ever any game world more monotonous than Pandora? It was basically a big desert with rocks of varying size. I can't recall any weather effects or day/night cycles.Character upgrades were meh. It was cool to offer character upgrades in an FPS, but they rarely felt like they added much.ConclusionBorderlands was a very good game that failed to reach its potential. Based on the reviews for the sequel, it seems that the developers learned from their mistakes, and I'm very much looking forward to playing it.BTW, the DLC was included on the disc.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2013"}

{"product_name":"B004S5TDL0","description":"","reviewerName":"DryvBy","summary":"Skeptical But Now I'm a Believer","reviewText":"I had so many doubts about this product. I questioned how this game was going to know which tabs/chords I was playing. I didn't know if it would actually help me learn to play any better than the countless YouTube vidoes had before. But my questions were soon answered thanks to GameStop having a good sale on the \"game\" a couple of weeks ago.I've had a guitar since 2001 and I've learned to do absolutely nothing on it. I'd practice for a couple of days, maybe even a week, and lose all interest in it until a couple of months later. I never wanted to get a teacher for help since I'm a full time employee, married, and a gamer (ie: no free time). I tried several methods online, even bought the beginner books at stores... nothing. So this game was my last hope. And so far, I've stuck with it longer than before. Am I learning anything? Maybe, maybe not, but I'm at least practicing.The game works, which blew me away. I have a friend that's the exact same way with the guitar as me, and also a gamer. I loaded Skype up so he could watch me play and so we could judge the game based on what it was advertised as. He was blown away too, buying it the next day.When you play, the game starts you out on very basic tabs. At first, I was thinking this method sucked (still blown by the fact that it recognized I was playing the right note). I soon realized that it would be pointless to throw all the notes at me since I'm still in learning mode. But basically, the game will start you off with a few notes here and there. If you're doing good, you will \"level up\" and be able to play more notes. Start sucking again, it will level you back down. I have found this method extremely helpful so far and something that really makes sense.While you play through events and practice-practice-practice, you'll unlock some mini-games that help you progress further. These are just there to help you fine tune moving between strings and frets, chords, slides, bends, and more. I've played so much of the bends and frets that I actually do feel I've improved at the gutiar a little bit.Pretty much everything works well. There's a lot of tutorial videos and mini-games/training tools that makes the $50-$80 price really well worth it if you're seriously wanting to learn. The only thing I will say that kind of stinks is that when you turn the music/crowd off, you'll notice you still suck at the guitar because you're not strumming correctly or holding the string down incorrectly. I've been working on this and I think the best thing to do to sound better is crank the music/crowd down to about 60 and leave the guitar up so you can actually hear yourself suck.One other thing I've noticed is that the game isn't perfect at picking up the notes you've played properly. For example, if you have to strum a lot, the vibrations is what it picks up (I assume) and if a string is still vibrating, sometimes it will pick it up like you played it. It's rare, but it happens.I still give this game a 5* just because it works and it's motivated me to learn the guitar after years of excuses.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2011"}

Resistance: Fall of Man, Rainbow Six Vegas and Call of Duty 3 are the only first person hooter games I got and that all are good in there own way. Call of Duty easily beats all of them out of the competition. Call of Duty completely delivers in almost every category that a game is based on. The graphics are the best (But a lil better on 360), The sound is immersive that you would think you were actually on the battlefield if you were blind/. The presentation is great, its like you are actually in the game sometimes.There are a lot of people complaining about the single player campaign, that it is too short, and I'm very sad to report that it is pretty short. But even though it is short, the replay value is great even after you beat the game. First is obviously the online play, it is one of the deepest online mechanics, from customizing your own class to customizing your weapons the online play will keep you playing long into the end of next year. Plus once you beat the game, there is an arcade mode in which you play the campaign only this time there is a point system and you earn points from killing enemies. There is also split screen with 4 players which was absent from Call of Duty 3 for the PS3 last year which annoyed the f*** outta me. But even so there is very little things wrong with this game and 10x better than call of duty 3 so pick it up cuz this is one of the best games for the PS3 this year.PROS-Gameplay - tight PS3 controls (can't wait till Dualshock 3)-Graphics - one of the realest graphics I have ever seen-Sound - Call of duty has always been famous for its authentic sound and this one's no different-Campaign - short but one of the best campaigns of all time in my opinion-Online (Multiplayer) - FUN, FUN, FUN!!!!!-Replay Value - VERY VERY HIGHCONS-Campaign a lil short-No CO-OPTHE BEST PS3 GAME RIGHT NOW","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2007"}
