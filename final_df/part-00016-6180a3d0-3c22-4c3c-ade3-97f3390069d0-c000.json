This game was made for the XBROKE2, and then they lazily ported it to the superior PS3 in the most sloppy, worthless port i've ever seen. The load times are way too long, even just to save the game it goes through a 2 phase save process, it's ridiculous. The overall graphics look worse than the PS3 demo somehow? it's as if they said \"it plays well and looks good on XBROKE 2, who cares about porting it to PS3, lets not optimize the graphics and upscale everything to Blu-ray level, in fact lets just crap it out in the most sluggish insulting manor and just let the PS3 owners kiss our butts\".EDIT:revised opinion after taking time to install game media to HDD, I give it one more star since it does play a bit smoother after installing a huge chunk, around 6GB? i can't remember offhand but it's a large chunk of space just to make the game playable. It's fun, can turn into a button masher unless you can remember all the combos and get the dodging witch time thing down and try to make and art out of the button mashing. It is still sad realizing the textures probably could have been upscaled for the PS3 yet they ported it over to PS3 in the laziest fashion which is the norm this generation of XBROKE dumbed down to dvd level gaming. HD and DVD just don't mix, yet this is the cheap easy buck for all these developers, I am still sadly disappointed with the Japanese devs. this generation, I have yet to see one Blu-ray level game from a 3rd party dev, hell even the first party stuff isn't great besides Gran Turismo 5 and... well that's about it until The Last Guardian comes out, and even that may be a letdown.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2011"}

During the battle, a rift between their world and the Lost Lands opens and Tal'Set is sucked into it.Features and enhancements to this new installment in the Turok franchise include the groundbreaking Squad Dynamics System (SDS) for realistic enemy and allied squad AI, and an entirely new game engine built to take full advantage of the next-generation hardware platforms.

The game is full of destructible objects and environments: shoot down trees over your enemies and collapse massive rock spires onto dinosaurs. The environments consist of lush, living jungles. Plants move as dinosaurs brush against them while trees sway in the wind. The game also includes stealth- and action-based gameplay directed by context-sensitive, mission-based sequences.

So what if the game is just hack and slash!  From all the previews I read of this game that is what I expected.  So what if they're too may enemies, no one complained about that in the Contra series or any other game like this.The game presents a great challenge in a light I haven't seen since the good ol days of my NES.  But even if the game is a good challenge, its nothin to complain or get excited about.  Once you realize how easy it is to battle enemies you'll feel strange knowing you ever lost to them in the first place.  But the other disappointment with the difficulty is that bosses are a bit easy (but to be truthful what game actually has a tough boss nowadays on the PS2?)I was not in any way disappointed with this game, and after reading all the bad reviews that people gave it I almost didn't get it.  But then when I heard it was an old fashioned Action/Adventure game you can't resist.Don't listen to all these bad reviews (they're mostly just complaining anyway).The gameplay is fun and interesting but some of it can get really annoying sometimes like when you die and then when the game over toll keeps increasing making it harder to continue.  The game is great and exciting for an Action/Adventure gamer.The game was good in the aspect of graphics and sound.  The music is so good and gets you into the game.  The Voice acting is top notch.  While the story is the basic \"Save the princess and restore peace to the land\" stores I had no problem with it this time (as IF, HOW MANY OLD CLASSIC GAMES HAD THAT!!! Mario also comes to mind.)  The game is funner and presents a good challenge but its more about skill then difficulty.  The game doesn't even get hard until the fourth world!OVERALLPositive:+Great Graphics and Sound+A great game for the old school gamer and action/adventurer+Good combat system+Top notch voice acting+Good gameplay+Good challenge but not for a veteranNegative-Gamers more fond of the \"Next Generation Systems\" (PS2, Gamecube, XBOX) will not be very pleased with the retro aspect-Bosses are too easy-The same old \"Rescue the princess and restore peace to the land story\" that we've heard since the beginning of time-Those who don't like Action/Adventure games will be bored and then killed by hordes of enemies","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2002"}

In this updated version there are even more reasons to let it out of the basement! First off they added something which I thoroughly enjoy! Portraits. This may not seem like much but now you get to see why Galuf gets ragged so much about being old! Oddly enough he doesnt have brown hair and beard in his portrait...but thats ok we love his sprite anyway! There is much better character interaction, and the party actually seems to have developed a sort of personality. Bartz cracks Groany jokes that will make you slap your forhead. In fact there is even a very bizarre Red Lobster reference in the game... You will fall in love with Gilgamesh all over again as he incompetantly tries to thwart you repeatedly throughout the adventure. Farris is not quite so rediculously cliche as a pirate, but still cliche enough to make sense and be loveable, and her portrait helped you understand how the characters found her foxy a little more than the purple haired creature you were familiar with. X-Death is still the lamest bad guy of any FF game, but its almost kind of endeering in a way...and yes he still harnesses the ultimate power to become a....tree at the end.The class system is left more or less unscathed but for the addition of a few new ones which are dumb at best. Canoner was not somethign any of us were waiting for ff to add. Necromancer has never been the MO of the FFs and the bizarre weather oracley person just kills your party most of the time. Nice guys! It makes you wonder why they didnt throw in some FF staples that were missing. It might have been nice to have a paladin or something remotely FF thrown in there, but whatever, thats small potatoes...Its still a blacksheap but you will find the game much more playable now, and the characters dont simply clam up half way through the game like they did before!

The missions themselves are some of the most fun since the original Halo (on XBOX) for some reason (maybe because of the \"fresh look through ODST eyes\") and seem to combine all the things that make Halo a great franchise till this day.- The campaign can be played with either one of four players at any time.- Fire Fight mode and playing the campaign missions in co-op will keep you playing this game long after you beaten it.- Intense multiplayer versus action with plenty of different modes to choose from; BUT it is the same multiplayer from Halo 3 released two years ago, although all the downloadable maps are added (including as yet to be released on Xbox Live Mythic Map Pack).- The plot is less over the top then the previous Halo games and is more of a soldiers story (just a series of missions).- NO Master Chief, in this game you play an assortment of different troops from the 'Orbital Drop Shock Troop' division within the Halo universe; these guys are just skilled soldiers and are not the superman that the Master Chief is - this gives the gameplay a slightly new and more difficult feeling.- NO FLOOD, it should be noted this is the first Halo to also not have any FLOOD aliens within it.- The Story is good (with its flashback missions); or as good as you can make it, setting the game between two major titles (Halo 2 & Halo 3) and not breaking any continuity. It's a pretty realistic look at a non-Spartan II's journey in the world of Halo.- Collect audio-logs in the \"Hub-World\" that will unlock supply depots throughout the city giving you items like ATV's, Snipers Rifles, and Rocket Launchers (which helps). Also the audio-logs tells of a back story to the city and game similar the audio-logs in games like Bioshock and Fallout 3.GAME IT'S MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Halo 3 (Xbox 360/PC)- Gears of War 2(Xbox 360)- Halo 2 (Xbox)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- The game is two discs; One disc is the campaign and Fire Fight while the other is the Halo 3 multiplayer will all maps.- People who pre-ordered this game got a code to play as Sgt. Avery Johnson (a well known character in the Halo universe) in Fire Fight mode, also beating the game will unlock more characters for Fire Fight mode.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2009"}

He is the last of a noble and respected line. Raised in a series of safehouses by families loyal to his father's memory, Lucas will not rest until the Legion is rebuilt, and his family's honor is restored. Lucas has been taught the art of combat in the ancient and deadly style of the Legion. Lucas is a skilled swordsman, and a master of two combat stances. He can fight with a sword and shield, which allows him to attack quickly, deal heavy damage, and interrupt and stun single targets. When outnumbered, he wields a massive two-handed sword. While slower to swing and less practical for one-on-one combat, it can strike multiple foes and knock them back, making it an ideal weapon for crowd control.AnjaliAnjali is an archon - a legend, come to life. In the old stories, archons were spirits of fire, who served the long-lost creator gods. But Anjali was raised by friends of the Legion, and she does not know how she came to this world, or what happened to the others of her kind.Anjali can shift freely between her human form and an incarnation of elemental fire. In human form, she fights with a staff or a spear, allowing her to fend off multiple attackers while leaping in and out of the fray. In her fiery incarnation, she can hurl bolts of flame at ranged targets, flood areas with heat and fire, or inflict searing wounds that injure her foes over time.KatarinaKatarina is the daughter of a Legion commander and a Lescanzi witch.

Due to the middling to bad reviews, I decided to rent instead of buy Dungeon Siege 3.I've experienced the aforementioned camera issues and witnessed the bland story line.

Just tell me where to go, and I'll fetch your gewgaw so I can level up and stand a chance during the boss battles.  The game's basically a 'roided out Gauntlet, which is both a good and bad thing.  Mash away at the buttons, but don't stand in one place or you're dead in two seconds.  Only one other party member can join you at a time--boo.I thought the controls were a bit sluggish, so there's a black mark.  The camera views are simply awful.  The graphics and animations were pretty nice, though.Graphics weren't enough to keep me interested.  I wanted to get through this game as quickly possible.  Luckily, if you push up on the directional cross key, you'll see a little golden trail leading to your next fetch-it quest or boss battle.  Throughout the game, I was on autopilot, following the trail of golden balls to get to my next fight which led to less than spectacular loot.However, DS3 still provided some semblance of fun, and I didn't feel cheated because I paid eight bucks to rent it.  I think the game's worth maybe twenty bucks retail.  Dungeon Hunter: Alliance also is a Diablo clone, with less impressive graphics and an even lamer story than DS3--but I knew what I was paying for when I spent the fifteen bucks to play a port of an I-Pad game.  No way in heck is DS3 worth sixty dollars.Despite the above-mentioned issues, if you enjoyed games like Dragon Age 1 and Diablo, you should check out DS3.  Just don't pay full price.  This will occupy 15-20 hours of your time.  I doubt you'll want to replay the game as another character unless you're a glutton for punishment, or really bored.

Even if you think you are \"lag free\", play a round with bots and you'll notice how incredibly smooth the game is unless it is on-line.The graphics are...  out dated.  The style and detail are great, but the engine seems to be almost a throw back.  The visual customizations for your character and weapons are great -- except when you are actually playing you don't even notice it because it is mostly \"not there\".The technical aspects of the game -- classes, goals, abilities -- are mediocre at best.  There isn't really a lot of motivation to use any of the various abilities most of the time.  The classes seem bland and only relevant temporarily while you need to achieve the mission objective.  The variety in weapons is seemingly wide, but it is more like a list of weapons whose primary distinction is its irritating shortcoming.The maps are well done with a multitude of paths to traverse, secondary objectives can open up short cuts or block progress, and that might be the game's only real upside.The parkour thing is ehhh.  It is highly disorienting and inconsistent, and even though it is titled, \"SMART\", it isn't.  If you aren't straight enough on to something you won't parkour it...  and sometimes you'll parkour something at your side totally throwing you out of whack.Lastly, every mutliplayer game -- which this basically is -- has one gigantic potential weakness:  the actual players.  So far I've not run into many people who bother to try to work with their team at all.  That can make for very easy victories, or very painful and drawn out failures.  I found a little fun in the co-op campaign, but then the enemy bots are...  akin to card board pop ups at a gun range.  ...and no voice chat?  I know, I don't want to hear the idiots, either -- but we can't really coordinate in a meaningful \"team manner\" while playing this \"team oriented\" game.  A strange choice and just an example of one of many strange choices they made in this game.Time will tell if they can patch up the game and fix the incredibly poor quality online experience, performance/technical wise.  The game is just generally weird and not good.  After about five hours of on-line, solo challenge, and bot play I can safely say that this game is just not good.  I've heard the PC version plays better.I'll probably put a bit more time into this game just in case, for some reason, I'm actually missing the fun part, but I'm pretty sure this game is a flop.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000TI836G","description":"","reviewerName":"Corey Turner \"The Musician\"","summary":"Medal of Honor Steps Up to the Plate","reviewText":"Medal of Honor is a first person shooter set in a middle eastern valley. Attempting to reboot the acclaimed series, MoH has shifted away from World War II and has found the most recent shooter gaming niche: modern warfare and conflicts. Doing so is no easy task, behemoths Infinity Ward and Dice certainly know how to extinguish competing developers. Fortunately publisher EA has Dice in there catalog and has paired the creators of this MoH iteration, Danger Close, to make for a dynamic duo.During the summertime a beta was released for online gamers to partake and help locate bugs and performance issues. Doing so the mysterious vale was lifted and the gameplay has eased many anxious consumers, having been compared to Dice's previous work Bad Company 2, and something all its own. The Multiplayer should be looked at as the main dish of the game, as the campaign is meager in duration. That's not to say its bad in any way, perhaps even the campaign benefited from this.Medal of Honors campaign quickly sets you up into one main location serving as the topographical back bone for the rest of your play time. This helps create coordination between the stories believability and time frame. To help break away from the monotonous feeling of being confined to one central location,levels will often be livened up with particle effects, haze, snow, and time of day lighting changes. Still you may find yourself trudging through similar caves, sand blasted trails, and the occasional structural hide out. The beginning of said campaign is much more varied on location, where as the later half of the campaign is more aggressive in the tactical maneuvers you were taught a long the way. These include the quick ability to `laze' targets and set up air strikes, operate the guns of a helicopter, silently taking out foes and forceful use of night vision. You'll notice a pattern between the current soldier you are playing and their missions gameplay style.The game can be a bit quirky, a good example would be the ability to see straight down a partially lit corridor, walking into it the game immerses you in total darkness. You could clearly see deep into the hallway earlier, but suddenly it wishes you to turn on your night vision. This isn't too bad and certainly illustrates a cinematic flair, similar cases on the other hand can hamper your productivity. Occasionally you'll be asked to fall back or the game wont proceed with scripted segments. Or sometimes you wont have the option to sprint ahead, in fact you'll be forced to walk so you can let your teams leader guide or to over hear story unfolding dialogue. All of this could simply be looked at like it was in the title Gears of War `game plays good, so I don't mind'. The worst case scenario though for a gameplay burden is the wretched bugged segments where you may not be able to use artillery at all and will receive a quick mission failed, and are forced into replaying the section. This has happened to me a lot, and is resolved usually by retrying said area. Other things people might take notice to is the linearity due to invisible walls, pathways appear vast but only gift you the passage of a specific trail. Also on the side note the enemy AI can be a bit dull, standing behind cover with a limb freely exposed for their demise. Team mates may even stand by an enemy as though the enemy has equipped a cloak and you're the only one that can see through this.Aside from performance issues, the game can be really entertaining and upon completing campaign there is still much to do, that is if you have an internet connection and an online account set up. Modes like `Tier 1' let you run through the campaign on a brutal difficulty with a timer counting your every move down, practical head shots and eliminations manipulate the timer in your favor. Converting kills to points one can compare stats upon completion through leader boards.Multiplayer offers a more jittery fast paced experience than campaign, at the cost of some of the cool features (firing modes, night vision, acquiring ammunition from a team mate). If any of this can be obtained I can't validate this, well if it's too far into the mp experience, as I've had immense difficulty getting an online match to run. One may like knowing, respawning on a map can be a terrible task, expect to be shot consecutively when spawned. I've been pinned behind a team sniper who is generating to much notice and in return get blown up within moments of respawning. When the server cooperates the game shines, fast loads between matches, leveling up individual classes based upon usage and style. If you are into sniping or charging the enemy there is a class for you. Though classes are condensed compared to Bad Company 2's roster, they are suitable for the smaller multiplayer objectives, and team death match variants. Gunplay is balanced in the sense no weapon feels too out of place. Snipers are fitted for closer range then BC2's open maps, but are instantly capable in the given hands of a good scout at range. Other titles have balancing issues with explosives, Medal of Honor underplays equipped explosives (grenades, launchers etc) by dampening splash damage and effectiveness of `spamming'.Medal of Honor may not be the definitive modernized war fitted game, but it certainly shows promise. It makes for a great rental, or a great buy if you wish to sink a lot of time in leveling up an online class. That is if you can keep up with the frantic bullet chatter, and quick take downs. It's not a style I feel everyone's going to digest. It's not as 'action packed' or as accessible as Call of Duty, but its an engrossing shooter none the less. When the comparisons are dropped down the road, MoH may be recognized as to having one of the more realistic campaigns of its time.Quick Edit: For those who may have perceived the above paragraph regaurding tier one as an online only mode, no worries it's available to offline gamers as well. I was simply suggesting the online leader boards for said mode add to the value.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2010"}

ACII Brotherhood is probably the most amazing example of this, as, had I reviewed it a day before yesterday, I would have been raving about the most amazing game of the year and showering it with praise.Sadly it's not that and there's specific reasons for this which I will get to.Before I do though, I guarantee that my review will get lots of '0 out 100 people find this useful' type votes from folks who simply disagree with my thoughts, or have yet to experience the last two sequences. And well I'm prepared to take it as I feel this game could and should have a been a five star game across the board but it isn't and I think information is key so let me get to it...I reviewed both AC1 and AC2 sometime back and loved them both; AC1 for what a new franchise that brought a lot to the table and AC2 for taking the budding seeds of the first and building a majestic tree out of it. With Brotherhood things start off so well with Ezio continuing where AC2 left off in Rome and yet the game manages to cram a whole bunch of new stuff to find and do. And boy is there a lot of terrain to explore and things to collect - an area many times bigger than the biggest of AC2. Plus, since you can now purchase and upgrade buildings you're literally changing the face of your environment. This is especially true when you begin to repair the aqueducts which in turn will allow you to get to areas that are physically unreachable even though they're in your current 'memory sequence'. There's more though - you have a horse at your disposal which you can call at anytime and, most impressively, you have a crew of trainable assassins ready to aid you in your quests. The upgrade system for both yourself and your cohorts works beautifully; when they're out on missions they're unavailable but when they return they're stronger and more powerful thanks to distribution points you can spend on them. Not only that you can select them to go any missions which will specifically reward you with items which can be traded for treasure maps and so on. But there's even more, shops can but upgraded and fast travel points can be opened, and you can even buy landmarks all of which will increase your income allowing for even heftier purchases. It's all so smooth and simple yet so addictive. If you loved all the stuff you could do in AC2 then you'll be in heaven with AC2:BH.So, I was gutted when I reached sequence 8.I'm not going to spoil the plot for you but I will spoil the game. Once you reach Sequence 8 all logic is thrown out of the window. Everything you have done up to this point was... pointless. For the most part, your only weapon is a silly sci-fi piece of nonsense totally out of keeping with what has happened up to that point and it actually takes away your health to use it. This makes it kind of tricky to do the missions where you can't lose health, by the way. Oh and your health now magically recharges even though it hasn't before in Brotherhood. It gets worse, much worse. Your Assassins, which you may have spent hours getting to Level 10 cannot help you at all for no apparent reason, you cannot use ANY of your weapons or your health vials, your poison, your skills or indeed be able to free roam.I'm not kidding.And then the killer - Sequence 8's missions dictatorially flow from one to the next. There's no option not to take the next mission, just hit (A) to accept. And it goes on and on and on. When playing these sequences I desperately wanted to just be thrown back into Rome so I could complete some of the earlier quests but you don't get that option until you complete the game in what is now a linear frustrating pile of junk. Gone are the wonders of Rome and its amazing free expansive experience, only to be replaced with silly cutscenes and very limited time missions which were very unpleasant to play. It feels rushed, like the devs had run out of time and that's exactly what happened. But you continue to the end just so you can go back and do the missions and collect the items that you missed. But what's the point of doing that when you know it ultimately boils down to the last two god-awful sequences?To add salt into the wound, since you can no longer leave the animus once the game is complete you will miss a vital collection quest in the current time which is not returnable to. So unless you do that optional quest before entering the final phase of the game, you actually would have to start a new game just to get 100% completion and reap the achievement.So with AC2:BH you need to think of it much like the tastiest pie you've eaten, but unfortunately about 80% into it you suddenly realise it was full of bugs and was rushed to bake in a dirty oven. When that happens you don't remember how good the pie was up until then... you think 'urgh that pie was awful and I wouldn't eat it again'.I don't give out 1 stars lightly, especially on a deservedly lauded franchise like AC. Clearly massive amounts of time was spent making the world of AC2:BH amazing to romp around in and enjoy.But I cannot forgive the ending sequences and I doubt you will be able to either.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2010"}

I will run through each of the problems in a list format.-Small Online CommunityThe only game I purchased with my Wii U is COD Black Ops 2. It's fairly easy to find a game of Team Deatmatch or Free For All but the rest of the game modes are severely lacking in total number of players. In fact a few modes usually don't have enough players to even get a game started. The Zombies mode also seems to be suffering from a lack of players. This may change as the console says more units, but currently it's very discouraging.-Poor Battery Life in GamepadThe Gamepad needs to be left on the charge anytime it's not in use. It only lasts a couple of hours before the red battery warning light appears. This will be annoying for hardcore gamers or people with cluttered rooms and a lack of available outlets to have one dedicated to the Wii U gamepad 24/7. Nyko has a battery coming out soon that will double the battery life but the additional cost and legwork is not what you want to be faced with after dishing out $300 for a console.-No 'regular' controller, lack of options with controllersThe console does not come with a typical controller. You can buy the Pro controller separately but it's expensive and lacking in features. It doesn't have a headset input and also doesn't have analog triggers. This means that you'll have to use the Wii U gamepad tablet just to have the in-game chat features. I've already mentioned the poor battery life of the gamepad tablet, so you should see how this can be extremely inconvenient. You'll end up with the tablet charging and having an auxiliary cable running to your headset. Cables make for frustration and discomfort. Even if you buy a pro controller, it won't work with some games (NSMBU) and it also can't be used to adjust Wii U settings or browse the eSHOP. I assume it also won't work in various video streaming apps (Amazon, Netflix, etc.). Also, in regards to controllers, keep in mind that only one Wii U gamepad tablet can be used with the machine. It doesn't have support for using two. Lack of options for the gamer is disappointing.-No DVD or Blu-ray support or media support in generalYou can't use the Wii U to watch DVD or Blu-ray movies. I'm sure most potential buyers probably already have a DVD player and some may even have a Blu-ray player. Still, clutter is annoying and having an entertainment system that can do mostly everything is ideal. The Playstation 3 plays Blu-rays and DVDs and the 360 plays DVDs. There also isn't anywhere on the Wii U menu to go stream videos from a server. The Playstation 3 and 360 both have features for streaming various encodes of music and movies. The Wii U has no such feature.-No ethernet portWireless for many is unreliable and introduces extra lag. Gamers and consumers in general like to have options. The Wii U does not have an ethernet port and only allows for wireless connections out of the box. You can buy a USB ethernet adapter for wired connections, but again, just like with the pro controller, after spending $300, you feel ripped off when you are left to go buy the rest of the console that Nintendo didn't include.-Poor software, no achievementsIn comparison to the PS3 and 360, the OS on the Wii U is third rate. On PS3 and 360 it's easy to pull up menus during the game and access many things outside the game like messages and game invites. I've yet to see these options on Wii U. The menu only let's you close software and open up other apps which will quit your game. Multitasking is nonexistant. Another disappointment is the lack of achievements. The PS3 and 360 offer achievements with games that are of course optional. The Wii U doesn't even offer the option. This shows a lack of sensibility from Nintendo. When the Wii brought motion gaming to consoles, Sony and Microsoft came up with solutions for their consumers. Achievements have been around for years now and neither the Wii, 3DS or Wii U offer them. Even IOS and Android have achievement systems for their games. Nintendo seems out of touch with gamers.-Poor eSHOP content, lack of appsThere's not much to see on the eSHOP. Only a few pages of retail games and some download exclusives. I realize it's a new console but I expect more. Why is there no longer the Wii News and Wii Weather apps? Sure there is a web browser, but I found the specialized apps to be highly convenient. I'd also recommend free drawing apps to take advantage of the gamepad tablet. For $300 you want to be able to do something with the device your buying. If you buy an Ipod Touch you immediately have access to hundreds of free apps. If you buy a 3DS or Wii U you have access to hardly anything. Perhaps it'd be useless to some users, but the Wii U gamepad tablet has a camera, so why aren't there any QR code readers available? I see a failure to take advantage of the hardware from Nintendo's part.-Third party supportFar Cry 3 will not be coming out for Wii U, developers say it's because the game was being produced prior to the console being available to them. Going forward I hope the Wii U has better third party support than the Wii did, but there are no guarantees available. Even Activision has been mum about whether or not the map packs will be made available for Wii U users (already Nuketown 2025 isn't available).---The console isn't all bad. Playing an FPS on the gamepad tablet may seem impossible or awkward, but it really feels great and is enjoyable. The Youtube app has a great design and makes browsing YT from the couch convenient and comfortable. The TVii feature doesn't really apply to me since I only have basic cable, but I imagine those with DirecTV or Dish Network will love being able to browse what's on without pulling up a menu on the TV and also being able to control their box and TV with one device. In addition games look great on the gamepad tablet and can be played across the house. I've always hated split-screen gaming as I lack the discipline to concentrate on just my part of the screen. With the Wii U you can each have your own screen and the smaller screen isn't nearly as bad when held in front of you.Consider the cost and the future of console gaming and decide what's best for you.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2013"}

Dancing with the daughters is very important and you will need to do it a lot, but it is also the one aspect of the game that I don't like as it does get somewhat repetitive.There are several basic ways to get wealth, but preying on ships of whatever country is at war with yours is one of the fastest.

And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Caleb Williams","summary":"Intense","reviewText":"Burnout Paradise in my book is easily one of the top 5 PS3 games so far, it's fast, it's intense and it looks darn pretty. Unlike previous Burnout games this takes place in a free roam environment known as Paradise City. You're a racer of no particular name or gender, you have no particular purpose other than to win the numerous car races going on around Paradise City. The side missions are simple and in a way kind of boring or pointless, they are either smash through gates, jump over stuff or smash billboards.The lack of any sort of storyline and the existence of repetition, I guess brings up the question \"So why 5 stars?\" Well that's simple, with all that aside this game is still awesome on a magnificent scale. The variation of cars the different race types and the fact that you can initiate showtime mode (Crash mode of the new generation) anywhere and any time. The game looks perfect and crashing one of these cars is both dramatic and in another sense pretty.Road Rage is my personal favourite mode as those familiar with the old games will know what this mode is about. The concept is generally the same, make your fellow racers crash in a blaze of twisted metal to gain the win. This mode is the most fun simply because of the intensity and speed of it all, it's a mode and a game that tests your reflexes as you really have to be quick to survive.They also now have a mode similar called Marked man, it's simply a game of getting from A to B without being taken down by 2 other cars whos simple goal is to take you down. This is relatively fun but when in a strong enough car it's pretty damned easy.Over the past few weeks Burnout has gotten a number of new updates including Bikes and Trophies. These give the game a whole new dimension and with the news that a new Island is just around the corner the game only seeks to get better and better.An awesome game that even with its flaws is still massively entertaining.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2008"}

To be honest, I'm more impressed then I would've figured, and pleasantly surprised at many things including the voice acting and battle system.There are so many great features about this game it's hard to explain it all without wanting to go back and play it (game is paused right now). Some of the things that are every enjoyable are that when you pause the game, you go into your sanctuary (with the best butler ever, you will recognize his voice)in which you are able to do everything without needing a menu. You can change clothes, hairstyles, tattoos, weapons, check gifts, transactions, friends worlds, fast travel, stats, etc etc the list goes on and on. The fact that you \"level up\" using followers adds more to the realism, i.e, no menu or stat bars (you can check stats in your sanctuary, but no more pressing start and magically being able to see everything like most rpgs allow).Don't ask me why, but the way the world map is layed out and the way you can interact using it reminds me of Dark Cloud for some reason. I have no idea why!I love the fact that your weapons morph based on how you fight. There are so many different variations, i.e your sword dripping blood if you're evil enough (possibly slaughtering innocents?).The way co-op works in this game is downright AMAZING. I'm not even going to get into that because I can go on forever, but the most hilarious thing is that you can, in addition to seeing your friends orbs around your world if they're online and in the same map as you,that you can actually hear them on the mic without being in their world! I don't remember this feature in Fable 2. One of my friends was playing Lute Hero (Fable version of Guitar Hero) and I heard him cursing and talking about gold/breaking the guitar (when I was near his orb), and I don't think he knew I could hear him because we weren't in co-op together!I find this game to be way better than Fable 2, which I also enjoyed, and recommend it to all. I feel like I'll be playing this and making multiple characters for a long time to come. I have no idea how I'm going to actually collect all 50 legendary weapons, though (some only obtainable in friends worlds)..Between this and Fallout: NV, I'm in RPG heaven!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2010"}

The mp, plays like cod for the most part, maybe with a bit more features taken from bf3. (I don't like either, so this is a con for me)-Level destruction with the Frostbite engine could've been Alot better.-Small glitches of sorts, guns floating, enemies floating and going through walls, etc.-Over balanced enemy flashlights (too bright)-Non-skippable cutscenes, minor annoyance, but there should be an option to do so in every game now.-Not too much of a biggie, but if you give headshots importance by showing an indicator, why not give us an achievement for it? Or at least one for getting red indicators.-Again, a minor problem, I know I put the new door breach mechanic in the Pros, but at the same time, it only takes 5 headshots to unlock the next one, so I unlocked all the door breaches a few levels before the end while getting pretty much all headshots in every door breach, they could've taken a cue from mmo's where in order to \"level up\", you need get more kills than the previous level. To even further this, once you've unlocked all of them you could get progression in something new, so it adds a bit more re-playability.I actually had rented this game, I just wanted to post a review of it here so other people can read this review. So if I did actually purchase this game, I'd be REALLY angry, because in order to play the mp you have to sign up for origin, and I won't attach my gamertag to that malware service and especially ea and never be able to get it off. Big mental satisfaction points deducted cause of this.Overall, I'd say rent this game, fun enjoyable play for a weekend, driving levels offer re-playability simply because you want to play it again, but this game isn't nearly good enough for a buy, especially if you don't like ea/origin so you don't want to sign up for it to play the mp.mw = modern warfaremp = multiplayer","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0053BCMAC","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"It hurts me to say this...","reviewText":"Please put down your pitchforks, my friends, and give me a chance to explain. I am no Nintendo hater. Quite the contrary in fact, and when it comes to the Paper Mario series, I have always been a massive fan, whether it's theoriginal, classic Paper Mario,its utterly amazing sequel, The Thousand-Year Door, or the more platformer-centricSuper Paper Mario, I love me some Paper Mario games. I can't tell you how excited I was when Sticker Star was announced. I bought my 3DS way back when highly anticipating this game, and even though it went through several delays, I waited patiently. All through development, this was promised to be an entry that would take Paper Mario back to its RPG roots, in every sense, and I couldn't have been more psyched. The first two or three hours in, I really enjoyed my time with Sticker Star. It was a blast and the undeniable Paper Mario charm was off the charts. Then, I started to notice some glaring issues, and they became more glaring with each passing moment until I realized something painful, I don't really like this game all that much. Please, put down your torches and pitchforks and let me explain (and I want to be fair to the game and to you, the readers, so this may be a long, detailed review, I'm warning you right now)...First off, there's a reason why I was hooked for the first two or three hours. There are a lot of positives in this game's favor. Here are the biggest ones:- The Presentation. The visuals are spectacular, possibly the best the series has ever had, in fact. The whole \"children's pop-up book\" aesthetic of the Paper Mario series has always been one of its biggest strengths. Not only is it cute, but it somehow pulls off being simultaneously nostalgic and fresh to the extreme, and it's done really well here. Many familiar locales from Mario's history, most notably from thethe New Super Mario Bros series, get their chance to shine, and shine they do. The nostalgia and familiarity is really endearing and some new twists on familiar oldies, like a Mariachi Shy Guy band, or a Yoshi sphinx, are fantastic. There's also something awesome about 2-D, flat paper characters and settings rendered in true 3-D on the 3DS. It's like playing a child's school project diorama come to life. Great job here! And then there's the soundtrack. Oh the soundtrack! The music in this game really blew me away, and on occasion merits putting down the system just to soak it in for a while. Much of it feels like they told a Jazz band to just go nuts with familiar Mario motifs and themes, and it's awesome. Plenty of sax and trumpet to go around. Sweet stuff. Don't even get me started on how sweet the Mariachi Shy Guy band music is.- Stickers, stickers, stickers. Everything revolves around stickers. Yes, everything. The battle system is entirely sticker based, and oftentimes you need certain stickers to solve puzzles in the various levels you visit. Maybe you need to put a mere normal sticker in the environment to open a door. Or maybe you need a special \"thing\" sticker that comes to life and affects the environment in big and surprising ways. There's lots of clever puzzles throughout the whole game. I found the whole \"sticker\" theme to be a refreshing twist on the classical Paper Mario formula, or at least I found the concept to be great anyway.- The Battle System (more on this in the bad section later). In an attempt to return to Paper Mario's RPG roots, Intelligent systems made the battle system a turn-based affair once again. To fight a sense of \"been here, done that,\" they decided to make the battle system revolve around stickers. This means two things. 1.) The entire battle system is, for all intents and purposes, entirely item based (or sticker inventory based, if you will), and 2.) There's a system of strategy that involves proper button inputs to increase the effectiveness of whichever sticker command you choose. This gives the battles a great sense of risk vs. reward as you wonder, \"Can I use this less powerful 'worn-out hammer' perfectly and finish the battle that way? Or should I pull out my more powerful 'flashy hammer' sticker and guarantee a victory?\" This is really cool.This all sounds awesome, doesn't it? Well, yes, that's because it is. It's a unique twist that at least starts to bring the series back to its RPG roots. There are a few HUGE problems, however, that really pull the rest of the game down. I'll try to explain them now:- The story. There is no story, really. Yeah, at the beginning, Bowser grabs a giant, mythical royal sticker he's not supposed to, and because of that sticker's power, he himself becomes a super powerful, shiny sticker. He gives each fragment of the original royal sticker to five of his henchmen across the land, and it's up to Mario to go to each area, traverse their levels, and get each crown sticker back. After this introduction to the story, there's nothing more. No more plot, no more interesting characters, no real developments. It's bizarre, because the game actually feels like a traditional Mario platformer in terms of its story, in that, there is virtually none. Even the way you get from level to level is like a Mario platformer: an overworld map in a \"level 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, etc.\" sort of way. Again, it's more akin toNew Super Mario Bros. Each level itself is styled in the way the original Paper Mario was, but there's no big world to explore, no big, interesting towns to visit, no companions to meet and take along with you, nothing. There's only one companion, a floating crown sticker named Kersti who is basically Mario's very ownNavi, but not nearly as charming or likable. Even Super Paper Mario, which was basically a platformer at heart, had way more plot and characters than this. What happened? There's no incentive to keep going, as far as plot is concerned. Again, in a Mario platformer, that's not a problem, but this isn't a platformer! It's *supposed* to be more of an RPG, and in an RPG, plot is kinda important.- The Battle System. Now wait a minute, didn't I say this was a positive? Well, yeah, the battle system itself is fantastic, except for one MASSIVE problem: It's all meaningless! After playing for an hour or two, I noticed something; there's no place in the menu to see Mario's stats, or his level, or his equipment... there's only sticker inventory. Wait, does that mean there's NO experience points (or Star Points, to be accurate) or leveling up in this game? Yep, there are *zero* tangible benefits to battles. The ONLY reward for winning battles are coins and stickers. Stickers are *everywhere* in the world as you explore, so this battle reward is meaningless. Coins are also everywhere in the levels, and their only use is for buying more stickers, so again, meaningless. The battles that are otherwise brilliantly conceived are rendered a waste of your time by no meaningful, tangible rewards for your efforts. There's no sense of progression in Mario's character, whatsoever. It makes more sense to just avoid enemies on the map altogether (who always respawn when you go back to already conquered areas, by the way, and since backtracking is a big part of this game at times, this is troublesome and annoying). Coming from Thousand-Year Door, where I actually sought out battles as much as I could due to their one-two punch of awesome design and satisfaction from winning, this is a *massive* gaffe. I mean, it's unforgivable really. Imagine truly great RPGs, ones likeFinal Fantasy IV(or VI, VII, and IX, take your pick, they're all amazing),Chrono Trigger,Earthbound,Radiant Historia, Super Mario RPG, the Mario and Luigi rpg series, or the first two Paper Mario titles, and imagine them without experience points, new, better equipment to find/aquire, or a leveling system. Blasphemy! If this wasn't trying to be an RPG, it wouldn't be so bad, but everything else in the game hearkens back to the RPG Paper Mario titles. *Sigh*- Perhaps the WORST thing about the game is its lost potential. When Intelligent Systems started work on this game, they wanted to make it a true sequel to 1,000-Year Door. They had a big, epic plot planned out. There was going to be a charming overworld filled with exciting places to explore and characters to meet. There would be several unique, lovable companions to join you on your quest. The theater turn-based battles with audiences would come back. All throughout the process, however, Shigeru Miyamoto rejected all of these ideas until this game became the finished product. I love you Miyamoto-San, but what the H-E-doublehockeysticks were you thinking!? If Intelligent Systems' original vision for this game had been allowed to come to fruition, I have no doubt whatsoever that this would have been a 5-star masterpiece. Look at their track record for a moment: all Paper Mario games up until this one, the Fire Emblem series, the Advance Wars series, the WarioWare series, Pushmo, Crashmo, and the list goes on. These guys are masters of their craft, and this would have been another masterpiece to add to that list, if only Uncle Shiggy hadn't gotten in the way (I love the guy, he's a true inspiration to gamers everywhere, but this is a blemish on his otherwise astronomically great record). What would have been a masterpiece has been turned into a game that is merely \"OK,\" and that is the most painful thing of all about this game: The lost potential.I am not an overly critical person. I think this is my second or third 2-star review in total. I'd much rather review games I love or at least really like, not ones I think are just \"meh\" or \"OK.\" I *really* wanted to love this game, but given the massive loss of potential, and the real botching of some of the most crucial aspects of the game that would have justified the change in direction, I just can't. I really tried with this game, but in the end, I just couldn't shake the growing feeling of disappointment and boredom anymore. Super Paper Mario really changed up the traditional formula, sure, but it was still a wonderfully executed game that was great on its own. Sticker Star could have been a nice spin-off Paper Mario title like that one was if there was even a slightly better plot to break the monotony, a battle system that actually feels rewarding, and a sense of satisfaction and progress for Mario's character throughout the game, but it just isn't there. Maybe others will find more enjoyment in this game. The game has some real strength in its presentation and many of the core concepts are sound, but it just isn't for me. I'm sorry Intelligent Systems, I'm sorry fellow Paper Mario fans, and most painfully, I'm sorry Paper Mario, but I just don't like Paper Mario: Sticker Star. Thanks for reading my review and hearing me out. You can go ahead and get out your pitchforks now.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2013"}

FFXIII has to have one of the worst stories of any game I&#8217;ve played let alone one that is meant to be a major blockbuster. It is overly confusing and convoluted that no one I talked to has any idea what is going on. Some have even tried writing down plot points into a note pad and are still baffled as to the storyline.Naturally, a bad story leads to awful characters. This is partly true. A few characters are memorable: Lightning and Fang, a few that just occupy space: Vanille and Sazh, and a few that are completely irritating: Snow and Hope. This volatility is a theme of how this game&#8217;s production is. With a series that has brought us Sephiroth and Auron, the characters are generally forgettable.I know Final Fantasy games can be cutscene heavy, but it almost felt as if you were playing between cutscenes at many times. One of the biggest complaints is its linearity. I personally didn&#8217;t find this to be a problem. It does open up slightly in the later parts of the game.One of XIII&#8217;s strengths is that it just feels fluid and polished. The smooth graphics, the quick and stylish UI, and has hands-down the best battling system. For me, this game&#8217;s saving grace was its battling system. Battles never felt like a chore and kept me interested in the game despite an awful story.As a Final Fantasy game, it is a letdown. If viewing in isolation, it is a decent RPG. Despite its many shortcomings, it only took me like a week to get through the 60+ hours of gameplay, a marathon only a few games have warranted.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00D7NQP9M","reviewerName":"Matthew Anderson \"Robbin505\"","summary":"Great Multiplayer Game","reviewText":"Blizzard is well known for making good games and Diablo III is another quality game.  First off,  buy this game used. The only thing that comes in the box is the disc and a one page manual so any extra money spent on a new copy is only for plastic wrap and that annoying sticker that makes the game really hard to get in to. The mechanics of Diablo are solid. The controls are easy to learn and customizable to your liking. The game pad makes combat really fun and easy by making the left stick move and the right stick dodge with left trigger to lock on. The buttons are all basically for attacks and spells/skills so there really isn't a lot to learn beyond remembering which button is equipped with which attack or skill.  The story is good and has that Blizzard humor throughout. The graphics are high quality considering it is a console game with limited rendering power. With the new expansion out and coming soon to consoles this is a great time to pick this game up. The expansion ushered in a lot of changes on the PC which fixed a lot of the known problems and has brought back many who gave up and also inspired new explorers to join in the fray. The changes should be reflected in the console versions especially the Xbox One and PS4 versions which will have the expansion included. Diablo III has a lot going for it with multiple characters each with many different styles, appearances, and attacks which gives players the ability to replay the game and have different experiences with each play through. The co-op aspect is another of this game's awesome features. Get together with friends at home or far away and play a four player game in which working together is rewarded. Too many games are about player versus player so a game that is about working together is nice to see, at least on consoles. The leveling, skills, and gear are acquired through grinding so it can be very unappealing to some players but the old school RPG dungeon crawling fans will love it. The game is a top down third person isometric style game which is also very familiar to old school RPG fans but may be unappealing to some players. Diablo III really is about friends, gear and story so prepare for some good times and lots of loot.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2014"}

Fernandez \"lorenzferus\"","summary":"Go home and stay home Fatal Frame.  BORING!!!","reviewText":"Fatal Frame 2 does nothing to innovate the genre at all. It's an exact wannabe clone of Resident Evil and Silent Hill. Explore a maze of rooms with some helpless and awkward to control characters all while solving some puzzles and reading some notes. Been there done that. The problem with Fatal Frame is that it's horror concept just isn't as cool as Resident Evil or Silent Hill, those two games each have their unique style, and little japanese girls taking pictures of spirits, ancient japanese rituals, and boring villages simply aren't as interesting. Sure Fatal Frame 2 is a pretty scary game, but making a scary game isn't hard, making a good game is.Not only is Fatal Frame 2 a clone of better games, it's also a nearly exact clone of the original Fatal Frame, and since Fatal Frame seems to only exist to try to claim the title of scariest game, it might be worth mentioning that this one isn't as scary as the original. Everything is the same, and anything different isn't even worth mentioning because the game is still BORING.To be fair Fatal Frame is much easier game than the original, which I think is good thing and the graphics are technically impressive with lighting and shadows that aren't seen other than in Resident Evil games for Nintendo GameCube.  The controls and everything are just a bit smoother and more polished than the original. Technically a well made game, but the CONCEPT is just not there. Make a horror game about something cool, no one wants a horror that takes place in Japan or old Japan.  People don't watch those old japanese movies where the lips don't match the words do they? Use your head Tecmo. This should be the last Fatal Frame installment, please go home Fatal Frame. BORING!!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2004"}

I completed it in three or four days.  It is cute, hilarious, fun, and intriguing.  I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to play video games.  I most enjoyed the little touches that make the game so good.  For example, Hiro the Hero can use his hat as a boat while in the water.  He can also fish for sushi fish while riding in his hat.  The game is challenging but not too difficult.  There is a minimum of reflex button press sequences, and they are all well timed, so as to not be too difficult.Most of the game is completely free roam, and there are lots of secrets to discover.  The game play is broad with different fighting styles, magic, and strategy.The concept of saving your ninja friends while traveling and discovering troubles through out he land is simple and compelling.My wife who is of Japanese ancestry was slightly annoyed at the engrish style voice acting at times.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2009"}

The game starts out in the usual story mode Star Wars manner telling the tale of Jedi's etc. I won't go in deep but its really nothing new or that you haven't heard before. The gameplay is great, i really like using the Jedi Mind trick and making Storm Troopers, Droids etc jump off ledges or turn against there own, very cool. The graphics are great and the characters look like real humans, this is a feature that should be used in a lot of games but isn't, even today most still look very computerized. The surroundings leave something to be desired except for certain areas. Outside environments look pretty stellar(especially in rain) while inside bases look pretty bland. Controls are crisp and very responsive, and all your different powers work very well. Also many of the cut scenes when you have to perform certain functions are very good, flying, dropping, killing bosses, doesnt really seem repetitious. The game itself however is very easy and very short, so would i recommend a purchase? No, better pass on that or wait for a price drop, its a good game but don't expect an Uncharted Drakes Fortune type adventure. Its nothing more than a good sequel to a good franchise, but what more do you want? Its star wars, there is only so much you can do with it. I'm going to try it on PC just to see what \"else\" i can do with the graphics, it may be even better. Fans get it, new comers, wait.Note-Shame on Gamespot for giving this a 6.0, a 7.5 is more in order. How many good games where u shoot over and over get stellar markings?

The Shenmue series are among my favourite games of all time, I finished Shenmue II and immediately wanted to play the next episode in the saga.  Sadly it seems at the moment this isn't going to happen, which is a crying shame, but I can only hope Sega change their mind.As for my review of Shenmue II, it like it's predecessor is a classic, in fact I think they even outdid the original with this.  It is a much bigger game, taking place over 3 large areas, including Kowloon in Hong Kong.  The scope of the game is massive, there is so much to see and do, and in Kowloon there are 40ft scyscrapers to explore amongst other things.  The only drawback from the original is that the online features are gone, in other words you can no longer set high scores for the mini games and put them on the world ranknings.  This is only a minor compaint however, the fighting is as slick as the previous Shenmue game, with numerous moves (taken from the virtua fighter engine) to master.  There are now more arcade games, with classics like Outrun added, and more slot machines and even more toys to collect.  If you wanted to you could waste days on this game, there is just so much to see and do.As with Shenmue I, it's a classic, I only hope Sega get it together and Ryu Hazuki's adventure ends properly.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2005"}

{"product_name":"B007TYC8MI","description":"","reviewerName":"Graham Swearingen \"Graham1138\"","summary":"God Of War Ascension: More of a good thing","reviewText":"Greek mythos on every level is few and far between this day and age. Understandably so, as it is 5,000 years old. That being said, like a sponge I will soak up any and all Greek mythology related anything I can get my hands on. As a fan of God Of War since day one, there are a few things I have come to expect as a fan of the series:1.  Clean, tight, responsive controls when it comes to fighting, platforming on the other hand, I expect to fall to my death a lot.2.  Nudity, lots of hot, topless ladies. Hell, you even get to sex some of them up for power and experience orbs.3.  Puzzles, lots of tedious, fun and smart puzzles to solve.4.  Gore, gore galore. Ripping Minotaur's heads off, pulling out a Cyclops eye, beating skeleton soldiers to powdered bone dust.5.  Mythology, albeit loosely based or even somewhat molested or simplified, the characters are based on Greek mythology and some of what they do is fairly accurate.So, does this game deliver on all these expectations? F#@& yes it does. I don't play God Of War for the story. Some angry Spartan who lost his family and kills in a fit of blood thirsty rage is not very original or compelling of a story. Nor are Kratos' origin stories. I just want to control this beast and wield his Blades of Chaos down on some sorry Harpies and Elephantaurs stupid enough to get in my way.So there are some differences from this game to the last 3 (I am not including the PSP games as I did not play these, I didn't get suckered into buying a PSP so I haven't played these even though they are available now for the PS3. I did however, get suckered into buying a PS Vita, yea) games. You can pick up certain weapons from fallen foes, a new enchantment for you Blades of Chaos called \"Life Cycle\" which allows you to freeze enemies and slow down time which is imperative when solving certain puzzles. Rage mode is still available, even though I find myself rarely using this in any of the games. Experience orbs are collected so you can level up your powers and weapons. And there are still gorgon eyes and phoenix feathers to collect.I can't speak on the multiplayer aspect of this game (as I haven't had a chance to try it out yet), which is a brand new feature. I have heard some boring and negative reviews on this. If it's just fighting and ripping people apart with combos, how could it not be fun?This game uses the same game engine as God Of War III, so the graphics are only slightly improved. I think the best part about the graphics are just the size of scope and scale in the traditional grandiose God Of War style. The world seems as big as ever, if not bigger (especially the snake level, you'll know what I'm talking about when you get there). Does the game feel different since Stig Asmussen is off doing other things? Not really, no. Is the game shorter than previous games, not sure, I haven't beat it yet. Unfortunately I couldn't stay up all night and play it all day, gotta go to work and make money. Even if it is shorter, it's not that big a deal. In the end this game is just more of the same thing and I agree with other people that maybe they should retire Kratos and work a new character into this world. Maybe that's something they'll do with the PS4. If you are a fan of any of the God Of War games, you'll want this. Maybe you don't need to run out and pay $60 for it first day, but you def need to own it. It's everything you've come to expect from a GoW game, at least it is for me. It's fun, challenging, has an awesome score by Tyler Bates (Slither, Watchmen, 300, Conan the Barbarian), hard hitting action and gore, big set pieces (giant and epic really), great boss battles and good cut scenes. This game is a must own for sure.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2013"}

It's a spin off and also the end of the Tokyo location and game engine..Hence the title \"of the end\". Part 5 is being developed as we speak with tons of work to be done considering they are making a whole new engine. Now I won't go into heavy detail as I did with my Yakuza 4 review, but give my pros and cons.Pros:Storyline- Can never say more than enough for a STELLAR storyline.. you will not find better from any series including cutscenes.Characters- The loan Shark,Dragon of Kansai and Majima join Kazuma into gunning hordes of zombies popping heads like it's going out of style. Can't ask for a better team.Graphics- Same as 4,same engine..Love it or hate it, it works.Mini games- Are all here..Whether you like to bowl, play slots,arcades,cards,mahjong,hostess bars,batting cages,karaoke,massage parlors tell me when to stop..And many many side missions for each character(One example is saving store fronts and reopening businesses).When complete you can have the option to travel around a normal town or apocalyptic town with zombies.Cons:Sadly the controls are a little problematic at first,but as you play you will be popping heads with a hostess in no time.Some Framerate issues at times.Overall it's a great end to this engine and the Tokyo location. I hope when 5 is complete they bring it to the West. Sadly other reviewers will sway hordes of people from even touching the series.

First of all the graphics are mind blowing, besides METAL GEAR 4, I think the graphics are great, the game si ok, very entertaining but repetitive at some times, you get to do missions on the citys to locate you targets, but the missions are always the same in every city or location, but one you get your target it gets very fun to play, especially if you want to do the stealth kills wich I only did two of them. The story is excellent although youy get to imagine the end of the game, with just one exception.So in resume the game is great if you like games like SPLINTER CELL and MG4, but with a sword.Hope this helps.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2008"}

(This was my favorite part of the game) The ones that i enjoyed the most were: Lucy in the sky with diamonds,Dear Prudence,Something,Helter Skelter,Here comes the sun and While my guitar gently weeps.Cons: The game is just too damn short,I feel that this is something that someone could finish in a day or two if they played it enough,There are only 45 songs and many of them are very short,I was disappointed that certain songs were not in the game such as-Penny Lane,Eleanor Rigby and Strawberry Fields forever to name a few,The menu system in this game is kind of annoying as well i would have preferred for the next song to come on after the previous one instead of constantly having to switch from song to menu,Overall i think this is a good game i however am glad that i did not pay full price for it when it first came out.I'n my opinion this game could have been alot better.I would recommend this game to a Beatles Fan,If however you do not consider yourself one then i would suggest that maybe you rent it for a weekend.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2010"}

WooHoo!!! Thanks to William for the headsup. That is one heavy car and doesn't handle as well as the vette, but at over 1150 horses, the car is FAST (140+ mph)....I am not changing my original comments, but this should correct my original statement. The game is very challenging and al ot of fun. The AI hasn't changed (I'm halfway through level 20), and the load time for the tracks have not increased and take too long to load. The only good thing about that is it gives you time to calm down a little, after you get beat, but when you win and want to move on, it stinks to have to wait. I'm still amazed by the graphics. The ability to modify the cars to each track is now becomming apparent and tweaking the transmission, differentials, etc., become more important as you get deeper in the game. This is a great value, as there are SO many different races, challenges, etc., that you will be playing this game for a long, LONG time. I highly recommend it, inspite of the track loading time.Update 12-15-2010:So far the AI does not seem to have improved at all. Damage is minimal, but I don't mind it that much....I just want to race. I can confirm Veyron became available to me when I got to level 19, for $2 million. I have a bunch of cars, and the biggest let down so far is the Enzo. Even built up it's not that fast or that great. I much prefer the Murcielago and even more, the Corvette! The R-8 is another let down. The Nissan GTR is great....I'm loving this game. Also, after all this time, the tracks still load VERY SLOWLY.....no change in loading time. That is the only pain. Still, my son and I love this game! I should mention that it's odd seeing the drivers on the \"wrong\" side....yup, these are right hand drive vehicles. Not a big deal either for me....just wanted to mention it.Update 12/3/2010:The loading time has not changed at all folks! It is really insane. If this game were not so good I would take it down to three stars because of the delay. It is almost unacceptable! With that said, ehem, I still play this a lot, which is a real credit to the game. While others (see comments below) have mentioned the Veyron, I have not seen it for sale. I have raced against it, but that is it. I do love the Nissan GT-R though, it's an awesome ride, especially with all of the modifications. It's also funny to see Porsche's under the guise of RUF's. Inspite of the track loading time, I still say buy it! :-)Oh my God! 40 minutes to start playing folks (if you load the 8+ gigs into your HD and update your system)!!! If you have an older system, be aware of the the memory requirements. I have never had a game (for any of my systems, 360, wii, or ps3) take this long to load...not even close....and it's  terrible because the excitment to start playing is intense, especially if you have been waiting for sooo long! The races load in about 45-55 seconds (depending). I would have thought with over 8 gigs in my HD it would have been faster. I take off half a star for the initial load and the track loads. Not all cars show damage for the purists out there. For me it's not really such a big deal. The graphics are AWESOME, and if you have surround sound with a good subwoofer you are going to LOVE the sound. Rear end someone at speed and you feel the thump! (This is also 3D compatible, and I think I know what I'm buying my self for Christmas!!!).One word of warning, this game can cause some major life problems, like being late for work, feeling sleepy and run down during the day, etc., because this is a VERY hard game to put down!!! LOL.The brakes are a little funny and pull the car too much too fast until you get used to it, especially in the cheaper cars. Nothing major, I just wanted to mention it so you are prepared. The overall physics is great and very realistic and the graphics are also great.The cars are nice, but I was disappointed to see no Porsche's. I was hoping to see Bugatti's, but not expecting it, so that was not as disappointing.In the garage you can tune your car. It would have been nice to see the benefits of each tuning option before going deeper, but it doesn't take that long, so it's not that much of a distraction, but worth mentioning. Using the Miata at first was very helpful, and after a few races you will be able to make some nice modifications. I'm sure there are other options, but that was the one I used.I love that you don't necessarily need licenses, but can also earn experience. It's nice to earn while you learn....The controller is fine for driving and I personally do not think you NEED a steering wheel set-up.....however, it is great to use one. One thing though, you will find yourself gripping the wheel (or control) unusually hard. It's very easy to lose yourself in this game, and that is not something I would normally say about a racing game.I should note that I do not play my PS3 as much as my 360 and Wii, however, GT5 is going to save a lot of wear and tear on those other systems. The bonus of unlocking the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Stealth Model car was nice.Now for a quick AI review. It sucks...at first. Fine with me, as I am getting used to everything, and I expect to get frustrated. And you will, as it is almost like you are not even there with the way cars drive into you, etc.. The good news is it does get better....the bad news is, it's still not that great....but really, who cares. Everything else is so stunning that this is easily my favorite racing game! And that is saying A LOT!!! If you have a PS3 and like racing games this is a must have! If you don't have a PS3, this is no reason to buy one.....almost, but not quite.Again, I would like to note that as systems go, I play my 360 much more, mostly because I have more games for it. I do not have a favorite system, as I think they all have their own strengths and weaknesses. So, please understand that I tried very hard not to favor a system, but just tried to review the game for what it is.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2010"}

I am not a big fan of the first-person-shooter genre but I can appreciate a well made game and Killzone 3 is certainly worth playing through. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this game does not require a lengthy install which is very common among high profile PS3 games. Believe it or not, Killzone 3 only requires 5MB of your hard drive space and that is simply amazing given the game's gorgeous visuals.The controls are very much improved over the last game. I didn't feel that the controls of Killzone 2 were game breaking because everybody else was moving at pretty much the same speed. With that said, it was still occasionally frustrating to play through the last game and wait for your character to trudge to the next destination. Killzone 3 still manages to make you feel like a soldier loaded down with equipment but the actual controls are much smoother and I never felt like I was fighting my controller just to aim my weapon.As others have noted, Killzone 3 is a class based shooter. You can play as a number of different classes such as medics, tacticians, infiltrators and others. Each class has a function such as capturing spawn points or repairing fixtures. Some classes will do better in direct combat and other classes will need to find other ways to reach their goals. If you play well you will earn unlock points which you can trade for upgraded equipment and abilities.If you're looking for a well written story or strong character development- play something else. Killzone 3 is a game about shooting enemies and blowing stuff up. There is a story but it is not very impressive by modern standards and the characters are actually quite shallow.The big draw of shooter games is usually the online multiplayer function. I was pleased to find that I was not dropped from my matches and I only occasionally noticed any lag while playing. I am sure that these issues will crop up now and then as they do with all games but for a high profile title on launch day, Killzone 3 plays remarkably well online.My only real gripes with Killzone 3 are the lack of an online co-op mode and its very linear game play in single player mode. I really do feel like the game is holding my hand and leading me along but the battles are so amazingly fun that it doesn't kill the game for me. Killzone 3 plays in 720p and while elitists may turn their noses up at the lack of 1080p visuals, it doesn't bother me.I think that Killzone 3 is destined to be the premier shooter on the PS3 and shooting games for other systems will be compared to this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00BMFIXKQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Alexander Lucard","summary":"One of the Best Games of the Year","reviewText":"Due to the sheer amount of video games I play and review every year, the entire Assassin's Creed series slipped me by until now. In fact, the only reason I had a chance to play this is because of the review copy offered to me. Otherwise I'd have been playing one of the many titles in my ever increasing backlog.I was surprised how much I enjoyed Black Flag. I'm more of a RPG/Shoot 'Em Up (Think Gradius or Ikaruga, not Doom or CoD) and fighting game fan. Third person action games are rarely my thing. However, I had a lot of fun with Black Flag. The game is your fairly standard open world action title and a bit generic at first. Then when you get to commanding your own boat, everything changes. It's a bit AC, a bit Sid Meier's Pirates and a bit Port Royale. I had a blast recruiting crew members, fighting battles, upgrading everything and finding hidden treasure. I wasn't a big fan of Orca killing, but it's just a video game and it was more or less historically accurate.Edward Kenway is a very interesting protagonist and you just want to breeze through the modern day pieces to get to his parts of the game. I'd love to see more done with him, but we do seem to get a different hero per game, so as much as I liked Edward, this is probably his fifteen minutes of fame.The PS3/4 version of ACIV is the best way to go for the downloadable sixty minutes of additional gameplay you get for free. An extra hour isn't a lot (especially if you're used to games going 40+ hours long), but why get a version where you don't get additional content for free. It seems pretty cut and dry.Assassin's Creed IV is one of the best games of the year? Would I put it in my top ten of 2013?&#34; Probably not, but it was pretty fantastic. it's quite outside the usual genres I engage in and I still had a blast with it.

From that NES through the Wii, I have played video games on all the major Nintendo consoles and experienced the pros/cons of each of them.  All things considered, I have to say that the SNES is probably the best in terms of overall performance/fun.The SNES takes the top prize because of its durability and quality of games.  Other systems have always had a major weakness, for example:NES: Contains my favorite games ever, but durability is a major issue.N64: Mind-blowing for its time (3-D!), but hasn't aged well at all.GCN: Lack of gamesWii: Too &#34;cartoony&#34; for those who like the graphics.The SNES, on the other hand, is not only durable (I have one that still works perfectly!) but also contains quite a library of great games.  FZero, Donkey Kongs, Marios, Madden '97, NBA Jam, Mega Man X, and so many more games stand the test of time.Thus, although the NES contains the more &#34;classic&#34; games, the N64 has more &#34;nostalgic value&#34;, and the Gamecube controller is the best, the Super Nintendo is the best taking all things into consideration.

In general, this game is mainly shoot and hide, and keeps you interested with new weapons and enemies as you progress. Most of the time you will be sneaking up behind soldiers, fierce shootout, or battling robots head on. You can also use bullet time in this game to balance out the playing field. Grenades explosions are pretty cool. You can actually see the shockwave as they blow up.

Not only did I not have to deal with the bugs that have troubled PS3 gamers, but I also avoided the interminable wait for the DLCs that were promised for this platform (Dragonborn, Hearthfire, and Dawnguard arrive next month!).What I did have to deal with was a solidly stable game that has taken up more hours from my life than I'd care to admit.Fans of Bethesda's RPG genre are already familiar with the size and complexity of the worlds they build, but this one is something else entirely. This world is huge, and is populated with such wonderful attention to detail (I even witnessed a bear attack a moose in the wilderness!) This is a world of giants, mammoths, sabre toothed cats, and trolls. A world where NPCs almost pass the Turing test in their interactions with you. A world where a dragon could descend from the skies at any time, and engage you in an epic battle. And, a world where the \"just one more level\"-syndrome will literally take over your life.That said, there are some things that don't work well. Characters do seem to get embedded/stuck in places. The alchemy skill (which is invaluable for quick money and recovery) is not easy to learn without resorting to cheats. And, the carrying capacity limits mean that you are reduced to pack mule-ing your stuff multiple times to vendors (this is one area where I'd have preferred that reality were suspended.)However, in the final reckoning, this game is a must-have for RPG fans - especially for those who enjoy medieval settings.Happy gaming!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2013"}

Well it just so happens in the eternal Dragon Quest franchise, number 5 is often noted as the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me by ardent fans.  The number one reason cited is Dragon Quest V's (DQV henceforth) \"amazing story\".  But before I get to that, let's break this game down into modular criticisms.Graphics:  DQV on the DS is largely graphically the same as DQIV was on the DS.  Quite a few assets are recycled, as is the game's engine itself.  Luckily there have been a few small upgrades to DQV's engine, such as hues changing as day turns to night and back again, as well as the ability to zoom scenes outward to a bird's eye view.  The backgrounds consist of simple 3D elements but run smoothly, whereas characters and monsters all are 2D sprites.  The highlight of the graphics however are the wonderful enemy animations, fluid and quite lively they spice up the otherwise rote combat.Music: DQV's soundtrack is built upon symphonic pieces composed from sampled instruments.  This approach often works well, and many of the songs here are perky and uplifting.  Unfortunately many of the songs here are also lifted from previous entries in the series, leaving only a few surprises.  And while the tunes are nice as a whole, there's not enough variety.  By the end of the game you'll be tired of hearing the same town, dungeon, and battle music ad nauseam.Gameplay:  There's an old adage that says \"if you've played one DQ you've played them all\".  Well based on my limited experience with the series (I've finished DQI GBC and DQIV DS before this), I would say that's not entirely untrue.  The battle system especially is nearly identical to DQIV, with the exception of being able to get monsters to join your party (randomly).  This feature is often cited as innovative on DQV's behalf, but it isn't really considering Digital Devil Story on the Famicom allowed you to do this in 1987, years before DQV adopted the idea.  Also concerning battling, you will be grinding ferociously in DQV if you want to see the end.  Literally in most hostile areas you will get in a battle every 3-5 seconds of walking.  That means a simple dungeon that would take you two minutes to walk through takes two hours thanks to incessant battling.  Luckily you can put your party on auto battle and turn up the battle message speed to fast, which greatly helps ease the pain of the incessant grind. Lastly I will say DQV is a very easy game.  The only tangibly challenging encounter for this player was the final form of the final boss, who I still managed to best in my first encounter.  And that was with no strategy guide or cheats.  To be honest the most fun I had with DQV was traversing its numerous T'n'T boards.  These are special places in the game that are their own sort of dice & board games where you can win special gear.  I would have enjoyed an entire DQ game based on this concept.Story / Plot:  I've saved this aspect for last because it was so disappointing for me.  I had been lead to believe by incessant internet opinions that DQV has an astounding plot.  Well that is simply not true in the opinion of this player who's been into JRPGs since the late 80s.  The biggest deal with DQV's plot is that it's based on family.  You start off as a kid, grow up, get married, have your own kids, and eventually take down the big vague baddie with your family in tow.  Well this might actually mean something if any of your family had deep character development.  Sadly, that's just not the case.  I could not tell you what my wife's favorite food is, or what my kids' enjoy doing in their leisure time, for example.  That's because your family are cardboard cutouts left completely undiscovered thanks to your protagonist being mute.  Dialogue is always one way, as your main player says nothing.  When you are given the option to converse, it's only via a binary question mid-conversation that means nothing at all.  If you choose the incorrect answer, the game will ask you over again until you choose the answer it wants.  What's the point of giving this illusory choice then?  As far as raising my children in DQV was concerned, the only real influence I had as a father was deciding what color hair they would have.  This is a joke considering you could also have children in Phantasy Star III but largely influencing their physical/combative traits based on who you married.  And PSIII came out two years before DQV, for the record!  In the end, the plot of DQV is simple and totalitarian, pushing the idea of familial bonds upon the player but never making the player actually care about the family in tow.  I mean, why should you care that your mother is imprisoned when you know practically nothing about her?  And of course the final boss was some vapid monster who's impetus you knew little about until it showed up out of nowhere and wanted to destroy the world.  Well I have seen deeper stories not only in older JRPGs than DQV, but in children's novels for Pete's sake. My one bit of praise is that despite DQV's threadbare narrative, I will admit the DS version's localization is top notch.  The many NPCs you encounter throughout the game come to life thanks to the colorful translation.Overall:  As you can tell by now I was not enamored with DQV.  Rather I found the entire experience to be over-hyped and honestly a slog at times.  It took me 37 hours to finish DQV, and I was well tired of it by the time I hit 20 hours in.  Having to force yourself to finish a game is never a good sign.  If DQV's plot had actually been gripping, that wouldn't have been the case.  Rather those extra 17 hours weren't full of riveting narrative as I'd been led to believe, but rather endless grind.  At the finish line I walked away feeling DQV was merely a \"decent\" JRPG.  Whether you feel DQV's story is amazing or not largely depends on how old you are when you play it, and how many other RPGs you've already experienced.  For this weathered veteran Dragon Quest V was simply an unmemorable notch on the sword.  Another entry on the list of overrated JRPGs I've finished that I simply can't understand the collective fervor for.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2013"}

I mention this as usually a company is more than happy to answer questions that are posed by members of then media, which might be an indicator that support for the game may be lacking so potential buyers may want to bear this in mind.RTS guru Chris Taylor has returned which the mega-hyped Supreme Commander which is said to take RTS games to a new level. The game offers much potential as players can compete as one of three races on distant battlefields each with their own unique weapons and technologies.As I played the game, I was at first impressed with the abilities to reclaim fallen units for mass necessary to create new units and that many of the units could be upgraded as a players technology level increased.The game also offers a nice array of land, sea, and air units that allow players to develop attack and defense postures that suit their styles. For example, if you prefer to pound them on the ground to open a whole in the enemy's defense line for your air units, then you may do so.Sadly, once you get past the initial eye candy, numerous issues in the game arise. One thing is the amazingly poor unit A.I. that happens at a frustrating level. I commanded a squadron of bombers to stay put at a locale while I built up my forces, only to see them and other units time and time again rush off into battle on their own.Another issue for me was the fact that the game cut scenes were complete with a voice track, but when you are in game, and getting commands from your superiors, the commands come in via text message. It is 2007 folks, when I am in the middle of a battle; I do not want to take the time to have to read text, when voice conversations should have been included.Despite my early frustrations, I continued on in the game, and soon discovered another issue with the game. One mission required me to relocate units to a base and then evacuate them. The problem is that it never said what units it needed, so I moved all of them to the new base, and was constantly frustrated by a counter that listed 3 sets of numbers but required me to move units over one style at a time to learn exactly what they expected me to move.Undaunted, I decided to try the multiplayer portion of the game, and found that even though I had the latest update patch, the game still wanted to patch and posted numerous errors when trying to update to allow access to the online network for the game. I finally solved this by locating a folder in the game directory and patching manually.Once in multiplay, the game was so slow, that is was practically unplayable with four human players all boasting high end systems and high speed connections. Case in point, a bomber took 5 minutes to go from one side of the map to another.Another bug noted in the game was that at times when I attempted to start the game from the icon on my taskbar, the system would reboot.  As a person who worked in tech support for years in the early days of my writing career, I of course know the need for updated drivers and a lack of other programs running and I can assure you that none of those reasons were behind the system rebooting. I had to take to opening and closing my DVD drive to get the game menu up to play.Graphically the game has some nice features, and the explosions in the game are very well rendered and make up for the average to poor sound of the game and the poor voice work.I had very high hopes for Supreme Commander based on the hype and early reviews. Sadly the game is buggy and dull and does not rate more to me than a good idea gone horribly wrong.My advice ignores the hype, skip this one and wait for Command and Conquer 3.2 stars out of 5Gareth Von Kallenbach[...]","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2007"}

No competition means no lowering of prices.This is my biggest complaint against the XBox 360.

{"product_name":"B00AKIPBNS","description":"","reviewerName":"Marcos \"proletariat\"","summary":"Exspansive SRPG makes great use of wireless options","reviewText":"Read for review and playing tips:Available via retail or by download to your 3DS (sd card) via the Nintendo Digital Store, this SRPG makes fantastic use of the spot pass feature and other wifi enabled features such as regular updates, upgrades, downloadable maps and additional optional chapters (some which are free and some add ons for sale, making for a very huge game well worth the 40 dollar purchase price) other add ons, wifi combat, and many more wireless options including street pass which allows you to parley and fight other players locally.This game is similar to, for instance, Jeanne de Arc for the PSP and other tactical, grid based strategy battle layout SRPGs but much more expansive and also makes use of the wireless capabilities much more than almost any SRPG I've personally played to date for the 3DS.Truly a recent masterpiece.Battle is tactical, grid based strategy and single turn based with tons of strategical options such as weaponry, inventory setup, team selection (often you have more characters than a certain battle allows), grouping characters to fight together based on their \"support\" levels that can raise throughout the game, auto play, and much more. Battle animation is advanced with pause and zoom and other options. Experience and stats, weapon levels, Weapon forging that upgrades a weapon's stats such as strength and critical hit chance percentage and connect/miss ratio), skill selection (each character acquires different skills as they level up throughout the game_), changing \"classes\" (similar to jobs in Final Fantasy) are also other elements in between battling... there are many different things that level up based on experience aside from your basic stats and max hp, which makes the game much more in depth and enjoyable; like acquisition of skills, weaponry levels (the better the weapon, the higher class it is in, and characters must attain the respective weapon class from E up to A to use relative weapons... some characters have the ability to use multiple weapon types based on their character type/class, like swords, axes, lances, staves, magic, etc. and also with regards to weapons, most come with usage limits, e.g. 30 hits, then it breaks, while others are permanent but therefore not forgable). When you begin the game you have the choice between three difficulty levels, and I think the higher the level the more medals and possibly other additions, upgrades, additional chapters, etc. that are available... I am playing the game on normal, and cannot imagine playing on the difficult setting, since normal is already challenging enough by chapter 5. I have learned that it is absolutely necessary, or so it seems, to play the games additional \"paralogue\" chapters in between the linear chapters in order to gain enough experience and level up, or play extra \"risen\" battles as they pop up on the world map or even buy extra material/maps for experience, gold, extra characters, upgrades, etc. I had to go back a couple of times and do this in order to defeat the next chapter early in the game.The game is filled with beautiful graphics and great cut scenes (some are fully animated and voiced over, others show text and have partial sfx from characters, e.g. grunts, sighs, etc.), decent 3d effects, good gameplay and advanced features in the strategy based turn play battle mode, and lots of other game options. The story is somewhat tired AT FIRST... A corrupt country invades, and that repeats itself throughout, there is a mystery behind the lead hero character, a marriage is thrown in there, and there is a mysterious dark force at work behind the scenes... but, where the story lacks, it makes up for in characters and game elements. Some of the characters, granted, are a little too branded... i.e. typical stereotypes, but others have more depth, particularly the main characters. The story does get better as you stick with the game with a few twists, and the game offers sub-plots in addition to the main storyline via, for instance, the optional paralogues.As far as purchasing additional maps: One of the most important maps that you should purchase early on is \"the golden gaffe\" which can be bought individually for 2.50 or in a package (the golden pack) for six dollars that includes other good \"maps\" (battles with a sub story that offer treasure and other rewards) such as \"EXPonential Growth\" in this package. This is definitely the best package early on so you can level grind easily and earn lots of gold for better weapons, items, forging, upgrades, etc.Paralogues also offer additional characters as well as the new story elements,  and \"support\" is yet another element,where characters can evenbecome so good together when paired in battle they reach an A level or, if of opposite sex, the S level which is marriage (NOTE: spoiler without revealing too much: this is automatic when it is relative to the storyline but can happen also based on gameplay... such as how often they fight in battle together and the barracks and support features). Characters that are purchased or won via an additional purchase map or by \"parleying\" with/battling optional teams... they can also be purchased with gold, for example... are not part of the main cast (they are called \"cards,\" e.g. a bonus for beating an additional map/battle can be an item or something like \"Prince Marth Card\" meaning you now have him as part of your lineup to equip and use in battle) These particular characters therefore cannot level up in the support manner and have other restrictions main cast members don't, but can be a huge asset. As also stated earlier you can acquire new main cast characters along the way especially in paralogues, and they become part of the main cast. Some characters that become part of the main cast are optional whereas others must be acquired as they are part of the core storyline. There are also other relativesin the game such as children of other characters.... speaking of this, it is absolutely necessary to keep your characters alive (if you are playing on normal or difficult, which I suggest over easy since you lose a lot of options in easy, characters can die in battle or \"retire\" which you don't want). By keeping your characters alive, the game will allow for much more bonus material... i.e. paralogues and additional characters from the future/other relatives/spins on substories. The other important thing to do is to start working early on \"support,\" i.e. couple up in battle and you can have characters not only fight better together but male/female relationships can reach the level of \"S\" meaning spouse and this can open up additional chapters... paralogues.. that open up, as I said, additional characters and storylines.Additionally, the weapon upgrading, skills, and many other character elements are well developed and keep you busy, as well as upgrading or changing classes with scrolls and using other items to upgrade stats. The game is extremely expansive and virtually endless with all the add on material and paralogues to unlock... I have finished it but am still going back to try and unlock other paralogues and other additional material I didn't get the first run through and am getting new elements added to the story... mostly new unlocked characters.My only issue with SRPGs like this in general has always been that they are too linear - the addition of optional chapters (again, some of which are available for purchase but others are free, the paralogues as well as other additional ones that pop up for free) makes this a lot better, as well as teams you can channel from other worlds, extra \"risen\" that show up to fight in order to level up, the ability to call 'risen' foes onto the map with an item, local wifi battle, additional maps to buy and fight... however it still lacks the exploration element of your classic turn play RPGs like Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest and other titles like Suikoden, Radiant Historia (my ultimate favorite), Nostalgia (I'd love to see a hybrid with the SRPG battle mode but the non-linear exploration of the old school exploration RPGs... like towns you can explore instead of just shops at each point on the map, caves... maybe I just haven't played enough RPGs, though I have a decent body of titles from dungeon crawlers to classics to conceptual time line RPGs like Radiant Historia to tactics and action based combat RPGs and more).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXLQC","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Big let down","reviewText":"This is not Survival Horror any more.Not to be put off by a few less than glowing reviews, I bought Resident Evil 6 in the first week of it's release, but I wasn't sure what to expect, as from the demo it seemed to be all \"shoot first think later\". However the idea of four separate games and the familiar world of zombies and horror drew me in.Well, things did not go well. Right from the start I noticed something I never expected to see...from the initial options menu there was a choice available of \"Infinite Ammo: Yes/No\"? Infinite ammo as an option from the word go? In a Resident Evil game? Something's wrong with this.Anyway, you begin the game as Leon, in an extremely bewildering prologue, which is followed up by the game proper, set in what I think is a university, where Leon is forced to shoot the zombified President of the USA and then escape from the campus. There is absolutely no back story given to this. Who is his partner Helena? Why are they confronting the president? When did the campus get all zombied up? As far as I recall, the last time we saw Leon he was escaping Monster Island on a jet ski with Ashley Graham in Resident Evil 4. They really should have started the game with a bit more background set-up that this.Anyway, a couple of hours into the game and some more disappointing features of it come to light. Most worryingly, I realised that a lot of the time I wasn't really doing anything but watching scenes happen by themselves. Every now and then something visually exciting will happen, but from a gameplay point of view, all you are doing is hitting prompts on the screen when asked to. Even in the normal game play modes you really can't go far wrong as your AI partner ends up doing such a sterling job of killing zombies that you really never feel in any danger. It really hit me later on when a set piece involving the over-running of a gun shop by dozens of zombies kicked in. Now this was clearly supposed to emulate the tremendously exciting \"Ganados village\" chapter at the beginning of RE4, or the first Majini group attack in RE5. In those games, you had to think smart and fast to get through the attack in one piece.But in this game, you are joined in the gun-shop assault by about 5 other AI human character, all of whom have firearms! After playing once and dashing about trying to kill the zombie invaders to little effect, I reloaded and tried again, only to find out that it was possible to simply stand in the middle of the room and watch all the other AI teammates deftly massacre all the zombies without any help from me at all. Another reason why this was preferable was that when I was trying to join in and dish out some damage, it was so difficult to move Leon around the room that all I did was get myself attacked all the time. The controls are really fiddly. Moving fast can see you spinning around in unpredictable directions. The inventory is difficult to manage, and not intuitive. On the other hand, your partner has no inventory. They have infinite supplies of everything and never die. I say it again...this is not how a Resident Evil game should work!A few hours in and the reality had really sunk in. You are here to watch rather than play. There are spectacular set pieces such as the attack of a giant killer fish, or the out of control airplane. But, as good as these look, there's pretty much nothing to do. No game to play. Just unfolding action and the occasional prompt to mash a button. When did this become more important than trying to kill the enemy the old fashioned way with skill and good aiming? By the time of the switch of the action to China (still with Leon), I had no more expectations of actually having any fun or any sense of achievement. I ended up playing with an overflowing inventory of ammo and health items. Why heal yourself when it's cheaper to die, as you always restart at the last checkpoint with your health back up to max again. And I'll say it again - your partners will NEVER die while fighting, so I just ended up letting them do everything that was difficult.I did enjoy Leon's final boss fight though, as it was so drawn out. And that was the end of that chapter. Then I moved onto the Chris and Piers campaign. Even less motivated this time, I was surprised to find I started enjoying this game slightly more. But really, I still didn't feel like a hero. Again, I just bumbled around, and the AI controlled Piers did all the hard work. Again, there was a reasonably fun final boss fight though, but everything else was still the same. Most tiresome of all is the beyond ridiculous re-use of the Ada Wong character who is now so unstoppable, unkillable and uncatchable that it's not even funny. All she does is turn up, utter snappy dialogue, and then vanish again. Seemingly in possession of a never ending amount of back up, gadgets and weaponry that you never even see until it's the right time for her to escape/vanish/steal something important.  Then finally onto Jake and Sherry, which at least had some variety in locations, but in a rather cheapskate move, it has you repeating two very significant set-pieces like-for-like as they appeared in the Leon/Helena game! It made no sense to play as Leon and defeat two substantial bosses, and then play as Jake and Sherry and have to do the same thing again - not from a different perspective, but the same actions as you already did before.Anyway the final chapter is Ada Wong, which initially started well - Ada actually has to do some thinking - but it wasn't long before it turned into more of the same: overflowing ammo, and no need to heal, just get all your health restored by retrying from the last checkpoint (which are always very generous and plentiful). Ada as a character was just as tiresome to play as, rather than a personality, all she has is acerbic comments: \"I never was one for the spotlight\" or \"Poor old Leon, always one step behind\".Honestly, Resident Evil 6 never presents you with anything that feels like a challenge. With so much hand-holding, easy checkpoint restarts and winning fights via button prompts, you do feel like you are watching an interactive movie. The game looks spectacular of course- this is Capcom after all, who never let you down in the visual department, although I did see a few shortcuts taken in some scenery with several artifacts rendered as flat when they could have been 3D. Its a long game if you play all four campaigns and there is extra mini-game content as well, but by the end of it, I was playing while browsing the internet at the same time, which I have never done before! I'm really impressed by the amount of technical work that went into this game, and there is so much to see, but somewhere along the way, someone forgot how important it is to make the player care about what they are doing.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2012"}

This game is great!!! The storyline is great. The \"missions\" if you want to call them that are very interesting, and I like how you can use your creativity to finish it. You can possess a rat, kill everyone, use stealth, etc. The game does really reward you for being creative! I can't tell you how many times it was fun to turn a machine against the enemy or stopping time and putting the enemy in front of a bullet that he shot himself. One thing that I thought could have been done better was to make the relationship between some of the characters more connected. For instance, it was heavily implied that there was something going on between the empress and Corvo. But, it would have been nice to have Corvo have flashbacks about the empress and how she was so that the player could see more of thei relationship or just how she was in general. The whole idea was to get players to feel like they were Corvo, which I did feel connected to Corvo. But, there were a couple of things that could have been done better to get other players to care more about the reasons Corvo does certain things. Also, once you beat the game once, you can beat it again in half the time. So, the game is actually short after the first playthrough. I hope the makers of Dishonored keep at it and release another great game.One key thing I should point out. It was published by Bethesda, not created by them. While I like the Elder Scroll and Fallout series, I haven't feel connected to them. Sure, the sandbox and fighting is interesting. Storyline is ok. But, you don't feel connected to the characters. It's fun because you can go around doing stuff, but for me, I need that along with memorable characters or something more interesting. Dishonored definitely gave me, and while it isn't a \"sandbox\" type game, the whole playthrough was interesting.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2012"}

After all, what's better than gunning down hundreds of Beheaded Cannonball Berzerkers with a gatling gun while traveling through a temple in 15th century Egypt? SS never tries to be serious, and this is what makes the game superb. The graphics, albeit limited in scope to the Egypt locale, are rendered beautifully, especially on fast machines (love my GeForce 3!). The gameplay is nothing new, so expect your index finger to cramp up quite regularly. For what SS lacks in length, it makes up for in price. At $20, this game is an absolute steal. It's quite difficult, even on the easiest settings, so get used to the Quick Save key. The bottom line: If you're looking for mindless, fun action, then SS is your game.

I was not a big fan of the time hopping aspect, however.  I don't like that gimmick in pretty much ANY game.  In this particular game, it made the story a little harder to follow, but still not as crazy as the first games story.  It also disguises the fact that you will be visiting the same areas multiple times with different weather conditions, color tones, and people.  In the end, it's still backtracking through the same places.  The game is graphically gorgeous as usual...and the soundtrack is okay.  I got it for about 20 bucks on sale so I feel I got my money's worth.  I would not have paid full price for this.  There is LOTS more to do overall in this game than the original FF13.  There are side quests and more of an open world feel.  Well, there are towns to visit at least.

Afro has set out to try and avenge his father's murder by a man named Justice. Justice murdered Afro's father to claim the 'Number One' headband, giving himself the chance to rule the worldAfro Samurai is based on the popular and stylistic anime of the same name.View larger.with powers akin to a god. The only one allowed to challenge Number One is the person with the 'Number Two' headband, but unfortunately for Afro, the current owner of the headband, anybody and everybody can, and does, challenge Number Two. But never fear, as this new title includes brand new material and background for fans of the series and newcomers alike to enjoy.Loads of Stylized ActionAfro Samurai brings gamers a balanced experienced, with stylistic combat and acrobatic platforming combined with the ability to dynamically slice and dismember enemies in unending ways. While gamers can hack and slash their way through many foes by combining heavy and light attacks with just two buttons, accomplished players will master moves like the Deep Throat Killer, where they pierce their opponent's neck and rip everything loose in a crimson splash.Players will also need to learn the Focus maneuver with its bullet-time effect. This allows the user to slow down time and designate a specific strike zone, which with the right timing and skill can allow Afro to cleave an enemy in two or slice a limb completely off. And since characters are not pre-rendered you don't just get a canned scene when you cut through your enemy, giving you endless ways and means to cut your enemies down to size. This ethos is applied game-wide, as Afro is allowed to interact with anything and everything in his environment to help him on his journey.Star-Studded Supporting CastSamuel L. Jackson reprises his role as both Afro and Ninja in the game, and the same striking art style that made the anime series so popular provides the unique look and feel across beautifully animated open environments. And for those of you who are wondering, developers Namco Bandai let Jackson ad-lib a lot, so be prepared for his branded vulgarity and the M rating it helps the game earn.Meanwhile, Ron Pearlman and Kelly Hu continue on in their roles as Justice and Okiku, while RZA of Wu-Tang Clan fame has created all new tracks for the hip-hop inspired soundtrack. And thanks to an innovative gameplay system, the enemy AI and tone of the game are affected by the beat of the musical score, for a truly immersing experience.With its visual stunning graphics, and fluid and graceful movements, Afro Samurai will provide hours of entertaining, balletic action. Add to this ground-breaking elements like health that is represented by the blood on your clothes, or your enemies', and you have a game that simply can not be passed up.Slice and dice your enemies in a glorious number of different ways.","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"It's the Perfect Afro... with some Head Lice...","reviewText":"Afro Samurai is an action game based on the anime that aired on Spike TV in 2006.  Both the game and anime chronicle Afro Samurai's ultra violent quest to avenge his father's death.  Lots of effort was focused on the style of the game and it really paid off.  The writing, art, acting, combat, music, all flow together to create a fun experience...  but the game has some serious flaws.Story / Dialogue  8/10The story is well told and voice acted by Samuel L. Jackson, Kelly Hu, Ron Pearlman...  The dialogue is entertaining, humorous, and deeply poetic at times.  However, unless you've watched the anime, the story will be hard to follow and may seem like a hip hop ronin acid trip with a large dose of Samuel L. Jackson.  The relationships between the characters and the events in the story aren't fully explained in the game, but it still manages to entertain.  If you've seen the anime, you'll be fine.Graphics  9/10The game does the best job ever at creating a game that looks like playable art.  The stylized look is amazing.  The screen shots and movies don't do the game justice.  If you're an anime fan, you'll really appreciate the look of the game.  If you strive for a more realistic/traditional game look, like Gears of War, the look may not appeal to you.  But if you like anime, you'll love the art!Combat  9/10The combat system of Afro is great.  Afro and his enemies are well animated and very responsive with a large arsenal of attacks.  What truly sets the game apart is the SLICING system.  The player can slow time, and dynamically slice enemies.  Chop off arms, legs, torsos, heads, parts of heads, feet, hands, cut them in half... etc.  Wherever the sword passes through the enemies, they get cut.  It's incredibly satisfying and never gets old.  There's never been an action game that's captured the feeling of wielding a katana and hacking through hordes of enemies quite like this one.Sound  9/10The sound effects and music set the mood really well.  The music blends hip-hop, feudal eastern, and classic western tracks.  I'm not a hip hop fan, but I really enjoyed the epic feel of the soundtrack.  The music is great!Style  9/10The art, combat, acting, music are all top notch.  Very few games have as much style as Afro Samurai.  I really wish I could stop writing here... but here comes the part where the lice ruin the fro.Camera  4/10The Camera is awkward to say the least.  The camera is not inverted.  (95% of games use an inverted camera system - pushing right, moves view to the left.)  You can go into the Options Screen and set the horizontal axis to inverted, but you can't adjust the vertical axis.  The camera feels like it is drifting at times.  I finished the game and never got used to this.  It felt like I was watching a samurai movie shot by a perverted camera man when there were cheerleader tryouts happening just offscreen.Levels  5/10The Levels look great, but some of the designs are very confusing.  It's pretty easy to get lost, but you can press Down on the D-Pad and Samuel L. Jackson appears as Ninja Ninja, telling you where to go.  If you use him too much, he starts insulting you...  Unfortunately, this is when you need him the most.  The combat parts of levels are great, but there are platforming sections of the game.  The platforming areas do a great job at showcasing how bad this game is at jumping and acrobatics.  They're horrible.  Afro is much too floaty, and the camera is too unreliable, for a player to consistently jump from platform to platform.  Most checkpoints are generous, but for some reason, some checkpoints send you back 6 checkpoints if you fall.  This game needs platform jumping like the Superbowl needs a halftime show.Bosses  5/10The bosses in this game are hit or miss.  Some boss fights are really fun, while others are very frustrating.  There's an amazing fight with Afro-Droid, but for the most part, the bosses take really cheap shots at you and do a disproportionate amount of damage.  Some bosses can insta-kill Afro with a single hit while others feel like they're attacking with a fly swatter.  Most of the time, you won't be sure if you are winning or not and the fight will be interrupted by a victory cut scene.  If this happens, it means that you've won.Leveling Up  3/10Sometimes, an icon appears that says Level Up while you are playing.  However, the game never tells you how you just improved!  Did you get more Hit Points, Do More Damage, Get More Moves, Get Sexy Pictures of Kelly Hu?  This is never clear.  You can pause the game and look at a moves list for Afro, but the new moves are not highlighted.  The only thing I can say for certain is that you don't get Sexy Pictures of Kelly Hu, so you're never really excited about leveling up.Replay Value  4/10There really isn't much.  You can play on a Hard difficulty level and completionists can search levels for collectibles to unlock character models and concept art.  That's it.  Playing the game over again to experience the combat is the best reason to replay the game.  The game ranges from 6-7 hours long, depending on how much you search for collectibles.The game is rated M for Mature for every reason a game could be rated M.  Gallons of blood, dismemberment, gore, language, breasts, etc...  Spike TV would be proud.Overall, this could have been a great game, but the flaws start to add up.  Buy it if you are a hard core fan of Afro Samurai and can overlook flaws...  like if you don't mind if your girlfriend has herpes.Rent it if you liked Afro Samurai, want slice through hordes of enemies like Uma Thurman in Kill Bill, love Sam Jackson, know what an Otaku is, know the difference between a katana and a wakizashi, or love action games.Avoid it if you hate hip-hop, Sam Jackson, anachronistic samurai stories, flawed games, violence, or gore.Personally, I feel that Afro Samurai could have been great...  The team at Namco managed to do all of the hard stuff right, but messed up on the easy stuff like Leveling Up, Camera, and Straight-forward Level Design.  It's a cool game with fun moments, but it's not a great game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2009"}

Now it's bringing those controls to the rest of the celebrated series, allowing players to experience the entire Metroid Prime story arc with the peerless precision of the Wii Remote.

In addition to the new control, the Nintendo GameCube games have new features in the Wii versions and improvements such as 16x9 wide-screen presentation, improved HUD system to accommodate the new pointer control, some graphic improvements, and newly added new difficulty levels.","reviewerName":"Patricia Laverty","summary":"Simply Amazing .","reviewText":"Corralling all three Metroid Prime games on to one disc and gifting the GameCube games with new Wii controls feels like an award for outstanding achievement rather than an attempt to improve upon the originals. For as slick as the re-engineered pointer-based shooting system is, it's not the series' most significant accomplishment.Trust Nintendo to give the green light to such a rethink of the firstperson shooter. Here, AI is functional and multiplayer an afterthought (Prime 2's fourplayer mode could be generously described as throwaway), while protagonist Samus Aran's arm-mounted cannon is more a means of progression than weapon.After all, each new upgrade only reaffirms Metroid's status as the thinking man's shooter, with missiles opening previously impenetrable doors, bombs clearing blockages, and so on. Even the gargantuan bosses require equal parts thought and firepower. But the true obstacle in Metroid isn't the alien fauna, it's the vast and daunting terrain.In no other shooter does the environment play such an integral role as it does in the Prime series, a fact frequently underlined by Samus' most significant means of interacting with her surroundings: her visor. Hassle-free dips into the menu switch to scan mode, revealing depth and detail untouched by other firstperson action games. The textures may have aged, albeit with some grace, but in terms of depth the Metroid Prime games still deliver supremely engaging experiences.Inevitably, quality wavers across the series, peaking with the original instalment, its follow-ups favouring graphical flourishes over design innovation: for every clever new gadget there is a helmet-full of air-rippling energy blasts and an increasingly reflective visor. Even the advancements made possible by the Wii Remote feel like a necessary evolution rather than genuine innovation.Regardless, the gathering together of the inspired original and its two accomplished sequels at such an affordable price is only good news for Wii owners. The new control system may ultimately be an upgrade Samus Aran never really needed, but this is still the best - and most logical - Wii reissue from Nintendo to date.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"W. freeman","summary":"My Graphical Review #3","reviewText":"\"One of my favorite games of any kinds, of all time.

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"Square meets Disney. A breath of fresh air for RPG fans.","reviewText":"On the surface, the idea of matching Squaresoft with Disney seems a bit like putting ice cream on pizza. But I had high hopes for this game, considering it was Squaresoft, and I was not disappointed. I bought \"Kingdom Hearts\" on September 17, and have be enjoying it non-stop since then.The story of \"Kingdom Hearts\" is two-fold. We first meet Sora, who along with his friends Kairi and Riku, hope to explore the world together, having never seen the world outside of their island. We then go to Disney castle, where Donald Duck and Goofy must set out to find the king, who has mysteriously diappeared. All he left behind was an odd note that mentions that they must find a \"key\". One stormy nights, Sora, Riku, and Kairi are sucked into the darkness from a mysterious force, and are separated. Their paths cross in a place called \"Traverse Town\", a place where people go when their worlds disappear. I will not reveal anymore, but suffice to say, the story gets more intersting.The first thing you'll notice is that there are a lot of Squaresoft characters you'll recognize: Waka, from FFX, and Cid. There is also Cupo, the loveable and wise Mog from FFVI-XI. The list goes on. Also adding to the mix are 100 Disney characters, almost every one you can think of. The thought behind \"Kingdom Hearts\" is quite brilliant, making it fresh and original. This is what I wanted. The dialogue and writing is definitely not kiddie-fodder. While the game can appeal to any age group, the writing is not corny or overdramatic as kid's movies tend to be.The control is easy to master on the first try, while the battle system couldn't be more natural. Rather than the turn-based battles of the Final Fantasy games, the battles are in real time. The big advantage is that if you are good, a lot of enemies won't even be able to damage you. The graphics and music are fantastic, first rate for the PS2. The animation is smooth and fluid, while the scenery is flawless. The theme song by Japanese pop star Utada Hikiru is excellent, by the way.There are many reasons why I would recommend \"Kingdom Hearts\", but the main one is that there is, literally, something for every body: Familiar Disney characters for the kids, battles for the action lovers, first rate graphics and sound for those who demand it, and interesting story and classic Squaresoft gameplay for the older gamers. This is one of Squaresoft's finest, no contest.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2002"}

The problem is that the parasites are quickly making their way through the research lab's many dangerous projects and subsuming their abilities.As a special bonus to GameCube owners,Metroid PrimeandMetroid Fusioncan each unlock special features in the other game via the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance cable.

It makes you lose the sense of free exploration that the Metroid games are much known for.Still, this is an extremely solid and well made space adventure that should keep you occupied in its 3-5 hour mission.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait. You can't buy a much better game.--John CockingPros:A story to beat all storiesCharacters worth caring aboutHey--it's from SquareSoftStunning animationsCons:Too many random battlesCombat is, as always, turn-based and offers minimal excitementWeak souls might give up after two or three discs of play","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"A Final Fantasy That Tries Too Hard","reviewText":"When Final Fantasy VII debuted in 1997 it was hailed as the greatest of great RPGs.  When Final Fantasy VIII came around in 1999, it had so much to live up to.  So much hype that the bar was set too high, even for Final Fantasy VIII to hit.  Almost ten years later, it's a little easier to look at Final Fantasy VIII with fondness.  In part because that bar it had to reach is no longer there.  The hype has settled.  We can now look at Final Fantasy VIII for what it is.  It's a great game to be sure, but it still has some problems it has to address.Final Fantasy VIII is, first and foremost, a love story.  It takes a moment to get going but when it does (about halfway through) it turns out to be good.  Final Fantasy VIII is about Squall, a young member who attends the Balamb Garden Academy and is about to undertake a field exam for an elite group called SeeD.  When he finally gets in his first mission to help a resistance group lead by a young woman named Rinoa.  The adventure eventually leads to an epic good versus evil battle as Squall and his allies realize a sorceress is plotting world domination.  For the most part the story is good, but even now it's hard not to notice how it skimps on certain things.  Squall is a well developed character, but Final Fantasy VIII does little to develop its other characters.  You come to like Squall and understand his angst, but you'll hardly come to understand the other characters quite as well.Final Fantasy VIII also utilizes the ATB battle system which has been in place since Final Fantasy IV.  The eighth installment in particular tries to differentiate itself from the rest of the series and succeeds.  Very well.  First there's Final Fantasy VIII's junction system.  Rather than having the convential level up system, this game opts instead to have the enemies raise levels with you.  It seems like this will make the game harder, but the junction system serves as a balance.  First, there's drawing spells.  In battle, characters can draw spells from the enemy.  It's a tedious task and often gets boring, but you can use any spell you have to increase your statistics.  But there's more than that.  You can't junction spells to your stats unless you junction Guardian Forces (Final Fantasy VIII's summons) to a character.Junctioning isn't just a gimmick, however.  It's a necessity to getting through the game as your characters stats won't grow fast enough.  Different spells also have a different impact on certain stats.  More powerful spells will do a better job than their weaker counterparts.  You can also junction to increase your defense against status ailments and even increase your elemental defense enough to absorb spells.The Junction system is a great addition but it's overly complex.  The big problem with it, however, is that the game never gives you an incentive to use one character over another aside from their limit breaks, which are very powerful attacks, but only useful if your HP falls into the yellow (or you cast a certain spell).  Battling in Final Fantasy VIII can be fun, but the biggest problem is that it never encourages you to take advantage of it.  You can draw spells, but depleting your stock of spells also depletes the stat its junctioned to.  In short, if you want to keep most of your stats in tip top shape you'll want to refrain from using some of the game's more devastating spells (as they'll be used to junction).  The junction system does work, however, in letting gamers challenge themselves.  You can make the game as hard or as easy as you like.There are also abilities that each GF carries that allow you to learn several abilities.  Some can give you new commands in battle while others can also help increase your stats by a certain amount.There's quite a bit more to Final Fantasy VIII's gameplay.  There's also a card game called Triple Triad you can play.  It's a simple game complete with complex rules.  It's also incredibly addictive.  There are a couple of other mini-games, but where Final Fantasy VIII really succeeds is it's unremarkable number of sidequests (though most of them become locked on the final disc).  There's a ton of optional things to do here.If anything did go against Final Fantasy VIII, it would be some of the things at the core of its gameplay.  As mentioned earlier drawing is downright boring and long.  There's little incentive to use magic and there's not much point to level grinding or any incentive to actually work for abilities either (why bother if enemies will level up with you?).  The biggest problem is actually getting new weapons.  In most RPGs weapons are found or bought in item shops or earned as rewards for defeating certain enemies.  Final Fantasy VIII does away with all that and makes you scrounge for items to make weapons.  At first it seems creative, but getting some of the more lucrative weapons becomes very taxing and repetitive.  You might find yourself getting into several battles just to get one part for a weapon.  It's helped a little by letting you change items and cards into tools, but some can only be obtained by defeating enemies.  Getting new weapons and making characters more powerful should be a bit more fun than this.  Final Fantasy VIII manages to turn it into a chore.Graphically, however, Final Fantasy VIII is a milestone for the Playstation.  While it's environments can be a little grainy, its character models are very beautiful and actually very human like.  The game doesn't look smooth, however, and some of the art design doesn't look as good as other Final Fantasy games past or present.  It's a visual looker, having some incredibly detailed towns and dungeons and even some incredible looking spell effects and limit breaks (as well as some top notch FMV sequences) but it doesn't always set the mood the way previous installments have.  As much as some may not like to hear it: Final Fantasy VII was a greater visual achievement.  Final Fantasy VIII is incredible to look at, but some of its visuals just look a bit sloppier.Musically Final Fantasy VIII sounds good.  It doesn't sound quite as good as Final Fantasy VI or Final Fantasy X, but the tracks that stand out are among the most recognizable in Final Fantasy history.  Much of it has the love story soundtrack going for it.  There's a lot of slow low key musical numbers.  For some gamers this probably won't cut it.  Especially when compared to the more lively and upbeat soundtracks of the other games.Final Fantasy VIII isn't a bad game, but it's one that tries so hard to be different from the rest of the series and tries too hard to be better than its predecessor.  The truth is, when a game gets labeled the greatest of greats, its probably better not to try and out do it, but to focus on what made it great in the first place and continue in that direction.  Final Fantasy VIII is a good game.  A great game, even, but its gameplay issues make quite a dent in the game as a whole.  It's an amazing experience but with these issues, it keeps it from being the best experience it can be.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2008"}

I tried fighting online, but couldn't ever get into a match due to heavy usage. Needless to say, I was disappointed.A few days later I practiced using many of the different characters and the hundreds of moves that come with them and I realized that this isn't just a regular button mashing fighting game. The controls are VERY precise and pressure sensitive. There's a lot to learn here.In my opinion this game really shines when you go online. After a week or so of buying this game it got a whole lot easier to find available matches. I love the fact that you can fight opponents online with the same precise controls as in the single player game. Matches rarely go past ten minutes making this a perfect online multiplayer game if you don't have a long time to devote to it.

{"product_name":"B001L8DKJ8","description":"InPrinny: Can I Really Be The Hero?players are treated to a single player spin-off from the popular role-playing (RPG) universe ofDisgaea. Here players step into the unlucky shoes of a penguin called a Prinny and 999 of his comrades as you slash your way through various Netherworld areas in side-scrolling service to the Demon Lord Etna. Although the mission that you are saddled with is ridiculously comic, the action you face is not, so you're given 1,000 lives to work with and you can use everything you find on the battlefield to help you survive and succeed.Caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Classic side-scrolling action.View larger.Challenging difficulty levels.View larger.Multiple vehicles &amp; aircraft.View larger.The StoryPrinnies are the reincarnated souls of evil humans trapped in purgatory. Summoned by urgent order, the player in the form of the lowly Prinny rushes to meet his boss, Demon Lord Etna in her chamber. You arrive just in time to see Etna beating your fellow prinnies to a pulp. She is definitely in a bad mood, being even more abusive and violent than usual. As it turns out, someone has snatched her favorite dessert from the fridge. Eager to vent her frustration, she orders you to hunt down the ingredients to create a new Ultra Dessert and promises that if you do not deliver the goods by the next morning that you will learn what eternal suffering really means. Since you are at the very bottom of the netherworld food chain, if not its gutter, you have no choice but to snap into action.GameplayPrinnyis a side-scrolling platformer filled with classic flavored gameplay that requires timing of jumps and memorization of the patterns of enemy movements. As non-threatening as dessert making might seem, nothing could be further from the truth. In the game players are given 10 hours and the use of 999 identical comrades from the Prinny Squad to defeat demon bosses spread throughout the game's levels who possess the necessary ingredients to create a new dessert for Etna. Although this may sound like way more than enough help, surprisingly challenging gameplay that consistently has players one blow from either victory or defeat and the nature of the prinnies themselves will quickly change player's perception on this.True to their origins in theDisgaeauniverse where their literal explosive nature makes them perfect cannon fodder to aim at enemies, prinnies are extremely volatile. Players can only only control one prinny at a time because you only possess one red scarf, which not only indicates your status as current game hero, but also keeps you from blowing up. Wave after wave of enemies within the game also conspire to exploit the prinnies' tendency towards combustion, and more often than not are successful, underlining the importance of your 999 friends. This means that players do not actually play as a single prinny. As one meets his end another takes his place and you are kept informed of how many prinnies you have left, as well as how many hours. Prinnies are not defenseless though. Players have use of a variety of attacks and moves like the 'Dual Sword Slash' to deal with enemies in front of you, the 'Hip Pound' which allows you to stun opponents with your bottom and standard platformer jump and sprint functionality for mobility. In addition, prinnies can lift and throw objects like bombs, stomp enemies and even pilot tanks and planes to bombard whatever gets in your way. The game comes with two modes: Standard Mode, which allows you to take damage up to 3 times before losing a life and Hell Mode where one blow means instant death. In this ridiculously comic adventure you will need every advantage if you hope to survive the cost of the ultimate sweet treat.Key Game Features:1,000 Units- Players will get 1000 lives to beat the toughest action of this platforming side-scroller.Lift &amp; Throw- Prinnies are able to lift and throw objects on the battlefield.Vehicles- Steal and control powerful vehicles, like tanks and UFOs.Hip Pound: Jump and pound enemies to stun them. Then you can inflict multiple combo attacks for extra damage.3D World with 2D Characters: InPrinny, character art is created using fluid 2D sprites, giving it a classic look with a comical tone. Battlefields and backgrounds, however, are created with 3D models. This allows for a smooth and unique combat action where certain attacks are rendered in a 3-dimensional view.Boss Battles Galore- 10 Major stages featuring many hidden characters and a boss waiting at the end of each.Music Collection Mode- Find music tracks during game and replay them as background music.Humor- Ridiculously comedic storyline and characters.","reviewerName":"FunFact","summary":"Dood !!!","reviewText":"Ok to start off this I would have given this game a 4 star or maybe a 5 star if not for the the bad controls it has .

I must say that when i rented this game, there were some quick things i noticed and liked, or noticed and disliked. I did not really think the graphics were good in this game. From a distance, they seem pretty good, but in cutscenes, they are really lame. What I did like about this game was how you could be a Jedi and use a light saber, or maybe have a duel in multiplayer mode, or do a cooperative mission. About the single player game, many people complained about how easy this game was and how quickly it could be beaten; not for me. I am generally good at games, but I am at the ' showdown with Dooku ' and I can't beat him. If the game wasn't so hard, i wouldn't have quick single player and started to play multiplayer. About multiplayer duels now, you can play with a friend or against an A.I. controlled player. You can select from young Obi-Wan and Anakin from the start of the game. As you progress, you can unlock characters such as ( may be some spoilers, discontinue reading. ) Mace Windu, Darth Vader, Ben Kenobi, Grievous... and others. I was dissapointed though at duel mode, because it didn't include Jedi masters like Yoda or Emperor Sidious. ( no more spoilers. ) Moving on to the cooperative mode, this is just flat out hard. Just on the first level of cooperative mode, and on easy, I had a lot of trouble getting through it with my cousin. There were about 4 waves of droids we faced, and we didn't get to finish because well, lets say about 5 droidekas came in at one time when our health was low. Oh, by the way, there are no bacta tanks to give you some healing. So, cooperative mode is kind of fun, but also very frustrating. I took this game back to blockbuster the next day because of a lack of fun. I am a huge starwars fan, and this game was okay, but the best starwars game i've played is still starwars battlefront.

{"product_name":"B001ASJISG","reviewerName":"Brendan Foy \"Foy\"","summary":"When a Game becomes Art","reviewText":"I am not a big fan of Prince of Persia. I liked Sands of Time but thought all the GOTY nominations were taking it too far. I saw it as a solid and highly enjoyable experience but not this AAA title others touted it as.I was skeptical of IGNs review of this new PoP where the reviewer had a love affair with the game on the pages of IGN. He just seemed like he was too much in love with the series in general to give a truly unbiased review. I have also recently been reading many revisionist takes on this game saying it is too short, too easy, too shallow, bad combat, overrated, etc... the usual things the second guessers say about a well received game.I picked up a copy of the game for myself and have now beaten it and unlocked 94% of the achievements, the most I have ever done in a game before.  My in depth experience has given me an informed impression of the game.  There is much this game does right where it will just grab you, then hold you in the palm of its hand.  At other times you may find yourself annoyed, frustrated or even bored.  All in all, this is an excellent game that you should experience, but UBI Soft had a particular type of gamer in mind when they designed this new Prince of Persia.Let me start with why you should get this game:For one the game is absolutely gorgeous. A work of Art. I love the look of this game and it is nice to see a Western developer create a style so detailed and beautiful. I can't stand the big eyed weird looking Japanese style of artistic games and I hope other Western devs follow Ubi Softs lead. It is part cel shaded, part conventional graphics. reminds me of a movie which uses Rotoscope animation. The game world is like a painting in a museum and the main characters have so much detail and care put into their design and every movement you can't help but take notice, even when in an intense situation. This is the type of game you stop playing for a bit and just look at. Having the Prince stand on a balcony of a massive tower overlooking a massive landscape is a sight to behold. My dream game would be a Conan game which uses Ubi Softs engine and Frank Frazettas art style.The difficulty in this game is about the same as Sands of Time and may even be a tick more challenging. No, you can't \"die\" in the game, the A.I. character will always save you. It is a bit lame, but it is not much different than using the time control in Sands of Time to rewind time to save yourself. It is essentially the same concept. I don't see why some are so hard on this game but give Sands of Time a pass. Also, there are a ton of games which allow you to save anywhere at anytime, creating your own checkpoints. How is that any less \"cheap\" than not dying in this game? There is also an achievement you can get where the A.I. can not save you more than 100 times. there's a little incentive for you to be more careful. And there is another component to this game which involves collecting \"light cystals\" after you beat certain areas. It can be pretty damn tough to get all of them and offers a different kind of challenge.Alot of games these days are short. Too short. Prince of Persia is not one of those games though. Yes, once you do beat it you may be done with it, but it is like that with most single player games.  It took me well over 12 hours to beat this game.  Now alot of my time had been spent gawking at the scenery, but this isn't a game meant to be rushed through. You really have to stop once in a while and soak it all in.The gameplay is very good and the controls are top notch. This is an action platformer and a joy to play.  There are plenty of intense and epic moments to be had in this game, you constantly be wondering what else they have in store for you. The gameplay is like Sands of Time but with a slightly faster pace and more intuitive controls.The combat is pretty good. This is not Warrior Within, so there aren't that many enemies to do battle with. The focus is platforming and exploration here. What combat there is though is pretty fun. A more polished version of Sands of Time where you can do some really cool stuff.  The gripe I have about the combat are the Flash Prompts, which I will discuss later.The sound in this game is incredible. From the effects to the music. It doesn't just sound good but it knows the right time to kick in as well. You'll hear an earth shattering roar just when things started to get nice and quiet or you'll hear some epic movie like music just as you walk out onto that balcony to check out the scenery. Like Luke Skywalker watching the Tatooine Suns set with a John Williams score in the background.Yes there are some flaws, and I'll mention them real quick:The Prince himself can be annoying. UBI Soft has such an incredible art style and gorgeous game world, they should have taken the character more seriously. They went in a tongue in cheek direction, but only with the Prince character. They tried to make him sarcastic and witty but he comes across as a bad Disney version of Han Solo or a poor mans Ash (Bruce Campbell in Evil Dead Movies). It does take away from the game quite a bit at first, but eventually he will either grow on you or you'll learn to tolerate him.The story is generic. Would have been nice to have a story that matched the scale of the game world. But it is nothing too bad, especially by Video Game standards.  The ending I must say redeems the story completely and leaves you gaping at your screen.  Exceptional.Collecting the light seeds will seem tedious at first, it did to me. But then I realized the real challenge in getting to some of these things and how it adds a new dimension to the gameplay. I soon looked forward to collecting them.  But they will be tedious to others.The game has incredible platform elements. I'm talking some pretty intense stuff here but the platform puzzle aspect (other than getting to some of the light seeds) is lacking. One main reason for this is you can have your A.I. companion cast a spell which lights up the path you need to take. A glowing orb will \"show you the direction\" if you press the Y button. Still, getting through that path safely can be quite a challenge and when it comes to finding a way to get to light seeds, you're on your own. Some Tomb Raider like puzzles would have been great and would have added much to the gameplay.The game world feels a little lonely, not that many characters. You are basically trying to save an abandoned part of the world so it's mostly just you and the A.I. Companion along with the occasional enemy to battle. Would have been awesome if this game had a Zelda like spin to it. A minor gripe.The bosses are pretty impressive in the game, but you don't have any real fear of dying from them.  You'll be amazed what you live through. The fights themselves can be quite the spectacle, a spectacle you are fully involved in.  But the battles also use what I will call flash prompts, where the bad guy gets close and enters an animation and you can't control your because you're supposed to wait for the appropriate button to fash on the screen and if you hit it in time, the Prince will react and counter but if you miss it, you get to watch him get beat on.  These flash prompts were a pain to me, I felt detached from the experience.  They aren't a huge portion of the battle experience though.Final Thoughts:Prince of Persia was designed with a more casual gamer in mind.  Someone who is not particularly seasoned in gaming but is interested in getting lost in a beautiful new world.  Somneone who enjoys games, but does not have the time to sink endless hours into one and accomplish nothing.  The objectives of the game are the same throughout, beat a world (which takes around 20 mins or so) and then collect the needed light seeds.  It is the type of game best enjoyed when played in spurts as opposed to setting aside your whole weekend afternoon.  The longer you play it, the more tedious the limited battles and light seed collecting becomes.  When you play it in spurts, such as an hour or maybe two at a time, then you will be presented with a gorgeous and fully detailed world lifted right out of the dreams of your childhood and the pages of a Fairy Tale.  The platforming and acrobatic moves are a joy and collecting all the light seeds in an area is a challenge, but one that won't keep you up all night.  The gameplay is incredibly streamlined and there is a deliberate effort to avoid frustration as much as possible.  This is good for those who play it in spurts, but possibly problematic for those who grind right through every game they get.  With the beautiful animations, Ubi Soft is also flirting with some dangerous territory here where you feel you are \"watching\" the game more than \"playing\" the game.  Still quite challenging, but at times the platforming seems a little too automated as well.It is a beautiful, elegant game which controls perfectly and oozes high production value with its top notch presentation.  The game is in many ways a work of art.  A visual and audio work of art.  Story, except for the end, is rather bland and the gameplay highly streamlined.  The game does hold your hand more than many would like, but the critics of Prince of Persia are exaggerating quite a bit when it comes to this game. It is a well made product, a work of art and can be tons of fun, just play it in spurts and not with a \"must beat it\" mindset.  Sit back and soak it all in, you'll be glad you did.My Letter Grade for Prince of Persia would be a B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2008"}

Best graphics and handling of a racing game i've seen. However it gets boring real quick. There are very few tracks and you just keep doing them over and over and the only thing that changes is the type of vehicle you drive and the difficulty. And the few tracks that there are, aren't even that fun to begin with. I'm only on level two, and I'm already bored.Get this game if you like cheap thrills, but if you're looking for substance and re-playability, this game sucks.Take a lesson from Off road fury 4, they had a ton of great tracks.

I played 1 & 2 multiple times, testing variations and exploring the game.ME 3 is not a bad game, they got a lot of the mechanics right, and during most of the game they offered a good experience.But as we are all mentioning here the endings are not acceptable.  Either Bioware/EA has absolutely no sense whatsoever not to realize the ending makes no sense and betrays the entire series (and not because it is sad or happy, but because it is a cheat and stupid) or they planned to sell the \"real\" ending on a DLC later on.  I don't know which is worse, if they are so senseless or so corrupt to the point of selling the ending of a trilogy without the ending in order to make a few extra bucks.I dare say this failure sets back videogames as a media for storytelling considerably.I also believe that the gaming magazines, all of which raved about the game, now have two very bad reasonable choices.  They can admit the reviewed the game without ending it, which would be ok and we would understand why they gave such a review; or they should acknowledge they are nothing more than a propaganda mill and their review independence is nill.

I love the story, the character interactions, the missions, etc. This is truly a great series finale. Each installment has gotten bigger and better. There are a ton of missions and side quests in the installment, probably as many as the first two games combined.Story: The reapers have invaded earth and the galaxy. It is up to you to rally up all the species for one final showdown.Gameplay: Action RPG and 3rd Person Shooter, similar to the previous two installments. You traverse the galaxy using your spaceship. You can walk around your ship, the citadel, other planets, etc. While in your ship, you can explore solar systems. This includes scanning planets and launching probes to gather information and supplies. The only difference in this game is the scans can attract the reapers so you have to leave the solar system before they catch you. You can interact with all of your party and most of your crew. The main missions include every species we have seen throughout the series including the Krogan, Salarians, Turians, Geth, Asari, Quarians, etc. all while battling the elusive man and Cerberus and the Reapers. You have to resolve conflicts and get as many species on board to help the final confrontation against the Reapers. While on missions, the gameplay turns into a 3rd-person shooter with multiple weapons and a cover system.Conclusion: While I know there is lots of frustrated gamers and controversy surrounding the ending of the game, I do not believe that has any affect on the rating of this game. The story is still great and although the extended cut DLC did improve the ending a little for me, I don't think it was needed. I couldn't come up with a better ending myself that solved all the problems. I mean this is not as simple as one of those &#34;the good guys win&#34; scenarios. There are consequences to every outcome of the battle and no one ending is going to satisfy everyone. The gameplay is incredible, the missions, the dialogue, the conflicts, Cerberus- it all adds up to a great game.

This must be said. Some people will get stuck on certain levels, but there is always a way to get through. For instance, it took me 15 minutes to figure out that I had to feed my blob a trampoline bean in a hole and then push a rock on top of the trampoline to provide a step at a higher platform, because otherwise the bird kept eating the beans I would feed. This game is very similar to Braid for the PS3 which is a download, and usually gets a 5 out of 5 reviews. Braid is 15 dollars, but A Boy and his Blob is much easier and I enjoy the plot and setting better. A Boy and his Blob also uses the newWii Classic Controller Pro - White, and was the first game I tested the controller out with.**Considering the price of this game(sixteen dollars), A Boy and His Blob deserves 5 stars.Update 5/1/10: make sure you search for youtube videos when you get stuck. I did get stuck at the first boss, and needed the help. The first boss can take forever to defeat without that help.

{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Siddiqui","summary":"343 Industries have taken the Halo franchise over and proven that they can handle the challenge.","reviewText":"It's been 5 years since we last saw Master Chief as he and Cortana were left in a empty ship awaiting a rescue team. Within that period two Halo games were released before Bungie left the series in the hands of a new studio, 343 Industries. Stepping onto the mantle of something as adored as Halo is no easy task, especially when taking the reins from a studio that has earned its admiration. Halo 4 makes the start of a new trilogy and is possibly the best Halo game made so far.Halo 4 begins 4 years after the events of Halo 3 with Cortana waking Master Chief from cryosleep aboard The Forward on to Dawn. After a brief introduction a group of Covenant attack and then you plummet to a new world called Requiem. Here is where you meet the crew of the UNSC Infinity and is where 343 Industries does something new. Instead of telling brief a story 343 attempts to include a large amount of Halo lore from books, animated series, and games. Characters address issues such as the moral dilemma of initiating the Spartan II project and the longevity of an AI. Things that was previous ignored in Halo games is now brought up. It is definitely a change of pace from pervious games, but if you are like me and read all the books or saw any of the animated or live action series based on this beloved franchise then you will be in for a treat.I bring up the lifespan of an AI because 343 places Cortana in the spotlight of Halo 4. As a old AI construct Cortana has exceeded the predicted lifespan and is beginning to show signs of rampancy. Right after Cortana wakes Chief from cyrosleep she begins to show signs of deterioration such as a screeching voice, violent emotional outbursts, and processing tactical data . She and Chief have also kept each other safe but now it's up to Chief to keep Cortana from insanity, creating a much more personal story that puts there relationship to the test.Master Chief and Cortana may be dealing with there own personal issues but a new enemy has risen to take the place of the Flood parasite. Requiem is an amazing planet full of secrets and some are better left alone. For the sake of brevity a new enemy has risen to eliminate humanity as a potential threat and retake the position as the apex race. Master Chief must now do what Spartans were designed to do, to protect humanity at any cost.Halo 4 has had a massive graphical upgrade, making it the best looking Halo game so far. The new planet of Requiem host an array of areas from past Halo games such as forests and deserts but adding new Forerunner architecture that looks stunning. Textures look pixelated up close though and the overuse of lens flare is distracting at times. Although the Xbox 360 has aged these new visuals are a impressive feat, it's obvious that Microsoft spared no expense in the production of this beloved franchise.The combat mechanics of Halo 4 have been modified while remaining loyal to traditional elements. The new and old enemies will require you to use every weapon and equipment available to you. Regardless of the situation, whether you fight one of the heavily armor Promethean Knights or the classic Elites, you will have a weapon designed for the task. Eliminate an enemy shield and then melee them to finish them off or sneak behind an enemy and perform a vicious assassination attack still remain a viable tactic.But what good is being a genetically modified solider if you have no one to fight, fortunately you won't have no shortage of enemies. Halo 4 will have the Covenant Elites, Grunts, Jackals, and Hunters as well as new Promethean enemies called Knights, Lurkers, and Watchers who want nothing more then your extermination. The Covenant rely on the same strategies the Prometheans can teleport, summon support, revive allies, throw grenades back, and provide shields for friendly forces. The objectives are a simple mash of moving from one marker to the next, but combined with vicious opponents and a stellar atmosphere you'll forgot These new adversaries are a welcome addition to the Halo universe and worthy opponents.Beside the story, the gameplay, and the multiplayer the other significant portion of Halo as been the soundtrack. Sound effects that didn't exist in Halo before have been introduced such as heavy metal boots hitting the floor. Every weapons been audible redone with human weapons sounding more lethal or alien. Neil Davidge done a phenomenal job of retaining the original feel of Martin O'Donnel, while establishing itself within a new trilogy. Whether you are shooting hostiles or apporaching your next objective the soundtrack will have you engaged in each level.Halo is responsible for making online console competitive gaming what it is today. The multiplayer mode, now called Infinity, takes place during and after the events of Halo 4. Infinity consist of the map creator Forge, the post-single player cooperative campaign called Spartan-Ops, and the competitive mode known as War Games. The most radical changes to the multiplayer is the use of loadouts, default sprint, kill camera, kill streaks, and instant respawn. The map and playlist creation mode known as Forge as been updated with new items, but it may be weeks before creative minds are able to fully utilize these tools to make some interesting creations.War Games host plenty of competitive options for those seeking to test there skills against human opponents. Right now 10 maps and 10 modes are available that allow for classic modes such as deathmatch, team deathmatch, domination, capture the flag, and free-for-all. Pervious modes like grifball and flood, perviously known as zombies, have been modified to feel more like competitive modes then a custom game.Spartan-Ops replaces firefight and offers five episodes, each consisting of 5 missions, that take place after the events of the campaign. Only one mission is currently available and 343 plans to release new missions weekly with no additional cost. These short missions allows you and up to three friends to tackle a series of missions following Fireteam Crimson, which consist of a team of Spartan IVs, to repel Covenant and Promethean forces to establish bases on Forerunner structures.As you complete challenges and kill other human players you'll earn experience which can be used to unlock new gear, gain levels, and earn cosmetic items. Halo 4 gives you a large amount of options for you to make your own personal Spartan IV. You are constantly earning experience from the rewarding leveling system that grants you points for every contribution you make.Halo 4 signifies the departure of Bungie and welcomes 343 Industries as the new handler. It makes an amazing and emotional return for Master Chief in the stunning campaign shows that 343 intends to maintain the same high quality Bungie preserved. The competitive multiplayer picks up where Reach left off and Spartan-Ops may proves its worth in the coming weeks or fall in the shadow of main campaign. It is no doubt that Master Chief has return with a bang.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2013"}

To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide.

The kind way to put it would be that Gears 2 was *extremely* consistent with Gears 1. If you flashed a bunch of screen shots of both games, it would take some effort to recognize which game each shot was taken from. The only thing that kept Gears 2 from feeling like an expansion pack for Gears 1 was its sheer epic scale.There is no such issue with Gears 3. The game play is instantly familiar and as rock solid as it's ever been, but the look and feel is a bit different and improved. That \"extra year\" of development this game had is right there on the screen. Some of the character models have been updated to the point where they're off-putting at first and take some getting used to (I'm looking at you, Cole and Baird) and that's the closest thing I have to a gripe about this game so far. As always, all I care about is the single player campaign, and Gears 3 delivers the goods.

It's addicting and fun, but it also has a few snags.  There are a number of civilizations you can choose from, all with their strengths and weaknesses.  They are not equally balanced, but it is fun to try to win with all of them.The gameplay is not as sophisticated as I remember the PC version being, although I admittedly haven't played a Civ game since Civ II.  For instance, roads can be built instantaneously.  You have to focus your cities on either gold or science.  There is much less micromanagement, which speeds up the gameplay but also robs the player of some depth.  You also run out of time at 3000 AD, although I have never even come close to running out of time.  Still, it should be open-ended.  Also, there's only one map size and it doesn't feel nearly as large as the old PC version.  That can be troublesome, especially at the higher levels.The difficulty levels range from Chieftan to Deity.  I started out low but moved up quickly to Emperor and Deity.  Deity is the most challenging, but also the most perplexing.  The AI civilizations are able to produce settlers without costing them population deductions, are able to produce unending waves of Legions, and randomly have victories by far, far inferior units.  I still prefer to play at the Deity level, but it can be maddening at times.The graphics are quite nice for a turn-based game, and it seems to run without too many problems.  I have played both the 360 and the PS3 versions (I own the PS3 version, and my friend has the 360 version).  Both have frozen on me, although I think I would recommend the 360 version if you have that choice to make.  The 360 seems to run just a little more smoothly.While this game might not be everything it could have been, it is still quite enjoyable and is fairly addictive.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0044SA70M","description":"","reviewerName":"Jane","summary":"So much to do!","reviewText":"Short answer...Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a solid action RPG with a few gimmicks that separate it from the games it's influenced by. It's fun, huge, with a difficulty issue that is kind of big (way too easy) and a broken economy (I am way too rich). The main plot is fun, but after completing a ridiculous amount of side quests (there are plenty) I find myself bored with them despite their fairly well mapped out plots.Long answer...Graphics: I'm a firm believer in graphics being not as important as plot, and I'm a firm believer that photo and videorealism are beautiful, but unneccesary. That said, playing on a good computer rig I find this game to be quite beautiful. The colors are vivid, sparkles in the air, lots of different color effects. Very nice. You appreciate the beauty of the game's impressive fantasyscape when you exit a dank cave. That said, about 60 hours in, I find the texture details are inconsistent.Setting and world: Amalur is beautiful and bright. There's a war going on in a distant frontier, and the background is good. You have immortal natives who are unchanging, a few different races, lots of big cities, tiny towns, and even smaller settlement pockets. Big fat evil to be discovered and all the reasons behind it. There are .. about 5 HUGE areas, and unfortunately it seems that most of the side quests are kind of within the area. I find little reason to go back to the original area, so far. But I also haven't finished the game, so who knows. I don't HAVE to have a calendar or a clock in games, but when I do I like there to be a significant difference in day and night. I like sunsets and their color effects. This game has a clock, and it has been dark at some times, but it doesn't seem consistent and you don't really care since the NPCs seem to sleep at random times. Sometimes it's midday and these fools are taking a nap.Sound and Voice Acting: The voice acting in this game works because there are enough voices that are similar, enough that are varied and enough light accents to mix with the hard accents. It seems very realistic and I haven't directly thought, \"Same person who I talked to in the last town\". The music is good, if a little too epic in some areas. Nothing is one of those superb theme songs that you remember for years after, though. Just mood music. ;)Choicemaking: Uhhm, I guess? There are a few choice, but it's mostly kill this person who is evil or let them run off... Persuade this evil person to go away instead of fighting you. So far I haven't come across any choices that genuinely feel important to me. I guess that cuts replay value down since you can play ANY class at any time that you want by visiting a \"fateweaver\". So after this go through on the game, I have no reason to create another character. Also, I don't feel like there was any real difference in choosing a race. They mention it at times, but it doesn't mean anything.Combat And Character Development: Yeah, it's smooth. It's also easy. I can't say there's any real skill involved to the combat, not even in the combos. It is attractive and I like the ability to manage my new combat classes. I like reallocating my points which I can do OFTEN because I have so much effing money I can change depending on whatever new weapon I found. The skill tree is fine, if bland, looks like Venetica's skill tree. Three classes, put your points in one or a combination of. No point playing a battlemage if you can play a soldier one minute and a mage the other.Did I get all the primary categories?Okay. Fun game, a few flaws. Definitely a good way to spend the time in between Skyrim and Mass Effect 3. I've been in Amalur quite a few hours (40+) and I like the variety and amount of quests but it's definitely not a perfect game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0044SA70M","description":"","reviewerName":"Psychic Cypher","summary":"Haven't had this much fun in years!","reviewText":"I'm an avid gamer. By avid, I mean that gaming is one of my passionate hobbies. I have two young kids and a wife that I love, so gaming is relegated to my (often quite) limited free time. But it's one of my main ways to relax. As such, I've played a LOT of games. I'm not much of a multi-player kind of guy; I prefer single-player games with a good story and (even more importantly) great gameplay. My two favorite genres are RPGs and FPSs. My favorite game of all time is Metal Gear Solid 4, with a close second being Uncharted 2.Probably my third favorite game of all-time is Twisted Metal 2. So I've been eagerly awaiting the release of the new Twisted Metal, and while I've played a little bit of it (and it's awesome!), it says a lot that I've barely gotten into that game because I've been having so much fun with Amalur. I've also been very impatiently awaiting the release of Skyrim, which is also awesome, but I have fully abandoned it (for now) in favor of my Amalur addiction. I'm literally completely absorbed into this game. The story is awesome, the world is fully realized, and I actually care what's happening. And the combat is better than most ACTION games...certainly better than any other RPG I've ever played. FINALLY! An RPG with great combat. Who woulda thunk it? Well, everyone, I guess, but it's never happened until now.Most of the time in RPGs, as much as I love the gameplay (other than combat) and main story-lines, I just find it tedious to get into the excrutiating minutia of the world's lore - usually a bunch of trivial details that don't make one bit of difference and don't enhance my knowledge of the game's world...nor make me care any more about it. Not so in Amalur. I find this world completely absorbing and addicting. I think about it when I'm not playing it. It has that \"just one more quest\" or \"just one more area\" mentality that sucks you in and won't let go. And, more so than most other RPGs I've ever played, it's actually a COMPLETE blast while you're doing it. There are just so very few weak aspects of this game that it's a joy to play.Graphics - 9.5 (Beautiful, colorful world that looks amazing. A little pop-in here and there, but overall it looks fantastic.)Gameplay - 9.8 (SO much to do, and almost all of it is fun. Combat is amazing...certainly the best of any RPG I've ever played.)Story - 8.8 (Interesting main story and faction quest-lines. Side quests are interesting and fun, but don't add much to the story.)Length - 10 (There is a LOT of content here. I don't think it's in the 200+ hours range the publisher has touted, but there's a lot. Certainly more than many other RPGs. What matters here, though, is the QUALITY of content...it's all well-done, and fun.)Sound - 8 (The times I did notice the game's sound, it was good...enhancing the story, letting you know enemies are nearby, etc. But there are many times I didn't notice it - which usually isn't a good sign. The music is there, it's good, it's just not super remarkable. In some ways I think it's a good thing that it's unobtrusive; but overall it just didn't stand out the way some game's sound does.)Overall (not an average) - 9.5 (A remarkable game that keeps you coming back for more. Lots of (well-done, usually not superfluous) content, excellent combat, and high marks for the plain-old \"fun\" factor.)HIGHLY recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00002CF9M","description":"InDiablo II, players return to a world of dark fantasy. As one of five distinct character types, players explore the world ofDiablo II, journey across distant lands, fight new villains, discover new treasures, and uncover ancient mysteries. Since the beginning of time, the forces of order and chaos have been engaged in an eternal struggle to decide the fate of all creation. That struggle has now come to the mortal realm, and neither man, demon, nor angel will be left unscathed. Diablo, lord of terror and youngest of the three prime evils, awakes from his long sleep beneath the dark earth. Setting in motion a grand scheme to free his exiled brothers, Mephisto and Baal, Diablo takes control of the small western kingdom of Khanduras. Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo grips the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia. Ultimately, as even Khanduras's good King Leoric falls under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arises to challenge the darkness that engulfs the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronts the lord of terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit can never be truly destroyed, the hero makes the noblest sacrifice of all--casting his soul and his very sanity aside, he takes the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will can contain the demon within. The hero doesn't realize that his selfless act will not only ensure Diablo's victory, but will also irrevocably damn his soul for all time.","reviewerName":"M.

Take your typical grind-house movie, throw in a House of the Dead vibe, and some tunes that Quentin T. wished he could have used on Pulp Fiction (here and there anyway!) and you've got the makings of a laugh-out loud funny game.I was wondering how far the TV-MA rating would be taken.  Rest assured, SEGA leaves no room for doubt...the profanity in the game (rumor has it that it made Guinness for the most profane game ever), the violence, and the somewhat near \"was that what I think I saw\" Janet Jackson moment definitely does NOT make this a game for the family.  It's fun for me, though, when I would like to unwind after a hard day at work and want to do something else besides play Super Mario Galaxy with my 6-year old daughter.The banter between the straight-up well-tailored G and the foul-mouthed Detective Washington (who sounds like a dead-on Samuel L. Jackson impersonator) is great.  G has his foul moments as well which makes it even funnier.  The scene with the ice cream truck cracked me up beyond belief where G and Washington are debating music choices.Another fun moment is when Agent G and Washington find themselves on a little kiddie amusement park ride that moves around like Disney's Snow White through a haunted house...Washington blurts out )after G admits that he's a little scared to be on the ride), \"Are you holding my hand?!?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Let go of me (string of expletives).\"The gameplay is great although the frame rate does take a hit here and there if you've got loads of zombies and rapid gunfire.  That said, the simulated film scratches and pops actually add to the feel that you're watching a real 35mm movie that occasionally jumps, so it actually adds to the mouth-popping popcorn experience to the whole game.  The environment is pretty well done and the variety of gore does take into account where you're hitting the zombies.Who ever would have guessed that an on-rail shooter game would be this much fun?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2009"}

The first I liked was the marked improvement of the detail of the zombies and the effects,  and the soundtrack was also a great plus for the new release.  The second was the 70's campy satire of the storyline which gave it a little humorous ping to all the zombie killing,  the sarcastic lines they have going between the two characters Agent G and Detective Washington were also a good little touch for the game and made it fun hearing them banter back and forth while you're shooting the zombies.  The one thing I truly thank them for is how they did the weapons upgrade in the game,  the game plays in chapters and after finishing the chapter you'll earn money depending on your final score and with that you can either buy new weapons or upgrade your current ones to be more powerful, faster and etc etc.  The one thing you'll not have to worry about in the game play is trying to find ammo another plus, regardless of what weapon you have you'll have unlimited ammo the only thing you'll have to do is reload and not have to spend your time looking in the area or corners for ammo boxes(Ala REUC).  The game extras are pretty cool as well but I still haven't played them all as I have unlocked the directors uncut chapters showing more game scenes in each chapter and am now playing that.

They kind of remind me of the Turtle Beach x11s for the 360, but with better sound quality.  I used them for hours straight with no discomfort.  Here is some *KEY* information:These come with the controller adapter, so you there's $25 of the value right there.A really cool thing about the adapter is that you can set the game volume to voice chat sound ratio, and then change the master volume. This makes it convenient when you have to lower your volume because unlike before, you don't have to set the correct ratio when going back up, it's already set.The headset sounds pretty good, and if you don't already have a good pair of headphones with a mic, then I suggest getting them.With that said, if you purchase the $25 adapter separately, then you can use any pair of headphones to listen to game sound.  And if they have a mic, then you can speak with them too.  I wanted to have turtle beaches dedicated to my Xbox One, so that is why I got them, but I have a pair of Sony MDR-1RBTs that I can plug into the adapter and use just as easily.  For most people, I would suggest using a pair of headphones with a mic that they already have, with the adapter.  For anyone without a headset, absolutely get these.For a comparison with the XO Sevens, read on.The XO Sevens are nice.  They sound great as well.  There's one issue with them, however, that got me to return them to Gamestop.  The XO Sevens are just too heavy and the material is not breathable. They get irritating after long use and the weight does not help.  They do sound superb though, so if you don't mind slight discomfort after extended use, and you don't mind the price, then go with those.  Otherwise, the XO Fours are your best bet.

The sequel deals with Alice's Madness as she attempts to solve a mystery.Story: 9/10A mysterious fire started, burning her house to the ground and incinerating her family.  Alice was framed for the crime and it doesn't help that she can't remember what happened either.  As Alice slips into madness, Wonderland slips into corruption.  Alice must battle her way through Wonderland as she finds memories which will uncover the truth!  The story is really well done and this would have made a great book, movie, anime, graphic novel, etc... Unfortunately, this story drives a lackluster game.Graphics: 6/10Alice looks great and the concepts behind each of the levels:  Steam Punk, Japan, Storybook, Queen of Hearts, etc... are very interesting.  But the execution is pretty weak.  The game looks like it's 5 years old.  The levels are low polygon-low res textures.  The lighting and camera are also pretty bad, too.  As I was playing through the game, a mystery began to form in my own mind.  Why does this game look so bad?Gameplay: 6/1012 hours of Platform Jumping, 3 hours of basic combat, 1 hour of really bad puzzles.  This is mostly a platformer where Alice can triple jump and glide.  It's fairly easy and if you do miss a platform, they start you where you last touched solid ground.  Unfortunately, the camera is not always your friend and you have to struggle to get it pointed in the right direction.  The Combat is easy and straightforward.  Hit or shoot enemies.  Some enemies must be hit first, some must be shot first.  When you kill them, they drop teeth and health.  The teeth are used to upgrade the weapons.  But there are no jumping attacks and aside from YYY or XXX, there aren't any combos.  The mini-games are just plain bad.  Slider Puzzles with the same solution and sometimes the same image across puzzles.  A pinball game with awful physics.  etc...  The gameplay is so bad, I'm surprised 3DO didn't publish it...  I started asking myself, why is this game so bad?Sound:  7/10The Voice Acting is OK.  The music is well done and highlights the combat and creepy atmosphere.

It's more like Silent Hill than Crash Bandicoot.Overall: 6.5/10When I finished the game and saw the ending credits, my mystery was solved.  Nearly everyone was Chinese.  So, EA took this Alice Madness Concept and farmed it out to a cheap rookie development house in China.  This is why everything looks blah, and the gameplay is clunky.

In his dreams, happenstance encounters with a young girl facing a terrible destiny and the boy who will fight to save her, leads to Chopin's discovery of the light that shines in each of us in this enduring tale of good and evil, love and betrayal. With gorgeous next gen visuals and style, a unique battle system, and a captivating story, Eternal Sonata promises to give Xbox 360 fans the RPG they've been waiting for.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Eternal Bliss","reviewText":"There aren't a lot of JRPGs on the XBOX360 and what ones there are aren't as special as promised.  Eternal Sonata is a different story.  It's a grand game that hits all the right notes.  It has a few minor issues, but nothing that keeps it from being fantastic.Fredric Chopin is terribly sick and dying.  As he lies unconscious in bed he has a dream where he is in a world unlike any other.  In this world, those who are sick with incurable diseases can use magic, but is it really a dream?  Or is it another reality?  This world has its own problems, however, the people are being taxed and a man named Count Waltz is slowly enslaving everyone.  It doesn't sound like much, but the story is surprisingly deep and is full of several themes.  There are also many music references throughout the game.  From the characters who have names like Allegretto, Polka and Beat.  To some of the places you'll be going like the Chrous Plains.The story is told through cutscenes voiced by the characters.  The voice acting isn't the best in the world.  They've got the right voices for the job, but a lot of the actual voice acting is dry.  Luckily, if the English voice overs are annoying you, you have the option to switch the voices to Japanese.  The story jumps between Chopin's life and the dream world which the gameplay centers in.  Also, throughout the game, you'll get to learn a little about the real Chopin.  The game gives you some historical accounts and during these moments will play his beautiful music.  This is all great, but sometimes these historical segments come up at inappropriate times.  The good news about these historical segments is that they do relate to the overall story.  Also, as good as the story is, it's rather slow to start.  On the bright side, the cast of characters are really likeable.The game isn't all that different from your traditional JRPG.  There's a field mode and a battle mode.  Outside of battle you'll run around on the field gathering treasure and talking to denizens.  Battles are contact based which means you can easily avoid battles you don't want to bother with.  Battling in Eternal Sonata is quite fun, though.The battle system is perhaps one of the most inventive battle systems in the genre.  Your characters and enemies have what's called an \"action\" gauge.  When a character takes his or her turn in battle they'll have what's called an \"action gauge\" on the left hand side of the screen which will count down.  Within the allotted time, you can pretty much do anything you want.  Either attack normally, use items or special attacks.  You'll have to plan well, though.  It's a simple battle system to grasp, but it's hard to master.  This is because the battle system never stays entirely the same throughout the journey.  You have what's called party levels, and the higher your party level the more difficult battles will be.  For example, at Party level 1 the action gauge decreases only when you move, and stops decreasing when you stop.  When you hit party level 2, however, the action gauge never stops.  Just when you're positive you've mastered the battle system, it throws another twist at you, via the party level.The battle system works well because it relies not only on real time, but strategy as well.  Special moves are an important part of combat.  There's no limit to how often you can use them, but even here there's a twist.  Your party has what's called echoes.  The more hits you score in battle the more echoes you get.  These will increase the power of your special attacks and are shared by the whole party.  While it's tempting to end every combo with a special attack, it's even better to save them until you've acquired enough echoes.  Just the same, Eternal Sonata will give you quite a challenge, especially in the boss battles.  You can also block your enemies attacks by pressing B at the right time.  This doesn't mean you can just mash on the B button when the enemy attacks as your character will guard prematurely and take the full extent of the damage.  These timed presses take a long time to master.Another really big aspect of the games battle system is the use of light and dark.  Special attacks change based on whether or not you are standing in light or in shade.  That's not all light and shade have an impact on.  Some enemies change form depending on where they are.  Some enemies will also throw you for a loop because they can provide their own light.  The game is very touchy on this as even standing in the enemies shadow will cause you to use a dark special attack instead of a light one.  It's pretty amazing stuff.The only major issue with Eternal Sonata is that there simply isn't much to the game.  There's a sidequest where you can collect and play musical pieces, but for the most part, it's quite linear.  There's no overworld map either, so there's not much of a chance to really explore anything throughout the game.  Another big issue with exploring the environments is that the camera is at a fixed angle and you can't shift or rotate it.  In some moments when you're traversing behind scenery, it'd be nice to be able to shift the camera to see what was in front of you.Another smaller issue involves the story itself.  While it is good, there are moments when it rambles and even (to a certain extent) preaches to you.  A lot of the cutscenes are long, but that shouldn't be much of a problem.  You can skip them.Those issues aside, the game is absolutely gorgeous looking.  It's not the greatest looking game on the system, but it's beautiful and artistic nonetheless.  This is one of the most beautiful looking cel-shaded games out there.  It also doesn't suffer from terrible load times or framerate issues.  The best part about Eternal Sonata is its beautiful music soundtrack, which sounds nothing short of fantastic.  It's absolutely remarkable.  The fact that they also play some of Chopin's music is also really nice.Eternal Sonata is easily the best JRPG available on the XBOX360 at the moment.  It has a surprisingly deep story and is a burst of creative energy.  All minor problems aside, it's an enjoyable game.Pros:+Surprisingly deep story+Very well defined characters+Some historical background on Chopin's life+Very inventive battle system+A good challenge, and the game only keeps getting harder as you go+Very gorgeous game+Remarkable soundtrack, some of Chopin's actual music is also usedCons:-Very linear-Historical moments sometimes show up at inappropriate times-Slow story-Bad voice acting-There are moments when the game is just all out preachy","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2007"}

Bullet time was my old time favorite, and going through some of Max's darkest dreams was always a riddle on its own...Now Max Payne 3 is here..we find an older Max, boozed and high on pills, the same old demons inside his head...His old self in a brand new game...Max Payne 3 will take you for a wild ride from the minute you start until the very end. I started playing the game last night at midnight and haven't been able to put it down until now; a solid single player will keep you on your toes and the various multiplayer options will keep you occupied for many hours to come.The story begins with Max finding himself working in Brazil for a private security company looking after a real state big shot, whom puts Max in charge of his wife's security..of course, she is kidnapped..and that's as far as I will go...NO SPOILERS here. The main story is great, it will keep you intrigued from start to end, I can't go into much detail, but I can promise you this, it is a wild ride. You will be taken from Brazil to the US and back. The story will unfold in ways you won't expect and I guarantee you will like every bit of it, I can't say more without spoiling it, so I'll stop with one phrase, get ready, this is the best Payne so far. An explosive end awaits you.The game looks amazing, from face animation to environments, everything has been done with extreme detail and it truly paid off for Rock Star, this is an A++ game. From shadows, to night lights, to gun battles, you will have plenty of eye candy to enjoy; it is a gorgeous game.If you have a surround sound system, get ready to get your face melted; the deep bass and sharp bullets sounds make this an experience like no other. The voice work is top notch filled with plenty of faul language and taunts, it's the old payne we knew from before. One of my favorite aspects of the game, sound wise, is the background music, a bit slow mo samba, with a twist of drama, keeps the atmosphere in suspense, the music caliber of hollywood big budgets; the voice work, specially from the locals, is dead on, Portuguese is spoken and NOT translated,  giving the game a true authenticity the reflects what you would feel in that situation when you find yourself in a foreign land not knowing the language and its slangs. A true masterpiece.I'm happy to report that the controls are solid, I had no issues popping fools left and right and best of all, BULLET TIME is back! oh yeah, fans of the series will be pleased and new comers will know what's all about. Bullet time gives Max the ability to slow down battle time and shoot your way out of tricky situations. You basically have a Bullet Time meter that gets used every time, but can be filled by killing enemies or when you're getting shot at. The covering systems is as good as always, but this time be careful, some cover can be destroyed and will leave you out in the open, so be prepared to move quickly. Rockstar added a \"Final Kill Camera\" which basically will let you know that you've cleared and area, you can slow the camera down for a more intense view :)The game is rated \"M\" for mature and for good reason, there's plenty of booze, pills and sexual themes to go abound, so make sure under age kids don't play this. Max has to actually take pain killers as means to recover health (like good old times)Targetting is has three stages, Hard Lock, which will lock whatever enemey is closer to you; Soft Lock, requires you to aim closer to targets and OFF, which basically turns targetting assistance off.Enemy AI, I was worried at first, but again, RockStar has pulled it off, there's nothing dumb about those fools. They will take cover and try their best to make you bleed.Multiplayer: The multiplayer aspect of this game is fun and addictive and it has the following modes and sub-modes:Matchmaking: Join or creat your own party/game.PlayLists:Traning modes...deathmatch and team deathmatch for players new to the whole Max Payne MP experience (basically all of us)DeathMatch: every gangster for himselfTeam DeathMatch: Work with your gang to kill your rivalsPayne Killer: a blend of co-op and competetive play. The game starts with a standoff, whoever kills first, gets to be Max Payne and Raul Passos.Large DeathMatch: up to 16 players killing each other.Large Team DeathMatch: same as above, but in teams.Gang Wars (my favorite:Key events from the single player story are used as start off points. Gang Wars has the following:Warfare... all out battle for supremacyShowdown... battle to the death, the gang's strength depends on the previous roundsSurvivor....limited team livesLast Stand... each gang member has only ONE life.TakeDown... a target based mode. Take out the target and kill everybody else.Short Fuse... arm a bomb and protect the one doing it.Delivery...both gangs must collect and deliver items to a locationGrab....gangs fight to capture two bags and delivery themTurf Grab....battle for turfTotal Turf...fight for multiple turf sectionsSiege...pinned, one gang must hold on to 3 territories.Passage... one gang runs for their life while being hunted by the other (one of my favorites)If you want sex, alcohol, drugs, psycho episodes and plenty of blood, then Max Payne 3 is for you; a complete game by all means. Great story, awesome mechanics, gore and Bullet Time...Max is defenitely back.So there you have it, another solid game from the dudes at Rock Star, these guys have been in business for a long time and they always deliver. Kudos to them.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00001IVRD","description":"This package includes bothStarcraftandStarcraft: Brood Warsplus Prima Publishing's Official Strategy Guides, which offer you strategies, statistics, and details about new worlds to give you the upper hand in gaining control over the galaxy's resources.","reviewerName":"Mark Hills \"Nobody gets me, I'm the wind, baby!\"","summary":"The Best 2D Real Time Strategy Game Out There","reviewText":"Blizzard is one of those companies which toil away quietly only to release masterpiece after masterpiece. Real time strategy wasn't invented by Blizzard, instead they looked at what others had done and made  improvements, the end result was Warcraft, which was followed by the hugely  successful Starcraft in 1997, then the follow-up Brood War in 1998. They  have been assembled here in something called a Battlechest, which is  actually just a bigger box, but Battlechest sounds better. They also  include the strategy guides for both games, making it an excellent value  for the money given how routinely over priced strategy guides are.Starcraft gives the player command of 3 races: The Terrans, who are allied  in a sort of Confederacy and boils down to red necks in space; the Zerg, a  race of xenomorphs created by an ancient race known as the Xel-Naga. The  Zerg are the ultimate predator and hyper-evolutionary beings; finally we  have the Protoss, a race of psionic and technological masters, but were  also created by the Xel-Naga. Each race has 10 missions that the player  must complete, enabling them to `win' as each race while a larger story  unfolds.The Zerg are spreading across the galaxy trying to find the  next stage of their evolution, in this case it's the humans whom they plan  to absorb in order to gain psionics. The Protoss, aware of the Zerg  Overmind and his plans to infest the human colonies, dispatch one of the  greatest warrior templars-Tassadar, to deal with the threat. But when he  discovers that the humans have potential, he refuses to incinerate the  infested planets. The Terrans meanwhile are in the midst of the revolution  as Governor Mensk intends on becoming Emperor Mensk by leading a renegade  faction of humans known as the Sons Of Korhol. The game also introduces a  host of unforgettable characters like Tassadar, Fenix, James Raynor, and  Sarah Kerrigan.While graphics may begin to appear a little dated,  they are well detailed and colorful even though the game does not have any  3D support. What this also means is that they game will run on slower  machines like Pentium 90s. It has both Internet and Network support, and  both Starcraft and Broodwar include a native campaign editor that enables  creative players to design their own missions to share with friends. Both  the sound and the music are first rate, with one of the more enjoyable  aspects of the game being the different one-liners delivered by the  different characters and vehicles whenever you click on them multiple  times. Especially good are the standard Terran Marine, the Science Vessel,  and the Dropship.Game play, however, is second to none in the RTS  arena. All three of the races are exceptionally well balanced between each  other, though the humans are by far the most versatile and solid. The Zerg  regenerate damage and can be `built' quickly, but aren't as tough as the  humans so they make up for it in greater numbers. The Protoss are the  toughest of the three races, but their units also take the longest to build  and cannot be repaired if damaged. And one of the more fun aspects of  Broodwar is using Prostoss Dark Templars to mind control enemy units, such  as the Terran SCV or Zerg Gatherer, with it you can then build and control  all of the Terran or Zerg units as well.Starcraft delivers it all:  Terrific story, unsurpassed game play, great and often funny CG full motion  video, and replayability. No two missions are alike, and range from  capture, search and destroy, to all out warfare that will take hours to  complete. End missions are inhumanly tough, forcing the player to really  think about what units he should build and how he should use them. The game  rewards success with more missions, especially considering that between the  two, there are well over one hundred multi-player maps contained on the  disks as well. However, as with all internet multi-player games, beware of  dirty filthy stinking rotten cheaters.Straight up, this is the best  game within its class, outmatching even Command &amp; Conquer who really  created the genre in the first place. Starcraft's sense of humor, epic  story and scale, coupled with Blizzard's uncompromising production values  make for a truly memorable game, one that delivers hours of play in a well  thought out universe. This game is pure fun!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2000"}

{"product_name":"B003O6G5TW","description":"","reviewerName":"A. J. Herring \"Daemon\"","summary":"Laden with Problems.","reviewText":"I love the Battlefield series. I've been playing it since at least the 1942 version about 10 years ago. I really enjoy the Bad Company series for its twisted humor.Unfortunately, this game fell flat. I'll preface a little bit. I haven't even played the multiplayer yet. I play the single-player campaign in every game before I move on to the multiplayer. I always put it on the hardest level possible to get some kind of a challenge out of these type of games.Graphics - The game has some beautiful graphics in some areas. The cut scenes are well-rendered. The general game play is not. Some of it feels poorly done. The guns look awkward.Gameplay - The gameplay is terrible. I'll have a clear shot from behind a friendly and it will tell me I shot him. This has happened on multiple occasions. I will have a clear shot through an open part of a barricade and I won't hit anything. I will silently take down an enemy and the entire Iranian PLR will be down on me in a matter of seconds.On Uprising I was actually being shot through large, metal dumpsters. I could see the streaks from the bullets and my screen turning red even though I was completely in cover.Enemies will appear out of nowhere. In the middle of the street. Did someone honestly think that was a good idea?Additionally, you will face an endless horde of enemies in certain situations. You will be asked to push against MG nests only to find that there is a single spot that is sending out two enemies at time and they refresh every time you shoot one of them--immediately.Finally, you are expected to conform to routes and \"plot triggers\" or you will just die. Storming the MG nest I previously mentioned you can sit there and shoot the guys in the head over and over until this one character comes up, fires a few shots, gets laid to waste, and then another trooper yells \"Throw a nade!\" and they take out the nest for you. This is just one of many retarded examples.Story - Possibly one part that is okay. The approach they have is a bit played out with the whole 'let's break up time and piece it all together into one larger story.' It can't just be linear anymore. They have to see if they be as much like Call of Duty as possible.Some of the triggers are just completely lame. You will also notice that the game will work right the first time through, but if you die for some reason and reload at the last checkpoint the game will stagger a bit and things won't play out like they did before.It was meant to be the competition for Modern Warfare 3 this year. I've just recently beat Call of Duty: MW3 and I can honestly say there is no competition. I've found myself turning this game off twice since I started it. The only reason I turned MW3 off was to go to bed.I'm not sure that I look forward to any more Battlefield games. That is very heartbreaking to me. If you're looking for a great alternative to MW3, then don't look at this game.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2012"}

Cloaked in stealth, you will move unseen through crowds, travel stories above the peasant herds on which you feed--leaping from rooftop to rooftop--and use mind control to overcome vampire-proof inventions. The combat choreography unfolds with dancelike precision as Kain engages armies of demons and humans alike. The comprehensive menu of unstoppable attacks, nimble combos, and special moves are designed to appeal to even the most jaded of fighting-game fans. The world that Kain moves through is a lushly detailed gothic environment that is not only gorgeous to the eye, but also alive with the soon-to-be-dead.

Here, you once again take up the mantle of vampire dominance, playing as their leader Kain. Kain has been laid low by a mysterious being called the Sarafan lord, who has revived the vampires ancient enemy and is beginning the purges anew. As Kain, you must regain your former glory and defeat the Sarafan lord, retrieving your dark blade, the Soul Reaver, in the process. The voice acting is good (as usual), and the gothic environs really mesh well with the dark tone of the game. However, as is the case with Soul Reaver 2, the game is a bit too short. I wish that Eidos would flesh out the world of Nosgoth a bit, and not merely add to the mythos surrounding Kain...Oh, and for the fool below, Soul Reaver 2 WAS a cliffhanger, and playing all of the games from the beginning doesn't change this fact. However, Blood Omen 2 does answer one of the questions we are left to ponder at the end of SR2: the identity of the mysterious Hylden, whom Kain seems to fear at the end of SR2. However, could someone tell me why Vorador is still alive in BO2? Don't give me some stupid reason, either; I HAVE played all of the games...Anyway, back to the game, I think it deserves a purchase (it is fun to play again), but I am still disappointed with the brevity of the quest.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2002"}

I had such high hopes in the beginning.  It was as good as all the reviews said, reasonable graphics, good controls, fun weapons, OK story, and even though the terrain damage is only a gimmick (and one quickly forgotten) it was nice to see from time to time.  A fun game.  It also has great configuration options, letting you remap buttons and play with either normal or inverted y-axis; this is a deal breaker in a game as far as I'm concerned.  I cannot play a game where up moves you down and down moves you up.And then, the mercenaries come and the rail gun manages to nearly ruin the game.  Whoever decided to add it is almost wholly responsible for turning the last half of the game into nothing more than a frustrating series of saves and loads.Allow me to explain.  See the rail gun sounds like a great idea.  It can kill in one shot and it has an infrared scope that allows you to see enemies through doors, thin walls, etc.  Seems like a great cheap weapon to give people so if the game gets too tough they can rely on that crutch.  However, the problem is that the mercenaries can use them too.  They will wait behind things and blast you because you have to move forward.  More than one of them will sometimes have this gun at the same time.  They will sit there and kill you instantly, forcing you to reload just to get a crack at them again.  The *only* way to get past some of these scenarios is *if* the mercenary misses!  Because of where I saved, I had to play one segment ten times and 8 of those were due to impossible to avoid rail gun hits.  That's just unacceptable; I hate cheap deaths.While the first part of the game is truly great, the second half of this game has you spending 30 seconds saving your game after every minor battle and then watching the reload screen for 30 seconds after you periodically die an unavoidable death.  If you can't put up with this scenario, avoid this game.  Otherwise, it really is a decent title.  Without the rail gun, the game is easily a 4 or maybe 5 star.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0071NH8B8","description":"","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Top-Drawer Tech Titan","reviewText":"The PS Vita is a fantastic handheld:  Sony has a tendency to always go hi-tech and all out when they release new hardware, and the Vita is no different.  This particular console adds the ability to connect to mobile 3G networks using a SIM card (sold separately!).  I'll be honest with you:  with as much Wi-Fi as there is around me, and as much hassle as I get when it comes to trying to manage a mobile data plan, I'll probably never use the 3G feature:  mine came as part of a bundle, with discount, that included an 8GB card I would otherwise have bought separately, so it made better economic sense.  Whether you're dying for 3G or could care less, it makes sense to shop around Amazon for the various bundle deals:  like me, you may find one that suits you.  The rest of the PS Vita is as cutting-edge now as the PSP was when it was released.So what makes a PS Vita so special?CONTROLSEvery piece of the Vita has something to do with interaction:  you not only have dual sticks, shoulder buttons, a D-Pad, the familiar four-button layout and Start/Select/Home, you also have really smooth gyroscopic and accelerometric sensors that let you tip, tilt, and roll the unit to play some games.  The generous front screen is also a touch-screen with slick responsiveness that makes my smartphone jealous.  The back has touch sensors that aren't just for fingertips--Uncharted:  Golden Abyss has a jaw-dropping interactive moment where you hold the back of the PS Vita up to the light to 'read' a faded piece of parchment.  Last, there are digital cameras on both the front and back for taking pictures and video.  All of this can be saved to a memory stick, but the downside is that Sony has changed formats on us again:  old Memory sticks are NOT compatible with the Vita.  The newer storage system is proprietary to the PS Vita.SCREENThe screen is bigger than the PSP and about the same size as the top screen of the super-sized Nintendo 3DS XL.  While it is as sensitive to direct sunlight as your average laptop, it does boast a bright screen in just about any other lighting condition.  Just like the PSP and PS3, there is a menu bar that lets you customize all sorts of settings including brightness and power-saving modes.  Touching the front screen is very smooth, with complicated gestures easily translated by games.FEATURESIn addition to gameplay, the PS Vita offers the same kinds of multimedia features as the PSP:  music and video streaming, including Netflix (which works very well over Wi-Fi).  There is a feature called \"Near\" that will tell you what friends near to you might be playing, or let you look for a new friend nearby with the same game interests.  GPS is also built in as part of the unit and you can use it to navigate if you wish.  I haven't really used this or the 'LiveArea' that lets you share your gaming details with other people, or the IM feature that lets you message people.  I've been more inclined to use my PlayStation Network / PlayStation Store account to pull down games, including my PSP and PSOne favorites, and play them on a larger, brighter screen.One of the neat things about the interface is the 'peel off' way it's organized:  the home screen has round 'bubble' icons that you can tap to access an application.  Each application has a base page that organizes the basic things you might do, such as 'read the manual', 'check for updates', or the most-often-used, 'launch the game' and its corner sticks up like a curled piece of paper.  If you're in-game and press the home button, the game is suspended and you're dropped back to this screen.  Closing the home screen is as simple as using your finger to peel that corner down, like turning the page of a book:  the application is closed and you are back at the 'bubble' icon home screen.  The PS Vita has a built-in browser, and mostly I use it for accessing features off the base page, such as 'Help' or 'Support'.The way accessories are designed now follows the 'USB cable' design:  your PS Vita will have a charger plug, a tiny power box it plugs into, and from there a USB cable leads from the charger to the PS Vita.  The connector on the Vita is also proprietary, and that means that whether you're using an AC adapter, a car charger, or just connecting to a computer, you can't do it without that proprietary connector-to-USB cable.If there's a drawback to the PS Vita, it's that the high price sticker reminds us that this isn't a kids' console.  The unit is large and unwieldy.  It feels fragile and because it's expensive one of the first things you'll want to do is pick up a good protective case for it.  You won't be able to stick it in the average pocket and you'll definitely not want to leave expensive hardware like this lying around or it'll grow legs.  If you have the money though you won't be disappointed in this hi-tech handheld:  it is top-drawer gaming technology at its best.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0094MYU4M","description":"","reviewerName":"Dat Hong","summary":"Some Hissing, Not Loud Enough","reviewText":"I really wanted to like this headset.  It comes incredibly well packaged, looks and feels great.  It is a corded headset and works with almost any device you can think of.  I tested this out with my PS3 to play Black Ops 2 Zombies/Multi-Player, Tomb Raider, and watched some movies on Netflix.The headset is corded and it comes with a magnitude of wires for about every device.  For the PS3, I had to connect the usb and the optical cord.  The cord is more than long enough, and comes with extenders if you need it.  When playing on the PS3, the sound came out very clear.  I could hear the footsteps in Black Ops and it helped me figure out which direction people were coming from.  I could hear the wind and stuff crashing like it was all around me in Tomb Raider.  It also canceled out all the noise around me.However, I could also hear some hissing at times.  No matter what I did, I could not get the annoying hissing to go away.  I doubled checked all my connections and re-read the instructions in the manual and so far I do not see any user error.  The sound was also loud, but not \"blow out your ear drums\" loud.  The Sony Pulse headsets get REALLY loud compared to these.The mic was fantastic though, and my friends on the other side said it was the clearest chat ever.  They claimed they could not hear any background noise, and my voice came out loud and clear on the PS3.When watching movies on Netflix, I did not get the annoying hiss, but I was annoyed I couldn't get the volume louder.  It just seemed too quiet for me.  It was not convenient to watch movies in bed since it is corded.The headset also comes with a module that allows you to program and choose quite a few different settings.  It is very touch sensitive and I found myself hitting the settings by accident once in awhile when I was moving around.  You can attach it to your belt or pants.It does not have bluetooth capability and has to be plugged in to use.  The plates are also interchangeable so if you want a different design, you can purchase one.I give the headset an OK rating.  It feels and looks great, and the construction is top notch.  If it was a bit louder, and I could get rid of the hissing, I would give it a higher rating.  For now, this is a pass for me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000P297E8","reviewerName":"FicktionPhotography","summary":"Combat Heaven","reviewText":"What we have here is a bunch of characters that seem to believe they are better than all that and seem to want to show it.  Though the arrogance in the past DMCs had been oftentimes intolerable at least they were funny.  This just seems like the characters are so mightier than thou that they got lost on what humor actually is.  Dante is even insufferable at times.  But, let's not hold that against the entire game.To start off this is definitely not like the older games where your hands fall off from smashing buttons and attempting to do ridiculous combos without pause throughout the duration of the game. Speaking of the combos, they last about three hours apiece so if you like theatrics then this game is for you.On the subject of how this game is so much different from the others, where's Dante?!  We want to play as Dante!  Nero might be a close resemblance to Dante, but he whines too much and is certainly NOT Dante.  Even though Dante's arrogance is as acceptable as a knee to the groin, I would prefer it over Nero's constant blabbering and complaining.  More importantly, I'm not exactly pleased with the story of chasing after a girl.  Whereas the previous games have been about fighting against evil with a sidekick that happened to be female, this game has our white-haired heart-throb (no, not Dante, Nero...I know they look strikingly alike) is chasing AFTER a girl who happens to get caught up in the demonic world.  It just doesn't seem very DMC'ish.However, the combat is fun because of the style that Capcom introduces on a far larger level than any of the DMCs beforehand.  As stated earlier, if you have a penchant for the \"cool\" and \"exciting\" things you can do with a gun and a sword then this game is for you.  And if you don't have a penchant for it, perhaps you shouldn't be playing video games.Another problem I have with the game is that I can't stand the timed puzzles with fixed cameras that have you falling down into an abyss where you have to fight the same group of enemies twenty thousand times.  It's infuriating, but at least it gives you some kind of satisfaction when you make it to the other side.  However, the puzzles where you're smacking a dice across the room?  Not exactly my cup of tea.Halfway through the game you have to do the previous levels in reverse which makes me think that Capcom got bored with designing new levels and thought it a smashing idea to just have everything backwards.  It harks on the design of Nero being strikingly similar to Dante.  Instead of making a new character it seems just a rehash of a more prepubescent Dante.  So, we have duplicates of everything.  Why?  Why couldn't you just create new levels, Capcom?  Makes me believe there's a laziness factor occurring.My concern is that they are trying to play this off as a girl and guy game.  Both sexes can play it.  That's all well and good, but I could very easily play the first three and I'm a girl.  It's turning into a fanfiction of the previous games which spins off into the realm of depending on combat style to support the game.  Though the combat style, as said, is good, it's not worth buying the game for.  That is, unless, you're like me and are a fan of the series.Let's just hope that it doesn't continue down this track, which I'm afraid it might.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2011"}

Not to say it doesn't have good games, it does, just not ones that I like. Enter Soul Sacrifice. This game IS worth having a Vita for. It's probably the best \"AAA\" Vita title there is to date and it's well deserved. The graphics are fantastic, gameplay is smooth, and it's co op so you can play with your friends.Essentially the idea of the game(gameplay wise, not story wise) is you go on quests in areas to slay huge, ugly, dark monsters. You can do this with friends, alone, or with in game companions. Upon completing these quests you get better spells to use, which can also be combined with your current spells to make more powerfull spells. The more spells you get, the harder monsters you can take on.The sacrifice mechanic is very unique. When you kill any type of monster whether it be a boss or just a mob, you can either save it or sacrifice it. Saving something gives you life points while sacrificing gives you magic points. Saving things often will grant you extra health and healing capabilities, but you do less damage. Sacrificing things will allow you to do significantly more damage with your spells, but stay at the base amount of health. It's a trade off the entire game. Also whether or not you save or sacrifice will affect how your character looks later in the game. If you're mean and sacrifice things a lot, you'll start to look evil and dark. If you save things you'll eventually look divine and beautiful.Overall this game is a MUST BUY for Vita owners. You won't be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2013"}

Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course.

Many available cars, lots of tracks, hours of fun.  There are a couple of noticable flaws, though, in this edition.  First, there's only 1 BMW in the game.  Yeah, 1.  I, as well as many other GT fans, were hoping for more BMWs than in GT2, especially the addition of the M5, new M3, and M roadster for purchase and the original M (from 1979) as a car to win.  The second problem is the amount of time it can take to get anywhere in this version.  With less of a used car system than in GT2, you are stuck buying less to begin with and it takes even longer to get a car that will win you some races and some money.  While it could be said that this extends the game, it's really more of an annoyance.

Despite some lofty promises that it doesn't fully deliver, Gun is the best western video game to come out in years (and certainly better than Red Dead Revolver) and features some of the grittiest and grisliest action you'll encounter in a video game that doesn't come from Rockstar.  You play as Colton White; a tough hombre who's looking to avenge the death of his father.  Throughout the game's story, you'll meet a deranged preacher, a kindly prostitute, an insane Civil War veteran, and the railroad mogul behind the devious plot.  In between all that, you'll be able to go on side missions, ranging from playing Texas Hold 'Em poker to earn some cash to picking up bounties and acting as a law man to max out your stats.  You'll fight Apaches, thugs, and killers along the way as well, but the main problem with Gun is that it's too short.  Side missions and all, it won't take you long to beat the game, which is a big disappointment.  Not to mention that the gameplay elements can appear really linear at times, throwing out the notion that Gun could be GTA with a horse.  The storyline is entertaining enough, but the violence and language can be a little too over the top at times.  Despite all that, Gun is still a great game thanks to the atmosphere, excellent music, solid graphics (mostly), and the great team of voice actors which include Tom Jane as Colton, along with Lance Henriksen, Brad Dourif, Ron \"Hellboy\" Perlman, Tom Skeritt, and Kris Kristofferson as well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2006"}

The innovative part about the game is it's fighting system.

Other fun parts of the game are the bow system which I enjoyed sniping enemies down, riding a horse around, and changing my armor and weapons as I play along.

I liked my 360, even though I was afraid it would break (again), but it was never pretty to look at or pleasant to hear.  I didn't realize what a difference a slightly smaller (and much less obtrusive black) case would make, nor did I appreciate how much I'd like a quieter 360, but I do.  I can't stress enough how much better the new system is in those regards, nor can I express what a difference HDMI makes over component/optical.  It's really night and day, and I love my new 360!

Normal difficulty is pretty damn tough at times. There were a couple instances even before gaining my characters special powers that I had to replay an area between 2 save points as many as a dozen times, i consider myself pretty good at shooters, (and even then barely squeeking by with a couple points of health left). However unlike the comment by another reviewer save points are not unfrequent, once you figure out an area they can be reached fairly quickly.In short if you like a challenge and enjoy shooters that require more then just button smashing I would highly recommend Farcry.

{"product_name":"B003O6HDHA","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Not bad","reviewText":"I knew I would end up playing this despite mixed reactions on it's release, as I have played all the other Silent Hill games...and for the record I still think the first is the best. This one...well, it uses the formula correctly, but it spends too much time rambling and doesn't really gel as a full member of the series.So, in \"Downpour\" we play as Murphy Pendleton, a prison inmate who survives a bus crash in the middle of nowhere only to find himself lost in...Silent Hill! The game plays out fairly predictably, as Murphy makes his way through one weird location after another, trying to find any way to get out of the town. As in all episodes of the series, there are large \"chapters\" set in self contained areas, and (thank god) I can say that there is, finally, no hospital this time! Instead, Murphy is ensconced inside a monastery/orphanage, a tourist trap complete with cable car, a hall of records, an apartment block and so on. There are also some smaller self contained environments such as a bank, a cinema, and a couple of individual houses that are actually totally optional to explore, and come in the form of sidequests, which I think is a first for the series, and which I found very enjoyable to complete, although at some points some of the objectives required to \"solve\" these mini games were so obscure I got frustrated very often. You need to keep your brain switched on to get through some parts of this game.Having said that, for the most part the game is quite easy. There's plenty of health around and weapons come in the form of anything you can pick up, including an array of spades, axes and hammers if you're lucky, or chairs, sticks and rocks if you're not! Progress through the game is fairly straightforward, but it's refreshing to find that in many new areas you come to, a gigantic explorable area is available and it can be very enjoyable just to meander about and look at stuff. The scenery is great, if rather repetitive (you'll be saying the same borded up terraces of shops and interior apartments quite a few times), but the attention to detail is very good. Of course exploration also puts you at risk of meeting monsters, but there are far fewer types than in previous games, and all of them seem to be human shaped, nothing animal-shaped or that can fly ever troubles you.However I do have some negative points to bring up as well, which although were not showstoppers, did diminish the fun for me quite a lot:You can only carry one gun and/or melee weapon at a time, and if you want to use the gun you have to throw down your melee weapon. This is crazy as there are 3 types of gun in the game and numerous melee weapons, some of which are really cool. But this terrible inventory system means you can never keep hold of anything good for very long. I am sure if I was Murphy I would manage to carry a pistol in my pocket, a shotgun over my back (that's where he puts it), and an axe or knife in my hand. But no, you are not allowed to, although you can somehow carry at least 20 x healthpacks! I really didn't enjoy this one bit. Worst of all, at certain times you lose everything (it's at planned points), so all those lovely items you've been carefully hoarding get taken way from you anyway!Next, the game has technical issues. Often (especially while I was running), the camera would stutter and the screen would freeze up and judder horribley. This really happened a lot, and should have been addressed in pre-release testing. Worse still, some of the in-game activity was also affected. For me the shadow puzzle sidequest was beset with problems: artifacts placed on pedestals would vanish, leaving Murphy to twiddle what appeared to be empty space, plus the very annoying subways tunnels which I completely unlocked, later turned out to be locked again.And finally, the story itself really isn't that engaging. I knew that Murphy's crime was a bit of a mystery that would eventually be clarified, but it didn't affect the game play in any way, the whole game is just about moving from start to finish and overcoming obstacles along the way. There are some \"otherwrold\" portions, but these are few and are also quite boring, as the environments are just generic dark labyrinths. In fact during the final few stages, the game dissolves into little more than a carnival fun-house, where you have to face the most random puzzles imaginable and move from one enviroment to the next negotiating spinning blades, sudden spikes and wobbly floors that are all there for no reason other than to be in the way. By the time I reached the final boss I was just waiting for it all to be over.Still, there is ingenuity in the game and I had a lot of fun along the way. Some of the mini quests are great fun such as the \"make your own stage show\" puzzle, and the 3 old movies puzzle were all good. But that horrible inventory system made me very angry, and some of the daft deadly traps made me lose patience by the 12th retry.Worth a go if you can't get enough of the Silent Hill atmosphere, because it still has this, but it's a very weak story and a minor entry to the series.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0002CHJ8C","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"The Tekken continues...","reviewText":"Like a sleek, devastating cruise missile, Tekken 5 streaks onto the PS2 with little advance warning. Who knew that Tekken 5 would become not only a series high point, but also an early favorite for Fighting Game of the Year? Hey, if you were expecting Grand Theft Auto: Halo 2 Edition, that's your fault. Tekken 5 rocks. When Tekken 4 arrived, fans immediately frowned upon the weakened juggle combos and the emphasis on pinning opponents against walls. Tekken 5 casts off those shackles and makes a decisive return to the glory days of Tekken 3. Brian, Paul, and Nina are back to their old lethal selves, the cruel mass nerfing from Tekken 4 just a distant memory. Juggle combos again reign supreme. Wall hits are present but are no longer a constant, overpowering element. The new characters (including the Wesley Snipes look-alike Raven) and hardcore returning favorites (such as Jack-5, Wang and Anna) form a truly all-star Tekken roster. For series fans, this is all incredible news. Of course, some folks won't be satisfied by Tekken 5's incremental but much-needed, tweaks. Players who expect a completely fresh experience here are missing the point. Like Gran Turismo 4, Tekken 5 sets out to right past wrongs and make sweeping but subtle changes to the core gameplay. In these tasks, the game succeeds brilliantly. If it's okay for GT 4, why not Tekken 5? Where Tekken 4 took place in dull locales like airports and parking garages, Tekken 5 showcases some of the most beautiful, creative environments ever seen in a fighting game. One memorable example is the moonlit match set in a vast, shimmering field of dandelion tufts. The character models also look more convincing, as Namco has finally updated the character animations to create smoother, more graceful combos. Tekken 5 makes a few audio strides, too, with explosive sound effects and driving background music that is noticeably less techno-driven than prior installments. Tekken 5 is an excellent game, better than it has any right to be. But the premium bonus content (including arcade-perfect ports of the first three Tekken titles, plus a spiritual successor to Tekken Force) catapult the entire package to \"must-have\" status. If you missed out on Tekken before, this is the perfect chance to get acquainted. In the end, Tekken 5 is so energetic and refreshing that you have to wonder why Namco saddled series mainstay Nina with the cheesy adventure spin-off Death by Degrees. Judging by Tekken 5's success, the old girl can still stand on her own merits just fine, thank you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2005"}
{"product_name":"B001E8QA2E","description":"Batman: Arkham Asylum","reviewerName":"sonnojoi \"sonnojoi\"","summary":"Very nearly perfect","reviewText":"This is a great and varied game with nearly everything done superbly. It is a great Batman adventure and very true to character of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, although the plot and characters are drawn more directly from the comics. The gloomy visuals are alive and pulsing and it's definitely worth playing on decent graphics hardware. The combat is a lot of fun and varied between slugfests and predator mode where you face henchmen with guns whom you can't assault head-on but must stalk, separate and put out of commission one-by-one. Batman's code of honor, specifically his unwillingness to take a life, is a stark contrast to the maniacal butchery of the Joker and his henchmen and puts you at a severe disadvantage that you'll have to use your brains and batgear to overcome. The best part of the game is Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) as Joker's voice. He'll taunt and insult you throughout the game, then turn on his own men from time to time and mock their fear and incompetence as you pick them off while the search the shadows of the vast asylum for you. The other voice acting is all excellent as well. This game has great variety from combat to exploration to puzzle solving (a steady subplot is the Riddle feeding you clues and challenging you to solve his riddles - some of these are downright stupefying but the answers are all available online). When you're done with the game (or if you just want a break from the plot) there are awesome challenge maps where you can practice either brawling or hunting mooks.Three things I don't like about this game:1. Windows Live is annoying. I play through Steam and *still* have to sign in through Windows Live.2. The \"Press Spacebar Repeatedly\" mechanic to open vents and pull on ropes is tedious. This also features obnoxiously into the last battle.3. Withe the slight exception of tactics in any given fight (still circumscribed by your environment and enemies) and how thoroughly to pursue the Riddler's challenges, you make almost zero choices throughout the game. Although you have great freedom of movement around and over and under Arkham Island, the plot itself is as linear as can be and you don't even choose dialog options. I still enjoyed my second play through, but it was *exactly* the same game. Put another way, everything Batman does is already decided, you only determine. This isn't necessarily a flaw (the rails the game rolls along are great) but if you like to master your own character be aware that you will be playing the writers' (excellent) concept of Batman, not your own.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2011"}

The first thing you want to know - Is it a good game?  Compared to most games, yes.  It has the Bioware storytelling that brings me back time and time again.They also made some serious improvements to the game.  While I was initially disappointed that I couldn't armor up my companions, I soon learned about the special companion armor I could give them.  It does simplify things a bit when you're not lugging around tons of equipment that you plan to outfit your companions with.  I also appreciate the simplification of enchanting and potion-making.  I love the idea of finding resources and later being able to use them.  I cannot tell you how often in Oblivion I would have a pack full of crafting resources and felt like I spent most of the game trying to manage inventory.  Thanks, Bioware, for simplifying the parts of the game that didn't add to the story.The skill trees are also improved, and easier to use.I really like some of the new companions and it feels like you get to play with them more often - as there are many chances to change parties.  Fenris was an instant favorite with me and I also like Merrill, the blood mage. Their stories are compelling and they are interesting characters.Now, anyone who has played Dragon Age Origins is going to have a visceral reaction.  It is a different game, with a darker, harsher artwork style.  The character is someone new - and you don't feel as much like you are building your character as you did in Origins.  He or she already has a certain life and personality.  I believe this was intentional, similar to Mass Effect's Shephard.  There is definitely a sense of loss that you are not the Hero of Ferelden, but have to form a new relationship.  Still, it's a good thing - the Hero of Ferelden was supposed to live happily ever after, right?  And Bioware does throw in some of the last game's characters - Anders, Alistair and Leilani make an appearance, as does the elf assassin and the sexy duelist.I have two HUGE complaints with this game.  Huge. Unfortunately you see them enough that they really mar the experience of the game. The re-use of areas was a big mistake.  I know all the dungeons by heart and the maps do not match the dungeon as they use the same maps over and over, but close off doors so that you can't go down certain areas.  The areas are also rather small, you never worry that you'll be lost in a dungeon and miss something!  The advantage is that it's easy to leave, but that's not much of an advantage.  I mean, I remember the Deep Roads in DAI - you really felt like you could get lost in there and never be found.  It felt like true discovery.  As I entered the Deep Roads in DAII, I thought perhaps it would be the same feeling, but it was small, not very detailed, and I never got that joy of discovery or feeling of seeing something new.  I was incredibly disappointed by that.  For the rest of the game, it was just repeat after repeat - same dungeon, same map, same scenery, fights happening in the same area.  One cave is just like another.The second problem is that it's not grand, it's not epic.  It's a very small, tight story and you lose that epic feel. The story isn't bad, per se, but it takes a long time to get going - and even then, you're not saving the world - you're a player in a city's dramas, and a player only.  I think that this could have been a good thing, a real change from the norm for these games, BUT combined with the small scale of the world and re-use of areas?  Not good.Also, my final point, if you have a downloadable character that people pay serious Microsoft Points for, it shouldn't be bugged. Every other time I adjust the inventory for Sebastion Vael, it crashes the whole game.  Not cool.  To the point where I never use Sebastien because I never know when I'm going to lose my game.I hope that Bioware will take the feedback on this game and build Dragon Age III, utilizing the improvements in Dragon Age II, but correcting the issues. I am still a Bioware fan and will probably end up buying their next game, but I'm really hoping that they work with their strengths, roleplaying games, and remember what appeals to people who likes those games.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2011"}

But his success is owed to this pheonomenal game.  The first, although somewhat successful, did not have the commercial impact as this did.  Repeating the formula of the first Mega Man with giving you multiple stages and you chosing which one you want to tackle first and adding two bosses and dropping the score you get when beating the bosses, Capcom came up with 8 great bosses and a tremendous game.  A large part of the fun is figuring out the order in which to beat the bosses.  This also allows you to up the difficulty level if you want an extra challenge, as each of the boss's weapons work against another specific boss.  The most difficult, as I remember, was Flash Man's stage.  Those beams got me all the time.  But don't worry, you can clear all eight stages.  And once you do, going to Dr. Wiley's castle and attempting to figure out all the complexities only add to it.  Top of the line graphics, wonderful music, amazing game play, what more could you want?  This has all the markings of a bona-fide classic.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2001"}

I heard many good things about Mega Man 2 on Nintendo Power magazines and a few of my peers, but I just did'nt take the time to play it.  Unlike many 70's and 80's babies, I did'nt own a huge library of Nintendo titles because they were very expensive and my dad encouraged us to rent them before we decide if we want to own them, but I should have given this a shot back in the day.  Mega Man 2 was rented out most of the time, but I should've snagged it that one moment it was staring at my face.  I finally bought a used copy off Amazon that still plays great.Mega Man must face Dr Wily, again so he must go through 8 of his new creations and absorb each and every one of their powers to use against robots that varies in weaknesses.  The most useful weapons to use are the Metal weapon and the Quick weapon of which may be used on almost all occasions without quickly depleting your power bar.  I haven't yet completed the game, of which I intend to do, but it is a hard game and requires quick strategy, serious thinking, and moderate memorization to get through the first few of Dr. Wily's stages.  Just because a game is hard does'nt always mean that its bad.  It is one of the top 10 NES games and the gameplay/graphics/greatness more than proves it.  It was well advanced for 1988 and it still a great game to play in 2008, so its better being 20 years late than never having to play it at all.  I will plan to get Mega Man 1 and 3 in the future, but I will ignore the last 3 in the NES series.  The reason why I did'nt get the PS2 Anniversary collection is because I heard that the last 3 Mega Man games were not that great and I did'nt want to risk it with my money.  Another reason is that I like the joy of building up my NES library with good games that I did'nt get to do in the late 1980's and early 1990's.  Many popular used, but decent quality NES games are dirt cheap and are worth the investment and the thrill if you still have your NES today.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2008"}

The difference here is that this new model is quite a bit smaller than  its older brother, and quite a bit cuter, too.The system is made up of a 32-bit, 34-MHz RISC processor with 16 Mbits of main  memory, 8 Mbits of graphics memory, 24-channel stereo sound, double-speed CD-ROM  drive, and one Dual Shock analog controller. That's not a lot of power, compared  to a next-generation system like theSega  Dreamcast; but, when you factor in its very low price and the enormous  library of games that are available (more than 1,000 that are spread across  every genre imaginable), one can see easily why it's as good a deal as ever.

This gave it the ability to hold more information than a normal cartridge game ... and many games came in multiple CD packs. This equalled longer gameplay and more complexity than the N64 or Sega systems.The Playstation One is a smaller version of the same unit - portable and soon to come out with a portable LCD screen. Both play any game from the Playstation One library. While CDs do hold more data than cartridges, they load a bit more slowly, so often there is a second lag between scenes as the new scene loads into memory.While Nintendo games tend to be pixel based, most Playstation games are polygon based, taking advantage of the Playstation's 360,000 polygons/sec speed. This tends to make images sharper and scaleable. When something moves towards you it's easy to calculate polygons, compared to expanding pixels.There is a good sized library of games for the Playstation - quite a few racing games, plus the Tomb Raider series, the Final Fantasy series, Abe, Spyro the Dragon, and more. The games for the Playstation tend to be for teenagers and adults.We've had a Playstation since it first came out, and for racing and sports games it is incredible.

In Bioshock 1 I didn't really mind the basic FPS play much, because all the Ayn Rand stuff was pretty interesting, and the creepy dark environments and underwater tunnels added to a feeling of suspense.

Easily one of the best games of its  genre on any video game console, this long-awaited follow-up toGoldenEye 007is a must-have for Nintendo 64 owners--and a damn  good reason to be one if you're not.The futuristicPerfect Darkcasts players as Joanna Dark, a  secret agent who becomes embroiled in a sinister conspiracy involving  aliens and an evil corporation. Gameplay is broken down into missions,  each with objectives that must be unerringly completed before  progressing to the next mission. This is not your typical kill-anything-that-moves  game: putting a bullet in the wrong person, not keeping the  right one alive, or perforating a seemingly unimportant inanimate object  can often result in mission failure.WhilePerfect Dark's solo missions play out much like those inGoldenEye 007, the game's fantastic multiplayer options are  another matter entirely. Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy.

Yes, this is Fox's first and likely only adventure game, and it's rounded out as one of the strongest Gamecube games yet.

From every detail of Fox's fur, straight to the utterly amazing bosses, the graphics continued to stun and amaze me.10/10Sound:  An EXCELLENT soundtrack, filled with great new songs, and twists on some classic Starfox themes.  Voice acting, for the most part, is great, especially with Fox, Krystal, and many of the dinosaurs.  Unfortunatly, such characters as Tricky and Slippy continually get on your nerves.  Some enemies (those flying creatures) can also become aggrivating.  Everything else is top-notch.9/10Gameplay:A VERY fun game, with nearly flawless controls and ultimately great scenarios, levels and enemies.  Some issues with the C-Stick item menu just can't be overlooked though, as well as some shaky aiming while using some attacks.  Overall, absolutely fantastic.9.5/10Lasting Appeal:The game's one bad point: it's too easy, and too short.  The game could have included such things as a boss for the Cloudrunner fortress, minibosses, more sidequests and things to buy.  This would raise the score, but for now, you may want to play the game over another time, perhaps again some time from now.

{"product_name":"B000QY9C90","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Don't Leave This Behind","reviewText":"In horror and in thrills, zombies have always been popular.  From fine cinema to the video game.  Left 4 Dead is nothing new or original.  It's a game about Zombie Apocalypse.  Yet it's very well crafted and fun.  If you love Zombies, then Left 4 Dead is going to really keep you on your toes.There's no story here.  You play as one of four characters who are trying to survive the apocalypse.  And that's all your goal is throughout the campaign.  Of course, there's no way survival will be easy with zombies and other monsters coming at you from all directions.  There are plenty of weapons to find and ammunition is plentiful.  What makes the game hard is how fast you can be overcome by your adversaries, despite having plenty of weapons and ammo.  Your health will dwindle quite fast throughout Left 4 Dead.  On the other hand, things aren't always over when your health runs out.  You'll be incapacitated when your health depletes and be restricted from moving.  You can, however, shoot when you are on the ground.  Your allies can always come and revive you so that you can get going.  Even if you succumb to the enemy and die permanently, you can hope that your allies will find you as a survivor and you can jump back into the game.Going about the campaign with actual humans is much more fun than AI.  Mostly because you can set up better strategies and because the AI tends to get into a lot more trouble than is worth saving them from.  There's a lot of fun to be had from all the weapons and explosives you can pick up and toss at your enemies.  You and your allies will be on your toes for the entire campaign.The only real problem with the campaign is that it's really short.  Normally this would be a big problem for a game.  With Left 4 Dead, however, it's a plus.  The campaign is never the same thing twice.  You'll experience enemies in different locations every time, and you'll experience them in different numbers every time.  You might have a breeze going through it once and be taken down the next time.  The game manages to be incredibly difficult either way.  As a result, replaying the game is always welcome just because the experience is never the same and the same strategy rarely (if ever) works twice.Graphically, Left 4 Dead is incredible.  The character models are outstanding to look at, and so are the environments.  The zombies are also incredibly detailed.  It's also amazing that with all the chaos that can happen on screen at one time the framerate never slows down.  I've also experienced no problems taking it online.Better than the graphics may be the sound.  The sound effects from the zombies are bone chilling.  The music is also good, for the most part.  But the highlight of the sound comes from the characters themselves and how they interact with one another when you perform certain actions.  Shoot a teammate and he'll chastise you.  They call out when you find ammo, weapons and they scream whenever they've been overrun with zombies.  It all sounds fantastic.If there was any problem with Left 4 Dead it would be that it's a drag to play by yourself.  The multiplayer experience is what most gamers ought to take home from Left 4 Dead.  Unfortunately you don't get that same sense of adrenaline from the single player experience.  It just isn't all that fun.In the end Left 4 Dead is an amazing game and an amazing experience.  There are few games that are as good as this or as amazingly fun and adrenaline pumping.  Even those who don't normally like first person shooters can come to Left 4 Dead and enjoy it.  So jump on in and try to survive.  Don't leave this game behind.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2008"}

ONLINE PLAY!!The strategy, battles, and preparation would be unmatched if you could play against other humans.  While I enjoy the game itself, the AI is simply not good enough to pose a challenge.  You can get through essentially every battle after 1-2 attempts maximum.  If you could go online and match wits with others, and choose your armies and locations this would be one of the greatest out there.In this day and age it's hard to imagine why there is no online, and I have to detract 1.5 stars for that alone.But in any event, here are a few problems I've encountered with the AI that made it annoyingly simple to win.1)  AI doesn't use all of it's CP's each turn.  In basically every round the computer will have several CPs unused that they could have easily destroyed your troops with.  The AI moves it's tanks once or twice then not again, when if they used more CPs their tank could wipe you out due to mistakes you've made in troop placement.  ( a human opponent would take advantage of poor placement and crush you)2)  AI runs right passed your wounded soldiers to attack trooops who are further away instead of killing the wounded.3)  It is too easy to repair your own tank.  All you need to do is bring 2-3 engineers along with you and your tank will be at full health every round.  (human opponents would kill engineers)4)  AI never uses grenades.  They could wipe out 3-4 troops with a grenade toss and never even try.5)  AI never seeks cover behind it's own tanks.  They crouch behind sandbags and walls, but never behind a giant tank.  Just seems strange to me.6)  Too easy to rescue fallen soldiers and call for reinforcements.  The AI never even tries to stop you from getting to a fallen comrad.There are more that I can't think of right now, but overall the AI is far too easy to compete with even an average strategist.  If they ever come out with a second edition and they allow you to choose the battle field and go online, this will be a 10 star game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2009"}

There are motorcycles, convertibles, boats, planes and more to steal. Now you can even purchase buildings, that allow you to save you game in them. But you don't get paid much and buildings (like the malibu club) cost just a couple thousand dollars. Controls are easy and the graphics (while not great) are good.

On his 21st birthday, the Darkness awakens within Jackie Estacado, a mafia hitman for the Franchetti crime family.","reviewerName":"Christopher Deweese","summary":"Game play like no other!","reviewText":"First off, this game is very good and very interesting.  You would do well to buy it.  With that said, I must convey that when I first started playing it I was a little disappointed as it seemed to be pretty standard fare.  Jackie basically walked around NYC and shot stuff.  There were lots of cussing, cops, and cut scenes.  The darkness powers were, however, pretty interesting.  They were like nothing I have ever seen in an FPS.  The game didn't really start to get good until I began accumulating more and more darkness powers.  Then all of a sudden, I'm transported to a kind of WWI hell and I finally get this large dark tendril that I can use to impale people with.  Wow!  Talk about your 180.  Now this is what I was expecting.  At this point I'm very engrossed and basically don't want to put the controller down.  Graphics are good, but they're not as good as Gears of War.  The TV's in the game are a novel concept, but they don't really add much to the story.  Making phone calls also doesn't mean much to the story, but as long as it helps unlock extra content I'll put up with it.  I do like the fact that it is a mature story and not just a bunch of gore to satisfy the kids (who shouldn't be playing this anyway).  The RPG elements in the game certainly add to the story and add depth to the characters.  Summoning Darklings can be a little frustrating in that they don't always go where you want them to.  However, they are nice to have around during intense fire fights, since they take out enemies that would otherwise be distracting and troublesome.  The ending reminded me of Halflife 2.  It seemed a little ambiguous, but it certainly leaves the door open for The Darkness 2.  This is a solid title that is very innovative.  I would have liked to be able to use both darkness serpents (creeping dark) rather than just the right one.  I'd like to see a better array of guns with more ammo available.  Who knows.  Maybe The Darkness 2 will incorporate some of these suggestions.  At any rate, it's a good game that is like nothing else on the market right now.  Embrace the Darkness!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"\"missmegan301\"","summary":"Fun.","reviewText":"This game was fun.

Even starting cold with ME2, I very quickly caught up with what was going on and who was who.  The characters were engaging and while the main quest is very linear, there are enough decisions to make where you feel that you have sufficient input as to where the story was going.  And it's a fine story with well-developed characters who you get to know quite well as you recruit them and go on special missions to curry their loyalty.This is a shooter with RPG elements.  You'll spend most of your time ducking and shooting at enemies from cover, which is a lot of fun with the different types of guns and powers at your disposal.  There is a squad-management element, but they're smart enough to back you up without much help if you aren't inclined to give them direction (which I wasn't...

{"product_name":"B002I094AC","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Richardson","summary":"Good first game for the 3DS and great remake of a classic title","reviewText":"Star Fox 64 was one of the all-time great rail shooters, and this 3DS adaptation of it is excellent. Between the graphical updates, the bonus mode, the re-done voice work and the well-done local multi-player, this is certainly the greatest version of the classic game released so far. The 3D effect is relatively minimal, but well-done as far as it goes. The reason this loses a star for me, besides its relative lack of content, is its inexplicable lack of online multiplayer. Not a huge killer, but I probably would have played this longer than I did, since I don't really know too many other people with a 3DS.The game only takes about an hour to play through one of the paths, but multiple paths (and new levels) can be unlocked by fulfilling certain conditions on specific levels. Between this and the score attack mode, it took me about a month to fully explore this game (or almost fully, as I have yet to unlock the expert mode). Nevertheless, as I've gotten most of the medals for the levels in the main play-through and the score attack mode, and as I've played through all of the levels in this game and completed both the easy and hard endings, I do feel qualified to write a review for this game.This is a good first title for the 3DS. The 3D, as I said, is well-presented, but not overwhelming. There's also a good use of the 3DS' gyroscopic controls (of course, as others have noted, this can conflict with the 3D effect). It really allows you to adjust to control set-up of the 3DS. The game is also very engaging, especially for new players, and is a blast to play.With that said, though, this will not keep you engaged for months continuously, although I often found myself playing through a level of two every week or so. Recommended highly, but know what you're getting.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2011"}

I did, for the most part, but there were a few problems too.PROS:-As always, the action-packed, combo-oriented gameplay is fun as all-get-out.-The voice acting is phenomenal. In contrast with my expectations, the &#34;little girl&#34; character had a voice low enough that I didn't get a headache from listening to her.-The art is pleasant-The story takes some unexpected directions, and has a sequence of pure gold in the middle-The final boss is absurdly hard compared to the previous challenges in the game, which makes for an epic conclusion.-2D cutscenes by ufotable are off the chain; what a great studio!CONS:-Very unbalanced characters. Until every character becomes broken (around the level cap), using a character besides Jude and to a lesser extent Milla really cripples you, even if you're more familiar with another character.-The music is identical to every other Motoi Sakuraba game. If you've played one, you won't be hearing anything new here.-Story length is below average and side content is very lacking. The number of &#34;post-game&#34; challenges is limited, unless you force yourself to play them on the hardest difficulty ONLY, in which case they seem insurmountable.-The story climaxes way too early. After that, it kinda glides in to its conclusion.Overall, this is a good game and worth the time. Unfortunately, between the weak post-game and the drawn-out segment between the climax and the ending, it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2013"}

I've never played baldurs gate. I remember my sister asking to so I asked my dad to play Icewind Dale. He set this up for me and I remember playing to the Vale of Shadows. I stopped about half way through. The most ignorant part about the games is the battles. As you go they get increasingly frequent. I hate haveing to fight a skeleton with 2 hp every other second. As for fighting, the game lacks as it is more of a point and click.I started playing again from the middle of the Vale, and finally got out of there. I then went to a temple which was alright. After that I realized that I was going to another dungeon type cave. This time, I read a strategy guide to find out that it was about 5 levels of fighting. That's not fun. That is not fun at all. I could respect a short game with few battles, but when I fight battles every other minute just to drag out something... It almost seems meaningless after a while.Anyways, I stopped playing there and decided to remake my party earlier today. I am enjoying it more, mostly because I know to make really powerful fighters and forget about druids. My druid last game killed about 15 units. My main character killed about 300. This can only tell you that my druid was bad. Fortunately I was able to change him later in the game. Although when I did, I got stuck with a level 1 character who was easily killed off. So yea, don't think because you can change your party means you will be changing later in the game. The feature is useless because by the time you discover just how bad your fighter is, the game will be too hard for you to change.The game does a great job in voice actors though. The fact that I create my entire party is fine. The graphics could use some work. I get tired and bored of the same old dark environments every other minute. Even the snow seems depressing. Other than that, the game offers repetitive battles and little more. Online play isn't fun at all considering on gamespy there are usually one or 2 games going. Once you do get in the game you will learn that everyone exported characters who fought enemies on easy and had the option &quot;max hp on level up&quot; set.Here's some advice, go play baldurs gate. My sis, sister is playing it again. She is enjoying it. This game is bland, depressing, and repetitive.

{"product_name":"B001NJ6AWO","reviewerName":"Cobalt","summary":"The best Terminator game, but still falls short of what it could've been.","reviewText":"To me, &#34;Terminator Salvation&#34; is one of the biggest surprises ever, both in film and in video games.  I never expected to actually like a film that was directed by someone who's official stage name is &#34;McG.&#34;  I also didn't expect its video game counterpart to actually be any good, after my horrible experience with the sloppy, unfocused T3 game.  However, I'm pleased to report that TS the game is the best Terminator game ever released.  However, it still falls short of the potential that it could've possibly fulfilled.Developed by GRIN and published by Evolved Games, TS the game puts you in the role of famous Resistance leader John Connor as he leads his followers in their never-ending fight for survival against the Skynet Robot Army.  Well, that's technically not the real case here, as the events in the game take place two years before the events in the film.  At this point, Connor is still a common foot soldier who doubts that he really is humanity's savior.  However, when he receives a distress call from a small platoon of Resistance fighters who are trapped at Skynet's Headquarters, he decides to go rescue them, and recognizes the confidence and power he had inside him all along.TS is an easily familiar 3rd-person shooter.  You're able to use a variety of different weapons against the robtots, including assault rifles, shotguns, heavy machine gun turrets, grenades, and rocket launchers.  Each enemy you face is vulnerable to a different type of weapon.  For instance, the crab robots have a power source on their back that's vulnerable to assault rifle fire, the flying Aerostats can be potentially downed with one well-placed shotgun blast, and the T-600s are only vulnerable to multiple heavy explosives.  Since you can only carry two weapons at a time, and the enemies can absorb some inhuman amounts of damage, it adds a crucial strategic element as you try to pick the best loadout that is able to effectively deal with as many enemy types as possible.The cover system is the best part about TS.  You're able to use just about any surface for protection, and you can slickly transition to different objects anywhere within a 180 degree radius.  It proves extremely valuable when attempting to flank heavily armored enemies so you can fire at their vulnerable areas.  You can pop in and out of cover by pressing the aim button, as well as blindfire without exposing yourself.  It's very fortunate because the health system is unpredictable.  Health replenishes at the end of every official fight; in the middle of it, it's not regenerative, which forces you to stay in cover at all times and only attack when you have a prime opportunity.  It's another nice strategic element that doesn't fall neatly into any established system.The on-foot shooting isn't the only aspect to TS.

I have never played the previous installments before because it looks like a kiddie game. But fast forward to 2013 and you have a reboot Tomb Raider that dwarfed the old tomb raider games. I got it when it came out in March. And I just finished another play through today.HD graphics, captivating story, great action sequence, mesmerizing soundtrack and awesome gameplay it kept me glued to the screen from start to finish. I have tons of fun playing TR. In total I have finished the game 4 rounds, 3 in hard mode and 1 in normal mode (when I first played the game). I couldn't get enough of the game so I amped up the difficulties and much to my surprise the hard mode is not that difficult at all.I had a blast upgrading my weapons and survival skills throughout the game. The side challenge to collect various items in the game was a nice addition to the main gameplay. Love this new Tomb Raider which was rated M. I love the realistic killing, the gun fight, using the bow was also a blast for silent kill.The japanese floklore theme that was used in the game was really interesting and eye opening. It was a pleasant surprised I must say. It adds the suspense and dark elements to the game. Really interesting. The traversing, jumping, hanging, rolling, shimmering gameplay was great as well.Lara's ship shipwrecked near an unknown island, she and her crew survives the ordeal but escaping the island is a real challenge. Playing Lara exploring the entire island from the mountain top to the beach side is an exhilarating adventure.I love this game to heart and recommend it to everyone. I'm sure with the tremendous success of the game, the developer will make Tomb Raider 2. I am looking forward for it with great anticipation.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2013"}

The gameplay is pretty typical DMC but you can upgrade more with this one on the fighting combo and styles more.

{"product_name":"B003PHLT8W","description":"","reviewerName":"Subject7","summary":"No unlockable extras >:(","reviewText":"Assuming that you've read the other reviews and watched enough gameplay videos, I'll keep this review like the game, short and sweet.Vanquish is a fun game really.- The story is forgettable, involving a space colony/giant microwave cannon threatening to vaporize a major city in America (guess which one). The characters are potty-mouthed and cheesy as all hell but can be quite funny at times.- The gameplay is fast and challenging, a kind of mix between Devil May Cry or Ninja Gaiden and a typical 3rd person shooter utilizing a cover system.- The weapons are cool and upgradable, but not permanently. In other words, you can't keep the upgrades and use them in a second play-through, a fact I personally hated.- The suit is more or less well balanced and is able to slow down time allowing you to shoot enemies more frequently, assess a situation more thoroughly and shoot incoming missiles or grenades (even your own) out of the sky. Unfortunately, it's power system is quite limited and it cannot be upgraded.Praises aside, this game is not worth full price ($60).It's campaign is not very long (6 hrs approx.) and other than trophies and gaining a higher score, there is absolutely no incentive to re-play this game. Granted you are going to want to play it again, there's just no reason to.- there's no alternate skin/suit- you can't keep your weapon upgrades after you finish the campaign- there's no infinite ammo cheat- no 2x or unlimited suit energy- no artwork- no making of videoNothing.I enjoyed the game but considering it's length, I was hugely disappointed at it's lack of extras. I cannot recommend buying it for more than $30 (I got it for $20).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2011"}
{"product_name":"B003PHLTDC","description":"","reviewerName":"M. DiSpirito \"mentored1\"","summary":"Blast those !#@&%#@ Robots!","reviewText":"Greetings Amazonites.This is one exciting game, people.  I haven't had this much fun playing a game in a while.  It is raw, arcadey, action-packed blasting fun.  From start to finish, there isn't a single moment where you feel underwhelmed, bored, or out of the fight.  I'll run through my three points for this game.ENVIRONMENTS (5 Stars): this game is beautifully done.  It takes place in a massive, country-sized space station.  I honestly can't find one flaw in the visual presentation of this game.  It's astounding and really immerses you in the environment.  The music and sound are awesome.  Great techno rock tunes pulse during the games, and the sound effects are booming and robust.  For this type of action-arcade experience, there is not a single flaw to be found.  You shouldn't have one moment where the environments disconnect you from the game experience.  Even the cutscenes are impressive.GAMEPLAY (5 stars): I can't give a game 5 stars of gameplay unless it really deserves it.  The HUD is minimal, providing you only with the information you absolutely need to play.  Health is taken care of in a different way, without a meter or measurement; it's done well and keeps you in the game.  The controls are tight and easy.  There aren't a lot of special moves and such in the game, but the controls allow you to put the available tactics together easily.  The combat flows buttery smooth and the controller setup is intuitive.  You won't hit the wrong button by mistake or botch a move because of complicated controller setup.The \"suit\" worn by the hero is fantastic; the abilities it bestows aren't terribly unique but they are implemented perfectly and give a whole new dimension to action shooting.  In a nutshell: it's a blast to play!DESIGN (4 stars): The game isn't very long, coming in with 5 total chapters and maybe 5 missions for each chapter.  It took me about 2-3 hours per chapter, about 12 hours to finish the game.  It's unfortunately short.  The nonstop action and campy, old-school sci-fi story keeps you going and makes the short game packed with fun.  I could have easily gone for another 10+ hours.  If the game was less action-packed, it wouldn't be worth the play.There are five challenge levels that are unlocked as you progress, and these one-off, survival modes are a lot of fun to play.  I would have liked to see more of them, or some other modes to explore the awesomeness of this game's action.The levels, weapons, and interaction of characters with the environment is perfect for this type of game.  It's largely a set-piece game: you can kinda guess when the fights are coming.  The anticipation is fun, because there's a large variety of enemy bosses and the AI is actually challenging!  They take cover, lay down fire, and make use of different weapons.The story is cool, but far from intriguing or mysterious.  There's definitely a couple of twists, but not anything that'll blow your mind.  It leaves the door open for a sequel or DLC (which I hope they take advantage of!).  The characters in the game aren't developed--but given the action of this game, it isn't necessary.OVERALL (5 Stars): the basic story, simple characters, and campy feel take a back seat (and sometimes even augment) the fast-paced, pulse-pounding action in this game.  It's a blast to play and hard to put down.  The controls and in-game response is fantastic.  There's nothing to knock for visual or audio quality--top notch!  The game, because it's so cool, should have been a lot longer; there also could have been more challenge modes.  There's a lot of room for DLC here.  This game is a gem with a fun, old-school arcade feel to it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2010"}

{"product_name":"B001IK5TJI","reviewerName":"Nona","summary":"A fun and addictive RPG, but with a few flaws","reviewText":"If you've ever played Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR), then you have a good idea of what to expect in Dragon Age: Origins.  Even though KOTOR and Dragon Age: Origins (DA:O) take place in completely different worlds, the game mechanics and format of the two games are very similar.Dragon Age is an RPG in which you control a party of up to four characters to combat a wide variety of enemies and monsters.  The combat itself occurs in real-time, although you have the option to pause the game at any time and issue commands to any of your party members.  The other main hallmark of Bioware's RPGs is the number of choices (primarily in dialogue) you can make throughout the game.  While most of these choices do not have lasting importance, there are some which will radically change the path the story takes.  Your choices can also affect gameplay, as certain dialogue options may allow you to skip fights completely, while other choices might impact the abilities you have access to or the statistics of your party members.Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Dragon Age is the considerable amount of effort the developers made to making sure that the world appropriately reflects the decisions you make throughout the game.  When you start the game you begin in one of six \"origin stories\".  In each origin story you meet various characters that you will encounter again later on in the game, and when you meet them for the second time, they remember what you did at the beginning of the game. On the flip side, you will meet characters from the other five origin stories which you did not play, and only after going through their respective origin stories do you get a full appreciation of their part in the story.  It's details like this which make this game a lot of fun to play.The gameplay is also quite entertaining.  There are four levels of difficulty, ranging from \"casual\" to \"nightmare\", and they are adjustable on the fly.  The difficulty has no bearing on any other part of the game, but it lets you set the game at a level which is challenging but not overly so.  At the harder levels of difficulty considerable planning and thought is required to succeed, especially in the more challenging encounters, and it is here that the strategic depth of the game really reveals itself.  The choices you make outside of combat, such as the equipment you wear and the abilities you choose to learn as you level up, also play a huge role in determining how powerful your party is.Unfortunately, there are several pretty substantial flaws in this game, which might detract from your enjoyment of the game.  Perhaps the most prominent comment on the game are the relatively low quality of the graphics.  For a PS3 game, the graphics are indeed subpar, since the game has been in development for five years and is basically a straight port of the PC version of the game.  While the developers tried to make the interface of the game accessible for console gamers, it's still obvious that playing with keyboard and mouse on a PC is the easiest way to play the game.  Some of the sidequests don't seem to work too well, as some have ambiguous or incorrect instructions.Nevertheless, the positives of the game outweigh the negatives, and if you are an RPG fan this game is a good buy.  It might be preferable to purchase the PC version of the game over the PS3 version (evidently the PC version doesn't come with SecuROM, which is a huge plus for those who care) if your computer hardware is reasonably powerful.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2009"}

Otherwise, I would imagine that \"Super Paper Mario\" would have tons of reviews at this moment. This is an incredibly solid game.Less \"Paper Mario\" than \"Super Mario\", the game returns Mario to his 2-D roots. Gone are turn-based battles, and in their place, good 'ole hoppin' and boppin' fun, like in the old days, but with one clever twist. When your character is faced with, say, an impossible jump, you can simply \"flip\" yourself into three dimensions, the result of which is often the opening of a new path, or the emergence of a hidden pipe, etc. It's a clever twist on the 2-D goodness of the old \"SMB\" games of the Nintendo and Super Nintendo.If I had one complaint with the game, it's that it's a bit too easy. With the ability to level ones character, the challenging aspects of the original \"SMB\" games gets a bit lost (in particular, the character will NOT die from falling in a hole, and can sustain multiple hits before running out of heart points, which can be replenished by items, or even hidden mushrooms). But make no mistake - while the game is never particularly challenging, it is always fun. The dialogue is snappy (the \"dating sim\" send-up is incredibly humorous, e.g.), the controls are good and responsove (I would have liked to see the nunchuk controller used a bit, particularly for the 3-D sections, but this is a mild complaint), the graphics are pretty...interesting, and the whole experience is trippy, in a \"Katamari\" sort of way.All in all, a solid Wii outing - this is one of those games that makes you happy to own the system.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2007"}

You rarely, if ever, have a completely bad Mario game (I am of course not counting decent Luigi's Mansion, horrid Mario is Missing or his sports excursions like Baseball and Soccer. Aside from the main canon which includes Mario World, Mario 64, Mario Sunshine and Mario Galaxy, the RPG/Paper series has always been quite successful as well. Now the third installment in the Paper series is back and while I still love its premise, this is just not as great as Thousand Year Door was.Story: The book Dark Prognosticus has foretold the destruction of the worlds brought on by Count Bleck when he brings about the mystical Chaos Heart. However, a group of good decide to counteract it and make the Light Prognosticus which foretells of a coming hero, which is of course Mario. With the help of Princess Peach, Luigi and even Bowser, Mario has to once again rid the world of evil (although surprisingly not the Princess for a change).Graphics: The graphics reminded me of Thousand Year Door but that's not a bad thing, since that game had impressive visuals, especially its special effects and lighting. Super Paper Mario is basically cut from the same mold with bright, vibrant graphics. However this is the 2D world since the 3D side just looks plain and ugly. But still, it's a game where you can show off your TV since the image looks so clear.Sound/Music: Kind of unremarkable to be honest. I was so caught up in the gameplay that I completely tuned out the rather drab music. Some might disagree and say they're catchy but since the Mario series has had catchy themes like Starman to the Underworld, it's disappointing there really isn't anything like it here.Gameplay: Thousand Year Door's gimmick was that Mario gained paper-like abilities such as rolling and squeezing through cracks. This game is based on the idea that Mario can turn the 2D world into 3D. A common example is a wall that's too high to jump over in 2D. Stuck? No. Just go to 3D and that wall is right in the middle of a wide path and you can just walk around. What's disappointing is that it wasn't implemented that much with puzzles relegated simply to \"flipping\" the world. Not to mention it's kind of an easy game with barely any difficulty. But one thing that's great is the controls with Mario & Co. being more responsive than ever, unlike clunky butterfingers New Super Mario Bros.Instead of having teammates battling in RPG style turn-based battles, we're back to old-school platforming with Mario jumping on enemies. You can still use items like bombs, flames and whatnot. Defeating one nets you EXP where you can level up though this wasn't as implemented all that well. You almost forget about until the screen says you leveled up and you go \"oh...okay then.\" Also your characters are interchangeable so if you hit a snag, you can change to say Princess Peach who can glide with her umbrella or Bowser with his fire breath. Even though they're more established characters, I kind of preferred Vivian, Goombella and Ms. Mowz from Thousand Year Door better since they felt like more fleshed out characters.So that's gotta be it right? Nope. Along the way, Mario can get so-called \"Pixls\", flying butterflies that can perform certain actions. Since you're holding the Wii-remote sideways a la NES controller, you have to go in the menu and change them out. Some range from platform-making to bombs to grabbing enemies/items from afar and many others.  All of this gameplay variety and it's surprising at how...dull it feels. Of course it's Mario so you're going to play but it just feels kind of bland at times without those long playtimes previous games had whereas this game feels like it's best to play in short bursts.Is it a bad Mario game? Well no since there's still Mario is Missing and that time travel one. It just feels like you've played better Mario games before.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2007"}

I have an 8 year old daughter who plays on my 360 all the time (Minecraft of course). She loves Disney characters, and especially Disney world. So I saw this and thought I would throw it under the tree for her and see what she thought. 3 characters come with the package so you get a good start on different worlds and characters. The Toy box mode is where the fun is at, so make sure to check that mode out. Tons of things to find (eggs) and tons of areas to explore. The graphics are excellent as well. I am giving it 5 stars because it is really a great game like Minecraft for kids that keeps their imagination running, and adds some educational value. Be prepared to buy more addon's though!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0041OWQTO","reviewerName":"Bobby  W.","summary":"Reading the manual helped","reviewText":"Right now I'm on an FPS kick, and so far I'm very much enjoying Borderlands GOTY edition.This game is a shooter but also a \"looter\" - you go on missions and scavenge items (different weapons, ammo, cash, etc.) along the way. You drive some vehicles, too. I like the mix.As you gain experience, your character (you can choose from four different types at the beginning of the game) becomes more powerful (similar idea to buffing up your character in the \"Dead Space\" games).The AI for the bad guys also increases as the game progresses, so don't let the first few bandit encounters fool you.One thing striking about this game is that it has a very different, stylized look - sort of like a comic book (restrained color palette and at times \"2D\")- check out the screenshots - it may or may not appeal to you.Note that with Borderlands you do need to interact with your character's inventory and objective maps frequently - if you don't like fussing with those kinds of things, the game may not be for you.This is one of the few shooting games where I had to stop and read the manual - once I did that it became a lot more enjoyable.Glad I paid the extra bucks and got the \"Game Of The Year\" edition, which includes a number of add-on packs on the disc.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2012"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E5OE","description":"","reviewerName":"1Dub79","summary":"A step in the right direction","reviewText":"In the past few years, we have seen the same old features with next-gen Madden games. If you read my Madden 11 review, you'll know lack of multi-hit tackles; suction, morphing, and tumbleweeds have been the Achilles heel of Madden games. I figured Madden 11 would be different, but it was not. After another Madden fiasco, I decided if another Madden game had these issues, I would not buy another Madden game, ever. Well, there is none of those issues on this newest version of Madden. For those, who have not played the demo, this is what Madden 12 is all about.....Build A Franchise: This feature is VERY deep. For example, the players now have hot and cold streaks. In addition, there is a free-agent bidding systems, which gives the player a certain time and a certain amount of money to sign the coveted free-agent. Also, the franchise mode has something, which is called hot and cold streaks for player performance.Custom Playbooks: For those, who wanted this feature, look no farther! This feature allows the player to edit an existing playbook or just create another one.Dynamic Player Performance: This could be the most interesting new feature on the game. This feature shows the affects of a player's tendencies in a game. For example, if the player has a trait, such a \"drops open passes\", they are not likely to be very consistent in catching the ball, ESPECIALLY in clutch time. This feature is more dynamic in Franchise mode because their tendencies can affect how they play, each week, instead of each game. Also, you can edit these traits to your liking, when choosing to edit a players ratings.Enhanced Tackling System/Gameplay: This is my favorite feature of the game. No more motion shifting, morphing or suction animations on a ball carrier. The tackles are collision based, which means the player now has to make physical contact with the ball carrier, in order to make a tackle. In addition, location is also important to make a sufficient tackle.The hits can be extremely hard because they are momentum based. With that being said, hits never felt so good on a game because there is FINALLY no motion shifting or morphing. You follow all the way through with a hit. If your defender does not have the momentum to make a hit, he may just make an arm tackle or he might not be able to make a successful tackle, at all. Once again, location is vital to making a sufficient tackle. The multi-hit tackles are great. Each defender, who engages ball carrier, can possibly get involved in a tackle. In addition, you'll see stolen tackles, as well. No more tumbleweed animations.Throwing on the defense can sometimes be a daunting task, especially above the Pro level. You must choose your throws very carefully. The better your QB's throwing power and accuracy, the better off you'll be. Don't worry! If you do choose to play on the All-Pro level, you will not experience the constant route jumping by defenders, which you can experience, if you have played the All-American level ofNCAA Football 12. On Madden 12, defenders will sometimes jump routes, especially if his awareness rating is higher.The blocking is excellent in the game. In fact, I would say the blocking on this game is the best of any Madden title on next-gen. With that being said, running on this game is a very rewarding experience. Unlike previous EA Sports titles, the AI of your players rarely misses an assignment. Players block and immediately look for a player to block. I have seen some very realistic DL/OL engagements, as well.Graphics/Visuals: Once again, Madden has set the bar for graphics and visuals. Player's faces and uniforms are increasingly detailed and vivid. Everything you see on a players' uniform can be seen in this game. In pre-game, you'll see all 32 team specific run-outs. Then, there is degradation of players uniforms, based on the surface of the field. That is not necessarily new, but it is in the game. I WOULD say the degradation is more detailed, though. You'll see scuffs on helmets, grass stains, and grass stains on the uniform. On replays, you'll see 3D grass. I love to see the grass or turf flying up, as player's cleats go against the surfaces. In addition, you'll see animations, which pertains to certain players. For example, if Clay Matthews makes a big play, he'll flex his muscles. The commentary is still not that great, though. The halftime show is STILL terrible. I don't know why it is so hard for EA Sports to create a real halftime show.Overall, Madden 12 is not perfect. However, it is a step in the right direction. If you have been disappointed in past versions of Madden games for next-gen, this is version should make up for the disappointment.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2011"}
