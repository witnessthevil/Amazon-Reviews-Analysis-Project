{"product_name":"B00CQ7CIMS","description":"","reviewerName":"Bryan","summary":"A Good Companion to New Super Mario U","reviewText":"First, it must be said that you shouldn't get this game unless you've played and enjoyed the main game, \"New Super Mario Bros. U\". Super Luigi appears as downloadable content for that game, even though it's a standalone title as well. The only advantage to getting it as a disc is if you need to save space or if you'd prefer to be able to resell it individually at a later time.The game is classic side-scrolling Mario style fun in the same vein as the original NES games, much like all New Super Mario games. To be more precise, they should be calling these \"Retro Super Mario Bros.\" because that's exactly what they are.The Luigi game brings back nearly all of the levels of the Mario counterpart but remixes them into all-new designs that are made about half as long, but with slightly harder sections. It was actually cool to play both games back to back to see all the same familiar levels redone in completely new challenging ways. People who've played the first will be used to this enough to be able to do well, but the game may feel incredibly hard to those new to the series. As an expert gamer, in some ways I found this version easier simply because the levels were over so soon. Don't let the short length scare you from buying this, though. There are still about 80 levels, 3 star coins to find per level, multiple paths within the levels, and plenty of replay in going back to find everything you missed. At the budget price it's a pretty good value.The main drawback to the game is just the quick pace of play if you're in the mood for something more laid back. This game is absolutely out to kill you at every turn. You need to be on your toes and ready for the most unexpected and occasionally frustrating deaths.Some people are complaining about the time limit of 90 seconds per level. I do understand this complaint, but in completing the game I only actually died to going over the time limit two times, and both those times were my first attempt at a level. The levels are very short and all can be completed well within 30 seconds. In all honesty, for the length of the levels the original game's time limit was just as tight as this one's in some cases. Those levels could be 2 or 3 times as long but certainly did not give you that much more time. I nearly died of a time over more than once in the original game. The real problem with the time limit, if any, is just that it's indicative of the problem I mentioned above that the game has a crazy fast and unforgiving pace of play all-around. Some will love this, but if this sounds bad to you, consider a different game.I do think this game and its predecessor are great for kids, despite the challenge. It's games like this which will really hone a child's reaction time and ability to think on their feet. You really need to earn it if you're going to complete this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2013"}

How important is that for a game case though?That said, it really does the job perfectly well.  The games seat easily and are held securely.  The cases closes securely.  The overall construction is solid enough.  The bit of foam holds the memory card securely, and given how small those are, that's important.

{"product_name":"B00004SVXG","description":"NES Game","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"The Start of a Great Series, but with Frustration","reviewText":"Of all the games of the NES era, Mega Man sticks out in my mind as being the hardest.  I didn't expect it to include the things that would later go into the series such as the charge shot, or Rush or anything like that, but when I first played it, I was flabbergasted by it's extreme difficulty.  As a kid I thought it was a great game.  Now that I'm older, I can look at it with a critical eye and say that it is a good game, but even for an old school gamer, Mega Man is a game that so rightfully needed the remake that it was garnered in the PSP, and was also a game that seriously needed tweaking even when it was first released in the 80's.As with all old school games of the 8-bit era, Mega Man's focus was not story.  It was gameplay.  Storlyines didn't become important until the 16-bit era.  So if you wanted to know the premise, you needed to read the instruction manual.  Of course, you probably know it without the use of the instruction booklet anyway.Mega Man's gameplay was pretty simple.  You played as the blue bomber and selected one of six robot masters to go off and face.  You went through the level and would eventually find the robot master and take them down.  Each Robot Master was weak to another Robot Masters weapon.  In the end this proved to be a staple of the Mega Man series.  Each time you defeat a boss, you get his weapon and move on.  Fantastic.The game was difficult, though.  And when I say difficult, I'm not joking.  For one, you've got no energy tanks, and the energy pellets that restore health are not dropped very often.  Also, there are no passwords so you have to complete the game in one sitting.  Bosses also did a lot of damage to you.  For a series, Mega Man got off to a great start, but as an indiviual game, the fun is actually taken away because of the difficulty (the Yellow Devil comes to mind).  You're not invulnerabe to spikes if you get hit, and there are no energy tanks.  That makes up the bulk of the difficulty.  This probably won't bother those who played the games in order, but I started with Mega Man II.  The other big thing about the difficulty was the Magnet Beam.  You'll have to grab it in order to get further in Wily's fortress, but you don't get it by traditional means.  You have to find it in a level.  This brings about another gripe with the difficulty, if you go back to a level you must fight that Robot Master AGAIN, and you might not be prepared for that.Music wise I also didn't think highly of the first Mega Man.  A lot of the music just didn't sound fantastic to begin with.  There were some good tunes (Wily's fortress, Cut Man's stage), but there were also tunes I dreaded a lot (Ice Man's stage, the Boss Fight music).  Again, though, this is the first game.  It's just getting things started.Mega Man is a good game, but the extreme difficulty might be a bit much for even your average old school gamer who's used to such difficult feats.  It's a good game, and it'll probably test your skills more than the likes of Contra.  However, I'm not the kind of gamer who is used to that.  I was able to complete Mega Man, but it's not an easy game.  But I've heard of gamers going through the whole game without getting hit once, which means the difficulty really does provide a lot of fun.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00HRKE1SI","description":"","reviewerName":"Koala1356","summary":"Plastic construction, tight fitting","reviewText":"I was a bit disappointed with this Turtle Beach headset because of its plastic adjustment sliders on the earcups and (I am going to guess here) plastic headband.  It's certainly lightweight enough to not have any metal included. My other TB headset has metal in those places, which I think is more durable. On a brighter note, as I said, the all plastic construction does make the headset lightweight.  Unfortunately, I also I find it a very tight fit on my head&#8212;more than 'snug', I'm talking headache-after-a-short-time tight. Maybe this will get better with wear and time, but right now it's sure uncomfortable for me to wear for more than 30 minutes.I am not an audiophile, and so I find the sound quality very good.  I have no complaints in that department.  I was pleased that all the buttons and controls are found in-line (on the cord) rather than on the earcups.  It makes finding what I want a whole lot easier.  The in-line amplifier controls and cable are only used for two of the four configurations.  For Xbox One and Mobile, the headset plugs directly into the device with its attached cable and 3.5mm plug; for Xbox 360 and PC, the attached cable plugs into the in-line amplifier, which in turn connects to the PC or X360 via USB or 3.5mm plug.  Included in the box is an Xbox One controller adapter, so while you're still attached to your controller via cable (as per all XB headsets) the controller remains wireless to your console&#8212;effectively a wireless headset.  On the PC and Xbox 360, it is not a wireless headset.Right now the tight fit is the thing that bothers me the most.  I don't think this is a bad headset, but there are better ones in this price range.  Overall, I feel it's a little pricy for what you get, and that the money spent on the &#34;Titanfall&#34; branding would have been better spent on the quality.  3-average-stars from me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2014"}

{"product_name":"B004K1EA5G","description":"","reviewerName":"Mr.Chunky Monkey","summary":"One of the Best Nintendo 3DS Games to Date","reviewText":"Dead or Alive Dimensions is one of those games which made me worried before I bought it. In the videos it didn't look too fun. The moves and throws did not seems to carry the needed punch and power that you see in Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat games. But eventually I gave in and bought the game. I thought it was at least worth a try given the positive reviews.I was not disappointed when I received Dead or Alive Dimensions in the mail. First let me comment what makes this game a \"win\". All the characters are fully 3d models who fight surrounded by fully rendered 3d background. It looks on par with the powerful consoles. From the start you are given the choice of most of the characters available in the game. They range from sort of tiny girl characters to large monsters, from old men to large pro wrestlers. Also if you enjoy the type of game where the characters are scantily clad and show a lot of skin, this may be eat. It is not too explicit though.Basically there are many to choose from for anyone's taste.  When you start playing you can  see the bottom screen that shows you all the move input combinations. This is very convenient because there is no way you can learn all the moves on your own. The number of unique moves per character is many more than those in Street Fighter games, which creates good depth in the game. You can choose just to learn a few moves from each character or learn all the sophisticated moves of only one character. Great way to learn and keep replaying.The fighting system is a breath of fresh air if you're tired with the other fighting games. You are gradually explained within the game what each kind of move or maneuver does. There are various throws and a method to block the throws, and all such stuff.Despite the positive aspects of the game above there are some annoyances as well. If you start playing either the arcade mode or the story mode from the start you'll see that battles end extremely quickly. You could perform about 5 powerful moves and the opponent is down. Especially if you're experienced with fighting games it will seem too easy to win. What should be done from the start is the user should select a higher difficulty setting and check all the available game options. It will make the game much better. For example change the handicap and number of rounds to at least three.Another surprisingly annoying feature is the 3DS' 3D feature. Yes the 3D can look very good, but when 3D is turned on the game runs at almost half fewer frames than it does if the 3D slider is set to OFF. When the 3D is off the game runs extremely smoothly. I'd say the 3D feature is pointless since it makes things worse.The plot of Dead or Alive Dimensions leaves to be desired and pretty much a joke. If you played any of the Japanese fighting games then you already know the plot of the game. Someone sets up a tournament, someone lies to their friend, possession by demons. Most of the cutscenes are not actual rendered cut scenes but the characters frozen in time with a bubble appearing next to them. Whether intentionally or not, some conversations are very funny.So, overall this is an excellent game which fails to use the 3DS 3D feature well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2011"}

Now with the sequel, Harmonix has worked hard to put in new features that makes Dance Central 2 a full and new experience. I am hardcore gamer with a collection of 78 games, and yes I like playing Dance Central.Now 2 player coop is available, only LOCAL. It is unfortunate that there is no Xbox Live Coop other than leaderboards. But who cares, you can have fun with friends when having party or impress your date with awesome dance moves :PThe usage of Kinect voice allows you control the game in variety of ways such saying Xbox, Pause. It is suprisely good at hearing even when the sound is loud. Now you can also record the video while in breakdown mode so you can have better understanding what you are doing wrong in a dance move. There is new crew challenge mode where it is basically dance routines with mix variety of songs. I find that Kinect tends to track significantly better in DC2 than DC1. The difficulty has ramped up, it is harder to pull flawless moves in DC2, I guess they have reduced the margin of error in the game.You can import DC1 soundtrack using the special code in DC1 Manual and pay tranfer fee which I think was 560 MSP. May be a letdown but I guess they were remade of DC2 experience and Coop too. You also get similar code in DC2 suggesting there will be DC3.The song list are pretty decent, dances well, I think there is fewer guy songs but you can always combined the list from DC1.There is new fitness mode which now tracks calories burned across all modes, even in practice break down mode. There are special fitness playlist with longest one about 47 minutes, whop, major calorie burn. I played quite a bit and I believe I am losing weight, muscles always sore you know. Too much movement results in good workout.I suggest any Dance Central fans or new Kinect purchases, must get this game for their kinect collection and experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular.

{"product_name":"B00005Y4Q1","description":"Unreal II: The Awakeningreturns to the fascinating futuristic setting ofUnreal, first visited in 1998. Since then we've had to content ourselves with the excellentUnreal Tournamentmultiplayer combat series. For this first true sequel Epic Games hired Legend Entertainment, who made a name for themselves with theUnreal: Return to Na Paliexpansion pack and the woefully underratedWheel of Timegame (based on the books by Robert Jordan). The result is fun and frantic, if a bit too short-lived.Unreal II's best feature is its lush graphics engine. It's state of the art. All the locations, which range from bizarre alien worlds to those based on the filmAlien, exude dynamic realism. Human and alien characters are well-animated and rendered, but have a cartoonish exaggeration that clashes with the realism of the architecture. The designers were undoubtedly shooting for a comic-book look, which explains why the women look like blow-up dolls with bare midriffs and the men have hulking muscles. The monsters, too, ripple with strength and menace. This style will please some, but is less effective than the more realistic styles employed by similar titles--although at least the art direction is consistent throughout the game.Unrealcast you as a prisoner who--through both good and bad luck--was freed from confinement, but marooned on an alien world. He goes on to become a sort of messiah figure to the four-armed natives, while other, scarier, natives want to kill him. It ends with a cliffhanger that this game does nothing to resolve. Now, you play as a new character who works for the Terran Colonial Authority. You're a space marshal on the ship Atlantis. You and your buxom partner, who looks more like an exotic dancer than a police woman, have to solve problems in a game only tenuously connected with the originalUnreal.Core gameplay and mission design are good, but uninspired. Legend has taken a conservative, almost minimalist approach. They've made a solid shooter that takes full advantage of Epic's state-of-the-art graphics engine, but did nothing to set the shooter apart from the crowd. One hopes thatUnreal II: The Awakeningawakens Epic to the fact thatUnrealis a genuinely interesting franchise that deserves more.--Andrew S. BubPros:Gorgeous graphicsDecent gameplayCons:Amateurish if consistent art designToo short","reviewerName":"-- \"--\"","summary":"Not much of an Awakening for the genre, but a good game. . .","reviewText":"\"Unreal II: The Awakening\" isn't a very original first-person shooter, and this is an especially bad time to provide the gaming public with a formulaic action game, considering the amazing competition already sitting on store shelves, and the promising titles that will soon be shipping. That said, \"Unreal II\" is a very capable game, and should provide enough fps action to keep genre fans happy until the next thing rolls along. When all the hype is stripped away, it's not a great game, but a good one nonetheless.The plotline is pretty simple and unimportant. You portray a sort of intergalactic cop patrolling the backwaters of the universe, who happens upon a quest to collect the scattered pieces of an ancient alien artifact. Seeking the pieces of this artifact supplies the game with the ability to send you to various worlds, fighting various enemies, while providing minimal plot developments. It's all reason enough to play, though. Fortunately, your shipmates are rather colorful characters that you really get to know as the game progresses, since you return to your ship for briefings and chats on a fairly regular basis. It's a unique approach, and a nice change of pace, but it can be annoying as well, since the game forces you to go through these rather mundane situations a little too often. It is somewhat reminiscent of \"Soldier of Fortune 2: Double Helix\" in this regard, but implemented with a little more class and enthusiasm.On the action side of things, the game could have used more polish. Despite the stunning graphics on display, in gameplay terms this one seems dated much of the time. Your enemies display very little real intelligence, and usually just run wildly toward you or kick back and shoot at you from a distance without bothering to take any cover. On top of that, even the human characters move with a sort of superhuman speed, and their jerky gait makes them difficult to target with any precision. Of course, their stupidity will soon spell their end even so, as they'll eventually come so close within range of your weapons that you can dispatch them with relative ease. Shooting them isn't as much fun as it should be, since damage modeling is absent, and area specific damage is unpredictable. I once fired a sniper round into an opponent's knee and killed them instantly. Not exactly what I'd call realistic.The weapons are nice, and offer the capacity for alternate modes of fire, which is a plus. Even standard fps weapons feel a little fresh, as the `machine gun' exudes blue flame from its barrel and the shotgun can light enemies on fire (and yes, the fire effects are some of the best yet seen in a video game). Still, they feel a bit underpowered, thanks to the aforementioned issues. On top of that, you're sure to use some weapons far more than others - your pistol, for example, is a powerful weapon, but you are so limited by ammo that you'll rarely use it.So, given the problems I have just mentioned, how is the game fun at all? I mean, if combat is only somewhat gratifying in a game based around that combat, can it be worth the time and effort? Yes, actually, because of the game's mission design. I quickly concede that \"Unreal II\" provides some boring levels that are of the run-and-gun variety, but others force you to do more interesting things. You are often called upon to defend a given structure or person from potentially overwhelming odds - and you have laser beams and turrets that you can set up in preparation for the coming onslaught. It's like the assault and defend modes from \"Unreal Tournament,\" and it's grand fun. More shooters should take note and provide similar missions, as they are tense, exciting, and even allow for strategic thought. Another mission charges you to defend a mechanic from rampaging aliens - only you're trapped in a high tower and can only protect him with your sniper rifle, which is easier said than done. Excellent stuff, reminiscent of developer Legend Entertainment's earlier (and better) fps, \"The Wheel of Time.\" Another plus is that each planet you explore is remarkably different from the others that have come before it. Sure, you may face the same boring enemies from the previous stage, but the scenery is captivating, and it's hard not to wonder what eye candy lurks behind the next bend.\"Unreal II' has excellent sound effects, a fitting musical score, and decent voice work. Your own character's vocal resemblance to actor Vin Diesel is quite amusing, and so is the generally horrible dialogue that spills from his mouth. (The game's one-liners could almost be ripped from B-movies circa the 1980s.) Needless to reiterate, the graphics are splendid, probably some of the best you'll see until Doom III hits store shelves. However, the game's environments are not very interactive - you can't shoot out glass or destroy computer terminals or what have you. In areas such as this, the game could have benefited from more attention to detail. It's also rather easy on the normal settings, and shouldn't take too long to finish (and when it's finished, the ending is inappropriately gloomy).All in all, though, \"Unreal II\" isn't the `be-all, end-all' that Epic Megagames promised it would be (not by a long haul), but at its best, it can be a great deal of fun. At its worst, it's still a decent diversion. There are better games out there, but if you're an avid first-person shootist, you will probably get your money's worth, even at the full retail cost.Final Score: B","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2003"}

I personally got to like it after a while since it sort of goes hand in hand with your main character who you control (Hawke) actually speaking his lines, which is something I prefer that your main character do as opposed to what your character says simply appearing as unspoken text dialogue choices that appear on the bottom of the screen ... the dialogue wheel provides a sort of &#34;shorthand&#34; description that sums up what Hawke would say...It helps a LOT of you read the instruction manual, something I know most people are loathe to do  :P  and normally in a PC game you can get by without that ... but it's mandatory for dialogue, or, just do a google search for conversation icons dragon age 2 ... once you get a feel for the icons the dialogue wheel makes a lot more sense .. &#34; Oh there's a picture of a diamond next to that dialogue choice I can see Hawke is going to be charming&#34;.. &#34; Oh, there's a pic of angel wings and a halo, Hawke is going to be diplomatic&#34;... &#34; Oh, hammer striking something icon in red, Hawke is going to be aggressive.&#34;  I found it was pretty instinctive and intuitive once I got the hang of it and didn't have to bother looking at the conversation icons for long once I started playing.The other area where people might get annoyed at first (I did) is that it's not a grand sweeping &#34; You must save the ENTIRE WORLD&#34; sort of thing like Dragon Age Origins was which at first may create a &#34; why is Hawke forced to deal with all this ' little stuff ' ? &#34; sort of attitude... as critics of the game have mentioned in the past the big mistake Bioware made was naming it &#34; Dragon Age 2&#34; which immediately creates the impression it will be &#34;just like&#34; Dragon Age Origins...But what appears to initially be a weakness... to me anyways... becomes a strength as the game goes on ... the tighter focus on just Hawke as she makes her way in the world and becomes a legend in her own right.. granted a legend just within the city of Kirkwall as opposed to saving the entire world but still ... lets the game focus more on her own individual story, complete with heartbreaking moments (there's a LOT of tragedy that befalls her as the game goes by ) ..Much like Dragon Age Origins a huge reason for playing the game .. I would go so far as to say the game's primary strength... is getting to know your companions and their individual stories, and the relationship between you and your companions becoming stronger, very much &#34;in-depth&#34; as the game goes on ... I found myself genuinely caring for them as individuals much as I did in Dragon Age Origins ... as always the dialogue between characters is enormously well done and one of the major highlights of the game, I also found the voice acting to be superb... the other cool thing is that several years go by during the course of the game during which you see the characters grow and change to a certain degree as the passage of time takes it's toll .. romance between you and the characters is, as always, a strong point for the game as well.. the game is definitely tailored towards people who enjoy the whole &#34;getting into character/soap opera&#34; part of PC games .. if you enjoy that then this is THE game for you hands down.I share the frustration others have with the same maps for backgrounds being re-used over and OVER again even when it's supposed to be a totally different location.. as well I noticed the character models were re-used more often than I would have liked  though Hawke (whether male or female version) characters and those of his/her companions were, to me, well drawn and visually appealing ... if your computer can handle it though you should take advantage of the high definition texture pack put out by Bioware that your game may prompt you to download once you install the game.. I didn't see as many mods to create the absolutely &#34;gorgeous&#34; look to the character models that were present for say Dragon Age origins as far as unofficial mods but .... I was still happy enough about the way the game looked overall minor quibbles aside.  if you've played Dragon Age Origins you can input the results of your previous game into this one but ... quite honestly I found that the differences it imports into Dragon Age 2 are minor at best.. still, if you're a stickler for this... but at the same time if you run into the same difficulties I did as far as being able to import your dragon age origins save... there's a mod (unofficial) out there that lets you choose what happened in Dragon Age Origins and import those results into Dragon Age 2 you can take advantage of before starting your first game.Without giving away too many spoilers I found the emphasis on Hawke's family as major characters in the story to be refreshing, something that helps emphasize this is more the story of one person making his/her way in the world (and his/her companions of course) as opposed to the whole epic &#34; we need to save the world &#34; thing most PC games have going on .. which to me , again, his a huge plus.  If you REALLY want to find out more about what happens in-game you can read the other reviews on here but personally I find giving away too much of in-game events spoils a game for me personally :(  ..Oh also... the game has a unique approach to your companions' attitudes towards you based on the actions you take.. in Dragon Age Origins it was possible to tick a companion off so much that s/he abandoned you completely ... in DA 2 this results in what's called a &#34;rivalry&#34; which isn't always necessarily a bad thing - it's possible to have a romance with a character you have an intense rivalry going on with (sort of a love-hate relationship) which I thought was actually rather interesting..  minor spoilers here but ones that I feel don't really ruin any surprises in the game .... as far as the companions who can be romanced (not all of them can), your gender doesn't matter - for all intents and purposes I suppose Hawke and those companions can be considered bi-sexual.For those rare few new to Dragon Age &#34;companions&#34; refers to main characters who become close associates of Hawke's in the game, you can take control of them in combat, decide what their equipment is same as Hawke.. but Hawke as your main character makes all the final decisions far as what goes on in the game (though it's possible for a companion to strenuously object to Hawke's choices)... at the &#34;climax&#34; of the game at the very end the relationship you established with your companions DOES make a big difference.... again without giving away too much if you haven't done enough for the companion to have a firm 100 percent opinion of you one way or another... you might be in trouble with that companion, put it that way.Also.. and I don't feel this is too much of a spoiler either.. I found myself with a lot of extra (and consequently un-needed) cash (well gold coins but same thing) at the end of the game.. I kept thinking that some sort of in-game event would take place that would require all that money but it never did... there's so much powerful equipment around to help Hawke and his/her companions out (armor, weapons, magic rings and belts et cetera) that is either dropped by defeated enemies or just randomly lying around in some crate or barrel somewhere (?!?  .. felt that was more than a bit absurd but anyways...)  that you're going to be in good shape equipment wise anyways... still if Hawke or a companion is routinely getting hammered in combat (I found that my mage companions kept getting their butts kicked over and over again ) once you have enough money go ahead and purchase the most powerful armor or other protective equipment you can ... injury kits and health potions are definitely worth the money as well ... yes there are points where you may find it helpful to give a minor character money in order to gain information you need (or hawke simply wants to be a nice guy/girl and help the character out) .. but it's never a HUGE amount of money you need to give as a bribe or gift put it that way.This game is fairly cheap compared to the price for it when it first came out so definitely a bargain for the price ... as far as the downloadable content (DLC) you can purchase for it.. I can't comment on that one way or another since I didn't buy it but quite honestly I found the game enjoyable enough such that I didn't particularly feel the need for it.. if you're really interested I suppose you can do a google search for reviews of the DLC and see if you feel it's worth the purchase price.All in all a highly recommended game I found myself addicted to after a while.. IGN gave it a &#34; 9 out of 10&#34; rating or &#34;editor's choice&#34; and I can see why!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2014"}

It's your Uncle J!\"  You just have to love The Joker, and he's reason enough for you to buy this game.Batman: Arkham Asylum is a watershed moment for the Dark Knight himself.  It's truly a fantastic game with a superb storyline.  The graphics and cinematics are splendidly done.  The FreeFlow combat system is pretty ingenious, albeit a bit too easy to use.  Batman also has a vast plethora of gadgets available at your disposal to kick some serious thug *ss.What prevented me from giving Arkham Asylum a stellar 5-star review was the fact that not enough villains were included in the game.  I would've loved to see the Penguin, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, and the Riddler in the flesh (or the pixels, in this case).  I also felt that there should have been more boss fights.  The Titan henchmen were sort of lame, and you just fight Bane, Poison Ivy, and Joker as the three main villains.  I don't count Zsasz and Harley Quinn, since their demise was pathetic.I also found the Challenge Maps to be quite repetitive and optional at best.  For those of you who are all into getting every single trophy in the game, you may want to take a look at the Challenge Maps, but they're not necessary.  Finding every Riddler Trophy and riddle in the game is also purely an option, but they add a little spice to the fiesta.Is the game a must-buy for your PS3?  YES, but I'd suggest only buying it if you're into Batman to begin with.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000G6SPHI","description":"Sony God of War 2 PS2 God of War 2 PS2","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"The longest platform game ever made","reviewText":"God of War (GOW) was the ultimate platform game on the PS2. Before the advent of the new PS3 the developers of GOW had decided to go for a PS2 release sequel of the genre defining game. This 3D platform renaissance started with the PS1 Bruce Willis vehicle `Apocalypse' and was improved on with the jaw dropping Devil May Cry. Puzzle play enhanced by Shadowman 2. GOW was not only one of the best PS2 games of 2005, but is a big PS2 game, lasting about a week with at least two or three full days play in there. GOW set the standards very high. Can GOW II compete?The truth is that GOW II could never live up to the newness or inventiveness that GOW had, but it can do more of the same again, so nobody is left complaining. GOW lovers will have no problem coming to grips with the new split-second `mini-game' controls that had not been seen before. These `mini-games' require you to match the buttons displayed on the screen so that your character can perform a combo that results in a messy death. Not only are you required to button bash O to perform various actions (and this is real button bashing folks, so get that coffee table support ready), you must also follow through with various other button pressing timed moves, including analogue stick clockwise half turns and full anticlockwise turns that creates a very impressive array of transferring movements to beat the beasties. Included are power-ups and magical secondary weapons, wielded by the dual blades on chains swinger, Kratos, a muscle-bound ghostly white mortal turned immortal, looses his immortality and supernatural abilities which he gained in GOW and has to win them back.Starting with The City of Rhodes, Inside the Colossus, Flight to the Lair of the Titan, The Lair of the Titan, Flight to the Island of Creation, The Island of Creation, The Steeds of Time, The Temple of Lahkesis, The Bog of the Forgotten, The Temple of Euryale, The Hall of Atropis, Outside Atropis, Atlas, The Palace of the Fates, The Garden of the Gods, Underground, Temple of the Fates, The Inner Sanctum, The Summit of Sacrifice and The Loom Chamber... literally this game takes you to hell and back, which is more than a sort of a rerun of the original GOW.There is beam balancing, blade dodging, rope climbing (and along the rope battles), rock climbing (and climbing battles), orb collecting, item collecting, lever pulling, statue pushing, wall smashing and swimming. There isn't as much backtracking which GOW did suffer from and that is a good thing because it makes the gameplay more fluid. However the half way decent story that GOW had is replaced by a very convoluted GOW II story about revenge which is not bad, but hard to follow at times, but probably because this game is so long. In fact it will be the longest platform game you have ever played and if you thought GOW was long, GOW II easily outdoes it. Can it get boring? Yes it can because you have to get through so much to find out what happens in the end.Overall GOW II is more of a remake of GOW than a sequel. Many of the monsters are back again and except for a changing story, some new magic, new weapons, and new bosses, there isn't a whole pile that is different but that still doesn't mean it's bad. In fact it is far from it. It might not be the revolutionary game that GOW was but this is the #2 platform game out there. And oh yeah... Kratos gets a set of wings too! That alone means it can easily retain a solid five stars.*Note: This game is strictly for Adults only. There is Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Nudity, Strong Language and Sexual Themes.Pros:- Longest platform game ever made- Mini-games- Immense level designs- Explosive action contentCons:- Expectations of revolutionary play like mini-games will not be found.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2007"}

Name one good Batman video game, I dare you. Spider-man has had the biggest success rate in recent years, and the Hulk had a pretty good entry last year, but beyond that you're stretching things a bit. When X-Men: Legends came out a few years back, it was the start of a positive trend. Now everything has been set perfect by Marvel Ultimate Alliance.Taking a roster of over 20 different playable heroes, MUA allows the comic book fan to create dream teams never considered before. A-List heroes like Spider-Man, Captain America, the entire Fantastic Four, and Iron Man are joined by B-Listers like Ms. Marvel, Moon Knight, Doctor Strange, and even Blade. Imagine a team with Wolverine, Blade, Ghost Rider, and Deadpool...who could stop you? There are even those mega-powerful heroes like Thor, Silver Surfer, and Captain Marvel you can throw in. Oddly missing from the line-up is the Hulk, but I'm sure they had to save someone for the sequel.The storyline is simple: Doctor Doom has amassed an army of super-villains in an attempt to gain the power of Odin. Nick Fury of SHEILD gathers his own group of super folks to fight the threat. That's where you come in. Create your team from the roster available to you and go one the missions he sends you on. Along the way, you see cameos from characters you'd never have believed you'd ever see in a video game.Imagine a video game with twenty \"Non-Playable Characters\" (characters showing up in cut scenes or computer-controlled). Now scratch that, and imagine a game with 120 of them! Heavy-hitters like Galactus even make an appearance! In one mission, you actually have to save a planet he's destroying. I can't even begin to list the villains and heroes you'll see. Suffice it to say, you probably won't recognize them all, but if you're into comic books your mouth will drop at some of them. The cut scenes in this game are good, but some are just plain amazing. One in particular with Nightcrawler in Doom's Castle actually proves he just might be the best fighter of all the X-Men. It's a scene you'll be watching again and again.To top it all off, the heroes you control have different costumes to choose from. Choose wisely, because these aren't just cosmetic changes. Each costume changes the primary powers of that hero, so while Spider-man may look cool in his normal \"red-and-blues\", putting him in the black symbiote costume (the one showing up in all the trailers for the new movie) will change the way that character fights. The costume choices here are amazing too, as some of the most obscure costumes you could imagine show up center stage here. Remember Blade's very first green costume when he showed up in comics in the 70's? How about Storm's mohawk years? Captain America's World War 2 costume, Daredevil's red and yellow suit, and even the original \"cowboy version\" of Ghost Rider are playable here.As a final bonus, you can create and name your own team, populating it with whatever heroes you'd like. As you fight with your group of four, you gain reputation points which eventually allow you to add more members to your team. And you can even play with four people at a time, so everyone on the team can be a real person and do some massive damage to the enemy armies.So which cosole is the best to play this on? PS2 players get the short end of the stick with only 20 playable heroes. Next-gen consoles like the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions get two bonus heroes (Moon Knight and Colossus). In the handheld circuit, the PSP version gets four extra heroes (Hawkeye, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, and Ronin). The only downside to the PSP version is that there are times when so much is going on you can't really tell which hero you're controlling. The PS3 version wins as far as detail in display. You can actually see the threads in Spider-man's costume! I've played the game on all consoles, and have to rate the next-gen version the best.The beauty of this game is its high replay value. Because you can swap team members up and each has such distinctive power sets, the game can be played in an almost infinite number of ways.Easily my favorite video game of the year, MUA is a title no true comic fan should be without. With such an incredibly strong start, it's hard to imagine how they'll improve on it with the sequel, but I can't wait to find out!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2006"}
{"product_name":"B000TI836G","description":"","reviewerName":"Texan","summary":"Disappointing","reviewText":"The hype was high for this game. The creators touted the fact they consulted actual special ops soldiers, and the gameplay and style of the characters seem to be solid.  The problems--sometimes the graphics aren't crisp (ex: it takes awhile to have the environment load in properly- rocks are flat sometimes, grass and plants look like cardboard cut-outs, some goats at one point looked like a white blob before the level fully loaded, etc)--it may not seem like much, but the menus are dull and the multiplayer custimization is poor.  I was playing COD2 before this game was released so I could get into practice and MOH is disappointing.  I am sorry I spent sixty bucks on this, but too bad for me, I will suck it up and try to beat the game and get the achievements.I remember the first MOH game for the Playstation in 1999 and that game is better.  MOH is more of strategy driven game and I like that.  I think someone described it best on an earlier post that the developers seem to have released the game before it was complete.  I was expecting a little better graphics in multiplayer, better customization on weapons--the menus again in multiplayer are poorly developed.I will not recommed this game to anyone and I look forward to COD-Black Ops in November.  MOH wanted to reboot this franchise, but they failed.  I think I'll go back and replay MOH from 1999 and have more fun!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2010"}

Literally!","reviewText":"This is one of the most underrated games in a long time. It has been rated reasonably well by the press, but not great. I disagree. I think this game is well done, great fun, beautiful, and epic. Most of the press agrees with that statement. Criticism comes from bad AI and bugs. I played the Xbox 360 version and didn't notice any bugs really, and I noticed no AI problems.The game is in some ways a typical open-city game, very much like Grand Theft Auto (GTA) or - even more so - Mafia. If you liked one of those games, you will like The Saboteur. One of the big differences is the setting. Yes, World War II again, but not like you've ever seen it before. And the setting provides for some great opportunities that GTA and Mafia just don't have, like using massive guns to blow up Zeppelins and other massive things.To my surprise, I also found the setting to be interesting and fresh. Who cares that it is World War II again, when you get to see Paris in the early 20th century done in great detail. I love it when I see things in a game I have visited in the real world. The city is done with so much love and detail, you can spend hours just exploring and driving around (in a plethora of cars ranging from Nazi vehicles to vintage race cars). You can go anywhere you want, from the catacombs to the top of the Eiffel tower. You can find your way around Monte Matre, and so on. Very well done!And then of course, there is the art style. This game is stunning! The black & white look (with a few specks of color) of unliberated areas of Paris is amazing. And unlike many other games with unique looks, this look doesn't wear off, because as you liberate parts of Paris, color enters the world. As you go back to areas where the Nazis are strong, you go back to a black & white world. Due to this change of style, you end up being reminded of the great art style rather than growing numb to it as is the case in most other games. And not just does the style look great, it simply also makes sense, as most of the WW2 footage we see on TV is black & white. I am amazed that nobody else has thought of it before. Although on the other hand, not just does the game have a black & white look, it has a very unique b&w; look with specks of colors filled in, which gives it an amazing visual appeal.Well done Pandemic! Too bad EA shut this studio down after completing the game. Nevertheless, I am hoping for a sequel.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2010"}

Combining platforming with timing and counter based combat system, Prince of Persia is a thrill to play.The Environments and visual style is excellent.  The game is simply beautiful.  The game came out in 2008, I purchased a couple weeks ago in 2010 and the game looks absolutely fantastic.  I was blown away by the colorful environments and the overall intuitiveness of those environments.The camera is flawless. Rarely was there a time when the camera was in my way and obstructed my view.  There are also times when the camera is forced to move around rather quickly through the various plates and it swings around perfectly every time.The story is nothing short of greatness.  At first I wasn't really attached to the story but as the game progressed I really began to care about the world and characters.  The Prince (who's not really a prince and doesn't have a name I don't think) is quick witted and sarcastic but surprisingly real in his comments.  Elika, the Princess, is the perfect compliment to him as they quip back and forth in a humorous yet genuine and serious way.  And as they start to grow on each other, they start to grow on you.  Great stories in games in my opinion have the \"oh hell naw!\" moment.  That's the moment where something happens, usually bad, and you say \"oh hell naw\" and then make it a point to \"avenge\" or \"correct\" the disrespect.  That happened twice in this game.The characters animations are seamless whether crawling on roofs, running on walls, swinging, sliding, jumping or climbing, they are agile and fluid.People complain about the ease of the game.  The game isn't hard but it's challenging if that makes sense.  Pretty much the animations take care of themselves in combat and platforming.  Elika is there to help you double jump.  However lining up jumps, timing wall running, timing attacks and blocks etc require that you have to at least pay attention to what you're doing or meet doom.Speaking of doom, there's no dying in the traditional sense.  You die, but you don't DIE if you catch my drift.  No matter what happens Elika always \"saves\" you.  So if you jump off a cliff Elika will grab you and return you to the previous checkpoint.  Or if a boss \"kills\" you Elika will shine some light on them to get them off you and the boss' energy will be restored.  So you do die...it just doesn't stop the gameplay.  It eliminates the load screen and a war quote (as in Call of Duty) or Joker making fun of you (Batman Arkham Asylum) etc. Arkham Asylum has a similar mechanism with the grapple hook and some other games have that type of thing as well.It's Open World in that you can go anywhere right off the bat but you have to collect orbs in order to unlock Elika's powers that help you progress through the game into different areas.  You can unlock the powers in any order and the order you do so changes the experience in environments.  Each \"boss\" releases a different type of corruption into the world.  So if you choose a different power to unlock first, traversing the world will be different than if you chose a different power.  For example depending on what power you unlock, platforming in a corrupted area may or may not have flying, moving, or reaching corruption to get you.  It's hard to explain but if you play the game you'll understand it easier.Prince of Persia is fun.  You spend a lot of time platforming and engaging in story but the story is gripping, characters are interesting, and the world is well designed and looks great.  I would easily recommend this game and I'm upset I didn't catch on earlier.  I really hope there's a sequel to this game because we do sorta have a cliffhanger ending.  I do understand there is DLC for this game and I plan on getting that in the near future.  Anyways this game is highly recommended.  5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2010"}

She has thwarted their dastardly efforts before. She stopped them from amassing an army of Metroids and she kept Mother Brain from retrieving the last known Metroid larva. Now she must face the Space Pirates once again in an all-new adventure.","reviewerName":"Anthony Peak","summary":"Samus fans, rejoice!","reviewText":"I'll admit, just like everyone else when Metroid Prime was announced to be a 3d FPS I gave up hope. I thought it would obviously be the biggest mistake in the Metroid series. As the game progressed and the screenshots started coming out though, I became curious. And now that I've played through the game, I can say for sure: It is the best Metroid game to date. Bar none.Prime is not actually a FPS, despite how it looks. It's not Halo, it's not even Half Life style. It shares more with Zelda 64, in fact. What I mean is that most all fighting is done via a lock on system. The game is far more based on adventure, strategy, and tactics. It's not based at all on aim, and very little on reflexes. It feels exactly like the Metroid series should. The 3d world feels completely natural. You'll spend a good deal of time doing jumps from ledge to ledge like before, but it's done perfectly in 3d. You'll never have to blindly leap, your view follows the leap perfectly.The graphics are incredible, the best on the Gamecube to date. You might not be too impressed on the first level, but as you play through the game you'll see just why the graphics are so groundbreaking. It's hard not to be amazed when you jump out of a lake and water streams down the front of Samus's visor. The first time you try the Thermal visor or the X-ray visor, you'll be thrown for a loop. It's simply stunning. The bosses are incredible looking, and the game never skips a beat. Loading is done seamlessly as you move through the map, so you'll never see a loading bar even once.The sound is incredible as well, you'll always be able to hear the enemies and the explosions without effort. The music fits the mood perfectly and never feels out of place. It's a perfect mix of old and new, sure to please any fan.It's amazing, but playing the game you actually truly do feel like Samus Aran. When playing most FPS style games, you don't actually feel anything like the character you're suppose to be. Just a hand and a gun. But as I said, this isn't a FPS. Every single piece of your view is designed to be exactly what Samus Aran sees. From the HUD on her Visor to the amazing way effects like rain splats on the helmet, you are in the power suit. You'll never question it, and nothing is ever out of place. Samus never talks in the game, but you'll never question it's her.The game's best power ups are still in there, new and improved, along with several all new enhancements. Now instead of the freeze beam or pulse beam taking over your gun, you'll always be able to switch between each gun with the click of a key. You'll have to use every weapon in your inventory to take on the game's enemies through the multiple and ever changing environments. Each gun interacts with the world exactly as it should... the freeze gun freezes, the pulse gun will drive electronics into a frenzy, the plasma gun melts and sets aflame whatever you blast in an instant. It's truly amazing.You always have a 3d map available to help guide you through the world. And believe me, you'll need it. Without the map this game would have been a dull boring maze. With this map, getting from point A to point B across several environments is a breeze. You'll constant have at least a good idea of where to go, as hints will appear on your map telling you to investigate energy spikes, unusual activity, and the like.The game's story isn't the most detailed or anything, but it's very entertaining and will keep you hoping for more bits and pieces at every turn. The story reveals the mystery of the planet, the strange space craft and bodies you find at the very start of the game, as well as the past of Samus Aran herself. You'll know more than ever before by the end of this game, and will look back on the older games with new understanding. The storyline fits perfect with the rest of the series and doesn't feel out of place in the slightest.Samus has some new abilities that both help the story along, and make perfect sense for a bounty hunter of her skill and experience. Using your visor, you can scan computers or other electronics and the power suit will hack any security in no time flat. This is used for everything from opening force fields, and shutting down turret guns. Best of all is hacking computers to read messages and files and figure out what the heck is going on. The visor scans other items in the same fashion. It will translate carvings in walls, scan weaknesses in structures, scan enemies for weaknesses, and just about anything else you come across.All in all, this game in unmatched on the Gamecube. It's by far the best Gamecube game today, and the best Metroid game to date. That may be hard to swallow, but try it and see for yourself. You'll be amazed. The game is roughly 20 some game hours, which translates into 30 some real world hours. A dedicated player can beat it in a week, but a casual gamer could play for a month. If you replayed the old Metroids, you'll probably replay this. If not, you probably won't reply this one either. But either way you'll have one amazing trip from the title screen to the ending sequence.- Rirath_com","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2003"}

King \"The super mario nerd\"","summary":"Adventurous, Gripping, And Awesome.","reviewText":"If you havent played this game....well just order it now and see why. This is an amazing, perhaps my top five favorite game made. What is it you ask? Well its just a beautiful/spine chilling first person shooter that takes you from the depths of Magmoor Caverons to the frozen Phendrana Drifts. This is like when metroid woke up from the dead because no Metroid game was made on a home system since Super metorid which was also amazing. Then followed by Metroid 2: Return of Samus on GB. And boy has it came back to life for a good reason. The graphics are crystal clear for a GameCube game in 2001. Better than most ps2 shooter games that you would see at the time and future. Anyway, you are samus and you land on tallon IV after an explosion. There you travel around fighting mini bosses, bosses and regular enimies for those of you who havent played Metroid. This game like all other Metroid games do require allot of mental puzzle minded thinking or else you will get stuck or not know what to do next. It was quite hard for me to beat when i was young. Walkthoughs help allot. The story is very amazing that will keep you hooked on playing for months untill beat and then you will want to beat it again. The atmospheres change from underground volcanic, frozen snowdrifts, rainy nature, to ancient ruins. Each containing several attachments and upgrades for your suit. The further you go, the better stuff you need. Like all other metroid games this one has very soothing and upbeat music that strangly comforts you. The story should take you a good 10-20 hours depending on how you game and every millisecond is worth it. Sadly there is no other mode to do however you can hook up a completed metroid fusion gameboy game to the GameCube and play the original Metroid on the NES and you can even save on it. So if you love adventure/puzzle games, spend the ten bucks and play it. You wont be dissapointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2011"}

It include 150 stages and 12 party games, which are: Monkey... racing, fight, target, bowling, golf, billards, shot, dogfight, tennis, soccer, baseball, and boat.If you are unfamiliar to SMB, the game is kind of like \"Marble Madness\" because you have a monkey in a ball and you tilt the course to roll the ball to the finish line.  Sometimes this can be difficult because of narrow bridges and slopes, moving objects, and switches.The regular game is loads of fun, but I must warn you that if you are an easily frusterated gamer, you might not like it.  There are some stages that are quite difficult and require lots and lots of tries to beat them, but it is worth the effort.The Party games is where SMB 2 is really fun.

Leon Scott Kennedy (from RE2) is back but not in Racoon City But in Europe Possibly Spain on a top secret mission \"to save the presidents daughter\". The Game from beginning to End is without a soubt amazing and scary. I suggest you get the PS2 version because although it has less appealing graphics, it does have much more extras such as the new mini game-Seperate Ways which explains the more confusing parts of the story. New costumes With Leon wearing a mafia type suit and Ashley wearing an armor which is extremly helpful because the enemies can't hurt her or pick her up and take her away because she's so heavy wearing that armor. Plus new weapons like the Cross Bow-Gun (seperate ways only) which is an explosive cross bow, and P.R.L.412 laser cannon which is a gun that shoots powerful electric/lasers at the enemies. I highly reccomend this game to all types of gamers because it really is that good.P.S.But if you own the first one on the Gamecube version then there is no reason for YOU guys to get this version","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2006"}

You can buy every weapon, go back to easier parts and see how each weapon \"fights\". You have light/heavy & short/long with different damage. You also have the option of using different spells. This is for those like me who want to prolong the game. I can't block/roll(.. physically disabled), so I go the \"best defense is a good offense\" strategy. You have many options how to win = you can thus make the game more difficult or easy based on your decisions.* Weapons - many choices. Light/Heavy; Short/Long; low damage/high damage; Augmentstions etc... You can try differnet weapons out per whatever part of the game; if you want to proplong the the adventure :-). Some weapons just plain look cool !* Spells - well, I have my favorites, but tried them all. Some work much better than others vs certain enemies. You can pick and choose !. I believe you can beat the game with only 3, but I used my favorite 6 = to spice things up.* Story - well thought out.* Battles - many major fights* XP/Gem runs - I can think of 3 spots where you can increase these important categories. Nice when added to a game !* Bugs - only a few desktop crashes; XP/SP2All in all, you are not overwhelmed with too many options.Just get in there and fight :-)Bad:* Voiceovers - sounded like 1-2 people did all the voices* Women/Villagers - basically the same model* Romance - well, one giggles and talk; the other actually seems to enjoy you. The third option for a wife is a special NPC and seems to be reading from a poor romance novel. Ok, you can hit the ESC button ?If they wanted to go down this path, the designers should have put more variety/work into this option.Why no romance with Whisper ... would have fit the story + changed the same-nessWhy no romamce with Briar Rose - as as above.Why no romance with a Bordello lady - same as above. Wouldn't fit with the story, but changed the same-ness. If you decide to give them a refuge, shouldn't the ladies talk to you; be open to romance ? They just stood there and posed.Why can't I buy clothes for my wives ... could buy a dress for myself* Maps - I liked the trek from the Guild to Oakvale: much to do and fight. I would go back and forth several times. Hoped to run into Nymphs :-)Seems once you get to Knothole Glade, you really don't feel the need to go roaming and look for something to fight/do. Ok, you have the Arena; lots of fun here = unless you hero save, you do it once.Hook Coast - just part/path of the final showdownSnowspire - well, it's it if you do the last soul.What was the point of talking to villagers; getting married etc, you spent no time in these places.There could have been a cave or forrest or swamp; or a combination to give one something to do while in these villages.Seems the final 1/3 of the game is just \"rushed upon you\" ... you feel like; \" might as well and just keep questing\" and get this over with.I would have liked to slow down, wander around; etc...If you didn't have the equipment/spells by now, you won't get them by coming to Hook Coast/Snowspire. All I can remember of value would be some xp or \"boosting potions\".If they were just quest driven locals, then only the map would be needed = I saw no reason to get a wife; buy anything at this point* Hero Save - ok if you want to do xp/key runs. I've heard of crashing problems if you over do it. But, in those longer/tougher quests, do you really want to redo several hours if you die or want to stop ?I'm on my 6th replay = about 240hrsSo, I obviously like this game.Just I see room for improvement by adding or subtracting = taking the middle, I feel the designers weakend the overall experienceBTW, Fable 2 is in the works(... for Xbox) = I hope they don't go crazy with the system requirements once it comes to the PC.

With corpses returning to life and survivors stopping at nothing to maintain their own safety, protecting an orphaned girl named Clementine may offer him redemption in a world gone to hell.A continuing story of adventure horror spanning across 5 episodes.Episode 1 &ndash; A New DayEpisode 2 &ndash; Starved for HelpEpisode 3 &ndash; Long Road AheadEpisode 4 &ndash; Around Every CornerEpisode 5 &ndash; No Time Left","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"One of the most heart wrenching experiences","reviewText":"I actually played this game and reviewed each individual episode so I will list them all.Episode 1: A New DayTelltale Games is famous for turning hit franchises (Jurassic Park, Back to the Future) into adventure games, and now The Walking Dead is among them. This game is based off of Robert Kirkman's award-winning comic series. The Walking Dead is quite different from other adventure games, due in large part to constant rough decisions and cinematic action. That is why this game is something special and worthy of the hype it has been receiving.Telltale chose to put every single action and decision in your hands, and the experience is enthralling. Think of this as a shooter, but instead of enemies with guns, it is choices. Most are timed, some long, some short, but you need to choose quickly. Usually, there are four choices that will change things throughout the episodic series, and its scope depends on how you decide to resolve the action. The game starts out in a sheriff's car, and there are a number of emergency vehicles driving around. Suddenly, a zombie crosses the highway; the car strikes the zombie and crashes in the woods. You are then immediately thrown into the action with zombies quickly closing in on the crash site. The first scene has you trying to grab a shotgun on your left and a shell on your right. You go to put the shell in, but you drop it as a zombie is crawling towards you. This is shown in a first-person view to add tension and suspense. You turn the camera and click on the shotgun shell to try again, cock the gun, and blow the zombie's brains out. All this happens in the first two minutes of gameplay.The game is packed full of sequences like this, but is nicely paced; there are some areas where you can wander around and explore, like most adventure games. Usually, this involves gathering a few items to continue on, but the game focuses on conversations, and there is a choice to be made for almost everything you say. A hint will pop up at the top of the screen telling you how the character reacted, how important it was, and to tell you that this choice will affect something later on. Some of the choices are so drastic that they change how the entire episode plays out. The decision to save certain people happens so quickly that you only get a few seconds to decide. In some instances, you only have a few seconds to determine the entire course of the game.As you would expect, there is plenty of zombie killing, but it is done in a more realistic way than other games. There may be times where you will have to sneak around, trying to figure out how to take out zombies as inconspicuously as possible. There will be tools in the area that you have to somehow get without alerting the zombies. These tasks are cleverly designed puzzles, and it integrates with the story seamlessly, keeping you engaged with the game at all times. Stabbing and killing zombies feels satisfying thanks to clever camera work, which puts you right in the front seat of the action.The game will keep you hooked, and you won't want to quit. The voice acting is great, with a comic book art style to help bring the world to life. The only complaint would be that the game is lacking technically, featuring low resolution textures, poor sound quality in spots, and some glitches (stuttering and hang-ups). However, this shouldn't irk you enough to turn the game off out of frustration, and hopefully, a patch will come along for the hiccups.Overall, The Walking Dead: Episode 1 is a great start to a possibly great series. With engaging cinematic camera work mixed in with great storytelling, you will be hooked. If you can look past the dated visuals and technical flaws, you will be in for one of the best zombie treatments since Left 4 Dead and Dead Island. Thankfully, this game pushes the zombie genre in a new direction. We look forward to seeing what our choices will ultimately bring at the end of the series.Episode 2: Starved for HelpThe Good: Expands character's personalities, some really heavy choices, great pacingThe Bad: Puts zombies on the back burner, not as many shocking moments as the first episode, not as gameplay heavyThe first episode was just amazing and had some shocking moments. I have been waiting for this episode, but I feel a little let down this time around. Lee and the gang need to find food because they ran out at the motel they are holding down. You go to try to find food and wind up on a dairy farm, but the food isn't exactly what you think it might be. There aren't as many shocking moments and they don't come as surprising as in the first episode. The big moments are more dialog choices than actual gameplay which is disappointing. One moment does have you chopping off a guys leg stuck in a bear trap, but other than that the other moments are pretty typical like yanking a gun out of a guys hand. In fact there aren't even really that many zombies in this episode, they kind of take a back seat for the internal struggle on the farm.The game plays out exactly the same, but there are less exploring segments, and even less puzzle solving. In fact this mainly felt like an interactive animated episode more than an adventure game. Not to say that is bad, but fans of the first episode may find it disappointing. There are some more important choices you have to make and that is probably the biggest switch from the first episode. Some changes actually determine the lives of a few characters you probably got attached to. Episode 2 does what this series is doing best and that's slowly drawing the characters personalities out and constantly making you question how you feel about them.The game isn't so much as tense gameplay wise, but story wise. The whole time I was surprised when something did happen. You are thrown important choices and need to make decisions quick at times when you least expect them and they really make you think. Almost every choice I had such a hard time picking because some times the right thing to do isn't the best thing to do. A lot of times I wondering how that would affect me later on in the series.Overall, Episode 2 doesn't have as much action or surprising moments, but it expands the character's personalities, and gives you some seriously heavy situations that force you to make big decisions. The episode also puts zombies on the back burner for the problems on this farm and the group so be prepared for that.Episode 3: Long Road AheadThe Good: Huge plot changes, choices from past two episodes really start showing here, some bugs finally ironed out, perfectly paced, a lot of shocking momentsThe Bad: Still way too short, still not enough zombies, needs a bit more action stillThe Walking Dead is probably my favorite adventure series of all time. It surpasses most adventure game clich&eacute;s like inventory management, tank controls, and disjointed pacing. The Walking Dead: Episode 3 is well paced, and there are some of the toughest choices you have to make. Things get very serious this time around because the group is starting to lose their mental stability. There's a lot of internal fighting and you must decide how this all turns out.The group is trying to get to Savannah, Georgia because things at the motel didn't work out so well. They find a train engine that takes them part way, but I won't say anymore. There are a few major areas you can explore with a few simple puzzles, but like usual the opening is awesome and I played through this entire episode and wanted the next one right away. There are three new characters introduced, but at the same time a few people in the group die. Who or how is up to you, but you will be shocked at how this all turns out. I actually had to pause the game with my mouth agape due to the shocking turns and mainly how it actually happened.There's more zombie killing this time around, but not nearly as much as the first episode. I found myself glued to my computer more than Episode 2 and I felt like the story was actually progressing better. A lot of bugs are also starting to get ironed out such as the constant stuttering during cut scenes and some control issues. You won't be exploring much, just in the main puzzle areas, but this is OK because of how much the story advances through dialog choices. This is about the time where a lot of your choices from the last two episodes will really start blossoming here. Some choices I made actually determined huge plot changes and I realized either I shouldn't have done something or wish I did do something, but that's the excitement of this series. You feel like you are playing a movie and directing it yourself.I just can't wait for the fourth episode because things will really start going downhill from there. This episode is a huge turning point for the story, and every fan will want more.Episode 4: Around Every CornerThe Good: Great pacing, a lot of new characters, more action oriented, more zombies, very intense atmosphere, a lot of new areasThe Bad: Most new characters are hard to care for, not enough meaningful choices to be made, not as much involvement this time aroundNow that we are almost done with this series I am sad that the next one will be it. Episode 4 sees the gang trying to get on a boat and out of Savannah, Georgia, but things don't go as planned. There are a bunch of new characters this time around, but most are hard to care for because they make brief appearances. By this point most or a little of your gang will be with you, but this episode is mainly lacking the suspenseful choices like in the last one. We get bigger areas to explore, a little more action, and finally, a ton of zombies.The series has been lacking any zombies lately and has just dealt with internal turmoil, but Episode 4 skirts this and brings the gang back to realizing that the zombies are the real threat here. There's a strange calm before the storm within the group, the conversations are tense and borderline everyone going postal on each other. I found that there was  a lack of gameplay here and it focused more on delivering story, but that is ok in this series. There is more action with some zombie shooting, action oriented puzzles, and larger areas to explore. I sat through the whole episode in one go because it was so intense and entertaining, you always want to know what is going to happen next.The new characters are hard to really like except Molly because of her shady personality. The new guys are brief and seem pretty generic. I really don't care for Christa or Omid who we met at the end of the last episode. Christa is selfish and Omid is boring and just seems useless. What grows even more is the characters you have right now from the original group, Clementine and Lee's relationship really blossom here and their trust will be tested.This episode is just a mish-mash of everything from the past ones, lots of zombies, action, large areas, new characters, and tense conversations but nothing very serious. What has stayed the same throughout is the constant intense atmosphere that makes you stay in the game and you never want to quit until it's over. This is my favorite adventure series of all time. The game puts you in control just enough to make you feel like you made all the important choices. The game has been built up to the climax, and the cliffhanger ending here is so abrupt and so sudden that you just hang your end knowing you have to wait another month or two for the last episode. This is just like a good TV series, but better.Episode 5: No Time LeftThe Good: A lot of shocking moments, heart wrenching ending scenario, all previous choices lead up to some big eventsThe Bad: Just an hour long, same issues persist, cliffhanger endingThe Walking Dead has been a gripping and highly entertaining adventure game thus far, so now that the season finale is here we can see how every choice you made stacks up. Thankfully choices have impacted things throughout the series instead of stacking them up for the end. A few from each episode will affect this episode, but I have to say that this episode is extremely heart wrenching and the most shocking of them all, not to mention the shortest.Lee and your surviving gang are on their way to save Clem from a mysterious man who snatched her up. They leave their boat behind for a bit to go find her, but things go completely downhill because the zombies are in the thousands and not to mention all the shocking moments that lead up the end. Something happens every 20 minutes or so that will make you set your controller down and take a breather and say, \"How did that happen?!\" That's how great this series is. Each character is memorable and you will either love them or hate them depending on your choices. The system Telltale set up is so organic and smooth that you don't really notice your choice caused this until you really think. That is excellent game design, but I will take some time to address issues that I have held off until now.Firstly, the graphics are pretty dated which I mentioned in the first episode. The art style looks like the comics, but the graphics are about 7 years old. There's hitches and stuttering often which never got addressed. Each episode is extremely short, but this one clocks in at just a measly hour. Why this is a stand alone episode is beyond me, they could have just made this series four episodes. The pacing is also all over the place. Episode 2 was probably the most disappointing of them all, and Episode 4 was lacking in the shocking moments department. There's also no challenge in the game with this just being an interactive experience. This is one of my favorite adventure games of all time, but I would like to see some serious upgrades in Season 2.With all that said Episode 5 ends on a cliffhanger and who knows when we will find out what's happened next. With seeing how successful this series was I'm sure Season 2 will start pouring out through next year starting in spring. Episode 5 is very touching and after you finish the game you will realize that Season 2 will start with a whole new cast of characters. As it stands Episode 5 delivers a great ending and you really feel satisfied with your journey through Savannah and will sit back and wait for Season 2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2012"}

This is a perfect port of the original Super Mario Bros. Every last mushroom and goomba is accounted for, and you'll feel yourself slipping into a blissful recollection of your early days as a gamer. Just don't expect anything revolutionary here. The closest thing to newness is the ability to link up with another GBA to play with a friend, but don't worry. Two-player is still available on just one unit. If you're looking for innovation, check out the excellent Deluxe version on Game Boy Color. But for purists, this is the cream of the crop in retro goodness. So, if you're willing to drop the 20 gold coins for this one, enjoy your trip down memory lane.Rated:9 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerIssue:June 2004Subscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"The Bros. First Adventure is Back!","reviewText":"Way back in 1985, Super Mario Bros. was a revolutionary game that defined the ever-popular 2D sidescrolling adventure.  Age certainly hasn't slowed Super Mario Brothers down one bit. In fact, since this is part of the classic NES it means its a direct port of the original Mario game.  This means it was before Saving was thought of.The graphics may not hold up a candle to what the GBA is capable of but that's because this is the &quot;classic&quot; NES series.  This isn't meant to showcase what the GBA can do. This is meant for nostalgia and it is perfectly captured on the GBA this way.As I said, it's a direct port straight from the NES to your GBA. But it does have one downside. For one, it seems that because of the GBA's screen some things had to be squashed just to be in proportion. This is very noticeable when you rescue the many toads in the castles.This shouldn't stop you from picking up the game but that's exactly where the other problem lies.  Like other classics in the Classic NES series, Super Mario Bros. has already been released several times!  If you have a copy of Super Mario Brothers Deluxe that'll do just fine.I'd easily say this is worth it to put down 20 bucks if you want the original classic.  But if you have Super Mario Brothers Deluxe or an E-Reader you may want to grab Zelda instead.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2004"}

Players need to see what is going around them all the time especially in the wide forrest. And the only way to let them see that is using the 360 degrees camera angle where you could navigate with the L3 anolog stick to see practically everywhere you want to see. Up down and the surroundings. Players could click the L3 to get back to the original camera angle if they want to. Put this feature in MGS3 and it will get a perfect score 10/10. With the overhead camera angle, I am sure that I am not the only one who got shot at often whithout even knowing where my enemies are shooting from.

{"product_name":"B001NX4DUQ","reviewerName":"James Skemp \"JamesRSkemp.com\"","summary":"Enjoyable, but quick, with some annoying platforming","reviewText":"As I continue playing games that received less than critical acclaim, I found myself playing Dante's Inferno for the Xbox 360.Dante's Inferno tells the story of Dante who journeys through Hell to save his beloved Beatrice. As we progress through the story we learn more about Dante himself, and why it is that he doesn't seem so out of place in this land.The story is rather well done, with a mix of CGI and animation telling parts of the story. The cast is fairly strong, with each character having a rather distinctive character.The play style is similar to God of War, but the button mashing sequences are relatively few and far between, with the majority of them being rather easy. For this reason, if you enjoy God of War, but find it aggravating, you may find comfort in this game.Moves include a weapon, long range cross, magic, dash, and a basic comboing system. There are two distinct trees containing skills and bonuses that can be unlocked, with both trees being completely unlocked if you play through the game more than once. Relics can also be found and equipped granting various bonuses.Altogether this resulted in a fairly enjoyable experience.The one thing that I didn't necessarily care for is the platforming, which due to a 'stationary' camera, can get rather annoying, rather fast. However, save points are such that only one area drove me to replay approximately 30 seconds of an area almost a dozen times.Seemingly the PlayStation 3 version is slightly superior, but for the price at which it is currently available, I'm happy with my 360-version purchase.Over the course of 5 days Dante's Inferno provided a little over 7 hours of gameplay, and 850 of 1000 achievements. I played only the first half or so on the normal difficulty, switching down to casual only to move through the game faster.I'll give this game 3 of 5 stars since it's enjoyable, but may not stay in my collection after I pick up the last few achievements, if I decide to do that (which I probably will).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"Paradigm ~M~","summary":"I love My PS4 but there are still some wrinkles to iron out.","reviewText":"I would like to start by saying that I do love having my PS4 but there are a few issues that could be fixed.Yes, I did delete my previous review because a troll decided to try and get a rise out of me (and he did) and it turned into a lot of arguing back and fourth. Needless to say he has been added to my ignore list. So I am re-posting with out all the arguing because well it just isn't needed.First, Sony seems to have broke the BlueTooth feature, the former PlayStation remote does not work and the Logitech Harmony Ultimate will not work with the PS4. This is absolutely a PS4 issue as the remote works great for the PS3 and the X-1. This has proven to be very frustrating but I do not use my PS4 for movies so this is not a huge issue, I just thought it worth mentioning.Secondly, any downloaded apps and games are just thrown on to one screen, the PS4 has zero organization capabilities! For most this probably is not a big issue but I am a bit OCD-ish when it comes to organization and the lack of it on the PS4 is a headache (especially once you acquire more than a few games. The PS3 you could place games into different albums and then set it to reorganize by albums and I loved having this option! This for me is the biggest issue, if Sony fixes this in an update then it would definitely improve my rating. There are also no themes, you are stuck with the PS4 UI, which isn't much (themes are fun and nice to change things up but trivial).The battery life on the PS4 controllers is terrible and I have had to get two controls just so I can have one charging at all times. Giving the option to turn off the Lightbar would probably help a bit. I am aware we can now dim it but we still cannot turn it off. The touch-pad may factor in a bit to the battery life as the control seems to drain really quick when the touch-pad is in heavy use but games that do not use the touch-pad do not drain the battery as fast as the ones that do. I beleive that battery consumption from the touch-pad is minimal when it is not being used so I am not 100% why the controls seem to drain so quickly. I suppose it is possible that I have a faulty charge station that is messing up my battery. I would like to hear from others on if you experience this issue or not.The PS4 is Sony's first console that has zero backwards compatibility, which for the most part is not a big deal as I have no interest in playing old PS1 and PS2 titles but I feel that any NextGen Console should at the very least be backwards compatible with the most recent Previous Gen console (PS4 should be backwards compatible with PS3 but that is the extent of it). I just had to purchase a new PS3 because my old one passed away and I would much rather pay a little extra to have my PS4 be able to play PS3 titles instead of having to buy a new ps3 or a new ps4 anytime one dies.If you are wanting a console to use for streaming movies then you should go with the PS3 or X-1. The PS4 is not the media super center that its predecessor was. I use Plex for my Roku and PS3 and I have read that it is supposed to work on the PS4 but I can never seem to get it to work. Again, not a big issue if you stream to another device.You will at this point in time find that some game producers are still doing PS3 only and not PS4 two titles that  instantly come to mind are the South Park game and the Borderlands Prequel. Yes there are more but there is little need to list them all, if you want to know if a new game will be on the PS4 just do a search on it ;) **Please read what I say here and not try to add your own twist to it. The PS4 plays games and it does it well, I am in no way saying that the PS4 does not play games! Although I am not sure if others have this issue or maybe I have a fault somewhere but it seems that for every 24 hours that I play on the PS4 a game will eventually crash and my PS4 gives me a blue screen error.I think that the PS4 has huge potential but it still has some ironing out to do. The consoles hardware is great and like the PS3 Sony makes it easy to swap out hard drives and upgrade your storage which is a pretty awesome feature! However the software still needs some work.So, if you are on the fence about making the purchase do your research and see if the issues are worth it to you. If you are unsure give it a while and we will hope that these issues start getting resolved sooner rather than later. If you are a gamer and want the PS4 just for gaming and nothing else and you do not care about the lack of organizational options then you would probably be quite pleased with your purchase.I would also like to note before starting that this is my review. They are my opinions based on my experience with the PS4 console...it should go without saying but some people don't seem to understand that but my reviews will always be my opinions and experience about the product. If you want specs read Amazon's description, go to the Sony website and read the reviews from others. As I said these are my opinions and the things that bother me may not be a big deal for you. That being said if you want to jump in and give your 2 cents be it for or against what I say then by all means. I just ask that you be respectful and polite about it and I will do the same, I have a very low tolerance for rude, mean and disrespectful people. Having a little respect and good manners is not asking to much.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00I5LMSE2","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"Kirby returns to his handheld roots in glorious fashion. Triple Deluxe indeed.","reviewText":"I have long been a fan of Kirby.Kirby's Dream Land 2was one of the first video games I ever played as a child. The first two Kirby's Dream Land games (alongsideTLoZ: Link's AwakeningandPokemon Blue) were my go-to games on road trips and for cool-down/relaxation after long days of swimming/hiking/adventuring in the hot summers where I grew up. I'd even play them for hours into the night when I was supposed to be sleeping, huddled under my bedroom lamp with myGame Boy Pocketand later my GBC and GBA. Needless to say, I have always loved Kirby, whether it istraditional Kirbyorexperimental Kirby, so OF COURSE I was going to get Kirby Triple Deluxe immediately as soon as my local *cough cough* opened on release day. After all, a traditional Kirby game like this in the handheld format where he started simply must be played if you're a fan of Nintendo's famous puffball. Let me tell you, I have loved every single second of my time with Triple Deluxe (henceforth called KTD in this review). It's a great new addition to the Kirby mythos.The story in KTD is rather strange and novel. You see, King Dedede has been kidnapped by some nefarious spider-like being named Taranza, who arrived in a giant \"dreamstalk\" that has left Pop Star quite disheveled. Kirby has taken it upon himself to rescue his sometimes-foe/friend-forever and it goes from there. Stories in Kirby games have always been simplistic affairs, designed to introduce the awesome gameplay and presentation and then take a step back to let that shine, and it does that here very well. I DO like that you're rescuing Dedede though. That's a really neat new idea. The story develops nicely too, introducing some twists and turns that are pretty decent toward the end. I liked it.The core of the gameplay feels like an improvement on Kirby's last outing,Kirby's Return to Dream Land(which, as you can tell by my review on there, I also loved immensely). In fact, KTD kind of feels like a spiritual sequel to that fantastic Wii game. As you'd expect from a traditional Kirby game, you'll be inhaling enemies, coping their abilities by viciously digesting them OR star-shooting them back out, slide kicking, floating, etc. You know the drill. There's something very cathartic and viscerally satisfying about this formula, and the way KTD not only refines it but also builds upon it is genuinely thrilling. The controls here are smooth as silk. The game is just so delightfully FUN to play! Boss fights are tense and feel like fights between titanic rivals. I really love the deceptive simplicity of old-school Kirby gameplay. Each of the roughly 25 copy-abilities (that's a lot!) has a startling number of moves depending on the control-context you use them in, so there's plenty of fun to be had with this game. There are several new copy-abilities that have been added in this outing. The bow-and-arrow, complete with a dashing Robin Hood-esque feathered cap, is my personal favorite. There are also some new abilities you can use such as \"hypernova\" mode which amplifies Kirby's inhalation exponentially, causing him to suck in trees, huge projectiles to fire back, and otherwise unmovable objects. It's pretty fun.The biggest addition to the gameplay in this one is the emphasis on 2.5-D platforming. Utilizing the 3-D in the 3DS to great effect, you'll be jumping between the foreground and background frequently in the levels as you play. I love2.5-D elements in platformers, and its inclusion here adds a nice sense of freshness to the traditional Kirby experience. As a bonus, it makes the 3-D effect look even more stunning and memorable. I really enjoyed this. As was the case with the aforementioned Return to Dreamland, KTD has tons of collectibles and special items that definitely fleshes the game out for those who like to hunt for such things and be completionists. I fall into that category, so I have really enjoyed that aspect. It's also worth mentioning that, once you beat the game, you can play through it as King Dedede if you so desire, in a mode called \"Dedede Tour.\" He plays very similarly to the way he did in Kirby's Return to Dreamland with his hammer, and the difficulty seems to be amped up by quite a bit too. I really enjoyed this inclusion, as King Dedede is a character I've always had affection for. There are a couple other modes included as well. One is a platforming/rhythm hybrid and the other is basically Kirby Smash Bros. These are really fun, but they're admittedly nonessential to the overall enjoyment of the game. Think of them as bonuses.The presentation in this game is wonderful. It utilizes the same kind of graphics that KRTD had to stunning effect on the 3DS screen (it may even be the same engine, which is even more impressive on a handheld). This game is gorgeously colorful and is full of the kind of childlike whimsy we all love (WITHOUT SHAME) Kirby for. I love the beautiful pastel colors that are so abundant in this game. So many of the environments in this game made me smile. Really, almost everything in the game's presentation made me smile. The characters and their animations are all so delightfully endearing. I love the many different forms Kirby takes on with each ability he copies. It's games like this that reinforce my belief that emphasis on timeless, vibrant art design is better for a game's look than trying to be hyper-realistic (those games always age poorly and quickly). This game is simply a delight visually. As I said earlier, the 3-D effect is really neat looking in this game. The sound design is also well done. This may be my favorite soundtrack in a Kirby game sinceKirby Super Star Ultra. It's undeniably catchy and in that old-school Kirby style that is quick and pumps you up for pink puffball action! The stuff that isn't fast-paced is downright moody, atmospheric, even haunting at times (that final boss theme... wow). I love it all. The presentation in this game is awesome. Bravo to the developers for their great work here!All-in-all, I think we have a winner with Kirby Triple Deluxe. It's a fun, frantic journey to Pop Star that delivers everything you could want and hope for from a Kirby game. I also really enjoyed all the new gameplay elements, both minor and fairly major, that this game adds to the Kirby pathos. If you're like me and you grew up playing and loving the Kirby series,from his humble rootsto his most recent adventures, then I guarantee you'll love Kirby Triple Deluxe. My recommendation? Buy it, devour this incredibly fun game, and enjoy every juicy pink second of Kirby's newest adventure.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2014"}

{"product_name":"B000AB603U","description":"It's the dawn of a new age in real-time strategy (RTS) games. A brave New World is rising--a hostile yet beautiful world, filled with innovative gameplay, new strategic scenarios, eye-searing graphics and much more. Welcome to a world calledAge of Empires III.CampaignIn this action adventure tale of historical fiction, players take on the role of Morgan Black and his family, struggling against the hostile wilderness and a mysterious cult that's crept in from Europe.In a series of 24 scenarios divided into three acts, Morgan Black and his descendants help the Aztecs resist conquest by Spanish conquistadors, pit the French against the British in the French and Indian War and help Simon Bolivar lead revolutions in South America.MultiplayerWhether you're searching for a quick game or hoping to talk strategy with friends online,Age of Empires III's Multiplayer site is your community destination.Here, you can play with persistent Home Cities that gain power and strategic options the more games you play, compete for a spot on dozens of ladders, help organize your clan or chat after a game -- all without leaving the multiplayer portal.Fans ofAge of Mythology's Quick Search can still look for games swiftly, while players looking for something specific can browse game lists to find the set of options that matches their tastes.New Feature--Home CitiesThis revolutionary new feature to the RTS landscape is incorporated into all aspects ofAge of Empires III-- from Campaign to Multiplayer -- and is unlike anything you've experienced before.Much like the persistent character from a role-playing game that encourages you to keep playing, your Home City is an important support system to your efforts in the New World. During a game, your Home City can regularly send you supplies or military reinforcements.You are the leader of your colony, but your success brings glory back to Mother Europe. The more games you play, and the better you do, the more powerful your Home City will become. Every few games, you gain the ability to both upgrade and customize your Home City:Upgrade your city by unlocking new types of soldiers or buildings, or improving those you already have.Broaden your tech tree in whatever direction most fits your play style--invest in warships, native alliances, cavalry, artillery or economy.Customize your Home City by changing the appearance of buildings, the weather or even the types of people who walk, work and perform in its streets.Throughout a game, as well as in between games, you can visit your Home City to watch its citizens go about their lives, get an opinion on how you're doing, plot your next move or just marvel at the beautiful sunset.Full 3-D Graphics, Destructible Environments and MoreWe first set out to reproduce the rich detail ofAge of Empires II: Age of Kings. As we strove to make the fascinatingAge of Empires IIItime period come alive, that goal quickly evolved: We at Ensemble Studios wanted to create the best-looking game ever. From the stunning water effects to the hundreds of units battling on-screen, you'll feel like you're a part of the action in the New World.Tone mapping--This photo imaging technique balances the colors in a scene on the fly. The end result is a rich, warm game where bright colors are vibrantly rendered alongside darker counterparts, such as shadows.Lighting and shadows--The sun is always shining inAge of Empires, so it's important that lighting and shadows be an awe-inspiring experience. Units and buildings cast shadows according to a real sun position, and even cast shadows on each other. High Dynamic Range rendering allows us to represent the shiny glints of sunlight that bounce off highly reflective surfaces.Bump and specular mapping--Water glistens like water. Metal shines like metal. These advanced techniques serve to provide an extra level of rendering detail heretofore unseen in real-time strategy (RTS) gaming.Water--We felt that portraying stunning, realistic water effects in the game was so important that we devoted a programmer to it full-time. You'll find the water rich with details like foam near the shore, accurately modeled water motion, flotsam in rivers and realistic water colors. Plus, reflections change with the viewing angle, the angle of sunlight and the motion of the water. The overall effect is breathtaking.Cliffs and Riverbeds--Instead of just stretching terrain, we built a system to attach geometry to the terrain map to allow for realistic overhangs and steep cliffs, from areas like the American Southwest. This effect is supported on random maps too.CivilizationsBritishQuick access to Settlers gives the British one of the strongest economies in the game. The ability to upgrade two key units -- the Musketeer and Hussar -- make the British military formidable in the late game. The British Home City emphasizes improvements to technology and naval warfare.DutchAlthough Dutch Settlers are limited and costly, their civilization makes up for this economic disadvantage by building Banks and generating coin automatically. The Dutch Home City emphasizes upgrades to defense and economy.FrenchAlthough the French economy starts slowly, the Coureur unit, a Villager with strong fighting skills, makes the French difficult to attack early. The French also have the strongest cavalry unit in the game -- the Cuirassier. Plus, the French are experts at allying with the Native Americans.GermanThe Germans have fewer Settlers and therefore a slower economy. Fortunately, both the Settler Wagon and Uhlan cavalry spawn for free from the German Town Center. Plus, the Germans start with the ability to send Mercenaries from their Home City (long before other civilizations can).Native AmericanEuropean civilizations can learn new technologies and gain troops by forging alliances with the Native Americans. A British player who allies with the Iroquois is essentially playing as two civilizations: the British and the Iroquois.OttomanFor the Ottomans, Settlers spawn automatically from the Town Center. Building a Mosque and conducting research help keep that Settler production steady. Befitting their position straddling Europe and Asia, the Ottomans have more unique units than any other civilization.PortugueseStarting the game with two Town Centers, the Portuguese can quickly produce Settlers, control territory or support their allies. The Spyglass ability allows the Portuguese to easily spy on the enemy. The Portuguese also have a strong navy, strong light infantry and the best Dragoons in the game.RussianStarting the game with extra resources but fewer Settlers gives the Russians the flexibility of focusing on economy or an early raid. Russian infantry, individually weak, are trained in blocks at a faster rate, providing the Russians with the opportunity to overwhelm their enemy with greater numbers.SpanishThe Spanish have a strong military, with both hand infantry and cavalry. Flexibility in early shipments from the Home City give the Spanish the option to attack early or set up for a strong, late economy. Spanish Home City improvements benefit soldiers, buildings and naval units.&nbsp;CombatAge of Empires IIIgives players an amazing amount of control over their side of the battlefield.More to command -- Not only are you in command of large and diverse armies of infantry, cavalry and artillery, but also Native American warriors, mercenaries and tall ships.Multiple formations -- You can assign different formations to your army for different strengths and weaknesses, or have the game automatically choose the most appropriate formation. Examples include:Volley -- ranged infantry, like musketeers, take turns firing at enemies ahead of them.Charge -- your soldiers walk, then run into combat. Cavalry wield sabers, and musketeers fix bayonets. This formation does tremendous damage but makes your soldiers more prone to injury.Bombard -- your soldiers protect the cannons, while the cannons shell enemy ranks. Available only when you have artillery in your army.Battles are easier to follow -- You can still command individual units. But when the units fight in formation, you'll be able to tell exactly who is winning the fight.Real-time physics -- Infantry struck by cannon fire will be thrown like rag dolls, perhaps even over a cliff and into the water. Cannonballs bounce and ricochet.Detailed destructions -- Shingles, shutters and whole towers may fly off a building and interact with the terrain, such as crashing into nearby water. This next generation effect is done on the fly so that each building always has a unique destruction, no matter how many times you see it.Unique animations -- With hundreds of unique combat animations, you'll never see the same battle twice.","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Great Game - Highly Recommended!","reviewText":"I've been waiting for Age of Empires III ever single I finally finished exhausting all of the fun from Age of Empires II. I really think it was well worth the wait.First, it is VERY much like Age of Empires II. That is a HUGE bonus for me. I love the Age of Empires series and if they'd changed the whole gameplay a great deal, it would have lost a lot of what I adore about this series. I can literally play each of these games for months and months before I begin to get bored. That is the brilliance of a well designed real time strategy (RTS) game.Next, the graphics are of course MUCH improved over previous versions. That of course means you need a much faster machine than you had before! Hopefully most people out there upgrade their computers regularly, to run ANY packages that come out each year - the newest release of PhotoShop, the newest games that come out. If you have a slow, old machine and can't run the newest games, well you really only have yourself to blame. I NEVER want game makers to make bad games just so they can run on ancient machines. It's their duty to make the best games possible. It's my job to get the machine that are current, to run them.OK, so on to gameplay. You get a collection of fun cultures, each one nicely costumed and with appropriate vocals and sounds. I love the detail in the homes, the people, the environments. You can \"skirmish\" to your heart's content, learning about the strengths and weaknesses and looks of each group. But don't go thinking you can memorize what works in each situation. The game does nicely to add complexity to that cookie-cutter approach.Instead, you have a great deal of customization ability, even on the fly. You can really build your style of culture to match your personal point of view, within cultural limits of course. This means when you face others in combat, you can never assume \"Oh they're an X which means I just have to do Y\". You have to watch, react, and implement a new plan.I really enjoyed the graphics a great deal here, from the cantering horses to the forests and smoke and flames. They did a great job of really making you feel that there is a little world being run inside your computer monitor.The sounds are equally good, with the voices and sounds, the background noises and alerts.  I admit the trumpet calls get a little repetitive, but what can you do.I suppose to some the downside is the fact that you need a modern machine. Again, I don't consider that a downside. It's an awesome game with a lot going on. It's not meant to run on a little 386. It's hard for old system owners to accept, but the world moves on. If you're going to play modern games, you have to move along with it. Believe me, it's only going to get worse as more games come out. It's time to grab that piggy bank and upgrade.I did find it really amusing that the scenario begins with the Aztecs. We just spent Black and White II fighting those All-Powerful Aztecs. What is it with the Aztecs in modern games?? I guess these things come in waves :)Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"David Stone","summary":"Better than Halo","reviewText":"Halo 2 improved over Halo with better controls, dual wielding, and a few new weapons and enemies.

It supports Dolby Digital sound.","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"A Spectacular Action/Horror Game...","reviewText":"Before getting into the review I want to be honest and let everyone know I played this game at a friend's house since I do not own a 360, and he recently purchased this game.  This game, not only is amazing, but actually makes me want to gather up some $ and splurge on getting a 360 now. (Plus Gears and Halo add to the temptation also LOL)GAMEPLAYGiven the opportunity to finally play Alan Wake I was blown away by the level of gameplay this game brings to the table.  The game is action/horror based and requires you to trudge forward as Alan Wake, trying to find out what is going on in this creepy town that he has chosen to take a vacation in.  Very quickly things go bad and only a trusty flashlight (powered by energizer batteries of course!) and handful of weapons are at your disposal to survive the darkness that is coming for you.  The mechanics of the gameplay are simple and are integrated excellently into the environment.  This game is dark, with most segments taking place at night where the darkness is at its peak strength. Environments are dark and creepy and your flashlight helps you see everything.  Intractable objects will have a sparkle/illumination to them when you put the flashlight over them and when it comes to combat, your flashlight actually acts as your cross-hair (it also will illuminate secrets).Combat is pretty simple.  Enemies are shrouded in this mysterious darkness and can only be made vulnerable by light.  Shining the flashlight on them drains the darkness away, but slowly. You could intensify your light to speed this up, but at the cost of battery power.  Run out of battery power you can either let the flashlight slowly recharge or pop in a few new batteries.  Once the darkness has faded you can then attack the enemy with a variety of weapons.  Alan also has the ability to use flares and flashbangs.  Flashbangs will instantly clear an area of enemies or severely weaken them, while Flares will drain darkness from them and force them to back off.  Upgraded flashlights you find along the way help you keep up against the growing darkness.On-top of fluid combat mechanics, the game can have a lot of depth to it.  You are playing out a book as it happens and finding manuscript pages adds to the suspense.  Sometimes it is a page reading about what you have already done, while other times it is only an ominous sign of what is to come.  The game itself is structured almost like a TV show, broken into episodes with each episode ending with a little drama.  The next episode actually does a \"Previously on Alan Wake...\" kind of deal where it actually summarizes the previous chapter for you as if you were watching Part 3 of 6 of a long running TV special.GRAPHICSWhile Alan Wake, graphically, is not the best you could find on the 360, the game shines when it comes to the lighting effects.  You can tell effort went into making light and dark look natural and feel natural.  The way your flashlight illuminates the environment, reflects off objects... How the town looks in the daylight etc.  The game has gorgeous lighting effects!  Alan Wake captures that feeling of being alone in the woods late at night.  You rely heavily on your flashlight so a lot of focus clearly went into making that mechanic work and look great.  Model graphics for characters are not bad either and are very believable.  Visual animation combined with excellent voice acting gives all the characters a unique feel to them, which I found refreshing and helped me to become immersed in the storyline.SOUND/STORYThe sound and music in Alan Wake is excellent.  High quality voice acting does a fantastic job giving characters a unique personality, and dialogue feels well thought out and written.  The gameplay itself is mixed with ambient noises and a sound track that fits the mood of the game.  The town of Bright Falls has two moods, day and night, and the game does an excellent job letting you not only see it, but hear it.  Alan Wake boasts a very good storyline.  It is deep and on a first play through you will be guessing at what is going on, twists and turns in the story and surprises will happen constantly.  Expect the unexpected at times and that works perfect for a horror/action game.  I could even see a second or third playthrough being just as much fun as the first.REPLAY/LENGTHIt took me a little over 12 hours to beat the game mainly because I tend to wander around everywhere and look for collectables or secrets (Such as hidden boxes and coffee thermoses), plus I took my time to enjoy the atmosphere of the game.  I could see your first playthrough ranging anywhere from 10-13 hours with additional game playthrough dropping to more like 7-9 hours.  The game has some length to it and the storyline is fantastic enough to keep you coming back again and again to experience the majesty of Alan Wake.CONSNo game is without problems and Alan Wake is not an exception either. A small problem hurt this game but not enough to hurt its score I think.  The only real negative I had for the game is the driving.  It felt tacked on and not well implemented; but given as you rarely will spend time in a vehicle it can be overlooked.OVERALL ... 95% (9.5 / A)I love this game!  I really do.  The environment and how your gameplay subtlety interacts with it.  The lighting effects of your flashlight, the storyline.  By no means is each element perfect, but when you combine all the elements Alan Wake brings to the table it makes for a Spectacular Action/Horror Game that will keep you riveted from start to finish.  There isn't always action going on, and there are long segments of storyline, but it builds tension and drama which is something I really enjoy when it comes to games like this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2011"}

The major improvement is in the landscapes, gone are the iffy looking distant landscapes but instead you have a lush detailed environment that is awe-inspiring.To top it off it runs very well on decent hardware as my computer is a few years old (with a modest graphics card and memory upgrade recently) and seems to run very well on high settings even when using fraps to record some video clips.I have not even begun to really get into the game but from what i have seen so far it really is worth the price.

They've tried it a few years ago with Star Fox Adventures, fairly well, and now it is about to be done all over again.Star Fox Assault, the latest game in the Star Fox series goes through ten outrageous missions that take you on foot, in the air with the arwing, and in the tough landmaster tank. The story of the game deals with Fox McCloud and his team who try to destroy the plague of aparoids trying to destroy Corneria, Fortuna, the dinosaur planet from Star Fox Adventures Sauria, and so many other outrageous galaxies in the way. The graphics and storylines are remarkably delightful, and maintain to the game far beyond the previous Star Fox games.The gameplay is great, but there are a few downsides to the game. One of them is the control of the game, especially on foot. If you haven't played Star Fox Adventures, it might be a little tricky at first to control Fox, Slippy, Krystal and Falco on foot in versus mode, and Fox in the story mode. However, it gets a lot easier along the way. Another disadvantage is that the methods of defeating some of the bosses in the game are ways of defeating similar bosses from Star Fox 64. One example is the Pigma aparoid in Level 5: The Asteroid Belt. The method of defeating him is a similar method of defeating the Area 6 boss from Star Fox 64. So for some, it does lack a few challenges here and there.Overall, Star Fox Assault is a very delightful addition to the Nintendo Gamecube lineup, and is a joy for longtime fans of the Star Fox Series. I honestly recommend this for truly dynamic sci-fi Fox action. This is no aparoid of a lie.Graphics: A-Story: ASound: B+Control: BFun & Enjoyment: B+Overall: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2005"}

The second playing, I finished in about half the time (I knew what I was doing), got 98 of 100 beads, unlocked all the specials, got the expensive items/weapons, fed most of the animals, and having met people 2 or three times in order to do the above, really became attached to even the minor ppl so that when that scene came that they were showing all the folks praying to Okami I had tears streaming down my face. Since I'm a guy who is not that prone to emotional outbursts, I can say this is a pretty good game.Graphics: 5/5 (Ink painting atmosphere lends alot of value over the typical graphics)Fun: 6.5/5 (They could have cut HALF of the sidequests out, and it still would have been a good game)Challenge: 4.5/5 (Technically, the challenge is about 1.5/5, since the actual playing of the game is such that you almost can't die. However, the last boss can burn alot of golden peaches or bones or what have you, and many of the sidequests, such as the demon's gate are also tricky unless you know how to disable multiple copies of former bosses.  Then also there are certain beads which require a great deal of time and practice to gain)Music: 5/5 (the ending song alone is awesome, and the songs set the mood, even the tone that tells you that you are on the right track with a puzzle)Extras: 6/5 (Having unlocked nearly everything, there is a high number of posters, pictures, music, game promos original from Japan, and even scrapped ideas which never made it to the US release.  It really makes you love all the detail which was put into this game, and how much the developers were actually invested in it)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00BMFIXKQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Brendan Riley","summary":"The Best Assassin's Creed Yet","reviewText":"Black Flag does what Sid Meier's Pirates (henceforth simply \"Pirates\") was unable to do, though likely so due to technical capabilities and the scope of the game. It has been such fun playing through this game, to the extent that I feel like fresh breath was brought into the franchise. I felt that Assassin's Creed III was good and had a lot of good qualities to it, but it just felt like a place holder. I read somewhere that someone higher up in ubisoft said that if people liked Connor (the main character from AC III) then there would be an extension of the story, like there was for Ezio (of AC II fame). Obviously, such was not the case as we now have AC IV with Edward Kenway. He shares the same last name as Connor's Templar father, but 24% into the game I have yet to find out if there is a connection, or probably more likely, what the connection is.I will say that there may be an issue of patience for some people in this game. Kenway's ship turns slowly (compared to \"GTA V type speeds\") and the ocean is vast with many ports that are distances apart and even simply traveling from one destination can take seemingly forever. Sometimes, also, there are missions on nearly opposite ends (so far) of the available areas of the ocean. FORTUNATELY the creators of this game are not idiots and recognize the impatience of some people and have included many opportunities to unlock \"Fast Travel\" sites (similar to those that have been found since circa AC: Brotherhood) that instantly, after a short load screen, travel the player to desired locations. More importantly, if you get bored or impatient traveling across the ocean, then you're doing it wrong and here's why:Much like in Pirates, as you sail the seas there are ships that are also out sailing - this is not a vacuum. They are all carrying some kind of cargo, be it fire barrels (used in battle), metal (used to upgrade the ship), or sugar (used for  trading) among others. So you pull out your handy monocular (the thing you see pirates looking at distant ships through in movies), size up the difficulty and payload of the ship approaching (or that you may want to chase down), and engage it in a sea battle. You can also attack forts and set up your own base in place of it there. Not to mention the fact that after damaging the ship without sinking it, you can use grapple hooks to pull your ship in so you can actually board the enemy ship and then have a battle on the deck of the enemy ship. These battles can get a little hectic and at times mildly frustrating (\"Nooooo they just killed me and that would have given me the 108 extra metal I need to upgrade my Hull!!\")So while you are en route to your next destination, there's plenty of booty to be had (snicker snicker). I cannot stress enough how satisfying the naval battles are, but I can say that often I am distracted from the story missions because I'm out at sea, plundering and pillaging the seas until I say to myself, \"Fiiiine. I'll go to the exclamation mark...\"Back again is the upgradeable \"hometown\" or \"homebase\". In this case it is Nassau, apparently in the Bahamas. So far, it hasn't been as complicated or in depth as with Ezio, but it is nice being able to invest in building up one's \"home\" town again. Also returning is hunting, though it has deeper meaning than it did in AC III. Each animal, typically, gives you a bone and a species specific item like a skin or a unique bone. These items are used to craft better pouches. Also, crafting includes health upgrades - so you craft your own armor. Additionally, you can sell the skins and bones you acquire for profit or buy some if you don't feel like looking for a black leopard.So far the story is engaging and the characters are interesting. I'm still trying to figure out whether or not one character, James Kidd, is a man or a woman... Everything seems to flow and there don't seem to be any missions that stick out as a point in the story that was forced so-something-later-could-happen. The voice acting is on point and the graphics are loverly (the ocean is a perfect example of the graphics).A negative side, though, is that this is Assassin's Creed so there are glitches and there are things that you should be able to do but can't for some reason (like climb up a wall if you walked rather than ran up to it and got too close. What?) Also, there have been a few times where I can see an enemy on the minimap, but as I sneak up to that area there is no one there until magically an angry, alerted guard materializes out of thin air. These are mistakes typical of the AC franchise (I hate to say) but they are not obnoxious unless you take your gaming super seriously. No one likes to die, but getting overly upset is another thing altogether.This game is a gem and I have been playing it every second I get. Admittedly....that didn't happen with GTA V. I bought that and played it off and on until this came out not expecting much (not after AC III) and now I am hooked. Hands down the best game I have played in a long time and CERTAINLY the best in the AC franchise.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}

This demon form features new visual effects and allows Dante to destroy enemies with one smashing blow.","reviewerName":"Tex \"dionysus_olympus\"","summary":"Better than Original with a Pulp-Fiction Twist.","reviewText":"I have finished playing this game, and I have to say it was much better than the original.  The puzzles are a lot less complicated, and the platformers are much easier.  Dante still packs as much firepower as he did in the original, but instead of learning new moves, Dante (and his partner, Lucia) improve weapon capabilities.  I have to say that I like the inclusion of secret rooms to improve Dante's and Lucia's health via collection of blue orb fragments.  Lucia is the newest member of the Devil May Cry games.  She has better close-up maneuvers and much quicker than Dante.  However, she lacks the firepower.Graphically, the environments are fairly massive, and you no longer backtrack generally.  True, you do revisit some locations, but luckily, not all of them.  Dante, Lucia and their enemies also look graphically superior than the original.  The Devil forms actually look much better as well.Gameplay-wise, it has gotten much better as well.  Dante and Lucia are flexible and walk on walls and kick in the air.  Lastly, the Bosses in the game have gotten harder, especially for Dante.  If you have confronted the last boss for Dante, you know the feeling of accomplishing and defeating the final boss.  Lucia however is actually a superior fighter than Dante overall at least when confronting the bosses.The storyline is done in two parts, from Dante's perspective and Lucia's perspective.  As soon as you play both discs, you get the full story on what happened, what is happening, and why they are kicking demon butt.  When you obtain the full story, the story itself is actually much better than the first.Overall, this game is definitely a great addition to any PS2 library.  With the flood of mediocre console games lately, this is a great buy.  One note: this game is relatively short, lasting about 25-30 hours at most (for the first completion of the game anyway at Normal Mode).  Lastly, the game does have some bonuses and extras to unlock, including Trish from the original Devil May Cry.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2003"}

I'll start with the pros.Pros:Bigger cast of players to choose from in party mode.A large (7) variety of boards, compared to the primitive ones.Plenty of minigames (however this is neutral if you read on)Great soundtrack.Cons:Story mode isn't really fun, due to the fact you have to duel 3 colors of Bowser Jr. on five boards.-Not to mention, the duel minigames are quite boring, especially since you're playing through the entire 15 duel games (most likely), and most of them are random, or one where it's impossible to win (Merry Poppings or something like that)When you select hard for the CPU, it's nearly impossible to beat them for the most part. This is a problem with most/all MP games.The item system was swapped for an unusual capsule system. I'd prefer just having the items instead of these capsules.I haven't played too much MP games prior to the review. I own and play 3, I rented 4 before, both of which are excellent games, and I've seen gameplay of the other ones.

{"product_name":"B0001X5YN4","reviewerName":"Ryan J \"Ryan\"","summary":"S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl","reviewText":"Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl is a game that is pretty difficult to review. It seems to be the type of game that some players will love and others will hate, and both will have equally valid reasons for feeling that way. Stalker offers a very unique experience, which can be hard to come by these days, and it is also an extremely atmospheric game. The huge world, rpg/sim gameplay, and open ended nature of the game are great. But there are also a bunch questionable gamplay mechanics as well as bugs that a lot of people would have a hard time overlooking. Whether or not you would enjoy this game will depend on how much you are willing to put up with in order to experience a truly unique shooter in a compelling setting.As the title gives away, Stalker takes place in the ruins around Chernobyl. Chernobyl was a nuclear power plant in Ukraine where one of the reactors exploded in 1986, resulting in a severe release of radioactivity into the environment. The surrounding areas were abandoned and still are to this day. However, in Stalker's alternate history the Zone is populated by various factions of scavengers, and the radiation has caused strange otherworldly changes in local fauna, flora and the laws of physics. This makes for an interesting setting that cannot really be compared to anything else, and simply exploring the Zone can be a lot of fun.You play as \"The Marked One\", a stalker that has lost his memory after nearly being killed in a vehicle explosion. All you know is that you were on a mission to hunt someone named Strelok, and are let lose in the Zone with one simple objective: find out who and where Strelok is and eliminate him. Most of the story is told through conversations with NPCs (only some of which are voiced) as well as a few cutscenes for key moments. The story is pretty interesting overall, but it can be somewhat difficult to follow at times. Plus, a lot is revealed at the very end of the game instead of you steadily piecing parts of it together as you play.Along the way you will meet literally hundreds of other NPCs which you can interact with, a number of which will give you side quests for rewards. However a lot of these side quests are not very interesting. Making things even worse is the fact that they are often not worth doing. The rewards are rarely worth it, and Stalker is not a true RPG in the sense that your character does not gain experience points from killing enemies. So completing these side quests often just feel like a waste of ammo and other resources. Also, many of the quests have annoying time limits that require you to complete them in a certain number of days before they automatically fail. There were times when I had completed a quest and simply had to return for my reward, but the person I had to see to pick it up was so far away that I couldn't be bothered to return. By the time I had gotten back around to that part of the world, the quest had long expired and I could no longer collect my prize.The open-endedness of the game is both one of its strengths and weaknesses as it can often be unclear what you should be doing at any one point. The map system does point you towards your objectives, but it is cumbersome to use. Also, your only means of transportation is your own two legs. You can sprint, but there is a stamina bar that drains extremely quickly if you are carrying too many items. But in return for these annoyances you get an extremely interesting and atmospheric world to explore. The Zone feels like a real place that is inhabited by other people, but at the same time you still feel completely alone and vulnerable which is really cool. Sure walking long distances can be tiresome, but the fact that you don't know what will happen to you along the way keeps things interesting. You might have a completely uneventful trip, or you might be ambushed by mutants or hostile stalkers. Or perhaps you will stumble upon a hidden cache of goodies or find artifacts to boost your stats.The combat in the game is extremely intense, but it is admittedly not for everyone. As the game is a sim of sorts, you can die extremely quickly in firefights, weapons will degrade and can jam on you, your character can bleed to death if you don't have bandages, and many of the weapons are not very accurate. This is especially true towards the beginning of the game before you get good body armor and weapons. Later in the game you find more advanced and accurate weapons, but up until then it can be frustrating at times. As such, you must constantly use cover and lean around corners, learn when to retreat, what range your weapons are most useful at, what ammo types they can use, what firing modes you should use at different distances, and avoid getting into fights unless you are properly equipped. If you like really challenging and complex combat you will enjoy it, but if you don't this game isn't for you.Surprisingly, the games graphics still hold up well today if played on the highest settings. Objects are extremely well textured with a good amount of detail, and the game has a good real time lighting system which really looks great in the creepy dark underground areas. The design of the Zone itself is also superb with a good mix of urban and rural areas, and it feels like a real place. Much of this is due to the fact that they recreated a lot of existing locations surrounding Chernobyl. The best thing about the graphics has to be the sky/weather system. There were many times when I would find myself simply admiring lighting in the distance during a huge storm, and how each bolt of lightning would briefly light up the world. The game also has a physics system, so bodies drop and boxes break as they should.In the end, whether or not you will enjoy this game depends largely on if you are willing to put up with some of its problems in order to experience a unique game with an interesting story that takes place is a great location. Sure the game's quest system is cumbersome and a bit broken and the combat can be extremely difficult at times. Yes, you will spend a good amount of time walking around the game world and backtracking to previously explored areas. But the game is also extremely unique and interesting because of its setting and rpg/sim elements. If the combat sounds too difficult and if you prefer more structure in your games this is probably one you should avoid. But if you enjoy a challenge and are willing to put up with some questionable game design decisions in order to experience something new for a change, then go ahead and pick up a copy of Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl. You will hopefully walk away from this game impressed on your way to the store to pick up Stalker: Clear Sky.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2009"}

Featuring enhanced graphics, sound and control, Silent Hill Origins sets a new standard for this survival horror classic.","reviewerName":"Michael J. Covino","summary":"Hope for the series yet","reviewText":"In my opinion, the Silent Hill series began to fall with the third installment, but was completely annihilated with the fourth game - but in Origins...Silent Hill is resurrected from the dead and has this long dedicated fan salivating for more.This time you play the role of truck driver Travis, whose persona has a lot in common with the memorable James Sunderland from the second game, as deep supressed and unwanted memories are forced out the more the haunted town claws its way into his soul. While Travis goes into this world of self discovery, you the player uncover the Origins of Silent Hill and see firsthand the separation of Alessa and Cheryl, and the birth of all the madness.The exploratory element that the third game neglected to utilize is brought back in Silent Hill Origins. All the streets are there for you to explore. Other than the usual Twilight Zone scenery, its unfortunate, however, that there is not much to discover down the narrow alleys or at the end of each road like what we had with the second game (like a corpse clutching on to the page of his final journal entry, or another Bar Nelly's with a blood stained map and strange writing on the wall talking about disappearing holes). That bar alone from Silent Hill 2 caused mile-long discussion forums all over the internet. Them were the days....But the streets are there to explore nonetheless, and to think that they were all absent in Silent Hill 4.One of the other small gripes that I had with this title is that the monsters appeared too early. I prefer a slow agonizing descent into madness, getting more intense the deeper you explore. This was something Silent Hill 2 perfected with the walk through the woods; first it was strange sounds, then strage shadows, then tracks of blood....a good build up before you were even confronted with anything. Not so in this game.I also think creatures should be stranger and more otherworldly, not bigger and more aggressive in a Silent Hill game. But that's just me.And I'm tired of having ways to warp back and forth from world to world, which this game borrowed from Silent Hill 4 with its stupid tunnels. Was it not crazy enough when the whole world around you would physically Shape-Shift every time the fire Sirens screamed? This I personally believe Silent Hill 1 was best at (check my review for that game).Those are my four biggest complaints. This is otherwise a very authentic Silent Hill game, and by the time you make it all the way to the Riverside Hotel, you will feel like you're playing Silent Hill 2 all over again. This game features four abandoned buildings to explore which include the Hospital (of course), a Sanatorium, an Amphitheater and the RiverSide Hotel. A couple smaller placeses include a General Store, a Butcher's Shop, a Lumber Yard and the Antique Shop (where the altar from the first game is). Its the small things that give the town a character of its own and that's important since its the town that keeps bringing players back.When Silent Hill comes out for Next Generation, I expect mostly every vacant house and room open for exploration, with ghastly little surpises in each. One can only hope. This game has got me waiting anxiously for the next title of a series I thought died with \"The Room\".","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2008"}

Too busy plucking sushi from the A$$ cracks of those waitresses that work at those neo-sign sushi bars when they ought to be writing a script...I'm telling, they're getting lazy.When I was first playing it, I was opened minded about it: \"Oh, eventually these tunnels are going to drop him smack dead in that foggy, barren town which we have all come to love,\" but as it turned out, it never happened. I thought I saw the words \"SILENT HILL\" on the cover of the game when I bought it, but I guess the lady at the cashier made a mistake with the order or something. I thought enough people complained about part 3 not taking a LONG ENOUGH ride into Silent Hill (the TOWN itself) would have helped the developers to correct this error with part 4, but instead they totally **** it up even more. I guess they've made their money with the first couple of games and are no longer hungry....and...no longer care. Lets go for a drink at that all night sushi bar, what do you say?It would have made a decent game if each individual level was actually DIFFERENT and UNIQUE, rather than making you re-visit levels you have already seen before during the first few hours of game play....No dark atmosphere, no flashlight (which just look so bad-ass ripping through the darkness in previous games, never knowing what it will shine on next) no radio to get that heart pounding, no ominous looking town enshrouded by fog; to call this a Silent Hill game is not only a mistake, it's BLASPHEMY.Put some more corpses in vents, or add more creepy sounds and whispers in those empty rooms or make one of the stiffs under those hospital sheets fall to the floor as you walk by - DON'T CHANGE THE GAME that made it to the 'Greatest Hits' list.

This is intereactive storytelling at it's finest!Concept:  10/10Bring the grim graphic novel to life, but allow the story to adapt to the reader based on their decisions.  Include puzzle elements, some bursts of action, and meaningful dialogue trees with memorable characters.Story:  10/10This is a standalone story that runs parallel to the TV Series / Graphic Novel Series.  There's no Rick, Shane, Governor...  Instead, there's a convicted murderer named Lee who is on his way to prison when the zombie apocalypse happens.  Shortly after Lee's escape, he runs into a resourceful little girl who has been surviving on her own named Clementine.  As her guardian, Lee must make very tough decisions for the survival of the group and the well being of Clementine as they're thrown into life or death situations.  There's the constant threat of zombies and things worse than zombies: Bandits, weirdos, liars, betrayers, and insane people...  Lee's decisions affect his future, Clementine's future, and often times, the fate of the party members who join them.  The story is well told, well acted, well presented, intelligently written, and your decisions affect the outcome.  It's GREAT!Gameplay:  8/10Most of the gameplay involves conversations with other characters and dialogue trees.  If you want an action game where you blast 1000 zombies with guns, this isn't the game for you.  Other gameplay includes searching environments for items, clues, and solving puzzles in creative ways.  Then there are quick bursts of action, where you must aim a cursor and quickly perform the correct action.  For example...  A zombie tackles you to the ground and you must put the cursor over the zombie's face and press the X button (which represents kicking it to buy time).  Or you may have to button mash to push it away.  The gameplay is pretty minimal because the story progression is the main focus of the game.Graphics:  9/10It's no Halo 4, instead, it's a highly stylized graphic novel looking game.  The environments, characters, and zombies all look true to form.Sound: 10/10The background music is dramatic and mournful.  During the action sequences, it's exciting.  The voice acting is also well done.Replay Value:  4/10You can play the game over again and make different choices, but there really isn't a reason to.  There are no multiplayer elements.Maturity:  MThere's swearing, gore, intense situations, disturbing situations, and the general stuff that you'd find in horror films.Overall:  10/10If you're looking for a very dramatic story that changes based on your decisions, then this is as good as it gets!Buy this game if you love the Graphic Novels or TV Series.Buy this game if you like dark storytelling.Buy this game if you like interactive storytelling where your decisions drastically affect the outcome.Rent this game if you have 12-15 hours to play through it.Avoid this game if you want it to be like Resident Evil or Dead Rising.  There's very little action.Avoid this game if you can't handle heavy drama.  There are some disturbing scenes.If you enjoyed the dark story, check out Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill Downpour.If you like games where your decisions affect the outcome, try the Mass Effect or Elder Scrolls series.If you like good storytelling, check out Red Dead Redemption, Bastion, Limbo, or Bioshock.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2013"}

Again, it's a wonderful collection of clever puzzles brought together by a charming narrative. Instead of confining you to one mysterious town, Diabolical Box focuses on a train and all its various stops.The real meat of these games are the puzzles, and this collection lags behind the first by a little bit. There were too many occasions where I really wasn't sure what the puzzle was asking for, and too many that weren't interactive (as in utilizing the touch screen/stylus). It's odd to see that downturn when there are several other sequels to this series in Japan. Still, on its own right the puzzle collection is high-quality. It's also quite lengthy, as it clocked in at well over a dozen gameplay hours.With great voice acting, some nice cartoon-like scenes and excellent writing, Professor Layton & the Diabolical Box is a stellar DS game that anyone into brain-teasers would enjoy. It's just a hair behind the first one. Note that playing the original is not vital to understanding this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000B43OY4","reviewerName":"eternal now \"roejoerrer\"","summary":"Definitive Next-Gen experience....","reviewText":"Ah...so we enter into the 7th generation of the console wars. In this battle, we have Microsoft, returning with their Xbox 360, Sony with their Playstation 3, and Nintendo with their Wii. All three systems are offering some form of an enhanced gaming and overall multi-media experience.Which system is better? This is an age old question that is presented during each console war. And the truth is, who really knows? What defines a console as the \"best\", above all others?Each system bring something to the table. Each system has its strengths and weakenesses, its triumphs and its failures. Just like the previous console wars, no console really emerges with all the \"gold coins\".Forget the other two for now, we are here to talk about the Xbox 360.When the original Xbox came out, it was met with much skepticism and animosity. Many stated that this was Bill Gate's attempt to have his hand in EVERY market. Well, duh!At first, the Xbox did not really impress anyone. The graphics were pretty good and the hard drive aspect was really cool. You could burn songs onto the hardrive and save game data. But that was really about it. The controller was bulky, as was the system, and the games that came out initially were lackluster and didn't really convey the true power of the system.Halo changed everything. Not to mention a more streamlined controller.Halo utilized the full power of the Xbox and showed the world that this system was a force to be reckoned with. I think more people bought the Xbox BECAUSE of Halo. Halo went on to become THE best First Person Shooter experience ever, not to mention the most popular Multiplayer experience. Which leads me to another factor that played into the Xbox's success, its LIVE feature. Hailed as the best live gaming feature for console systems, XBOX live united players from all over the world.Sure, Playstation 2 had a live experience, but it was not as streamlined and user friendly, nor was it widely used.After Halo, many other great games would come out that utilized the systems true power. We saw great graphical progressions on the Xbox, which had far superior graphics to the PS2, mind you. Actually, overall I do believe that the Xbox was a better product. PS2 had better third party support, but that was mostly because the PS2 was easier to make games for. But, and there is a big one, the Xbox could handle better graphics, faster speeds and bigger games, which game Xbox gamers some very special and exclusive treats (i.e Doom 3, a better Wolfenstein experience, Jade Empire, K.O.T.O.R 1 and 2, Fable and.....Halo 1 and 2). PS2 had exclusives as well, games that I absolutely loved were only exclusive to the PS2 (i.e Final Fantasy Series, Devil May Cry series, many other great RPG games, and for a small time the GTA series).However, whenever games were eventually ported over to the Xbox, they sported better graphics and an overall better package.The PS2 however had a strong loyal developer base and fan base, a better, more compact controller and a game library that was nothing to snuff at.Either way you put it though, the PS2 and the Xbox were equal systems with pros and cons.Onto the present day. Microsoft decided that for this new console war, they were going to be the first system out. This can have great benefits. First of all, getting a head start. That can make all the difference in the world. They aimed to grab all the gamers they could and rally them to their cause. Another great reason of being the first system is the experience. Everyone knows that most of the first wave of games for a new system are usually not that great (with a few exceptions). By being the first, Microsoft could get through the bad wave of first release games and get onto the meat and potatos of their gaming arsenal.As there are some good things involved in being the first system out on the market, there are also very bad things as well.It is believed by many that Microsoft rushed their product onto the market. This resulted in faulty systems that either refused to work, or overheated for no apparant reason at all. Not to mention certain \"qualities\" of the Xbox 360 that many would consider design flaws (i.e no rubber stopper in the CD tray, some sort of thermal foil wrap that was not taken off within the innards of the system, and poor design).I can totally feel where most of these reviewers on Amazon are coming from. I would be utterly angry and frustrated if my Xbox 360 died after one day or even one week of use. Its a $400 system! Far from chump change!I waited to get one. In fact, I was not even going to get involved in this present console war. No, I was going to skip the whole thing. Video games are a HUGE investment. I have a PS2 and a Gamecube at home, and for a while that was good enough.But then I started playing Gears of War at a friends house. If you have seen or played Gears Of War, then you should know the experience I had. I was instantly addicted. You see, Gears of War is like Crack, the most potent kind. Especially the online aspect of it. Once you start playing against others in Deathmatch fun, you cannot stop. After a month or three of casually playing at a friends house, I decided I was going to pick up an Xbox 360.First of all, its much cheaper than the PS3. I don't need a Blu-Ray player, or even a HD player. The PS3 has hardly any games out at the moment, and the ones they do have don't seem that great to me. (On a side not, Resistance: Fall of Man is touted as a \"Halo-Killer\". Don't believe the hype, its not THAT great).I am always very weary about spending even $100 let alone $400 on anything. I thought it over long and hard, and then finally made my decision one night. My girlfriend had decided to get her Samsung LCD 37\" TV that she had wanted, and I felt this was the perfect time to dive in head first into the console wars.I was as giddy as ever driving home that night, awaiting the glory and entertainment that the Xbox 360 was to offer........skip obvious enjoyment and fun...I am not going to delve into the specs of the Xbox 360, because that is already offered on this product page. What I am going to say, is that The Xbox 360 provides an amazingly fun entertainment experience unlike anything experienced on a console before.With the Xbox 360 you can:1)Play games (solo, two player, XBOX Live - where you can play people from across the world in all types of games and matches).2)Play DVD's - it will play almost all styles and regions of DVD's.-However, there is a separate HD player that you must buy if you want to watch HD DVDs.3)Play CD's - you can even burn them to the harddrive and play the songs while you play games(custom soundtracks)4)Xbox Live Marketplace - where you can download game demos, movie trailers,music videos, Xbox Live Arcade games, wallpaper, gamertag pics, and much more5)Send Text and voice messages to other Xbox Live gamers - you can even have private chats with other gamers while playing or not playing. - Think about it, if you have a friend who lives across the world, and both of you have an Xbox 360, you can chat for the mere price of a monthly Xbox Live Gold membership, skipping all long distance charges!6)Wireless Controllers - probably one of the most attractive aspects of this system, and Next-Gen gaming all together. I remember getting so fed up with the chords on the controllers because they would always tangle. Now, I am not the kind of person who could properly wrap controller chords, so maybe that is why I enjoy the wireless feature so much. Needless to say, the wireless function is very nice and very handy and practical. Another great feature of the controller is its set up. The dual analog sticks are set a different angles so as to fit your hand more comforably. And actually, the controller is one of the best that I have ever used. I am ultra pleased with its performance and feel in my hands.The buttons are not complex and are easy to access. The X in the middle of the console acts as the \"Xbox Guide\". Once pushed, it will bring you to a small dashboard display, where you can either sign in/out gamertag profiles, go to the full dashboard, or otherwise check on other specific things. This \"guide button\" makes for a much more streamlined and user friendly LIVE experience.7) 24/7 connection to LIVE - with your internet connection either plugged in or signaled wirelessly (sold separately), your Xbox 360 will be connected to the LIVE Network 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The gamer is identifed online by a gamertag, which reveals info about the gamer, the gamers repuation within the gaming world and the various games that the gamer plays. You can set the system to log your gamer tag in once the system is turned on, or you can set it so that you have to manually log in. Either way it is another amazing attraction to the Xbox 360. Have friends playing on  Xbox LIVE at the moment but don't know where they are? No problem! Once you sign in your gamertag Xbox LIVE will automatically find your online friends for you and signal you, making for an easy way to join friends online in a game or two.Sure, the Xbox 360 is a vast multi-media center providing the gamer with everything all-in-one.But lets focus on the main reason for its existence, games.The Xbox 360 has amazing HD graphics and superior game play.Gears of War was the reason that I bought the Xbox 360. This game is literally the flagship of Next-Generation gaming.1) The graphics are the best ever seen on any system to day. The sheer amount of detail and care that went into the graphics will drop your jaw, and not just on the first experience! The character models are so detailed that you can see the neck and body muscles, you can see the wear and tear on characters armor, and even glare from light sources. Their faces are weathered and look very real, and they reflect light(i.e fire light). The backgrounds are very realistic. Brick walls look like brick walls, grass and foilage look ultra realistic. Glass surfaces reflect light. The sky looks amazing. And images don't just look amazing from afar, once you get close to a brick wall, it still looks just as amazing.2)The game runs smooth as butter, movements are realistic and smooth. Nothing is choppy about the game. There are hardly any flaws in the design. The physics in game are second to none, and the enemy AI is super smart. The enemy will take cover, attempt to flank you, and otherwise try to remove your head from your body as best as they can.3)Multiplayer is some of the best ever made, almost rivaling Halo.So much detail went into this game, and you can surely tell that Gears of War fully utilizes the full power of the Xbox 360 in all of its glorious form. There is literally way too much to say about this game.The true definitive experience of Next-Gen Hi-Def gaming.And this is just the beginning! Wait for Halo 3...and Shadowrun..and Fable 2...and Unreal 3..and The Force Unleashed!Many tout that the PS3 has better graphics and is generally a more powerful system. But what you need to remember (as in the case of the original Xbox as well), is that its not what the system has going for it, but rather what the game developers decide to utilize. If the game developers choose to not use the full power of a system, then the game will not look and feel as good as a game that does.Gears of War looks worlds better than any game on the PS3 at the moment.Of course, there are games for the Xbox 360 that suck big time and look and feel like games that somehow managed to escape the clutches of the original Xbox. Its all about utilization.I personally recommend the Xbox 360. I achieved that wierd tingly feeling that I used to get when I played the orignal Nintento way back in the day. Now to me, that says a lot!If you do decide to join the online/entertainment gaming sensation that is the Xbox 360, there are a few things you should know. Keep these in mind, as you are about to purchase a $400 system:1)Don't leave your system on or play games for an absurd amount of time and then not expect this to cause some wear to your system. - Its not indestructable. Like all electronics, they don't last forever, so you have to take care of them while you have them.2)Don't leave your system on all night (or all day). - This will also put a considerable wear on your system and shorten its shelf life.3)DO NOT keep your Xbox 360 in a carpeted area or in an enclosed space. This beast has about 6 or seven fans for a reason! Use them! The purpose of these fans is to suck in air to cool off the innards of this bad boy, how can you expect it to do this if it is in a closed cabinet? If you store it on a carpeted floor, the fans will suck in the carpet lint, which will severely mess with your gaming. Trust me...4)DO NOT in any circumstance, switch the resting position of the Xbox from its flat position to its side while in play or while there is is CD loaded in the CD tray! This should be obvious. The CD tray does not have rubber stoppers holding your CD in place, and the CD could become damaged beyond repair if you alter the position of the system while the CD is in play.5) Do not attempt to over burden your system with too many tasks at once, this will lead to system crashed. The Xbox 360 is just like a computer, so you must treat it like one. If you assign it too many tasks at once, it will get confused and freeze up. This is not good.6)Give your Xbox 360 time to cool off after play. This is important. This system gets VERY hot during play, a design factor that could have been resolved (but thats another story). Either way, play to its strengths and weaknesses. The power block also gets really hot (it even has a fan on it as well!), make sure you let these cool off, for the sake of the machine.7)Never attmept to play a CD/DVD/Game that is severely scratched up, this could damage the lazer lens that reads the CD/DVD/Game, and then you got problems.8)Do not remove the hard drive while the system is on, this is just not recommended.9)Just remember, this is an investment in an electronic device that will be obsolete in 5 to 6 years. They are not meant to last, thats business for you. So do yourself a favor and rock it with respect while it lasts.Now, don't think that the Wii and the PS3 are not without their flaws, I'm sure they have some as well.Aside from all this, the Xbox 360 is an amazing system that has superior graphics, gameplay and an overall fun factor that shatters the ratings scales. I am very happy with my system.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2007"}

Formed by a bunch of ex-Black Isle developers, Obsidian Entertainment set out to make great role-playing games that pushed narrative in gaming. Alpha Protocol isn't just another shooter, as its RPG elements are fundamental to the game design, which makes Alpha Protocol a love or hate affair in the gameplay department. However, beyond the gameplay, you'll find a very deep and rewarding experience with Alpha Protocol.Positives:- Choice & Consequence - You shape the narrative in Alpha Protocol. The dialogue tree is timed, which causes everything to flow naturally instead of two idle character models in one still animation for too long at any given point. You choose to side with or cross individuals, to let them live or die, to sleep with them, etc. You dictate the outcome of any given discussion and situation through the well-done dialog system.- RPG Gameplay That Rewards - Here's where many will disagree, though I welcome the debate. Alpha Protocol isn't just a third-person shooter, it's also an RPG at its heart, which means the reticle and shooting mechanics have a very \"risk vs. reward\" feel. When you start out, your aim is rather poor, you don't have all of the best upgrades, etc. Some said this all came down to poorly conceived gameplay, but I must disagree with such a notion. As a fan of RPG titles, it's fairly common that you pretty much stink in the beginning of any RPG, then you gradually become better through experience, leveling up, new weapons, weapon upgrades/mods, etc. This is the very heart of an RPG, but it seems like many people wanted Alpha Protocol to have shooting mechanics similar to a Gears of War or Uncharted, but it was never supposed to be like that. Upgrading your character through meaningful ways is crucial to any good RPG.- Voice Acting & Characters - This is Alpha Protocol's greatest asset, no doubt about it. Each character offers their own personality, and all of the acting seems spot on. This isn't a hyper serious game all of the time. Your main character, Michael Thorton, is often a very sarcastic jerk. I find him to be a very entertaining character. And many other characters can be funny and over-the-top, too, which is what makes Alpha Protocol such an enjoyable ride from beginning to end. If it were super serious, not sporting any of the sarcastic and enjoyable dialogue, then it'd be a rather disappointing journey, as the gaming industry is full of grim storytelling these days.Negatives:- Technical Issues Galore - Texture pop-in is commonplace in Alpha Protocol. Similar to earlier Unreal Engine 3 games like Mass Effect, it takes a while for textures to fully pop into place. Framerate hiccups can sometimes muck up the action. Taking cover can sometimes be glitchy. The depth of field and motion blur effects are very poorly implemented.Sure, I guess I could've docked 1 star for the technical issues, as they are in the many, but I feel that despite those issues, they didn't take anything away from the game. I still played the game through multiple times without any severe issues that ruined my enjoyment. In many ways, Alpha Protocol is an experience that offers something truly great to a specific type of person. This game is by no means perfect, so I hope you don't get that impression from my 5 star review; however, even in the face of Alpha Protocol's imperfections, this is a game I'll never forget, as it brought me one of the most memorable experiences that I've ever had.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2011"}

In my opinion, just about everything that made GTA San Andreas such a blast to play.You can't customize your character's physique by working out. You can't get tattoos, or increase your fighting ability. Niko starts the game off wimpy in hand-to-hand combat- and stays that way to the very end.In GTA 4, you could improve your fighting, shooting and driving abilities to near- super-human capabilities. It wasn't 'realistic' (which one of GTA IV's selling points).It was fun.And while GTA IV's environment is better- rendered and more realistic, it is far smaller and less diverse  than GTA San Andreas.GTA San Andreas built upon its predecessors by creating a more vast, varied environment that included urban and wooded areas.And all of GTA IV's predecessors  had one thing in common: by the time you got to the end of the game, you had tons of money and pretty much ran the whole town.DRIVINGThe driving in GTA IV is also tedious and frustrating.There are many missions where you have to chase someone down in an automobile. These missions require that you drive at high speeds through the traffic- congested maze that is Liberty City.And  the vehicles handle nothing like they did in the original series. They veer out-of-control easily.After about five missions, this got tiresome for me and frustrating.You can chase someone for seemingly endless miles, lose them, and then have to start he whole thing over again.There was one mission where I was chasing down someone, only to have giant metal pipes fall in the middle of the  road and cut me off. And I failed the mission.And so many of the great stuff I liked about the other games are gone.You can't buy safe houses! WTH??!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"Gary S","summary":"As expected, GTA IV doesn't dissapoint. If you don't own this game, go buy it!!","reviewText":"The Good:- Graphics are much improved over PS2 versions, with good detailing, lighting and environmental effects.- Gameplay is immersive and ever changing with fun mission design and none of the tediousness of previous GTA games. Voice-overs and cut scenes are really well done and the plot is pretty interesting. Plenty of things to do outside of the missions.- Liberty City world design is simply incredible. The detail put into this game blows my mind. The citizens of Liberty City are more realistic, walking around talking on their cell, loading their trunk, or sipping a cup of coffee. The comments they say are hilarious too!- Great selection of weapons, cloths, cars, etc. It's always fun to try something new.- Rockstar eliminated many of the tedious tasks from GTA San Andreas, such as having to exercise/lift weights to stay in optimal shape. Or having to eat 4 burgers to regain health (just one will do in GTA IV).- Good surround sound effects. Great music/talk radio options, funny as usual. Laslo has returned!! You can even watch TV and surf the web.- Online mode adds some more replay value, although I don't care for the point accumulation. It takes forever to level up.The Bad:- Some slow gameplay at times. This is the first I've seen something like this on PS3.- Online mode could be much better.- Graphics could still improve... hopefully they can figure a way to lose the blurry/glare appearance and make it appear crisper (ref. Call of Duty).The Verdict:The best GTA yet, but there is always room for improvement.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2009"}

{"product_name":"B002I0EMUO","description":"Product OverviewFrom the critically acclaimed director, Hideo Kojima, a new 3D   experience re-imagined from one of the most popular Metal Gear Solid   titles from the    past, comes METAL GEAR SOLID SNAKE EATER 3D.In the aftermath of the Second World War, the world was torn in two   between East and West. It was the beginning of a new era- the Cold War.October 16, 1962. The President of the United States received word   that the Soviet Union had deployed nuclear missiles in Cuba. The world    trembled in fear as the prospect of nuclear war loomed ever closer.   After days of tense negotiations, the Soviets finally agreed on the 28th   to withdraw their missiles from Cuban soil. With the resolution of this   incident, later to be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, it    seemed that humanity had survived yet another threat to its existence.However, there was a secret condition in the deal that put an end to   the crisis. Nokolai Stepanovich Sokolov, a Soviet scientist who had   defected    to the West, was to be sent back to the Soviet Union. The U.S.   government agreed to this stipulation, and returned Sokolov back to his   native    land. Little did they know that Sokolov was to be the designer of a   nightmarish weapon. Now, with Sokolov back in their hands, the Soviets    are ready to resume its development. If this weapon is completed, it   will mark the beginning of a new age of fear.August 1964. Realizing at last the urgency of the situation, the CIA   forms a plan to recapture Sokolov. They dispatch the covert FOX unit    to Sokolov's research facility, located to the south of the great   Soviet fortress of Groznyj Grad. Led by former SAS member Major Zero,   FOX is a    next-generation special-forces unit that operates both as a   specialized combat group and as a covert intelligence outfit. The FOX   unit's modus    operandi is to send a single agent, backed by radio support from afar,   into enemy territory to carry out solo sneaking missions.August 24. A lone soldier swoops down from out of the blue. The man's code name is Naked Snake.FeaturesExperience an all-new re-interpretation of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, previously released on      PlayStation 2 with over 4 million copies sold, in 3D for the first time ever.Auto-stereoscopic 3D viewing capability that endeavors to create a rich jungle world with natural depth in      settings of trees, rock/stone, water and more.'Photo Camo' system utilizing the built-in camera technology of the   hardware bringing customized stealth      and camouflage options to the player.

In that regard Metal Gear Solid 3 is a well produced game and worthy of praise. However, it would be foolish to ignore the fact that there are many versions of this game on the market and if you have multiple game systems, this may not be the best option for you. I think the fairest approach is if you want Metal Gear on the go or a taste for more grown-up games on the 3DS, go ahead and get this if you do not own any other gaming system.The visuals are quite nice but I think that some people are stretching it when they claim this version of the game looks better than the HD versions. The 3D effect is very pleasing to look at but when the effect is turned off I do not think it looks better than the HD collections.If you play this game I suggest getting the Circle Pad Pro. It is very comfortable to hold and the second analog stick is much better than using the 3DS buttons to move the game's camera around. The game can be played without that add-on if you really don't want to buy that thing but it does help. Just remember to go into your options screen and set it to detect the circle pad. The developers added a few instances of motion control. One example will be early in the game when Snake is on a tree limb and you have to tilt your system to the right and left in order to keep your balance. This is very much like the same gimmick on Uncharted: Golden Abyss and I do not care for it here either.However, using the touch screen to access your inventory is awesome. You may need a little time to get used to it but it is a breeze to change weapons and items.I do not wish to spoil the story but there is certainly a lot of it here and the voices are very well done. In fact, the game talks a little too much but you can use a fast-forward button on the touchscreen to speed through dialogue if you want to.The only thing that keeps me from proudly recommending this game is the fact that the competing system is going to get the Metal Gear Trilogy collection (including this game) for about the same price. While the 3D effect is nice, it does not beat getting two additional games. If you have a 3DS and no plans to get the Vita then go ahead and buy this version. It is worth playing. However, if you have both systems then I would encourage you to consider the upcoming collection for the Vita.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2012"}

Sadly, I purchased this game after buying into the excitement of its release.  I'm sorry to say this game disappoints on almost every level.  While this is a decent game for those who have never played a first-person shooter before, it provides no incentive for veterans of the genre.  And as far as FPS games on the Wii go, there are better (e.g. Call of Duty: World at War).  The Conduit plays out like a game that should've been released 10 years ago.  If this game were to have been released on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3, it would've been a universal flop.  This game simply wouldn't fly, according to the standards set by Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, the Halo series or Killzone 2 (which have all defined the FPS).  Among The Conduit's bad points:The Story - It is the epitome of generic.  There is nothing new or that you haven't seen before.  The twists are completely anti-climactic and the voice acting is awful and fails to get the player engaged.The Graphics - One of the biggest disappointments, seeing as it was supposedly going to be on par with the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.  I've never seen so many jaggies on the screen.  The textures are very bland, and I know the Wii can do so much better.  The scenery in the game is dull and boring.  Bottom line, this is almost inferior to a PS2 game.The Length - This game is short.  Very short.  It's got only 10 missions, and all of them are incredibly linear.The Multiplayer - This is more fleshed out than most Wii games, but the lag is distressing and the maps are boring.One good thing is the controls.  Using the IR capability of the Wii remote to aim and look has always proved to be preferable to controlling with analog sticks.  Still though, the control scheme in Metroid Prime 3 is far more fluid and superior to The Conduit's.What this game comes down to is that it's perfect for an introduction to the genre.  Anything beyond that and you'll be disappointed.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2009"}

You've got all the modes, including the awkward over-the-shoulder \"3D Versus\" option; all the characters, 10 of which are missing their third DLC getups; and all the fighting backgrounds, which are about as animated as growing blades of grass.  Perhaps if the developers worked on this instead of the added \"Figure Collection\" mode, this would've been a perfect portable port.Speaking of which, this added feature allows players to buy random virtual figurines with in-game coins and organize a group of five to fight other figurines via StreetPass.  Totally unnecessary, but it adds something other than the 3D effects and having your 3DS challenge itself.

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, doubters say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.The return of Commander Shepard.View larger.A new cast of characters.View larger.Along with familiar faces from the past.View larger.New damage and dialogue systems.View larger.Integration with original game.View larger.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return, as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games as they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

You have driving, shooting, fist fights, foot and car chases, but a big part of the game is searching for clues at the scene of a crime and interviewing witnesses. The interviews are interesting .... people will sometimes tell the truth, tell a half truth, or lie. The clues you find will help you find the truth and solve the crime.Rockstar with Team Bondi have set a new bar for a criminal drama in video games. The story feels like a mix of  TV shows like Law and Order: Criminal Intent, and Lie To Me (especially during witness interviews). The action is Rockstar with a twist (you're a cop).

The story is actually quite amazing to say the least but you will be in it for the long haul.There are several maps and over twelve characters that meet in the story at different times. It is like Silent Hill but slower as you are not given great weapons to defeat the enemy. Instead you have the power of second sight. You do things in the map that are for the characters benefit and to set up something for another character who will arrive there later. The story is sort of like Pulp Fiction in that all the characters finally meet as you take them through the story.It is very very very difficult and very easy to die but there is a method to the game and once you manage to use the second site to run around the place so that the monsters do not see you it gets a lot easier.Stick with it, but this is by no means an out-of-box couple of days game play.

I'd like to hit the middle and provide you with some decent pros and cons.  On the one hand, the atmosphere is spooky and dark, the survival is not a twitch-fest like Doom3, and the concepts and characters are certainly unique.  But on the other, you have a system that promises an experience it can't deliver:  immersion, the most important requirement of a horror game.Maybe this has to do with its age--the controls can get awfully kludgy when you're trying to run down a darkened street, climb a low wall, and psychically tune in to your enemies to double-check if they see you.  Context menus drive some actions (similar to the Hitman games), while just standing in the right spot and pushing the stick will trigger others (like climbing).The character textures of course look dated, but the developers really went out of their way to stylize the whole look and feel, and it makes it easier to deal with because it all seems to fit into the tone of the game.  Unfortunately, the final clincher that keeps Siren \"good\" but not \"great\", is the unfortunate translation and voice-over work.  A series of British accents and much grunting and filler lines like, \"Wha?\" or \"Huuuh?\" make it difficult to really care whether these textured puppets live or die.I understand this game is being remade for the PS3--unless you're getting a cheap deal on Siren, you might want to hold out and see if the next generation systems can give this clever piece of work the proper interface (and translation) it needs.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2008"}

It does lag just a bit JUST A WEE BIT but thats only if im playing on a 1600 setting which most people dont play on. Settings lower than 1600 it runs really smoooooooooooooothee! as long as you have at least 512 mb and a decent graphics card like a 9000 radeon which is like sold for 50 bucks you can play this game on decent settings of 800 or 1024.

A lot of people, including myself, bought this up and had a great time hashing out songs with their friends and family.  I know I did!  There are many great songs on this game, but I feel the only one real problem with this game is that several of the gigs have some really crappy songs in them!  Many of my friends, my wife, and I agreed that there were definitely some poorly chosen songs in areas of this game.  After this the songs on following games were all a lot better, so I think after that whole thing they learned better of putting outlandish songs on Guitar Hero, and stick with more well known music.  However, that being said, this game was all around awesome, and I enjoyed playing through it, whether on my own or with my friends.  I also very much enjoyed the addition of the Tool playlist that you could earn with some of your in game dollars.  It was about $8,000 in game...a price I was more than willing to earn up to play them.  Tool typically keeps a pretty low profile and doesn't give in a whole lot to a lot of media and exposure, so I was not expecting to have seen that, but it was pretty awesome.  The animation for the duration of the 3 song set is pretty cool too.  I imagine anyone on drugs would have really freaked out playing those songs, LoL!

Now it seems that owners of the Wii U are going to get a chance to experience this with as Game and Wario is coming to this console. But is this collection of minigames going to be enough to justify buying this title?Instead of offering hundreds of games that you can choose from in previous installments there are only sixteen games and out of the sixteen four of those are multiplayer titles. The ones you can play with your friends range from Disco (creating a series of button presses that the other player must complete in time with the music), Sketch (which is an advanced version of pictionary as someone draws something and others have to guess what it is), Islands (launching characters known as fronks onto scoring zones but you can also knock your opponents fronk out of the way as well) and Fruit (as one player tries to steal a set of apples while others try to stop them).The single player games range from taking pictures of criminals to shooting arrows at oncoming robots. The only single player game that looks even remotely fun is the game featuring 9 volt called Gamer. In this game you can play simple wario ware type mini games as you lie in bed but you have to pay attention as not to get caught by your mother. You can hide to pretend you're asleep but do that for too long and the game ends. The games included in this collection all use the gamepad creatively and there are tokens that you can earn that will allow you to purchase capsules that contain either additional mini games or toys that can be used (like the glider game that was in Wario Ware touched).And the price seems to be fair as this collection of minigames will set you back around $40.00 but it seems no more than a glorified tech demo to show off the Wii U's control pad. If you do have a Wii U and you want a collection of mini-games that you will play for hours on end then by all means pick this game up.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Brian Seiler","summary":"I Don't Know If I'm Surprised","reviewText":"I'll admit that I didn't think that this game was the greatest idea to start with.  I like turn based combat, I don't like the saccharine side of Disney, and I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of this strange union.  That said, I was pleasantly surprised in a lot of ways by this game.  It deserves its status as one of the best selling RPGs of the past few years, and at the current price ($20 as a greatest hit title) every PS2 owner should buy it.Now, don't get me wrong--there's a lot that's not right with this game.  We'll start, as most people do, with the camera.  These developers should be ashamed.  I've met people who've failed out of community colleges that could have done a better job.  It's simply awful.  There's no other word for it.  The camera gets stuck on things.  The camera forces its way into awkward positions for no apparent reason.  At several points I felt as though the level designers had specifically tried to use the horrible control on the camera to make things more difficult.  Even .dot//Hack, which is not comparable to this game in a lot of ways, managed to build a camera that was responsive and let you keep your eyes on what you were doing.  The levels are poorly designed for as terrible a device as they're using, and there's simply no excuse for this kind of shoddy workmanship.Another annoying problem for me was the dialogue.  It's not that it was badly done (though there are some points at which the players don't deliver their lines in quite the fashion they were intended to)--it's that whoever scripted this thing didn't put enough in it.  There were several points in this game where the dialogue simply cut off and you were abruptly switched back to floating text boxes.  Very disconcerting and it did a lot to dull the experience for me.  And just as an aside--I know that it's the theme of the plot, but did the designers really have to try and set the record for most uses of the word &quot;heart&quot; in a ten minute span?  There are plenty of synonyms available, people--use them.All of that aside, though, this game still succeeds admirably despite its flaws.  The combat system, while not perfect (I didn't much like the ability system, and I particularly didn't like having to stick items on your characters before a fight) is remarkable.  The menu system is quite effective and the AI for your party companions is....well, it's terrible, but it's better than most of the ones I've seen in similar games.  The plot is involving and scripted better than normal for Square.  Rather than spiraling out of control near the end (as their stories so often do) everything remains tight and compact.  The characters feel real and you actually care about what happens to them.  Graphically, this game looks better than an awful lot of what I've seen on other platforms, and never mind how inferior the PS2 is supposed to be to the other two major consoles.  Square, as usual, has assembled a great looking product.  The music is also tolerably good, though perhaps not up to the standards fans of the Final Fantasy series might hold.  The mini-games are there for you to play, though once again you're forced to jump off of the plot in the middle of the climax and go slog through all the worlds you've already been to if you want to accomplish everything.  The game clocks in a little shorter than most Square RPGs (I finished up in a little over thirty hours with about half of the mini-games completed, and I spent a fair amount of time jumping into walls I wouldn't have had to if I'd gone to a walkthrough), but frankly I think most of their games run a little on the long end anyway, so that worked out well for me.On the whole, I'd recommend that any PS2 owner who's entertained the notion of purchasing this game go ahead and do it.  For twenty dollars, this is probably one of the best values that you can get.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Stephen A. Lambert \"DS Player, PC gamer\"","summary":"More than the sum of it's parts","reviewText":"Perhaps I'm coming to this review a little biased, as I enjoy both Disney and Square, but from a gamer's perspective, Kingdom Hearts is the cup of tea you've been searching for. The graphics are phenomenal, the voice acting is excellent, and the characters? All well-drawn and extremely well done. This game is not turn-based as some of Square's previous titles are, but the non-stop action won't disappoint you. It's all about action with role-playing elements thrown into the mix. And the blend is smooth to the point of perfection.The story starts a little slow, but this is just to get your feet wet as you get used to the way Sora moves, and how to successfully navigate the menus within the game. Mapping magic to certain buttons is a major plus for pulling off during the midst of combat, as you will find the Heartless are relentless in their pursuit of you and the Keyblade.This game is at an all-time reasonable price, so now's the time to get acquainted with Sora, Donald, and Goofy as they traverse the colorful worlds of Disney and attempt to stave off the destruction by the Heartless.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2005"}

The graphics are decent, and the sound is pretty good as well.  The use of the headset and varying commands are also great.  The inclusion of music within gameplay could have been removed to add more realism.  The faults of the game are several.  First, the AI of your team is completely moronic; meanwhile, your opponents AI is much better, and they can easily gun down your crew.  Several times when facing opponents, your team lies in direct line of fire, and even worse, let the opponents come close and either knock them out or throw a grenade.  Ghost Recon (XBox version) is much better.  Next, with the maps at the Briefing screen, you should be able to direct Bravo to move and cover various positions using waypoints of your own.  Third, there are cheap glitches in game.  In mission 10, the Hind that you are supposed to be attacking actually hides from you, and you are forced to stand in the open to fire at the chopper and will be slaughtered.  Every single time!  Cheap tactic! Furthermore, the game should have included more than a mission mode.  A firefight mode or defend mode would be really nice.  Again, Ghost Recon is superior in this aspect.  Also, the game should permit your team or yourself to improve your abilities. Again, Ghost Recon is better. Lastly, the game should have included a co-op multiplayer mode offline.  Again, Ghost Recon is superior.  This game is a somewhat enjoyable experience, but the game could be much better.Note: This game is an unabashed promotion for U.S. Navy Seals with its included documentary.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2003"}

The first thing you'll notice is that Metroid Fusion may resemble the classic Super Nintendo title, Super Metroid (regarded by many as the best Metroid game ever, and maybe the best game to ever grace the Super NES, which in itself is really saying something), but Super Metroid this is not.  The game picks up with Samus trapped a maze like ship with alien life forms running amok, and it's your job to put them in their place.  As the game goes on, you'll come across bigger and nastier baddies, as well as an enemy which bears a striking resemblance to our hero.  Anyone familiar with any of the side scrolling Metroid games will have no problem at all getting into the game, as it features great graphics, sound effects, and tried but true gameplay that the series is best known for.  The game's story is also something great as well, adding another layer to the Metroid mythology.  If there's only one bad thing to say about Metroid Fusion, it's that it's a bit on the short side. Despite that though, Metroid Fusion still manages to be one of the best, original games to find on the GBA.

I mostly played Nintendo 64 and now PS3. And while I enjoy the Wii Virtual Console, the offerings can be a bit expensive and difficult to switch between. Introducing the Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection. The title is a bit curious to me, because most of the games are non-Sonic and several are for consoles other than the Genesis. Don't let the name stop you from buying this collection.And what a collection it is! Of the included games, I would say I've only played Sonic the Hedgehog before, as we all have. So it was a real treat to discover the beat 'em up series Golden Axe, the futuristic RPG series Phantasy Star, and the playfulness of Ecco the Dolphin. These are high-quality titles that have since been largely forgotten. Many maintain cult followings. Here you get the chance to experience what makes some people so crazy for these classics. I have only tried out a handful of the titles and was impressed with their quality. You'd be forgiven if you were expecting a dump of cheaply-licensed sequels and Sonic iterations. Instead, you're getting some of the defining Sega titles from when that company still made great games. Sometimes I get the feeling that, despite graphical advances, games haven't really progressed beyond the example set by titles like these. While pixelated, the stylistic effects are charming and creative.The collection is also well-assembled, with a robust interface and usable game controls. You can choose to play games either in their original 4x3 format, with a thematic background graphic instead of black bars. Or you can opt for a 16x9 stretched display. What's more, you have incentive to keep playing, with unlockable (free) content available for completing certain feats in the games. Switching between games is quick and efficient, and save data ensures you can pick up where you left off.Just think about the deal you are getting here. These are many of the classics of the 1990s, pulled together for less than a dollar per game. It's an easy sell if you ask me.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2012"}

The longest game in the series, number 8 is one of two that I have been able to beat (along with number 10). The game spans across 4 epic discs (though, as usual, the final disc is rather short). In each disc, there are all sorts of lush 32-bit landscapes and characters, as well as gorgeous summons and various other magic spells. The CG cinematics are stunning, especially the ending. The character designs are new to the series, which is great: it was the first with the more adult looking characters that also stylized number 10 (parts one and two).Also, the musical score, though not as good as the one in VII, is GORGEOUS! The battle music for both bosses and regular monsters is beautiful: while the monster battles have more of a classical sound (strings leading in to a brass and wind attack), while the boss theme is more of a synth rock tune with rhythm guitar chugging away beneath the keys. The final battle music is beautiful, as is the music in the final level (Ultimecia castle). In fact, the music in Ultimecia castle sent chills down my spine when I first heard it, it is VERY creepy, with the organs blaring and the harpsichords beneath it. The bottom line: it doesn't have as wide of a variety of characters as many other Final Fantasy games do, but it has an eerie and atmospheric musical score that only Final Fantasy VII can beat.

{"product_name":"B00009WAUK","description":"You can almost hear the collective drooling of RPG and Game Boy fans worldwide. As the inaugural Nintendo/Square reunion title,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancehas a lot to live up to--and it does, spectacularly!The long heralded Final Fantasy series has enjoyed a number of spin-offs and sequels. Using the familiar character types and classes of the Final Fantasy series, but with a wholly original storyline,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancecreates an immersive world of strategic combat and conquest.Snow JobWhile most fantasy games favor romantic landscapes,Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceslyly starts out in a plain-vanilla suburb. Players assume the role of young Marche Radiuju in the humble burg of St. Ivalice.A snowball fight introduces the characters and sets the groundwork for future battles. After a brief (but chilly) skirmish, Marche heads home to visit his younger brother.Marche MadnessSoon after, Marche's friends drop by to show him an ancient book of mysterious origins. After failing to translate the text properly, Marche's friends leave for the evening. After a wistful slumber, Marche awakens and realizes he isn't in Ivalice anymore... or is he?Alone in a foreign land, Marche quickly comes under the care of a helpful creature known as a Moogle. It doesn't take much to convince Marche to adopt a lucrative career as a mercenary.Gangs of IvaliceA quick stop at the town inn introduces Marche to his new gang. A motley crew at best, your associates include low-level monks, mages, archers, and soldiers. The only hope you have of finding your way home is to turn your ragtag group of misfits into a finely tuned fighting force.Begin your tour of duty by chatting up the local barkeep. He'll clue you in to interesting news bits, rumors, and job opportunities. Due to your severe lack of experience, early quests are little more than errands.As you gain experience and reputation, your job options grow as well as the rewards. You can also send one of your crew members on side missions for extra swag. You cannot use these members in your regular quests until they return from their mission.Rules of EngagementWhether your quest is to fetch rare herbs or escort the local nobleman, you can always expect bad company. The battlefield is set up from an isometric 3D viewpoint, allowing clear view of every character in play.At the start of a match, you must choose which members of your gang you wish to take into battle with you. You have a clear view of the enemies before choosing, so try to match your lineup to your opposition.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceintroduces an innovative law system to the series. During every battle, an impartial judge decrees specific rules, such as banning poison attacks or physical attacks. The judges' unpredictability requires players to keep a well-rounded group of characters at all times.Technically, you can break the combat laws, but it is generally not recommended. Even if you win the battle, any of your characters who breaks a law is whisked away to prison. They can only be released after paying a hefty fine.Fantasy FightingThe battlefield is set up like a 3D chessboard, with elevations and terrain types. In each turn, a character can move a specific number of spaces and perform a single action, such as attack or using an item.Most strategy games employ either real-time or turn-based action.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceemploys a speed-based system that is somewhere in-between.Characters still take turns to move and perform actions, but these are based on each character's individual speed ratings. Nimble characters like rogues and ninjas are usually the first characters to go and can usually move farther than other characters. The downside is that faster characters typically lack strong armor and health stats.Subtle details such as terrain type and attack proximity can have a direct affect on your ability to hit an enemy. Attacking an enemy from behind or the side will yield much higher hit percentages than head-on attacks.Job FairWhat you do off the battlefield is arguably more important than what you do on it. Thanks to a stable economy, your characters can usually change job classes once they gain enough experience.Need a little more magic in your life? Try turning one of your grunts into a mage. There are more than 30 different job classes available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.Even in far-off fantasy lands, commercialism is a way of life. You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll end up spending your hard-earned greenbacks on shiny new stuff. Weapons and armor serve not only to boost your stats, but also grant special abilities to specific character types and species.While one sword might grant tremendous attack points, a seemingly lesser sword may give its wielder access to a special attack that can tip the scales in your favor. Thanks to the law system, one should never get too attached to a single piece of equipment.Face ValueGorgeous character illustrations and 2D sprites harken back to Square's 16-bit glory days. Each of the shops, inns, towns, and fields is superbly detailed, with subtle background animations.Final Fantasy Tactics Advancemaintains the series' stellar rep for technically and visually brilliant summon attacks.Uniquely,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancefeatures three separate display settings, depending on whether you're playing on the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, or the Game Boy Player. Each setting offers different levels of brightness, contrast, and saturation to appease even the most fickle of gamers.The only thing that can rival the on-screen wonders is the audio candy. It is no surprise why Square Enix's soundtracks are the most sought-after in the video game community.Lasting PowerNeedless to say, there are hours upon hours of gameplay packed into this tiny little cartridge.

{"product_name":"B000FRS9II","reviewerName":"Jeffrey S. Stanley \"Viper_29\"","summary":"Best Game ever. Period.","reviewText":"Well, what else can be said about Gears of War. This game has set the bar for all next-gen games to be measured to. While the game had originally been set for a launch release with the 360, I can only say that the delay was very much worth it. This game is simply above anything else that has come before.Lets all start off by saying that this is not a Halo game. The mature rating on this game will prevent it from being the next Halo for the 360. With that said, in my honest opinion it is a much, much better game that Halo (1 & 2) could have ever been. The mechanics in this game are much more realistic. This game does not allow you to run and blast your way through, you will be chopped to bits in an instance. You have to be strategic in your approach. There is a lot of cover and shelter in the game and you learn early on that to survive, you must use the cover. A great feature of this game is that it is very much a simple game to play in that you can pretty much use one button to do most of your moves. The story line is well laid out and while the game play in a very linear line, there is enough variation to keeps things interesting. The first thing that anyone will notice is the incredible graphics of this game. Even more so on a HiDef TV. This game is simply incredible in the presentation, the clarity and the framerate. I only noticed a couple of spots where the framerate slowed but it wasn't anything too bad. I have beat the game and am replaying it on the hardcore level. There are several times in the game where you will have to choose a path to go, which does allow for some replayability in the single player campaign. I also have to say that this is simply the best game for use of a chainsaw ever. Doom doesn't have anything on this chainsaw/rifle combo. Start your saw and lay into one of the locust and enjoy one of those guilty pleasures that Gears can offer. This is a very gory game. Blood splatters very realistically and you can blow your enemies (and they you) into many small pieces.I have only been able to play a small amount of the multiplayer on Live, but what I have played is very addicting. There are several different modes and they all allow for a good variety in gameplay. This will suffice nicely, atleast until Rainbow Six Vegas comes out and rules Live. The voice over acting is done nicely. The main character, Marcus Fenix, carries the game along with his compadres Dom, Cole and Baird. I was floored when I found that the guy who does Marcus's voice also voices that loveable robot on Futurama, Bender.If you own a 360, you simply must have this game in your library. No other game has the intensity or the beauty that this game offers. While MS hasn't confirmed a sequel, one can only expect another Gears to come out. This game all but confirms it at the end. No spoilers here. I can say that I am halfway through playing it a second time and I am still picking things up about the game that I missed the first time through. While this won't be the next Halo, I think it can ring up it own's little title all it's own. It is definitely a system seller. Enjoy it and if you don't have it now, do yourself a flavor and buy it now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2006"}

PROS/  I like how Tetra is really Zelda in disguise.  Ganondorf makes his appearance.  CONS/  Link is not really Link.  The guy you control who RESEMBLES Link is actually just a boy who dresses in Link clothing and takes the legendary sword and shield.  The water filled base, it's cool at first and maybe if it was smaller but most of the whole map/world is water and it gets annoying when you're trying to sail and everytime you want to go another way you have to play the song.The temples:  Only a couple, somewhat of a challenge, pretty well done.  I love the enemies and the fact that you have to sneak around under a barrel just so you won't get caught.  Puzzling but not as hard as OoT and some of the parts in MM.The characters:  The only character I really like is Tetra and Ganondorf.  It would have been a lot better if you were playing as the real Link but you're not.  You can pretend all you want but firstly, Link doesn't have a sister (especially a sissy one who would get captured) and secondly, Link does not show much emotion.  The main reason for cel shading this game was to have the so-called Link show emotions but in my views, Link is a tough guy who doesn't like to show much emotion.  See the facial gestures in Oot, MM and Super Smash Bros. Melee.In all, this is an excellent game to play, the temples and underground caves are fun to play and the items are cool and interesting.  Tingle is the same weirdo as always and the &quot;small fry&quot; fish is cool.  Okay well that's all I can write since my computer is messing up royal, anyways, this is an amazing game and I suggest you buy it especially if you enjoyed the other Zelda games.  A good edition.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2004"}

B. Link \"wildfirelink\"","summary":"A good start for the first next-gen MM spin-off series","reviewText":"Mega Man X (1993). The first part of a seven episode spin-off series, and the first one to appear on the Super Nintendo.By the time 1993 came around, the NES was almost dead and everyone's favorite series' of games had to be ported over to the then-next-generation system, the SNES. Many companies pulled it off quite nicely with new-port sequels of games like Mario, Castlevania, Metroid, and others. Obviously, Capcom heeded the calls of their devoted fans and decided to give their most successful series an innovative upgrade, and a new darker look. Thus the Mega Man X series was created. Although a bit cartoony looking (compared to say, X3 and X4), it took the MM series to a whole new level in terms of story, gameplay, and features. Well, here's my synopsis:PROS:-COMPLETELY ORIGINAL IDEAS. Most every X game hereafter would re-use this game's general formula of \"find the armor, beat the bosses\". The biggest difference gameplay-wise from the original series is the armor feature. By collecting parts of it, X becomes more able to take on the levels and the bosses (the levels themselves were designed with the dash feature in mind).-The idea for the \"power/animal\" bosses is alot more clever and original than the repetitive \"power/man\" type bosses used in the older games. For instance, Storm Eagle sounds quite a bit more threatening than say, ... Bright Man.-GOOD MUSIC IMPROVEMENT. Well, the old games had good tunes, but these sound more like upbeat hard rock in terms of quality, than the buzzing NES midi. The loud sound effects are especially fitting for an action game like this.-STORYWISE, A NICE CONNECTION TO THE ORIGINAL SERIES. It starts out with X being built by Dr. Light. He is very unsure about his new prototype model, so in order to make sure all of X's systems will function properly, he (X) must be locked in a capsule for about thirty years. Light realized that he won't be alive when X awakens, so he buries X for another scientist to find. 30 years later, Dr. Cain finds X and starts to build numerous creations based off of X's design. One of them, Sigma, goes haywire and threatens to destroy all of mankind, so X is sent to stop him. I won't spoil the rest.-Great balance of gameplay. The action is tough, but not too hard to the point of impossibility. There is plenty to shoot at, and enough great weapons to do so with. I like the new idea of CHARGING UP BOSS WEAPONS. At the cost of more w-energy, a little flame attack can turn into a giant wave of flame pillars. Simply a phenominal idea.-I LOVE THE IDEA OF BEATING A STAGE IN ORDER TO ALTER ANOTHER ONE. For instance, if Chill Penguin is destroyed, then all the lava in Flame Mammoth's stage will freeze, enabling X to make it through the stage easier and to obtain more powerups. Sadly, this idea was completely ignored for the next 4 sequels until X6, where it returned in the form of a crudely put together Nightmare system.CONS:-This is the first MMX game, and it shows. Many ideas haven't  been brought to their full potential yet, which would happen later in the next few games. A perfect example of this is the ram-helmet upgrade. There is one place where you can use it, but otherwise it's only function is to make X look more fancy. LIKE I SAID, THIS WILL IMPROVE IN THE UPCOMING SEQUELS.-The levels are decently designed and reasonably long, but like X4, there are hardly any extras to find (however, this IS the first game). Powerups are easy to find for the most part (the dash-boots upgrade IS DIRECTLY IN YOUR PATH). Still, there are more secrets to find here than in any other MM game up to that point.-Zero and Vile are introduced, but they don't really explain each of them here (Zero would be in X2, and Vile sort of would be in X3). The reason I complain about this is because originally, this was going to be the only game, and it would have been pointless to introduce close characters that wouldn't get a chance to evolve.All things said, I can't really find anything bad about this game. It's a great step up from the old series and has some of the best 2D action gameplay you will ever find on the SNES. Its only slight drawback comes from the fact that the X series is at its concept stage at this point, giving off ideas that will only continue to improve in the next several X games. This game gets 4 stars for good gameplay/sound/story/innovation, all put together into an overall great package. I heartily recommend this game to beginners of the series. Many long-time fans find this to be their all-time favorite X game. While it's certainly not my favorite, it does everything that an oldschool 2D action game should do: deliver pure nostalgic gaming bliss. Besides, isn't that all that MM games need in order to be good? If you haven't played this game yet, either you're too young to care, or you've been living in a hole for the past decade. In which case, go get yourself equipped with Time Stopper, and track down a copy of this game before they all disappear. You won't regret it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2003"}

Daneker","summary":"Addicting, challenging, gripping, runs on my notebook!!!!","reviewText":"People who say this game glitches or doesn't work must have computer issues. I run this game on a HP DV9000 custom Notebook and it runs great. I run at 1280 x 800 widescreen and it looks flawless. I use the onboard GEforce GO 7600 graphics, 4gig of 5-5-5-15 ram, 250 gig of dual SATA 7200rpm HD. I run the game at full-out high everything and it is completely smooth, never drops frames, glitches or hangs. My OS is Vista Business 64 and I run a 64x AMD Turion dual-core 1.8x2 CPU.As for the game, from the first moment of play it's impossible to stop. I would have liked more tacticle fighting (like halo) because you can't find cover and you can't run, you have to fight! I also found that while the amount of ammunition you find is sufficiant (you can buy it at vending machines as well) there are so many types of ammo and the game does not automatically go to the next type your weapon has available. It's a very clunky system and a patch would fix it. Also, you have to pick everything up manually, this becomes tiresome. Otherwise, on to the good stuff.The graphics are brilliat art-deco. At first they seem to get repeditive, but part-way through the game you release a gas into the air that cleans everything up and gets the plants growing, suddenly the enviroment is lush and colorful!The story is, well, I have no idea! Played about 1/3 through and I have no idea what the story is! Just keep solving each area, power-up and moove on. The great thing is that this is not a corridor shooter like Jericho, and it is not repeditive and boring like Hellgate! Bioshock gives you room to run about and explore if you need to, though more exploration and treasures (upgrades, etc) would be nice (Think \"Patch\") because the just thrusting forward all the time leaves a mildly empty feeling.However, the game does have the added moral issue of saving little girls and massivly powering up, or simply curing them and only aborbing a little power. The girls, though, are clones and considering the limited number (2 - 3 per area) they should have all looked unique. I have no idea what the implications of curing or killing them will be, but I bet it pays off.So far the best games I've seen this year are Bioshock, Uncharted: Drakes Quest and The Witcher. The worse was Hellgate London (looks nice, but never changes, never goes anywhere, no story, just repeditive.) I think if you like Halo 2 PC you'll be into Bioshock, it's not quite as tactical as Halo, not Quite as puzzling as Half-Life 2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2008"}

So how has the game \"progressed\" since GTA San Andreas?  Actually it has regressed and shoved a new gimmicky gaming aspect down your throat. When I heard about the announcement of GTA4 I was skeptical.  I believed that GTA San Andreas had such a level of depth that GTA4 couldnt possibly exceed. So I figured i'd just get GTA SA with a new coat of polish.  BOy was I wrong.Size and Scale:At first GTA seems huge. Once you get around however the game just feels a lot smaller than San ANdreas.  There isnt much variety between areas of town as compared to the LA/Las Vegas/Area 51 areas of San Andreas.Gameplay:Driving is now more difficult.  Especially for motorbikes.  Motorbikes a deathtraps. Which I guess is realistic but in the heat of a chase far too often you go flying off the bike into a wall and dying. Just to repeat the mission over. Repeating quests is as great as the developers made it out to be.  Here's a scenario.  Get a call from quest giver. Drive all the way across town or grab a taxi and teleport to your destination(a truly excellent addition to the game). Meet quest giver, watch cut scene then drive or taxi all the way to quest.  Do section A of quest. Do section B of quest. Die. Rez at hospital. Receive the text message via cellphone to repeat quest but you still have to drive from the quest giver to the quest all over again.  THis may sound silly but it is a huge waste of time and rage builder when you die several times do to the spotty(However the best in GTA history) combat system. Missions also are less inventive. They're 50% car chases where you have to follow a target(but not kill them) to a safehouse then take down a whole gang, 45% car chases that end in killing the target and about 5% \"drive to this building, clear it out and bring me back something that someone stole from me\"SA included missions like stealing a damn Harrier Jet from a battleship. Wheres the imagination?Graphics:Graphics are pretty good for GTA series but not jaw dropping at any moment. SOme pop up but all in all a decent effort.  Some character face models are hideous though. Not giving anything away but one of the main love interests are completely hideous.Sound:This is the worst soundtrack since before Vice City. There are a few gems and easter eggs(like the song from Silence of the Lambs that the killer dances too naked) All in all the soundtrack is forgettable. Most of the voice acting is great. Many of the characters are likeable and the voice acting is well done.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2008"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Spectacular","reviewText":"The title Ninja Gaiden alone will coax enough praise and groan-worthy comments from anyone who has had experience with Tecmo's long running series, and Ninja Gaiden II is no different.  Once again, a Ninja Gaiden game has managed to provide heaping amounts of action-oriented gameplay that can become mind-numbingly difficult, and once again, for those that enjoy the series' gameplay, the game delivers in spades, and is a spectacular action experience.  Once again playing as Ryu Hyabusa, you take on hordes of enemies that can be dispatched in some outrageously bloody and violent ways.  The character models and action set-pieces are so flashy and well designed that there will be moments of trying to pick your jaw up off the floor.  Yes, the game looks that good.  The only drawback from a graphical standpoint is that some of the environments themselves aren't all that worth noting, but with so much frentic action, you'll rarely notice.  Being a Ninja Gaiden game, there are spectacular boss battles to engage in as well, and the other enemies in general provide much challenge to boot.  The only major flaw with Ninja Gaiden II would have to be the in-game camera, which at times can make the game even more infuriating to play.  If this can be forgiven however, you will find some tough and rewarding gameplay that the series is known for; and the game's wonderful control, wild story, superb cut-scenes, great new weapons, and grisly finishing moves make this an even sweeter package.  All in all, Ninja Gaiden II is a spectacular action game that nearly perfectly follows the same winning formula that the series has in the past, and is an essential pick up for XBox 360 owners that love the series, and a more than worthwhile introduction for new fans of the series as well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2008"}

I felt it was sub-par for many rockstar storylines we've been entertained with over the past ten years, and that it was just an effort to explain about the prevalent Biker Gang's inner turmoil as hinted at throughout GTA IV.  It plays the same, but isn't anywhere near as long.Nice additions to the GTA4 game with EOLC is the drug wars, the fight club, and the three-part races (where you skydive to a boat, race to a dock, and hop in a car to jet to the finish line - very cool).

You are faced with variety of enemies, either you punish them using your guns and swords or you get punished for not punish them. I have been a big fan of DMC games thanks to DMC1 and DMC3. So I had to try it and I have to say, I am not disappointed. Here is why.************PROS***************CRAZY ACTION: Just like previous DMC games, your main character has a gun and a sword. Your goal is to use them in the most creative way possible to punish a huge variety of enemies that are out to destroy you. In previous games, Dante, dual guns and a huge sword wielder, has been the main character. In this game you get to play as Dante too, but the main character is Nero. Like Dante, Nero carries a huge sword. Unlike Dante, Nero only carries one gun. But Nero at the same time also has a demonic arm. So with sword that can emit fire, demonic arm and using revolver, with Nero you can do wide range of combos to punish enemies. Better combos you do, better stylish point you get and more orbs you get that unlock better rewards. While Nero can only use given weapons, Dante is a whole different story. He can use variety of weapons and if you mix and match different weapons you can come up with limitless amazing combos to punish your enemy.BEAUTIFUL GRAPHICS AND GORGEOUS SCENERY: This is the first DMC game that came out on next gen consoles. With 720p resolution and 30 (or 60, sorry forgot) fps picture, the game looks stunning. The artwork for main characters, levels as well as small fry enemies is aesthetically created. You will love punishing enemies whether you are in a small town eutopean village, snowy mountain, tropical woods or gothic castle. EVERYTHING JUST LOOK GORGEOUS.RIDICULOUS BOSSES: Other than fast-paced crazy action, DMC series is famous for mind-blowing boss fights. DMC4 carries on the legacy by introducing ridiculously astonishing bosses such as four-legged fiery minotaur with devastating blaze attacks, icy giant toad who can swallow you in a bite, serpentile-venomous man-eating flower demon and the list goes on. Button-mashing against this bosses will swiftly get you killed while dodging their attacks, creating openings and punishing them with different weapon combination will greatly reward you.RANKING SYSTEM TIED TO UPGRADABLE MOVES: As stated above, button-mashing will get you killed; however, if you play strategically as described in above section, you get ranked according to your performance during the battle. The better rank you receive while defeating your enemies, the more orbs you get for killing your enemies. This orbs can be used to buy a whole variety of moves. More moves you buy, more you can use them in the battle and more you can punish your enemies. This truly promotes you to hone your skills rather than button mashing randomly. LOVED IT... JUST LOVED IT.VARIETY IN ENEMIES: These days when majority of games have 3-4 different types of enemies making the game very redundant, DMC series, including DMC4 has provides you with a huge spectrum of enemies. On weaker end you will have scarecrows with sharp blades attached to their limbs while on the stronger end you will have lightning fast demon that will dodge your swiftest attacks and deliver you with a devastating blow.INCREDIBLY DESTRUCTIVE WEAPONS FOR DANTE: As indicated above, while Nero is stuck with what he is given in terms of weapons, Dante on the other hand is provided with variety of weapons. Defeating each boss will reward him devastating new weapons. Some weapons are quite unique. While at first you may find them difficult to use, once you get hand of them, you will love punishing your enemies with them. Combo of hand guns and melee weapons will just blow your mind.NERO AND DANTE: DECENT STORY (NO SPOILERS): As mentioned before, the main character in this game is Nero. The story begins with Dante coming to Nero's town and doing things that are a bit out of character for Dante. Since then Nero chases Dante to solve the mystery of what is going on with the town that is all of sudden filled with demons, his missing girlfriend and his own organization. Sorry can't tell you much. While movie watchers and book readers will see most of the things coming, there are few things that will surprise you, especially if you have been following DMC story.AMAZING REPLAY VALUE: Just like previous Devil May cry games, once you finish the game on the most difficult mode possible, you will unlock new modes. Some of this new modes are challenging as hell such as Dante Must Die mode while others are very unique and interesting such as Heaven and Hell mode, where you can kill any enemies including bosses using one hit, but even weakest enemy can kill you with one hit in return. I have finished all of these (~70-80hrs) and just loved them. Finishing all of these modes will reward you with more artwork and cool 720p HD pictures, if that is something that you might be into.***********CONS***************BACKTRACKING: While this is not a major issue, it is still an issue. In the later chapters of the game you revisit the same areas as initial chapters. While the character you play as is different (Dante) and the path you take is also different, it is somewhat redundant. Honestly though combat is so awesome that you won't notice.NERO vs DANTE: This one is just my personal opinion. While playing as Nero was fun and great, I wish Dante was the main character and Nero was the side character. Both Dante and Nero have different personalities and abilities as listed above. I just prefer Dante better. So wish they had more levels with him.***********CONCLUSION*************If you are new to the DMC franchise, this game is PERFECT for you as the story starts fresh with Nero. If you are veteran to DMC, this game may irritate you little, but as I veteran I personally had a lot of fun, all thanks to combat. So I would give 9/10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2010"}

Being able to create your kart and character is a great idea.  You can be very creative when making your stuff.  For example, i made a cardboard kart with a hamster wheel as my engine.  Then i have a another kart that uses a nuclear reactor for the engine.  Character creation is really cool.  I have seen a lot of creative people making iron man, punisher, mario, luigi, a helghast from killzone, jason voorhees, freddy krueger, star war characters.  My game came with a download of sackboy from little big planet and i have been using him in career mode.For career mode, its pretty challenging trying to win a race.  You usually have to make 3rd place in order to win a race for the first part of the game. I'm in the middle of the game right now, and it just changed to where i have to win first place to advanced.  So be aware of that.  For each race, there is a challenge to knock out an opponent or dont bump the side walls and win first place to unlock stuff. Some of the races are easy and some are hard and have to keep restarting to beat it. If you find yourself getting frustrated, take a break from the game and then retry later on, and you'll beat it.The ingame announcers are hilliarous and they insult each other a lot.  Its funny listening to them.  When you lose a race, they will make a funny rude comment about your driving.The special weapons in the game are cool but can be annoying to.  Especially when your about to win first and then you struck by lightning.  How it works is you pick up a weapon, if you dont useit and pick up another one, you increased the power of that weapon.  If you get a third one, its maxed out and you can do some serious damage with it.  There is also a speed boost, if you get three of those and use it, it will send you warp speed and catch you up to the race or help get in winning position.  It saved me a lot of times.The downside to this game is the load times, especially in multiplayer. I heard rumors that there will be a fix to speed that up but i dont know if thats true or not.Overall, its a really fun game.  The demo version was somewhat ok and it made me hesistant to buy it, but when i bought and played, i'm glad i got it.  Reading game reviews is what helped my decision.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002I0GX88","description":"","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"This supercharged sequel is familiar, but \"electrifyingly\" fun","reviewText":"Cole MacGrath, the Electric Man, is back for some more sizzling mayhem which is very reminiscent of his previous adventure. Despite certain rumors about being able to carry over saved data from the first Infamous into this game, Sucker Punch has decided to take a different approach in allowing you to \"continue\" the story of Cole's previous exploits. The game opens with three choices available for the player: begin a new game from scratch with neutral karma, begin the game with some good karma and experience points, or begin the game with some evil karma and experience points. Afterwards, Cole is shown in Empire City recalling the events from the previous game and then being approached by NSA agent Lucy Kuo, who also knows of the eventual arrival of the Beast that Kessler showed to Cole in a vision before he died. Kuo tells Cole about Dr. Wolfe, who helped develop the Ray Sphere, and she suggests that Dr. Wolfe may be able to help Cole gain the power needed to stop the Beast when it makes its move. As Cole, his old buddy Zeke, and Kuo are about to set sail for New Marais to meet up with Dr. Wolfe, the Beast shows up and starts leveling Empire City. Cole does all he can to stop it, but he simply isn't powerful enough to do so. Instead, he barely makes it back to the boat broken, beaten, and with some of his powers drained away. Empire City itself is even less fortunate and ends up getting destroyed by the Beast.Cole and the others eventually arrive at New Marais, the New Orleans of the Infamous universe. While this city is not under government quarantine, it has been put under lockdown by a group of gun wielding yahoos called the Militia, and they are under the leadership of business mogul Bertrand who is on a ruthless campaign to hunt down all Deviants (or Conduits) which are considered to be sub-human; kind of like how people view Mutants in Marvel comics. Cole then sets out on his mission to increase his power so he'll be able to destroy the Beast, which is slowly but surely creating a path of utter destruction along the eastern seaboard as it makes its way towards New Marais to catch up with Cole. With regards to how this game is structured with comic book themed cutscenes, movement and combat controls, the layout of the city, accessing of missions, random encounters, and taking territory back from enemy forces, this game is almost an exact clone of the first one. If any of you have played the Jak and Daxter series, it's a lot like the relationship between Jak II and Jak 3: two VERY similar games with a few tweaks here and there. In order to become more powerful, Cole will have to undertake many missions involving taking out enemies, escorting or accompanying allies through enemy territory, locating important items, and once again restoring power to certain sections of the city (but no running through smelly sewers this time). Of course, Cole will have the choice to complete his missions as a force for good or as a harbinger of destruction.This is one aspect of Infamous 2 that builds up on and surpasses what was done in the first game; while the karmic choices are once again very cut and dry, the way in which Cole acts upon them and the repercussions afterwards are quite varied. Like in the first game, Cole will have to avoid harming or killing citizens and cops if he wants to be good, while his evil persona can do as he pleases. He'll get more numerous opportunities with random encounters to gain large amounts of good or evil karma points: good guys can stop muggings, disarm bombs powered by Blast Shards (which can be acquired afterwards), and heal groups of injured people; bad guys can steal Blast Shards from certain wandering citizens, attack groups of police officers, take out protesters who support Bertrand and verbally bash Cole, or simply kill the people who are injured and being mugged, and even blow up the Blast Shard bombs. There are of course the good and evil side missions like in the first game that offer more karma points. Good missions will have Cole doing things like helping cops and rebels against bad guys and monsters, while evil missions will have Cole destroying parts of the city, letting people get attacked for a while by monsters, and hunting down pro-Militia people.Some of the main missions of the first game offered a few karmic choices which were very plain in their delivery (kill this guy or let him live, blow up innocent people or receive some damage instead, choose the good poster or the bad poster), but some of the main missions in this game are much more dynamic and offer very different karmic routes. Kuo, who eventually acquires ice powers, represents Cole's good karmic alignment, while the more wild (and somewhat annoying) Conduit named Nix, with powers of smog and fire, represents Cole's evil karmic alignment. Zeke kind of goes both ways (no pun intended), but mostly favors the good choices like Kuo. With Kuo and Nix acting as Cole's shoulder angel and devil, Cole will have to side with one or the other during some of these missions. For example, in order to gain the support of a rebel faction, Cole can side with Kuo and deliver medical supplies to the rebels in order to gain their trust, or he can side with Nix who will attack the rebels disguised as a Militia goon and Cole will step in and \"save the day\" to fool the rebels into relying on him. As a result, these main missions that offer you these karmic decisions will play out very differently depending on which choice you make.Sucker Punch promised us a more powerful Cole MacGrath, and for the most part they deliver on that. However, due to certain gameplay elements which could have been done differently, Cole ends up feeling somewhat underpowered for the majority of the game. From the very beginning he still has his lightning bolts, shockwaves, Static Thrusters, and Shock Grenades, but being drained by the Beast made him temporarily lose his Precision (sniper lightning bolt), electric rockets, his electric shield, and his lightning storm. As you would expect, he does regain these powers and their respective upgrades as you go further in the game, but he doesn't regain the electric rockets until just past the game's halfway point, which kind of sucks since they could have come in handy in earlier missions where Cole fights powerful monsters and annoying attack choppers. He also doesn't regain his most powerful attack, the lightning storm (now the Ionic Storm), until the penultimate main mission, which REALLY sucks since by that point in the game you don't have much of an opportunity to use it. Even the first game allowed Cole to use that power at an earlier point. Still, Cole does gain access to a bunch of other upgrades to his powers and other newer ones, and a lot of them depend on whether Cole is good or evil. While the first game had stunts which were mostly just for fun, this one requires you to perform stunts like hitting bad guys with head shots or using a shockwave to blast them off a roof in order to unlock upgrades, as well as completing a set number of side missions.Once the upgrades have been unlocked, you can use your EXP to purchase them and they include firing three lightning bolts in a single blast, throwing a shock grenade that splits into several smaller ones before detonating, and shooting a longer range Precision bolt. Other powers are acquired after Cole absorbs energy from devices called Blast Cores, which include improved Static Thrusters or the Ionic Vortex where Cole fires an electric blast that creates a miniature tornado that decimates large groups of smaller enemies. Good Cole eventually acquires ice based powers that allow him to create an ice shield or have a pillar of ice shoot up from underneath his feet to greatly increase his jumping height, as well as icy versions of his grenades and missiles. He also gains upgrades to his regular electric attacks like rapid fire lightning bolts, a slower but more powerful lightning bolt with greater range, and the ability to do far less damage to civilians should he accidentally shoot one (greatly cutting down on accidental civilian casualties). Evil Cole acquires fire based powers that let him plow into his enemies like a human rocket, and of course fiery versions of his grenades and missiles.His other upgrades include a more damaging shockwave blast, a lightning bolt that fires about five bolts at the same time horizontally, and temporary use of unlimited energy after bioleeching someone. All these attacks, even the lightning bolt, use up Cole's battery cores, except the Ionic attacks which use up Ionic Charges (up to three of these can be stored). Then there is Cole's melee weapon known as the Amp, which kind of looks like a cross between a pogo stick and a tuning fork. He charges it up and uses it as an electric club to bash his enemies around with some impressive looking spinning strikes and homerun slams, so the melee combat is much improved in this game. All these abilities are necessary for Cole to defeat the many challenging enemies he encounters: the gun wielding Militia, Conduits who use a combination of standard weaponry and ice powers, and creatures known as the Corrupted who come in all shapes and sizes... and just as many forms of ugliness. Different groups inhabit different areas of the two large islands that make up New Marais. Unlike Empire City, this city has many different looking and diverse areas, including a red light district, an industrial zone with warehouses and gas tanks, swamplands, trainyards, and the area known as Flood City. Much like the area of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, the neighborhood of Flood City is of course flooded and has many half submerged houses and buildings littering its territory... this area is of course more treacherous for Cole to navigate. It also makes the destruction in Empire City look almost tame in comparison.Blast Shards make a return in this game to increase the amount of energy Cole can store. Dead Drops left behind by Dr. Wolfe are also in this game, except this time they're attached to carrier pigeons who fly in circles around the city and Cole can either lethally shoot them down or use a shockwave to stun them (this doesn't affect karma). Since their general direction can't be picked up by Cole's electric radar ping, these Dead Drops are much trickier to find and only show up on Cole's mini-map when he's relatively close to them. Special mention has to go to the game's graphics: they are much better and prettier to look at than they were in the first game, especially with regards to the character and monster designs. Cole himself looks particularly amazing and his different karmic appearances are more diverse. As Cole rises in the halls of goodness he'll wear a clean white shirt, sport more circular arm tattoos, have a nice tan, his Amp will be clean and shiny, and he'll stand straight and tall with his chest out like Superman. But as Cole falls into the depths of naughtiness he'll wear a dirty and tattered red shirt, sport more sharp and pointy looking tattoos, have a pale complexion and stubble on his chin, his Amp will be rusted and dirty, and his posture will resemble that of Gollum trying to stand on two feet... and let's not forget the red lightning. Motion capture also gives the game a more cinematic look during in-game cutscenes, and even during gameplay Cole runs more realistically and no longer looks like a sprinting robot. As for the game's User Generated Content (UGC), it is well implemented and works nicely, making it possible for players to create some very fun and varied missions of their own that can be played at any time during free roam like regular main and side missions, as well as shared with other players online. However, it does require a lot of time, patience, and some technical know-how in order to really make a mission of substance, and not everyone will be willing to pull off the many detailed and in-depth implementations required for the program to work (including me, apparently).The main game is unfortunately not without a few technical problems that overshadow the less numerous ones in the first game. Defeated enemies and civilians will ocassionally float in midair for no reason, Cole clips through certain surfaces more frequently, and certain attacks by enemies that hurt civilians will count as negative karma towards Cole, which is irritating for good guys. The most glaring technical flaw is the game's camera, specifically when Cole uses melee attacks. It zooms in rather closely on Cole during his more powerful slow motion attacks, so while it certainly looks cool and flashy, it disorients the player and makes them lose sight of other enemies who can attack from offscreen. This is more troubling in confined spaces where the camera could go inside a nearby wall while Cole swings his Amp around. The camera spazzes out even worse when Cole is hit directly by a powerful attack like a missile or a glob of acid spit from a monster; when this happens, the camera zooms in REALLY close to Cole and is again accompanied by a slow motion effect, making it extra infuriating to be slammed by these enemies only to lose sight of Cole amidst a panorama of surrounding explosions or globs of acid.  With less access to Cole's more powerful abilities and the larger number of technical issues with this game, it rather sadly gets an overall score of 4 stars from me, and I really wanted to give this game an overall score of 5 stars. However, with its larger number of other fun powers, challenging enemies, and very different missions depending on your karmic alignment, this game ends up being more fun and much less repetitive than its predecessor, so that's 5 stars for its fun factor. Finally, unlike the final battle and ending in the first game, the good and evil final battles and endings for Infamous 2 could not be more different from each other. Regardless, both endings will leave gamers with their mouths agape for different reasons. Bottom line: if you liked the first Infamous, then Infamous 2 is certainly a worthy successor that is well worth your attention.*UPDATE*This next part will be dedicated to the stand-alone DLC called Festival of Blood. Much like how Red Dead Redemption added zombies to its world with its DLC Undead Nightmare, Festival of Blood adds vampires to the Infamous mythos. The game opens presumably at some point in the middle of Cole's adventure in Infamous 2. However, it's Cole's old buddy Zeke who first appears on the screen sitting at a bar drinking beer and reading a comic book. When an attractive woman enters Zeke's radar, he tries to woo her by telling her a (likely fictitious) story about an adventure that he and Cole undertook sometime after they arrived in New Marais on a popular holiday known as Pyre Night (kind of like a mix between Mardi Gras and Halloween). Zeke's tale begins with some citizens trapped inside the city's church as its interior begins to cave in. Cole goes in to rescue them, but then ends up getting captured by vampires. They take him to their practically dead looking leader Bloody Mary and after reviving her with some of Cole's blood, Bloody Mary bites Cole, beginning the process of turning him into a vampire. Now, unless Cole and Zeke can find a way to kill Bloody Mary before sunrise, Cole will be under her control as her most powerful vampire servant. The gameplay in Festival of Blood is not all that different from that of the main game, but it adds a few new elements that keep the game from getting stale. While only the first island of New Marais is accessible in this game, the look of it has changed somewhat. Gaudy decorations such as large, horror themed balloons, fireworks stations, and rock band stages are set up everywhere to set the mood for the big fiesta of Pyre Night. Even the citizens are all running around wearing silly masks, glowsticks, and other party-themed paraphernalia. Not only that, but Cole will be able to visit a previously unexplored area. He can now go into a long (and kind of creepy) underground tunnel that runs underneath the island. Cole's running and climbing skills are still intact and he can still zap enemies with his classic electric attacks (due to his vampiric transformation, he uses the evil red lightning in this game). He starts with the standard lightning bolts, then gains the shockwave, shock grenades, electric rockets, etc. that he used in the main game as he defeats a required number of enemies.Cole's new melee weapon in this game is a metal stake which actually functions much like the Amp from the main game. While Cole can incapacitate his vampire enemies with his electric attacks, the only way to permanently kill them is by having Cole stake them while they're down. The vampire enemies he faces range from the newborn breeds that simply pile onto Cole in great numbers, the footsoldiers who use crossbow guns, bladed boomerangs, and submachine guns, and the more powerful Firstborn vampires which are basically giant bats who can quickly tear Cole apart if he's not careful. Cole also has a couple of new vampiric abilities to help him complete his mission. For the first time ever, Cole has access to full on flight by turning himself into a swarm of bats, letting him fly high and far at great speeds. He also gains Vampire Vision, which lets him spot vampires disguised as humans and locate hidden vampire glyph messages. These glyphs are supernatural versions of the main game's Dead Drops that reveal interesting background information on Bloody Mary's past exploits. Both of Cole's new vampiric abilities drain his blood meter, which replaces the karma meter (no good or evil karma moments in this game). Cole cannot use his new abilities if the blood meter is drained, so he must drink the blood of citizens in order to fill it up again. Finding Canopic Jars hidden throughout the city extends Cole's blood meter, much like how the Blast Shards in the main game extend his energy meter. To sum up, Festival of Blood is really an enjoyable new take on the Infamous franchise. It doesn't do anything revolutionary, but it does add enough new gameplay elements and abilities to make it worth playing. Plus, the story is pretty interesting too. The only disappointing thing about this game is that it's short..... very short. I beat the main story, collected almost half of the Canopic Jars, and found all 10 glyphs in about three and a half hours. Still, for $10 on the PSN, Festival of Blood is a fun game for fans of Infamous to sink their teeth into...... I had to put ONE vampire joke in here somewhere.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2011"}

Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"Delighted it continued the \"fall out tradition\" so well!","reviewText":"Fall out had humble origins. It started out as a pen and paper post apocalyptic table top role playing game. Eventually it was made into arguably the best 3 pc games ever. Fall out 1, Fall out 2, and fall out tactics are loved and idolized to this day. While they do not have mind blowing graphics there is A LOT to do as you explore the waste land.So did Bethesda get it right with Fall Out 3? Though the game-play is very different (akin to a 1st person shooter or over the shoulder action game)Fall Out 3 is spot on. All your favorite 1940's-1950's songs,deco architecture, sprawling decimated bad lands, and make shift towns held together by a thread make a return. This time you are in Washington DC and it shows through in spades.Making a comparison to Fable 2 I can say the NPCs in Fall out 3 are by far more lovable and interesting. I did not get to know my father James that well before he was forced to leave Vault 101 but he made a lasting impression as a good man. I was angered when Jame's friend Jonas who gave me a B B gun when I was a kid was killed by the fanatic over seer. I felt pity for the over seer's daughter who helped me escape. I even saved Butch's mother from rad roaches though he was a hoodlum that treated me like garbage. Indeed that day despite our rocky past we became \"chums\".All that is just the introduction/tutorial. It does not explain why your father left the safety of the fall out shelter. It never explains \"how\" the over seer went crazy or for what reason he ordered his guards to capture you. The answers might be out there...but than again every answer brings with it more questions.The first thing I'll address is that the customization of your character is very detailed. You can be black, Asian, Caucasian, or Hispanic. Everything from your cheek bones to your eyes and chin can be altered. I hear \"jokes\" about females coming out looking like male cross dressers but my friend Alex blew my mind when he created a sexy red head.Secondly do not be discouraged if you did not like your results with the GOAT entrance exam or the stats you choose from your baby book. Right before you leave the vault you can redo things more to your liking.So what is it like \"out there\"? It is what you expect fall out to be. You will encounter many people in your travels. You can save them or damn them. You can trade and barter honestly or steal from thy neighbor. Just like the previous game you can be a savior or savage raider and your actions gradually give you a \"reputation\" making certain people friendly towards you while others will be out gunning for you.One argument was that it was too easy to get bad karma from stealing. I thought this implied when you picked things up you would not get a warning if the property belongs to someone else. Luckily that is not the case. If the text is \"green\" it is not shop lifting. If the text is \"red\" it belongs to an owner. Do not fret. Even if you don't pick pockets or loot stores there are plenty of ways to accumulate bottle cap currency and get equipment. Raiders always carry a lot of crap on them + certain creatures can be salvaged for meat you can eat or trade.While it is easy to be evil in the game is is no more difficult to be good. This came as a relief to me because everyone commented how the dastardly road of villainy was much wider. I've not encountered that pit fall yet.To me the best thing about Fall out 3 is it feels like a living breathing world. The people are lively,flawed, and even a simple merchant can have interesting gossip or an inspirational life story. No one truly seems \"flat\" and \"lifeless\".It was also nice how even doing the smallest things such as deactivating the atomic bomb and fixing the leaky pipes of Megaton gave me a sense of pride. Bethesda managed to make these little errands \"fun\". As to how they did it is a mystery.However there are problems with a free roaming real world dynamic. The first of these is that sometimes even when sticking to the straight and narrow and doing a low level quest you may still run into a death claw or super mutant. As you can imagine the end result of that is not pretty.My worst adversaries were when I chose to help a boy find his father. Fire breathing ants attacked the town and came at me from all sides. Trapped and cut off I fled into the subway only to find my eventual demise. Overconfidence can kill you quick in this game. It is fortunate \"saving\" is automatic and occurs often and that you can also manually save your game from anywhere.For those of you still worried rest assured. Fall Out staples such as the brother hood of steel and the enclave are portrayed in their full heroic and terrifying splendor. There are also ghouls and mini nukes. At first I was skeptical of Bethesda but all my doubts have been officially laid to rest. This is an addicting and fun game! Yes, it has a steep difficulty but if you have played the older games you know that is a fall out trade mark.The only down side I see is there are not quite as many skills and perks. However if you reminisce back on Fall Out 1 and Fall out 2 some of those skills and perks were quite useless anyway. I know some fans maybe disappointed by this which is why I discuss it.Gameplay is an odd fusion. On one hand you can play Fall Out 3 totally as a run and gun affair with 100% live action. However there is also \"vats\" which allows you to target specific body parts on your enemies and manage how many bullets or strikes per volley you'll execute. Vats is great for precision strategy but you will gradually run out of \"action points\" forcing you to once again go into quick combat.Personally though this system was hard for me to adapt to at first I was grateful for vats. With it I was able to precisely target my enemies without hurting my allies. In the thick of a chaotic brawl it is truly a life saver.The voice acting, music, and graphics are all superb. I cannot really offer up a critique for the audio or visuals department.Bottom line the only recurring fault is sometimes my game will freeze. I heard it is worse for other people but I have no idea why the problem fluctuates in severity between players.In closing this is as good as gaming gets. Whether you are a long time fan or know nothing about Fall out you owe it to yourself to pick this one up!Pros-Good game mechanics. Vats helps in all precarious situations.-Lovable and quirky NPCs that act like real people- A huge array of quests and ways you can interact with others.-The introduction offers a good story line ensuring your character actually had \"family\" \"friends\" and a \"life\" before entering the post nuclear waste land.-Large variety of enemy types.Cons-Game freezes on occasion.-Steep learning curve near the beginning. Luckily everything becomes second nature after awhile.-Those who miss the \"top side view\" of the other fall out games may dislike the first person and over the shoulder views.-Not quite so many perks and skills.-A lot of the cheeky and entertaining \"promiscuous sexual content\" was omitted from Fall Out 3 and the violence in my opinion became even more over the top. Most gamers will not even notice it but I did.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2009"}

The zapper is reasonably comfortable to hold, and the construction is good.  The remote and nunchuck fit snugly into the casing, and the wires are coiled comfortably into the handle.  However, If you are like me, your hands instinctively expect a trigger to be in the back of the gun.  The trigger is also not spring-loaded, so I've had friends complain that it feels a bit mushy (all the trigger tension comes directly from the \"B\" button).The Tommy gun-style front trigger takes some getting used to, and is reasonably comfortable after a while.  The buttons on the remote and nunchuck are all fairly accessible, and the analog stick is just where it needs to be for easy thumb access.  I like the zapper a lot for games that require the analog stick for moving the character around (like the Call of Duty series).  If I'm playing a Duck Hunt style game that only requires me to point and fire I'll usually either reach for aPerfect Shotor the shotgun or rifle that comes with one of hunting games (for instance,Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2011 with Top Shot Elite).As a free game that comes packaged in with the zapper, Link's crossbow trainer is worth at least $5-$10 of the price tag.  The dynamics are pretty simple, but you get multiple carnival games in one.  In target practice mode your character rapidly flies from scene to scene and you have to shoot as many targets as possible.  When you play Defender style you stand in one place (this time you can move the direction you are looking) and you have to kill as many baddies as possible before you're overwhelmed.  The final mode \"Ranger\" you run around killing baddies hiding in forts and other locations before the time runs out.  (Ranger mode is my personal favorite.)If you are a Wii junkie like myself the gun and game give you plenty of value for a relatively small amount of money.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube. For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience.

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Jos Alfredo Hernndez Daz \"Jos Alfredo\"","summary":"great","reviewText":"great graphics, great sound, great quality  for playstation 3  I recommend  because is excelent, excelent war, scary scenes very nice.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2013"}

It is not as good as the original game in the series but comes darn close. The campaign is exciting and overall a lot of fun. The weapon wheel is back so you can use any weapon that you have collected at any time. There are a few new weapons to aid your fight against the Chimera along with some classic ones like the Marksman and Bullseye. The new weapons are pretty sweet and a lot of fun to use. Also every weapon has two upgrades that you unlock which gives you incentives to diversify the weapons you use. The campaign has a lot of varied locals along with some really cool level structures that keep that WW2 feel from the original. The game really does a nice job of detail in it's environments. From children's drawings on the wall to actual Resident Evil style creepy hallways you are always drawn into the 50's feel of the game. There are also a lot of destroyed buildings to rummage through along with multiple enemy types to battle against. The regenerative health system has been replaced by a health pack system which makes every move that much more cautious and strategic.  I do recommend that you play the game on a harder difficulty though as in the lower difficulties health packs are too plentiful.The graphics are improved over the predecessor though not up to other Playstation franchises like Killzone or Uncharted. The game also looks pretty good in 3D with good depth along with the some popout from time to time. Playstation Move works well enough but it does take some getting used to and I would recommend not using the Sharp Shooter and just use the Move and Navigation controller without it. It gets really tiring holding the gun for a long period of time.The story in this game is pretty good as you follow Joseph Capelli's journey to stop the Chimera. He is driven by love for his wife and child to save the world. It is a compelling journey but it does have an interesting twist at the end that is a bit disappointing. Everything is wrapped up a little too neatly and it does feel like an end to the series.Overall the game is a major improvement over the second game in the series and is my pick so far for Game of The Year(Until Uncharted 3 comes out). It is well worth the price of admission as it is a fun and epic campaign.

Smith \"Duster\"","summary":"Im having more fun playing GTA chinatown wars on my DS than this game...","reviewText":"Of course I bought into the hype for this game and laid down $60 big ones for it... wow what a big mistake! I will cut to the chase here. The game has almost everything to make an outstanding experience and its missing the most important key element to why we all play games in the first place.Graphics: pretty impressive for an open world sand box game, some of the best I've seenControls: easy to get used to once you understand controlling the horse.Sound: sounds like it should: weapons, people, nothing seems out of placeStory: this game has better acting than most movies and the characters are all diverse and entertaining, not bad at all.GAMEPLAY: here is where the game fails miserably. Most of you (like me) will be in awe for the first few hours of gameplay. Roping some horses, shooting some animals, doing some bounty missions and main missions will be entertaining FOR A WHILE. Then I started to realize how repetitive everything gets. Start a mission, ride your horse from point A to point B while talking to someone on the way. Get to point B, take cover behind a rock, shoot some guys (auto aim makes it way to easy to win, i turned it off) then your pretty much done. About 85%  of the missions are like this, and it sucks. Shooting animals gets old after about an hour, roping horses is boring. \"Random\" events that happen along the trail are repetitive. I found no real reason to stray from the conveniently placed trails all along the landscape because there is really nothing to see off the road. Im sure these things won't bother a lot of people but I can't stand this type of gameplay. Like I said, Chinatown wars is a game that is always keeping me engaged with tasks to do and challenges that are fun to complete. This isn't a review of chinatown wars, but when I have more fun playing a Rockstar game on a 3 inch DS screen than I do playing on a 32 inch hi def flatscreen; something is definitely wrong. Red Dead Redemption would do better as a movie than a game. Rent first or borrow from a friend, you be the judge.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2010"}

Your mission isn't terribly new (infiltrate a terrorist base and blow everything up), but the gameplay is: your numerous enemies are watching for you, and you are encouraged to sneak rather than simply charge in. Every level brings new challenges. You fight snipers, invisible ninjas, psychic warriors, and even an M-1 tank! As the father of the modern spy game genre, this game is an instant classic.Your allies and superiors speak to you via a cool, implanted radio,  monitoring your progress, offering  tips--but failing to give you the full story. The combination of a mysterious and engaging plot and high in-game tension makes this a thrilling ride. Campy humor also abounds as you rescue beautiful women, verbally spar with your allies, and blow up enemies in the bathroom. A user-friendly control interface allows for sniping, hiding, crawling, and running, and the graphics leave nothing to be desired. If you like espionage, spy movies, or just want to own and play a piece of gaming history, then this is a must have.Metal Gear Solidis one of the all-time greats.

Metal Gear Solid was quite a fun and intriguing release and it brought a more cinematic telling into the stories and although short and plotwise it can get into philosophy-speak a bit too often (though at least it's easier to swallow than Sons of Liberty), it was still one of the more unique play experiences found on the console.Story: You play as Solid Snake who's sent to Shadow Moses Island in Alaska to rescue DARPA Chief Donald Anderson and ArmsTech President Kenneth Baker as well as stop the terrorist's plans on launching a nuke. But that's just the start of it as we get FOXHOUND members, special elite soldiers who went rogue, a big beast of a machine and Snake's own connection to the leader of the group.Graphics: Since this is the original Playstation, you kind of have to take everything at face value: they look blocky now and lack the clarity of Sons of Liberty or the huge polish of Snake Eater but it was on a lesser console so it makes sense. But at the time it was impressive with lots of cutscenes, done very movie-like and indeed the environments were well handled.Sound/Music: Along with the Lunar series, the MGS series has always been prime examples of how voice acting should be done. Instead of overeager voices or just robotic delivery, it's very easy to get involved with the story when the actors do a great job at balancing the quieter moments with the more plot-based information. The music does a good job as well though it's used rather sparingly.Gameplay: Unlike other games were it's encouraged to go crazy on your enemies, the MGS series rewards stealth and non-killing to progress. Use tranquilizer guns or knock out enemies, the object is to be seen as little as possible. Even then you have a huge assortment of goodies at your disposal that inexplicably can be stored in Snake's tiny pockets. From sniper rifles to 2 different kind of missile launchers, automatics and handguns and goggles, there's plenty to use should you get caught. Aiding your ability to not be seen is the radar where a blue cone represents your enemy's field of vision which you avoid though you can distract them by making noise such as knocking on walls.Cutscenes are well-handled from FMV-types which detail nuclear histories and such while there's others which handle the in-game cinematics like meeting characters. But Snake also talks through the CODEC, a radio and video communication which shows a black screen, text and 2 character portraits and though it's handy to read all the heavy plot scenes, it feels strange for character moments. Get used to that ring too since you'll be hearing it a lot as you play the game. The other negative people might have is its length which doesn't really feel long and it's actually perfectly paced and it doesn't feel like the game got extended just for the sake of adding more stuff to do.Although we have the remake with the Twin Snakes, I felt the original is the best version and while graphically it shows its age, it's still an engrossing playthrough.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2008"}
{"product_name":"B003O6G6RI","description":"","reviewerName":"JoshJosh","summary":"boring, buggy, and ill-conceived","reviewText":"I love Street Fighter IV and I was really looking forward to this. What I got in the package was one of the most disappointing games I've ever played.On the surface it looks good - it's done by the same team (Dimps) that made SF4. It has an equal mix of SF and Tekken characters, including a few out of Capcom's comfort zone (like Poison). Superficially, the characters, movesets, blocking, and systems were worked to accomodate both styles. The game is 2-vs.-2 to encourage teamwork. It all sounds great, the characters look great (if you're a fan of the SF4 style, of course), it should've been awesome.Problems are immediately obvious. First of all, it's as bare-bones as you can get. There's arcade mode, tutorial mode, challenge mode, and online. Capcom keeps putting out these bare-bones fighters and it's very frustrating to see a beautiful, feature-packed game like BlazBlue - or Tekken! - in comparison.That said, even a mediocre online mode can make up for shortcomings on the feature list. SFxT isn't even close. The game plays terribly online. Early on, the sound cut out like crazy in every match - Capcom claimed that they could fix the sound but the lag would still be a problem. So now we have a game with okay sound but more lag. Capcom claims the code was custom-written for the purpose of playing 2-vs.-2 online, but I would argue that 1-vs.-1 should still be a priority. In any case, the 360 version's online mode doesn't even support tag team with 2 people on the same machine.The game doesn't play well. Despite the fact that it uses a Tekken Tag like KO system (where you only have to knock out one guy instead of both to win), matches often come right down to the wire. The issue here is that combos are extremely damaging, so the normal response is a lot of keep-away. It's boring - neither tense and exacting like SFIV or fast-paced and technical like Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Capcom also threw in a comeback mechanic (calling it Pandora), but it's pretty terrible and doesn't fit into the game at all - it plays like Capcom added it because every game has a comeback mechanic and they needed to put one in here. They didn't.There's also the gem system, which is just a bizarre and ill-conceived addition. The idea here is that you can slot gems which give you additional powers in the match. They give either passive or active bonuses after meeting certain conditions. The problem is that the gems are arbitrary and poorly balanced. Capcom also took a hard-line on the gems, claiming that the game was balanced with them and could never be disabled. This pretty much doomed the game's long-term viability.Looking at the gems, it's clear that SFxT was Capcom's push to nickel-and-dime their customers. Locked characters, expensive costumes, and gem packs all turned the game into a decidedly chintzy affair. This was just insult being added to injury - not only did Capcom deliver a bad game, but they larded it up with terrible DLC. Well, I doubt they are making much money off the DLC today.I don't even know why I am writing this - Street Fighter X Tekken deservedly flopped. This is Capcom's worst fighter since Capcom Fighting Jam/Evolution, which released in 2004. Both Tekken and Street Fighter fans hated it. Tekken X Street Fighter (Namco's contribution) may never come out, so this might be all we get from that partnership. It was probably never a good idea - Capcom vs. SNK worked because the games are fairly similar on a basic level. Tekken and Street Fighter are very different games. Well, let's just bury this and move on to better titles.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2012"}
{"product_name":"B003O6G6RI","description":"","reviewerName":"Ryan Sil. (Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...","summary":"A hit-and-miss Street Fighter","reviewText":"Despite what the review title says and will say, I will say right now that if you loved Super Street Fighter IV, you're undoubtedly going to have a good time with Street Fighter x Tekken. The game plays identically to that of the frantic fighting action of its predecessor(s). This time, of course, you're treated to a cast of characters from fellow Namco franchise, Tekken, and they surprisingly fit into the Street Fighter gameplay style pretty well.That's just about the highest I could praise the game, though. While I do adore the unique and colorful atmosphere of the fighting arenas (They even change up round after round!), the soundtrack and voices are notable issues here. I don't think I've ever heard a less memorable soundtrack coming from a Capcom game, and quite a few tunes contain unappealing guitar riffs. If anything, the title screen theme is the best song in the entire game.While I did mention earlier that the game plays like Super Street Fighter IV, it also borrows a well-defining mechanic from the Marvel vs. Capcom series: The tag-team functions. Basically, instead of having to pick out only one character, you can select from two on the character roster as a team. If the character you're playing as is on low health, swap him out quickly with the other guy who, if you haven't already used him, is equipped with a full life bar. The tag-team action can be used in a somewhat strategic manner, but often does it come off as visually frustrating to see that I nearly knock down my opponent, only to see him/her be swapped out by a whole new one to take down.And then there's Capcom's incredibly horrendous business practices that single-handedly butchered the entire experience for many players. What am I referring to exactly? The absence of couch co-op and, worse yet, an overabundance of DISC-LOCKED CONTENT that you have to pay extra for despite the content already being on the disc. Clearly, they were trying to use this game as a cash grab of some sort.If you have an iOS device, I highly recommend you buy the iOS version of Street Fighter x Tekken to satisfy your SFxTK needs. It's what I consider the definitive version of the game, oddly enough. It not only has absolutely NO DLC, but the game also makes it easy to pick up and play, you don't have to pay for Xbox Live or anything like that to play online matches, and best of all, it's only $3! Heck, even the tag-team mechanics have improved drastically to incorporate more strategy (And now one of the two characters does not rely on a health bar, but is only sent out to fight for a short period of time).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2013"}

Catherine's core themes-those of free will, of the delicate nature of relationships and the choices we make within them, marry perfectly with the intense, terror-filled gameplay that serves to accurately reflect Vincent's growing sense of anxiety. It is an experience wholly unlike any to come before it, and is certain to leave gamers talking and thinking about Vincent's tribulations long after the credits have rolled.","reviewerName":"OrangeCrush \"Still shooting with Film!\"","summary":"Challenging and Truely Unique!","reviewText":"To be honest, I didn't know what to expect from this game. I had heard very good things about it and I love unique games so I figured I would give it a try. I am glad I did as its really one of the more unique and entertaining games I have played in a long time. Basically the story aspect of the game unfolds while Vincent, the main character, is awake and the puzzle/platforming side of the game occurs when Vincent goes to sleep at night. The story is surprisingly good and doesn't just feel tacked on. The puzzle/platforming side is both entertaining and challenging. It took me like 5 attempts just to get through the 3rd night. With that being said, its not the frustratingly difficult kind of challenge. Each time you replay a section, you should be able to proceed a little farther so I dont think many people will have the problem of getting stuck. You can always lower the difficulty if you do. This game does deal with adult themes so I wouldn't suggest buying this for your children.Overall this is honestly one of the more unique games I have ever come across and the developers do a great job of tying everything together. It has great characters, great dialogue, a great story, and most importantly a very entertaining and challenging puzzle/platforming side of the game that will keep you coming back for more even after you have completed the game. To be perfectly honest, I thought this game was going to be really lame when I first heard about it being developed. Well, I openly admit I was dead wrong.Highly recommended especially if you enjoy unique games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2011"}

I actually purchased this a few months after it was released but never got around to playing it. Its a shame that it took me this long as its easily one of the best games out for the 360. Its not perfect but its pretty close.One of the most impressive aspect to this game is the facial expressions from the characters you speak to. This is honestly one of the first games I can remember where the mouth and lip movements are actually animated properly in regards to what they are saying. Its not just a mouth flapping in the wind. This, along with outstanding facial renderings, really bring the characters in this game to life. The other thing that really sticks out quality wise is the story. This is not some hack story thrown together by a mediocre studio. Bioware is a AAA studio and they certainly dont disappoint with Mass Effect. The story is deep, engaging, and most importantly extremely entertaining to watch unfold. There are multiple paths that players can take and your choices can significantly change certain aspects of the story.The combat system in Mass Effect is outstanding. There are multiple character options in regards to combat but overall they are a balance between one of two systems. The first uses regular weapons like assault rifles, shotguns, and sniper rifles and the 2nd system uses what are called biotics. Biotics are very much like The Force abilities in Star Wars. They include abilities like push, lift, shields etc.. You can choose to focus on either one or a combination of both. This one aspect to the game by itself makes the replay value increase dramatically.As great as this game is, it does have a few flaws. First and foremost the design on many of the outposts is extremely repetitive. In fact, most of the colonies you visit have the same exact buildings. Then there is the whole hunting for materials. While driving around in the rover is extremely fun, it does get a bit tedious looking for those materials. Another big flaw is with the money. The money system is pretty much worthless as its so easy to get that you wind up with a huge wad of cash with absolutely nothing to spend it on. Both times I finished the game I was maxed out with money which is 9,999,999 credits. Basically you have very little money in the beginning of the game and that is when you really could use it the most. By the time you get a good chunk of cash, you no longer need it as items are easily found all over the place and your already well stocked equipment wise by the time you save up any significant quantity of money, hence there really isn't much you can buy as you will most likely already own it by the time you can afford it. The only other thing I can think of that bothered me was the elevators. Technology has advanced by light years in this game. Mankind has achieved faster than light travel and has colonized the galaxy. Elevators on the other hand have appeared to regress technology wise as they are incredibly slow and Bioware makes you ride it out as there is no fast travel option of skipping the ride.While that may sound like a lot of complaints, its really not. Most of this games problems are small and easily ignored. Overall Mass Effect is easily one of the best RPG's of this generation. In case your unaware Mass Effect 2 is already out and a third title is on the way. This was planned from the beginning and not just a response to great sales.Bottom line - Bioware has done it again. Mass Effect is an outstanding game and if you enjoy these types of games and haven't played it yet then it should go at the very top of your to play list. Like I said to start this review, its better late than never. I am moving onto ME 2!5 Stars!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2010"}

However, with Batter Blaster's vague and inacurate instructions, you too can attempt 4 times to make a pancake and hilariously burn them every time. The instructions tell you just turn the can upside-down, shake and aim the nossel downward and make a pancake any size you want. The instructions tell you to set your heat to mid-high at 325 degrees. That seems to instantly burn pancakes within a minute of cooking one side. There is no instruction to use any kind of cooking oil or PAM on the pan. With or without, seems to give the same burnt result. So the next time I adjusted to a mid-low temperature like the normal pancakes I've made and that seems to help, but I still manage to burn the pancakes quickly when cooking pancakes from a mix I've never burnt one. Once I finally made an edible pancake there were plenty of air pockets inside of it. It was pretty synthetic tasting. Beware of your results.

In this review I'll tell you pretty much everything you need/want to know about it.First off, the Nintendo DS has two screens, one on the top half of the system, the other on the lower half, so it's like a flip phone in other words, with two screens. The design is slightly bulky, but it's the best someone could do with it's kind of idea. When you look straight at the back of the front screen it's flat and has two slopes where the speakers are. At the bottom of it is the word Nintendo. When you open it, there is a screen in the middle at the top with speakers at the side, and below the top screen is another screen, with buttons to the left and right. On the left is the \"D-Pad\" and the power button. The D-Pad is all one button. On the right is the select and start button, along with the Y,X,A, and B buttons. They work well, but they are extremely small. If you continue looking down the DS, you will see a blank space. It is for a GBA game if you want one in there. To the right is a Headset and a Headphone jack, to the left is volume control. On the back of the DS at the top is where you insert the DS game. To its left is where the stylus goes. The shoulder buttons are on the top and left right corners of the DS. The handheld is pretty small when you open up, it's really actually thin, top and bottom, it's just that when one is on the other it is sort of big.Anyways, about the DS, the graphical capabilities are not on par with the PSP in any way, so if your all about graphics, get a PSP, but graphics aren't THAT important. The overall sound quality is fine, the controls are easy enough, ( but unlike other Nintendo handhelds, this one has four buttons where your thumb hangs over. Instead of just A and B buttons, there is also X and Y.The Game Selection: Not too great. There aren't very many games out worth mentioning, although the recently released Mario Kart DS is an unbelievably great game, there aren't many to comment on.Worth The Money?: Depends.

I've been playing for hours now, and I can say it is interesting and different---creative not as much.  The basic gameplay is jamming.  You don't create the tunes, at least not at first, but you mostly control the rhythm of various instruments.  You can be melody, percussion, chords, bass, and then be one of many instruments for what you chose---piano, toy piano, electric guitar, marachas, flute---lots and lots of choices.  Each type of instrument has a way to be held to play it, but you aren't actually picking the notes---just the rhythm---what you play has a built in melody which plays when you are playing.  It's fun to fool around with.  I thought I would like only to be the melody, but it's actually neat to be the back up chords or bass too.  You can also play all the different parts by going back and playing the same song again as a different part over and over.You unlock songs as you go.  The songs are fairly fun to play with, for a middle aged person like myself that doesn't know the most recent hits and likes songs I do know---like Clementine, Happy Birthday, O Christmas Tree, Twinkle Twinkle, Ode to Joy, etc.  I was surprised to see Woman by John Lennon on the list---I love that song, but it seems a bit out of place!There are lessons on types of styles, and also games you can play. The handbell game is curiously addictive, but I wish there were more songs available for it.  I like the musical quiz game, where you have to do things like arrange notes from lowest to highest, or find what 3 tones are part of a chord you hear.The learning curve is pretty quick.  The tutorial to get started is quite good, and I figured out the basics of the game in no time.I would say this would be a game for people who like to fool around casually with music---who want to get that cool feeling of being part of a band or orchestra without really having to learn much music.  I do think you'd learn a little as you went along, just by seeing what combinations of instruments and what rhymes sound best.If you are looking for a really hard core music game, this isn't it.  If you just want to have fun and also if you want to give your kids a totally non-violent and non-competitive game, this IS it!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000SH3XD6","description":"Conan is an all-new action combat game featuring a story of adventure, true evil, and brutal, visceral combat. The game follows the journey of Conan the Cimmerian as he fights an epic battle against a variety of enemies and an elusive evil power that threatens to consume the world. Using anything and everything at his disposal, including hand-to-hand weapons, objects in the environment, and powerful elemental magic, Conan takes the fight to his enemies across the massive continent of Hyborea.","reviewerName":"ribcage","summary":"CONAN","reviewText":"CONAN is a pretty decent game. It's not perfect, but it is a lot of fun and that's what counts. The graphics are topnotch, so all the bare breasts and over the top violence comes out with wonderful visual flair. Pretty much all you will be doing in this game is smashing out at enemies and randomly rescuing half naked women until you get to a boss battle at which point you will be angry for about 30 minutes.The last battle is one of the cheapest, most repitative boss battles I've ever played. It took me a good 45 minutes to finish and I can't remember the last time I was so angry. But other than that, the other boss battles aren't so outrageous, it's just a matter of taking a bit to figure out what exactly the game intends for you to do.There are some pretty brutal combos, but unfortunately most of them only really work on weaker enemies. Later in the game, once you've unlocked all your moves and have gotten used to them, these weak enemies are nowhere to be seen. You can still get a handful of combos out, and if you manage to stun the enemy you can get the ones you get on weak enemies, but by the last couple of levels I was mostly using three or four combos that actually still worked. A lot of the time, though(and this was a problem with that final  boss bottle), I'd just end up getting a ton of enemies pouncing on me interrupting every single combo so that all I could do was quick strike and dodge. However, even doing that I still managed to whip out some really vicious violence and dismemberments.Speaking of dismemberments, there are wonderful achievements, such as getting 100 dismemberments, 100 enemies thrown to their death, 100 enemies killed by boulder throws, etc. It really works to keep your variety up more.Despite the fact that alot of times I wasn't able to get the combo I wanted out and that the boss battles weren't really fun, I enjoyed the game as a whole a lot. It's pure streamlined carnal violence with barebreasts thrown in, obviously because what guy can resist extreme brutality with breasts on the side.Probably not really worth the full new release price, but I don't mind that I bought it within the first few days of its release. The game is a bit short, but really, I think six hours was enough. The game didn't start to drag because of this, which I think may have been a problem if it had actually continued on a few more hours.As for replay, I'm going to be going back on the different difficulties to try it out for the achievements and I'm going to shoot for all the different death achievements. If I didn't have the achievements, though, it would just be good for some random slashing whenever I was bored.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2007"}
{"product_name":"B002I0KOSI","description":"","reviewerName":"UziHorowitz","summary":"Irrational chose the impossible","reviewText":"Or so it would seem. How can you top Bioshock? It would seem like an impossible task. But Ken Levine and Irrational thrive when being challenged. Similar to his days at Looking Glass and the critical success of System Shock 2, Ken Levine and Irrational floored people with Bioshock. When Bioshock released in 2007, its creativity made people notice the work of Irrational in a more mainstream capacity, giving Irrational a lot more credibility with publishers, which would ultimately lead to many, many years of developments on Infinite. Was the wait worth it? Two words: Hell yes!Bioshock Infinite is a Bioshock game, period. I know it looks different and may seem different, but a lot of the things from Bioshock are in Bioshock Infinite. While Infinite has its own look and everything, which makes it feel new and fresh, this is a Shock game through and through, so you have a mix of the familiar with something entirely new. The combat is very similar to the first game, but guns have more of a kick this time around. Plasmids also make a comeback in the form of Vigors, which allow for a lot of variation and experimentation in combat. There's also the inclusion of sky-lines, which make some fights really exciting and frantic. I'd say the combat scenarios are an improvement from the first Bioshock. You'll also be looting the environment and corpses for money, food, salt (for Vigors), etc.Bioshock's art direction is simply stunning. It takes a very talented art team to pull off something like Infinite, and the team at Irrational was definitely up to the task. The amount of detail in each and every environment is staggering. You'll definitely understand why this game was such an undertaking and took so many years to create when you see it in action. Then you have Elizabeth, which is one of the most realized characters in all of gaming. Elizabeth's animations and interactions are one of Infinite's many highlights.But Bioshock Infinite is ultimately all about the narrative, which it delivers on from beginning to end. This game's story is hands down one of the best in the business, even going as far as surpassing the original Bioshock. While Bioshock was a masterpiece, its ending left a little something to be desired. But this isn't the case with Bioshock Infinite. This game has an ending that'll blow you away.Irrational chose the impossible, they chose Infinite. Would you kindly buy this game immediately?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2013"}

A lot of fun for action RPG fans--and a great buy!!","reviewText":"Glad i waited for dark Arisen--got the original and expansion for 40 bucks! As deals go, this cant be beat!Pros: Combat is a blast. Open world environment is fun to traverse, tho dangerous, esp at early levels. Pawn system is surprisingly effective and a lot of fun. Changing vocations is great, greatly adding to the fun factor by allowing you to try different combat styles at will.I bought this out of boredom with current RPG releases--and have invested 80+ hours already. Should tell you something. And unlike others I thought the ending of DD itself was creative and cool.Cons:Combat too difficult at early stages. Enemies respawn as fast as you can kill them, almost--would like an area to stay cleared for just a little while after you slaughter 20+ bad guys or monsters.Main objection: your character, the Arisen, has less personality than the \"pawns\"-- beings with no will or emotion of their own. Seriously, the Arisens only emotion is a bewildered stare. Never speaks, never thinks. Coupled with a pretty thin narrative it would be easy to stop playing this game midway through (glad I didnt). IMO this is the biggest failing of this game, and I seriously hope they learn from Skyrim and the Witcher and write some character and narrative into the sequel.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2013"}

Der","summary":"Too easy and have to pay more for so so characters!","reviewText":"I also came from the very beginning of these fighting games; X-Men COTA, Marvel Super Heros, and all the way to to MVC2. I thought MVC2 was the best fighting game ever! There was a huge roster of fighers of 52 people. Best graphics back then. Its battle system was a bit off, but still way way better than MVC3.This game reminds me of TVC. MVC3 battle system must had came from TVC. That was a big mistakes. In TVC, there is some kind of mega cancel and you can break out of almost any combo from your opponent. It's not in MVC3 but they put something in replace of that. The X-Factor, this makes your characters way more powerful and faster too. This effect can be good thing or bad. I mostly think it's bad because you don't need to give your opponent a comeback effect or yourself this effect either. If you about to win, you'll should win. If you're about to lose, you should lose. That's it! Throwing in this extra X-factor makes it a wild card matches for most of the time. No crazy effect to change things up a bit. They should had used MVC2 battle system. There was nothing wrong with it and it would had made sense in the end too.I bought this game at the midnight release date and the guide too. The guide was made very well and it's just a shame that the game isn't as good. After buying the game, I came home and saw all this flashing animation and sparks flying everywhere to find out that was it was just the background graphics going crazy! At one point, I didn't know what was going and didn't know if I was firing those projections or was it the animation from the background??? Seriously, this game could had tone down on all that stuff in the background. A fighting game doesn't need all of that to have great fighting game.In the end, I thought this game wasn't very fun. It's simple. Too simple! It's for good casual gamers to pick up and play around a bit. If you want a simple fighting game, pick up this game. The learning curve is easy and if you're good, you can master it in a few days to a week. Heck, maybe you should just rent it. Too easy!--------------------------UpdateI forgot one very important point about this game.Why do you need to buy Jill and Shuma Gorath? It wasn't like Capcom couldn't fit the two characters onto the disc. They were just plain greedy!It would be understandable if Jill and Shuma were still being made or if they haven't been made yet.But that wasn't the case. Jill and Shuma was ready to use at launch. If you bought the strategy guide like I did, you would see that Jill and Shuma was already made and give full detail explanations on how to use them both! Why couldn't they be put in as hidden characters as well on the disc? MvC2 would had done that, no question about it.Capcom just had to take out some characters and had to asks people to pay extra for them. Though they were already ready to use along with the other characters from the start. For Capcom to remove them from the original roster and asks people for $10 more just to put them back in - well that seems really wrong to me.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000085AHJ","description":"In the open-ended space action/adventure gameFreelanceryou play a ne'er-do-well with a lucky streak, one of two survivors of a space disaster. Penniless and shipless, you venture around a space dock until you find a ship and a job. You'll encounter a heady mix of canned missions that follow one main quest, and a million opportunities to make money or aggravate the various factions that co-exist in the universe. Like an online role-playing game, or Bethesda'sMorrowind, you determine who your enemies are and who your friends are by your own actions, and, in another nod to role-playing, you can customize your ship with guns, rockets, and equipment just as you would customize a RPG character with swords, bows, and magic items. Best of all, you can play cooperatively with friends or fight it out with enemies online.The backstory posits a future where various countries, divided by both nationality and, seemingly, race, have boarded massive colony ships and ventured into a wormhole that appeared within reach of our crude space technology. They found themselves in a galaxy far, far away and they got stuck there when the wormhole collapsed. They quickly colonized new home worlds and named everything with familiar locales that make navigation a breeze. In the American sectors you'll feel at home entering the New York system and landing at a spaceport called Manhattan, for example. While contrived, this device is used beautifully and it's far better than having to memorize a bunch of sci-fi names and remembering where they are, perfect for a massive universe such as this one.ThoughFreelanceris set in space, it is technically not a space simulation. The game was designed to be accessible to casual gamers. For example,Freelancermakes you use the mouse for ship control. This is quite a shift for a game genre normally known to require joystick control. But even old-schoolWing CommanderorX-Wingfans may find that the sacrifice of verisimilitude is made up for with gains in agility. The mouse controls your guns, while you use the keyboard to maneuver around the rich universe that developer Digital Anvil has constructed. Much like a first-person shooter, you can dodge and weave while precisely blasting your enemies.Despite the game's age, its graphics are spectacular, as is the sound and voice acting, and in that way, fighting and trading with friends or alone,Freelancerproves worth the wait.

Simply, you go the LancerReactor web site and download your choice of modifications.  One of mine is Discovery 4.82.  This modification adds more equipment, money, weapons, ships to the game during the story and after.The story, I seem to remember, ends at about level 27 with over thirty levels possible.  Futhermore there are, I guess, about 25 or 27 solar systems involved with the storyline game...I count a total of 57 or 58 solar systems on the game board.  Lots of places to go and explore after the game has ended.  (Off the record, I wish Bungie had placed one or two 'wandering variables' in the game after the story had ended.  This would have given you something to equip your ship for and to make more money for...afterall, you can't whip a level 50 ship with a level 7 ship, and if you don't get the best ship possible--fully dressed out--soon enough, THEY MIGHT WIN!What do I mean by a wandering variable?  In this case it would have been nice if another invader had entered that part of the galaxy...they send out super fighter craft that are level 50 with four fighters inside them at level 20.  There mission would be to gather up mineral resources and fight anybody who interfers with them...sooner or later the mother ship would appear for the 'big fight'.  This type of X factor can wander all over the starsystems and be unpredictable where and when.  It would have given you something else to prepare for than just fight single and groups of fighters of they same type you've fought a dozen times before.Nevertheless, I like Freelancer.  I've had it for acouple of years and played it many times.  You'll get tired of it after you've played it through the storyline 2 or three times...you put it away and play your other games, and then sooner or later you want to go back.  Play the story line again, go to that one solar system you haven't searched yet...why not be trader this time, or a pirate.So finally, dispite any complaint from the other reviews, if you like the idea of this type of game you should get it--there are a lot of Mods for it out there.  If you do buy it, my advise is download the free Discovery 4.82 from Lancer Reactor and add it to the game the first time.Bye!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2007"}
{"product_name":"B0041HROGG","description":"","reviewerName":"Siklootd","summary":"Great Controller That Provides Added Support Where Needed","reviewText":"The Xbox 360 is arguably one of the most popular consoles of recent memory, with even Hollywood films and television series making references to \"The Xbox\" or shown playing the console in some manner.  The console's main advantage over its predecessor is the ergonomically designed controller.  Whereas the original Xbox featured a rather large controller similar to that of the Sega Dreamcast, the Xbox 360 features a much smaller, yet larger than the PS3, design that incorporates easy to use triggers and concave thumbsticks which provide better overall grip than the PS3's analog sticks do.However, one thing has always been a little \"off\" about the controller.  Despite its overall design being praised left and right by consumers and gaming professionals alike, one drawback has been constantly present whenever one discusses the Xbox 360 controller and that is its directional pad.  The PlayStation controllers have always provided one of the best fitting, and most useful, d-pads on a controller to date.  However, Microsoft went the route of the Sega Genesis, and utilized more a disc design for their d-pad.  The result: an awkward design that does not respond as intended.  Pressing \"up\" can sometimes be interpreted by the controller as an \"up-forward\" making on screen avatars move in the wrong direction.This controller promises to try to alleviate the problem, and it works, to a degree.  The controller provides a much easier to press directional pad which allows the user to ensure that he/she is indeed pressing the desired direction properly.  It does not move as fluidly as the PS3 d-pad does, but when compared to the previous iterations of the Xbox 360 controller, it does provide a much better overall response for each direction.  If the user decides to play the games with the traditional disc that the 360 uses, a simple twist of the d-pad converts it back it to its regular form.Overall, the controller provides a better directional pad than previous versions of the controller, with slightly improved response from the four major directions: up, left, right, and down.  However, if a user is expecting PS3 level responsiveness, than they may be disappointed.  The color scheme is a nice touch to the controller, providing an overall classy, and sleek design.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00007B77T","description":"We could talk about theSerious Sambackstory, but that would be missing the point, namely to commit carnage on a galactic scale. The smooth engine, multiplayer options, and fast pace make this game a solid choice for fans of first-person shooters.The interface uses the tried-and-true Xbox formula for shooters: the left thumbstick controls movement and the right thumbstick controls the angle of view. The extensive arsenal is something special though, with each weapon possessing a different efficiency so you have to find the perfect weapon quickly for each situation. For instance, the shotgun is a great weapon for up-close fighting among a crowd of enemies, but it's horrible at a distance or when you're stuck in the middle of a melee. The enemy list is also quite extensive. You will be fired upon, stepped on, stabbed, slashed, and electrocuted. Enemies will appear by land, air, and water.What makes this game stand out and keep you interested, though, is its irreverent, offbeat sense of humor. Serious Sam makes outlandish comments throughout the game, rides cosmic surfboards between scenes, saves progress at Dr. Who-like telephone booths, and pays homage to the Indiana Jones theme song. And you can change the blood splatters between red, green, and hippy (flowers and fruit). Our only major complaint is level design. Even when you believe you've cleared a room, enemies can pop out of midair and injure you. By not allowing you to seal yourself off from the onrushing masses in appropriate spaces, a major strategic element has been missed.--Eric Franklin","reviewerName":"mdizzog","summary":"Fun!","reviewText":"Serious Sam at first, seemed boring. I played the computer version for hours though, and loved it. There are hundreds of monsters coming at you, and you have to strafe, dodge, and weave to avoid them. At the same time you shoot tons of different weapons. The funnest thing is, the game rocks.The badguys are fun and inventive. They don't get old. The weapons are great. Two shotguns, tommy gun, minigun, some laser stuff which is cool, two pistols, a cannon, a rocket launcher, a grenade launcher(which rocks), a sniper rifle(which is kinda like halo except it practically kills all in one to two shots), and a knife. The flamethrower looks terrific. It may even be a little better than \"Return to Castle Wolfenstein\". The story is there. It plays no role really, but its still there. Sam is awesome.As for replay value? Depends. I loved shooting millions of monsters in the heat of battle. Don't you? Some do and some don't. I guess this could be considered a \"hack-and-slash\" game because you basically shoot things and avoid a few traps. The game isn't frustrating though, and that's what counts.If you are reading this review, then you own a computer. Get Serious Sam for computer. It has an editor AND a modeler. I got Serious Sam 2 and learned how to use both these devices. They are kinda fun. There are also different mods for the game. Surf the web for a few and you won't be dissapointed. Serious Sam 2 is kinda repetitive after Serious Sam 1, but it has a third person view, which I like to use in unison with first person. Pass the xbox one up for the computer version.The price has gone down though. SO i would reeccomend this game to lots.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00C7103JI","description":"Warner Bros. Batman: Arkham Origins 1000381344 PC Games","reviewerName":"Adron Gardner","summary":"Direct to DVD Die Hard","reviewText":"I was one of the few who thought Arkham City was better than Arkham Asylum.  City was short and bumpy, but I just liked the smoother gameplay and the fantastic story.  Asylum was mind blowing, for about two hours.  After that, nearly every boss is a bane clone all the way until the final Joker.  Other than the great Scarecrow encounters, the second half - and ending - was a huge disappointment.Arkham Origins is a weird game.  It looks much better than City with some decent DirectX stuff, but the game is all over the place.  The map is largely recycled from City.  The flow of the story is really messy, and it just reeks of Direct to Cable or Direct to DVD.  All the \"secret sauce\" from the last two Rocksteady games is completely absent and there is a general lack of attention to detail.  All the level and encounter hopping feels arbitrary and unmotivated.  The combat is not only massively easier, it is missing some memorable touches.  There is no longer a loud thunderclap for downing the last guy in a group battle.  Bats just fly out and you get the XP but that satisfying thunderclap is gone.The voice acting is pretty spot on, but the whole production feels like a cheap knock off.  Crime scene investigations are expanded but also feel overly simplistic and I think they are a missed opportunity to do something different and better than the last games.  Arkham City has it's problems, most I can't argue with.  But it was not only polished but paced well and full of drama.  If Arkham Asylum was Die Hard, then Arkham City was, obviously, Escape from New York.  There's nothing great to compare Origins to at all.  In general the game is fun and plays pretty much like the other two games, but the whole experience has been completely unmemorable.  I played through Arkham City on PC multiple times.  I bought City to do trophy and achievement runs on both my PS3 and 360.  But I'm not going through Origins again.  I fired up multiplayer for 15 minutes.  In short, the MP additions and even the single player have a whole Bioshock 2 feel of \"unnecessary.\"This should be a $30 game, if that.  It reuses a lot of Arkham City's map without duplicating the drama or urgency.  The story is OK with some promising new voice actor additions, but all the wind is gone and the narrative feels pretty disjointed, almost unrelated to the earlier Arkham games.  Arkham Origins is not a bad game, it is still fun to beat up bad guys.  But you'll be better served by waiting for the Steam Sale where it's on the block for less than $10 in a few months.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2013"}

Me and my hubby have just played through the story mode of the game and started exploring the multilayer portion. All in all I am very pleased with the game though it do also have some serious issues.First of all this game is set in the G1 time line, it has nothing to do with the movies, which is a good thing. Not that the Transformers movies are bad but it is nice to see the old characters presented the way I rememberer them from my childhood. There is unbelievable amount of reference to the original G1 material in this game which makes it a treat for fans, though be aware that the game do take some liberties with the Transformers setting and characters. This game is set during the war on Cybertron, also it is set over 4 million years ago before the Transformers crashed the Ark on Earth. The story mode, or campaign mode is great, it tells a interesting story about the war and is quite good, only problem is that it is rather short.The Campaign mode has ten chapters five for the Autobots and five for the Decepticons. It is good and rather interesting but far to short, there should have been at least ten chapters for each faction. This game is mainly a multilayer game, it has several different modes from team play, to all out war to survival mode, one can even meet up with some other players and play through the campaign mode together. However the multiplayer plagued by bugs, something that is rather common in the game at large, two times while playing through our PS# froze and we had to restart it, and the machine is not three months old.The graphics of this game is beautiful. Yes the landscape of Cyberstron can be a bit repetitive, however it is a machine world and the game designers have stayed very true to the descriptions of Cyberstron in the comics and cartoons. The robots look amazing and I wish they would have done the same for the movies as they did in this game, the character design is upgraded and do not look cartoony however they are still easy to recognize for fans and are not just a mess of metal and fancy animated blank thingies as in the movies. I can not say anything than that the game look just amazing.I would give this game 3 of 5, it is a good game but with serious flaws and a to short story mode, it fails to rise above the mass of first person action games out there. However I will give the game an extra star for the huge amounts of fan material that is put in the game. A Transformers fan can not help but love this game, despite of the flaws. However had this not been Transformers it would be a rather mediocre action game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0038MUCPK","reviewerName":"M. Fulkerson","summary":"A rare feat in licensed video gaming","reviewText":"Usually, when a video game coincides with a movie release, it is an absolute disaster.  Movie companies and video game companies communicating with each other is typically the equivalent of Democrats and Republicans overlooking their differences, holding hands, and working together to solve the worlds issues.  Video games that are based on movies are almost always rushed, under-produced, over-hyped, and pieces of unplayable garbage.  Toy Story 3 is a rarity in that aspect.  While this game isn't going to change the world by any stretch of the imagination, it is highly playable, and mildly enjoyable.The controls of the game are nicely done which is imperative with a third person action style game.  The camera movements are fluid, and the aiming system works fine.  Jumping over chasms and ledges is also a breeze, and depth perception has been handled nicely in the game.  If I were to assign a grade to the control system only I would give it four stars.  Never did I feel like I was struggling to see anything, land on something, or grab an item.The graphics are very sharp and cartoony-like which adds some nice depth to the game.  Backgrounds are rendered smoothly, and the frame rate moves along at a nice clip.The fun factor in the game grows a little tiresome after some extended play, but I'm an adult, and this game is aimed right at the kiddies.  That fact alone may make my overall review seem unfair, but I've played (and still play) games aimed at kids, and Toy Story 3 is a bit short on ideas.  You basically perform the usual platform/action type video game moves like collecting coins, jumping on platforms, breaking boxes open, leaping from ledge to ledge, etc.  There is nothing wrong with that type of thing, but when that is where the creativity starts and ends you feel a little empty with the general gaming experience with Toy Story 3.There is really nothing wrong with this game other than it being guilty of uninspired gameplay.  It looks and sounds great, but you'll end up with a feeling that you've played this type of game 1,000 times before.  For a five year old kid that won't be an issue, but as a general rule of thumb it doesn't quite make it worth a 50 dollar price tag.  This game reminded me of the original Spyro The Dragon game for the PS1 with its animated look and control scheme.  Considering that the Spyro games came out over ten years ago it does make you feel that Toy Story 3 could have been much better than it is.As I stated in the beginning, though, the chances of a video game based on a movie being good is extremely bad, so in that respect Toy Story 3 is a pleasant surprise.  However, if you are a parent, own a PS3, and are looking for an outstanding game for your kid, look no further than Little Big Planet.  The creativity and customization with Little Big Planet is absolutely amazing, and human beings of any age can easily get lost for hours at a time getting carried away in its world.  Little Big Planet is truly a game for adults and kids alike, and comparing it to Toy Story 3 is like comparing the Mona Lisa to a blank slate.  Additionally, the Ratchet and Clank games are fantastic for parents to enjoy with their children.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2010"}

A co-op player can come into the game at any time and leave at any time (note only one of you will play as the Master Chief, while another will play as the Arbiter, and the other two players will be Elites that work with humans)- Great looking graphics and animation, that look even better then Halo 2, F.E.A.R. and just as good as Bioshock, while these graphics might not look as good as Gears of War do to some people these graphics still are some of the best seen to date.- Intense multiplayer action online through Xbox Live with matches as small as one on one and as big as 16 players (and offline with out using Xbox Live using either spilt screen, or system link). Halo 3 is set up similar to Halo 2 in the sense that you're given a rank when you play multiplayer (this rank can go up or down at any time) this rank is representative of your skill and your matched with others of your skill type, that way new unskilled players and hardcore veterans will not often play against one another, unless they make a special match themselves that ignores rank.BAD:- Confusing plot to new players of this franchise - Playing Pervious games and read the Halo Novels will fill you in on the details, if you are incline to learn them.- No Clan Support (like in Halo 2) - This might get fixed in a future patch- Game is considered short to some (Campaign Story Mode).IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- A Sci-Fi First Person Shooter with quick pacing and vehicle combat.- Co-op and online versus/team games is the big draw here.- NEW MODE: Forge is a mode that lets you edit all the maps in Halo 3, while you cannot rebuild the maps themselves you can in this mode, add and take away any and all of the objects from vehicles and guns to spawning points and flag zones. This is all done in real time and you can invite friends to this mode while your customizing the map(s), they can play a multiplayer game while your doing this (instead of just waiting for you) and if you want you can forgo editing the map and join the game at hand as either a player or the map editor (who looks like 343 Guilty Spark), while playing as the map editor you can still add and take away any and all objects from vehicles and guns to spawning points and flag zones any time you want.- NEW MODE: Theater Mode is a video editor that lets you record and play back any and all matches from Campaign, Multiplayer, and Forge modes from the point of view of any player either in first person or third person (even in a orbit-cam where the camera circles around the player) all in real time (you can also pause this at any time as well as fast forward and rewind), even use your camera to fly around the match and see the match from any angle you want, Don't forget you must save your videos before you turn off the game or you will lose said videos. Also you can take a picture at any time and save it to your Xbox 360 then download your picture at Bungie.netGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Halo 2 (Xbox)- Halo (Xbox)- Resistance: Fall of Man (PS3)- Bioshock (360)- Gears of War (360)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- There are bonus items scattered through the Campaign Story Mode called Skulls getting these \"Skulls\" will make the game harder (by doing things like turning off radar for the rest of the Campaign Mode your playing it) but will also greatly increase your meta game score for the Campaign Mode.- There are two different limited collectors editions of this game. One is called the limited edition, which comes in a metal tin and has a bonus disc (with behind the scene videos and such) and also comes with an art book. While the other limited edition (called Legendary edition) you will find an art book a mini poster two bonus DVDs (with behind the scene videos and such as well as a collection of all the cut scenes form Halo and Halo 2 and themes you can download to your 360) And the it comes with a plastic Master Chief Helmet to keep your DVDs in (Helmet as big a volley ball).- At Bungie.net you can sign up and pay a small fee to upgrade your Halo 3 account (default is free) to hold more space on their serves for your videos/pictures/clips that you made.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2007"}

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone. To help you maximize the potential of this setup, two-player online and offline co-op modes ensure that you have options when picking a partner.Steel yourself Against the Harsh Reality of KijujuAn advanced version of Capcom's proprietary MT Framework game engine brings groundbreaking graphics and effects to Kijuju, the highly-developed environment where this game's action takes place. New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"Ivan Tovar \"Ivan0072\"","summary":"THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD!!!","reviewText":"Only Downer Its That The Game Is Easy The First Time Around!

Together, these two titles laid the foundation for the series and spawned many hit sequels that have now sold over 42 million units worldwide.","reviewerName":"Joe Sherry","summary":"the origins of Final Fantasy...","reviewText":"With the success of the Final Fantasy series over the years, Squaresoft decided to revisit some of the older games in the series.  They had released Final Fantasy Anthology and Final Fantasy Chronicles, and brought Final Fantasies 4, 5, and 6 to the Playstation for the first time.  Final Fantasy 4 and 6 were known on the SNES as FF 2 and 3 (the Japanese 2 and 3 were never released in America), and 5 had not made it over here, either.  These were some of my favorite games and I was glad to have them available for the Playstation. But now I was hoping to get the first three ported over.  I started to lose hope and we are now several years into the life of the Playstation 2, but Square released Final Fantasy Origins for the Playstation.  Final Fantasy Origins is a compilation of the original Final Fantasy (NES) and Final Fantasy II.  Final Fantasy II was never released in America until now.Final Fantasy:  This is the game that first got me interested in the RPG genre (which is now my favorite genre for video games).  I played it for the NES when I was a child and this is the game I was excited to play again and not have any problems with save files deleting (a problem with my NES).  This version of Final Fantasy has updated graphic, some enemies/items/spells with different names, and the option to turn on extra features that were not in the original version of the game.  One feature is the ability to dash through towns and dungeons (making some things go a bit quicker).  The other feature of note is called \"auto-aim\" and takes care of the biggest problem I had with the original version of the game.  Now, when an enemy is defeated any character targeting that enemy for attack will automatically attack a different enemy.  This seems common sense, but this was not included in the original.  You also have the option to turn auto-aim off, if you so choose.There is also the option to play the game on Easy or Normal mode.  Normal mode is just like the original game, only with the addition of dash and auto-aim.  Everything else is the same.  Easy is the same game, only spells/items/weapons cost less, you level up quicker (and can surpass level 50), and can use more spells per level (You can use a maximum of 9 spells per spell level on Normal....this can be quite limiting).  Upon completion of the game, your stats are entered into a \"Collection\".  This records all the enemies you have beaten and all of the treasure chests you have opened in every area.  The more you kill and the more you open, the game will unlock bonus artwork.This is a very welcome upgrade to one of my favorite games of my childhood.Final Fantasy II:  For the first time, Final Fantasy II has been released in America.  From what I have heard from people who got to play the game before the game was released, very few people actually liked it and they called it perhaps the worst game of the series.  That very well may be, but the game wasn't that bad.  This version of Final Fantasy II has the same updated graphics and auto-aim that we find in Final Fantasy.  It has the same features and Collection Data as Final Fantasy.This game is the first in the series to actually have a story and characters of note.  You play as Firion, Gus, and Maria, three youths who escape from their town as it was being taken over by the Empire.  They join a resistance group and from this point they do missions to slowly chip away at the Empire and to achieve certain goals.  As you play, you have a different fourth member of the party which will move in and out as the game progresses.  This game actually has individual characters with names and identities.  The one thing to note about this is that the characters do not seem to have any noticeable personality.  It was a step in the right direction for the characters, but to be honest, there wasn't much difference between your three as well as whomever was the fourth character.In some senses this game sets the stage for the character building that you will find in Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy Tactics.  You get to choose what kind of warriors each character is.  If you want a strong fighter, then physically attack with him (or her) and the character will gain in strength and weapon proficiency.  If you want a white mage, teach him white magic.  The same with black magic.  Here's the twist.  Since there is no experience points in this game, you increases your stats through use.  You won't gain in strength if you don't fight.  You gain HP by being attacked and hurt.  You gain magic points by casting a lot of spells in battle.  When you learn a spell (by purchasing a scroll or by finding one) your spell is only on level one and you have increase the power of the spell by casting it a lot.  Further, if you fight a lot your strength will increase but your intelligence will decrease, making you a stronger fighter but less able as a magician.  I'll be honest, this is my least favorite experience/level system in any game, but it isn't horrible.  If you attack yourself a little bit early on in the game it'll help for the beginning stages.  Also, when you get the ship for the first time you can go to Mysidia and buy the Swap spell, and if you use this near Altair, you can increase your stats very quickly.Overall, Final Fantasy II is probably the weakest of all the Final Fantasy games, but I would not ignore the game because of that.  It is challenging, and it is definitely \"old school\", but it was still worth playing, especially if someone wants to beat all the Final Fantasy games.  I'm glad that Square did not stick with this experience system and it is interesting to see where the Final Fantasy series came from and how it got to where it is now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2003"}

There's not much else to say other than it is the most fun I've ever had with this kind of hack-n-slash action game. Yes, the cut scenes are still in standard def, but it's not as jarring as some make it out to be in my opinion.That said, do NOT let your kids play this. It is the video game equivalent of a hard R-rated action film: it's violent, bloody, and has the gratuitous nudity one would expect from an R-rated movie. This game is obviously and unashamedly targeted at the 18+ Spike TV male demographic, and pulls no punches on that front. It's over-the-top visceral manly-man ridiculous action stuff.All of that out of the way, this 2-game package is the best value for your money on any system right now, even if it only included one of the games.

Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well.

All quests come with a reward, which might be anything from a rare item to a new, unlocked occupation.Tag ModeDragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skiesincludes the interactive Tag Mode that allows players to keep the game active even while their Nintendo DS system is stored in their pocket, purse or backpack. When two players come within range of one another, Tag Mode enables them to wirelessly--and automatically--exchange character information, customized greetings and treasure maps. These treasure maps allow players to find otherwise inaccessible dungeons called grottoes featuring special boss monsters and even rare items.Social Play AspectsOne of the most enticing things aboutSentinels of the Starry Skiesare its many social aspects built into its gameplay. First, you need never be alone. Special multiplayer modes let players share their adventure with others, allowing up to four players to team up via a local wireless connection and experience the fun of tackling challenging monsters and dungeons cooperatively with their own characters. Players can even leave the game active in their backpacks, pockets or purses and still interact with other players via an interactive Tag Mode. In addition, information about players' characters can be wirelessly transmitted to others. Also the game contains treasure maps that allow players to find otherwise inaccessible special dungeons called grottoes, which can contain rare items or enemies. In Tag mode, treasure maps and customized greetings can be exchanged automatically by players who come within range of one another. Finally, players with wireless broadband Internet access can visit an online shop to find new items or download additional quests. The selection of items changes daily. Some downloadable quests will continue the main storyline of the game, while others offer standalone missions or quests themed to a particular time of year.Key Game FeaturesHandheld action RPG action where players engage in epic quests in undiscovered lands filled with dangerous monsters and untold storiesConnect locally with up to three friends in cooperative gameplay modesCustomization allowing you to create your own hero, either male or female, changing your hair, face, body style and equipping them from a selection of over 1,000 in-game items including weapons, shields, armor and accessoriesWireless features that allow access to changing exclusive items and questsIn-game treasure maps that reveal otherwise inaccessible special dungeons called grottoes, which can contain rare items or enemiesGameplay with differing stories and missions depending on NPCs encountered","reviewerName":"Steve","summary":"A Nostalgic, Fun Adventure!","reviewText":"I've been playing Dragon Quest/Warrior games since I was a small child, and the ninth installment is a perfect continuation of the series legacy.  Here are a few notes from my experience:- The gameplay and controls are simple, which should be nothing surprising to Dragon Quest veterans.  The battle system is traditional and turn based.- The story and world are light-hearted and almost whimsical.  There's not much of the deep, dark stuff typical of many RPGs.- Instead of playing the role of a small child out to save the world, you play an Angel who has fallen from the sky and lost his powers.- There's a pretty cool quest system where every week you can download a new mission/adventure with a variety of rewards.- DQ9 is a pretty easy game.- There's a job/class system where you can configure your party with different roles.All in all, Dragon Quest IX is a lot of fun and almost the perfect DS game.  It's a great handheld adventure that will provide you with many hours of enjoyment.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000099T2H","description":"The sequel is here with new challenges, enhanced graphics, and eviler terrorists!","reviewerName":"Reggie","summary":"Same as the first one, but still fun to play.","reviewText":"It's a very good game, but despite a good selection of campaigns, the single-player mode feels like a training tutorial to what the game is mainly all about... the on line multiplayer mode. The graphics, character models, and menue system are all good, but during the single player campaign, the friendly and enemy AI do a lot of dumb things that will send you back to the reload screen, and the story and motivations of the enemy deserves a bit more attention to detail. Killing enemies such as talking flowers, bazooka weilding houses, and giant mutated teddy bears in a game such as Final Fantasy is ok. (no one's gonna question the enemy and their motives in a Final Fantasy game). Killing enemies such as terrorist in a modern day game however, is a bit more tricky of a subject matter for game developers to handle and dish out. It should be the duty of game developers to present intelligent material in their games that helps people make sense out of these senseless times that we live,(and in this case) play in. Instead, they are possibly giving ammo (literally and figuratively) to kids (who play games such as this one) that are prone to believe that Islam (and other \"un-American\" beliefs) and all its followers should be shot. In the game, something drives these men to do what they do. Something moves men and women enough not only to kill, but also to die. Unfortunately, that something is never fully explained in this game. I don't think, \"just shoot and kill\" is the message that the game is trying to present to gamers, but subject materials like killing terrorist in a video game should be more fully explained, since this is a very sensitive part of life nowadays, just so that people dont get the wrong impression of the game. Maybe this is the reason why it got a \"M\" rating. It doesn't take long to get through the SOCOM games (I finished the single player campaing in 4 SOCOM games... socom 1,2,3 & Combined Assault in 14 days) but the meat and potatoes of the game is having fun destroying all of your friends in on line multiplayer matches.

While I loved the first I never finished it...the frame rate suffered...the difficulty was sporatic...and the story wasn't very enticing...Then they released the second one and while it still had a few of the same issues it made up for it with a more interesting environment and slightly better graphics and a better story. I completed it and the 2 add ons and have replayed it numerous times. When the third was announced and I saw the videos I was floored...It was turning into the Dead Rising I was hoping for with the first...Having a huge open world...millions of zombies and psychopaths and just about every issue corrected...there isn't to say there aren't bugs and what not but thats to be expected with open world game not to mention the hundred and hundred of zombies that can be on screen at one time. While I don't have the sympathy for the character I had for the second game, this new guy is far more interesting I still like his &#34;personality&#34;. If you've played the other this is the best one out there and is a good reason to shell out the money for an xbox one. The controls are simple and easy to get use to. Driving is a major part of the new game and while the cars aren't GTA style handling they are still servicable and the graphics may not push the Xbox One to its limit but no lauching game ever pushes the limits of the new console. What it does show is how to intergrate kinect into the game that makes sense and where games are headed. The graphics are still very good, just not mind blowing.

In this latest tale of 22nd-Century battles, you take control of the baby blue wonder and his mechanically inclined friends in a side-scrolling adventure set in a colorful 3D world. The run-n-gun action stays true to the Man's roots-while it may seem like you're hopping around in large three-dimensional levels, almost all of the action is still completely linear in traditional side-scrolling fashion. Though this in and of itself is not a setback, the unlimited cheap shots directed at you by the unruly enemies are nothing short of annoying and frustrating. Even a new feature that lets you switch between two characters at any time during gameplay can't keep adversaries from repeatedly hitting below the metal belt with unavoidable and inconsistent blows. The cheapness continues in other gameplay areas. A huge amount of slowdown, even when there's little going on, detracts from the overall simple shooting-n-slashing frenzy. A sloppy targeting system and the inability to strafe make the controls more of a pain than painless, while a dull soundtrack completes a mediocre audio package. If it weren't for the name, X7 would be at the bottom of the rental pile. For Mega Man fans, however, this latest foray with the blue man group has a nostalgia factor that might make it worth a night's rental-just don't expect an exhilarating ride from start to finish.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2003"}

It's very similiar to Zelda, and originally started as an N64 title before jumping to the cube and being rebranded with the Star Fox characters.My thoughts on the game are this: A few years ago, this game would've been right up my alley. I've played Mario 64, Banjo-Kazooie, and Donkey Kong 64, titles which focus more on the gameplay than any plot. It's about the joy of completing the actual challenge itself, and not the cutscene that takes place afterwards. Star Fox Adventures is very much like this. Each world is full of multiple tasks, where you have to complete puzzles or collect items so characters can advance. It's a little more story-oriented and linear, but basically the same thing.However, my tastes have changed. As an older gamer I prefer more plot to my games now, with intricate stories I can sink my teeth into. There's more story here than in most games featuring Nintendo mascots, but besides some small plot twists its still very general. The game's prime focus is on exploration and discovery for their own sake. If you like that, there's a lot to love here. Vast beautiful worlds and characters await you, and Rare has added some very nice fur effects that are wonderful. Still one of the prettiest Gamecube titles around.So there's a lot of game here, a long, meaty adventure that'll last you quite awhile. Younger gamers should eat it up.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Smash Out Amazing!!!","reviewText":"It arguably is so amazing how people really dig those one vs. one fighting games. Arguably, they've remained just as controversial and as much fun since back in the late 80's. Arguably for Nintendo they adequately did find a way to cash in on the fun with a one vs. one combat game for the N64 called Super Smash Brothers. Arguably, the game was fair but easily boring for one player, where if you were playing with somebody else, it would increase in the game of life. Well, Nintendo had to really consider improving the game to make it better for the Gamecube back in 2001. Well, they did and it is fiercer than ever.Super Smash Brothers Melee for the Nintendo Gamecube is a unique one vs. one combat game that like before, putting regulars and favorites from Nintendo past and present against each other in a battle of the best with returning favorites like Mario, Link from The Legend Of Zelda, and Kirby to name a few. The game also adds a little more fire with additions like the vile Bowser, the sweet and cute Yoshi, Metroid, and Peach just to name a few. The game does thrill a little more with more arenas and zones like Mute City from the F-Zero franchise, the innocent woods from Kirby's Dream Land, and others just to tell a bit. The games graphics are delightful, and it is easy to manuever. Still, it does take awhile for some of the more advanced moves to get used to, but they are simple to fight with.While many fighting games have come and gone for other systems, Nintendo has remained constant for the Gamecube with the Super Smash Brothers Melee. This has been a pure delight for Gamecube owners, and is sure to be a must have for anybody who loves combat games.

The best weapons are the rocket launcher, nano rifle (all matter eating beam),and throwable sticky bombs, which you detonate at your leisure.  The graphics and framerate are pretty good,so the game ages well.  Changing weapons is needlessly complex, as you have to hold down R2 and another button.This occurs in real time; they didn't learn anything from Bioshock.  I enjoyed this crazy, thrilling ride for a while,but grew disenchanted when the enemy ai really pulled the reins in.  I asked myself, \"Is it really worth the frustration?\"I had played enough of the game (30 hrs) to not need any more punishment, so I gave up.

There are five different types of challenges, appropriate for all ages and challenging for all skill levels.","reviewerName":"M. Warren \"gamer\"","summary":"Wow, wish all sequals were like this","reviewText":"Though technically not a true sequel, Big Brain Academy is another strong game to test your mind.  The game is unlike Brain Age in several ways.  Instead of doing short, fast actions like simple math, you do all kinds of puzzles and other stuff.  THe art style is alot different.  Instead of the campy doctor's lobby look, the relaxed, cool look, Big Brain Academy goes for a cartoon style, with kid drawings, and a Mr. Peanut shaped worm.  Big Brain Academy is a slower game, and the challegnes are based on memory and other things, as opposed to the fast thinking in Brain Age that stimulates more than makes you think.Big Brain Academy does not measure how old your brain is, instead, it tells you how much your brain ways, and the heavier your brain is, the smarter you are.  The premise is different than Brain Age as well, but instead of comparing, just read my review of Brain Age when I write it, and do the comparing yourselves (hey, I'm just a college student).Basically, you have three modes, and you can have up to five seperate files for five seperate people.  YOu can  do a test that tests you on five seperate catergories supposly for the brain.  These are things that involve counting math cubes, drawing lines on shapes, mapping where the dog has a bone, and other random stuff.  You can do this as many times as you want, and you can also practice any event you like.  It sounds like a real pain in the butt, and really sounds like the last game you would want to play.  However though, the game proves that it's a great game, and passes the most important test, and it passes with flying colors. The test would in fact, be, the game is wicked fun.  I hate math, but for some reason, counting coins, contrasting weights, and other stuff that normally are mudane tasks in life, become strangly, very fun.  That's the best part, this game is fast, frantic, and fun.  This is most important, and I really think that you should get it.  DOn't listen to anybody who bashes it because of math, if you think math is fun, tell people.  Don't be a sucker to sterotypes.  So try this game, and it really is worth it.As for the whole \"makes you smarter\" hype, I am not sure I truely believe it, but I do think it makes our brain's in better shape, that it makes it work better. And besides, doing math has never, and never will be, more fun.  With the price, you should get it, and it will be a game that you will be coming back to...unless you have the brain of Stephen Hawking (and you don't).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2007"}

It's memorizing. The graphics are beautiful, like a super polished, super smooth version of Odin's Sphere. Sometimes I take pauses JUST to view the environments, and my siblings watch me play all the time cuz it reminds them of something out of a Japanese fairy tale. The soundtrack is perfect. The music coupled with the art of this game makes you feel like you're actually there running through the feudal era of Japan. A LOT of hard work was put into every inch of this game and it shows everywhere.Whoever developed the control scheme for this game is a damn genius. I dunno how something so simple could be so complex. It feels effortless and yet, makes you feel like you're really getting your groove on lol. I could hand a toddler the control and he'd instantly look like a master. Don't think it stops there, people who actually know what they're doing can take it a step beyond. A HUGE step beyond. Mixing styles and attacks, counters and dodging, rolling and gliding, there's a million ways to come at your foes. People who say the battles feel repetitive are, sad to say, not creative, or flat out CAN'T fight. You get a wide range of bizarre attacks from just pressing A, so people tend to just button mash and run through the game, making it repetitive for themselves. There are tons of swords and abilities to unlock, so you're kinda responsible for making the most of your gaming experience...or not.I always prefer a game with English voice overs but I must say, the Japanese voice acting is very nice in this game, and it also helps add a nice touch to what feels like pretty deep Japanese culture. The replay value is pretty decent. There are two modes, you'll probably wanna play both. There are two characters, each with their own story line. Anyone loving Japanese folk lore/tale, or stories of the feudal era will be sucked into the story and its cast. Then there's the truck load of weapons to forge etc. If you want, this game has the ability to keep you busy for a while. The best thing is the price. This game is dog cheap! $9.99?! Brand New?! For something of this caliber?! It feels like the makers of this game ripped their own selves off! This is what I call putting customers first lol! This is a unique masterpiece, the kind you don't see often. You should grab it now before time passes, the game gets rare, and the price shoots up to what this game's REALLY worth. We're talking somewhere around $40-$50. HEED MY WORDS.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2012"}

Wii, like all the previous releases in theSuper Mario Bros.franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros.

The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"C. L. Hanson","summary":"DS fun on the Wii","reviewText":"I've been a huge fan of Mario and pretty much anything Nintendo-related since Donkey Kong in 1981. It seems all of Nintendo's core-system Mario offerings have been, for the most part, huge events and successes, with each offering being a bit different and innovative than the one before.The one mainstay, however, has been Mario's adventures in the Mushroom Kingdom (and beyond) were rendered mostly as single player, with Player Two only getting their crack when Mario croaked. Super Mario Galaxy became the one exception, as a second player can assist by using their Wiimote to hold off enemies and collect star bits for you. It was an innovative, helpful, and in some cases, necessary feature! My wife never seemed to care for Super Mario Galaxy, as we have several other multi-player games for the Wii. However, during my recent second play-through, she began helping me and we've been having a really great time.Now, with New SMB Wii, we can finally play as Mario and friends together! After playing the game for the first time last night for about an hour with our 6-year old daughter, we found out two things: teamwork is good, and running ahead collecting coins, stealing prizes and stomping turtles sending the shell flying towards other unsuspecting players is bad. Since time is of the essence, everybody has to be on the same page!If you've played New Super Mario Bros for the DS, then you'll be right at home with the Wii version, with graphics being turned up a notch, plus new suits, abilities and controls meant for the Wii. While a little difficult for the younger crowd, a fun game nonetheless.Within lies my one and only complaint. While I love what they've done here, I feel like this game borrows TOO heavily from the DS version, including the same cutesy background music, which the Koopas and Goombahs and other creatures bop along and react to. I could have done without this aspect, but again, this was intended by Nintendo to be a family-friendly game, meant to also appease the clamoring die-hards who wanted yet another core system side-scrolling adventure. I guess after being buried playing Galaxy for the past couple weeks, I would have enjoyed Nintendo employing the same graphics style, as some of the side-scrolling adventures tossed into Galaxy were awesome.Nintendo doesn't look back, and will no doubt continue to find new and innovative ways for Mario to rescue Princess Peach for the 100,000th time. While still a \"new\" Mario adventure, the DS aspect doesn't make it feel \"all new\". But, Nintendo is saving that for future 3D open world Mario adventures, which is truly where his future lies.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0050SX97I","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"The Definitive Way to Experience Metal Gear Solid","reviewText":"There have been a great deal of HD collections coming out lately.  Most giving you trophy or achievement support along with the updated visuals.  The Metal Gear Solid HD collection is not different.  But the package seems worth it mainly because of just how much you're going to get from these games.  By bringing you the Substance version of MGS2 and the Subsistence version of MGS3 you are getting much more than your money's worth here.  Not to mention you are still getting Peace Walker.There isn't much need to discuss the story of Metal Gear here.  In the first place, we'd be here all day just trying to discuss what it all means.  And in the second place, the majority of you getting your hands on this have probably already experienced these games once before.  I will only say that the story of the saga is absorbing, confusing and a lot of fun.  Gamers have been absorbed by the themes of these games for quite some time, but experiencing them again isn't always so bad.  The cutscenes are usually good.  Some of them are a little long, but they're very well done.  Complete with great voice acting, humor, drama and action.  The cinematic experience of Metal Gear Solid is a jack of all trades.It is unique, however, to see how these games differ.  Despite all being Metal Gear Solid titles they all look, feel and control very differently.  With Metal Gear Solid 2 harboring the closest to the original game while Metal Gear Solid 3 gives you a ton of freedom to actually take several different approaches to each particular area.  And while Peace Walker is much more straightforward than the third, it still allows for a lot of freedom gameplay wise.  This means that each game is actually quite unique.  And playing all three side by side by side in this manner helps to showcase that we weren't just getting the same old thing from one game to the next.  They all retain their stealth elements but approach them in very different ways.Trophy and achievement support has been added to the games.  This is sure to delight some of the most hardcore Metal Gear fans.  And it's nice to see that Hideo Kojima has a sense of humor about it in some regards.  The visuals are also crisp in HD.  Regardless of the HD or not, Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3 actually still look rather good even compared to todays standards.  The aesthetic design is still unique in both games.  It doesn't feel new, but it's easy to be drawn in thanks to the details.  Realized in HD everything looks smoother and is now presented to players in widescreen.The only downside to the visual structure is Peace Walker.  It doesn't look as good as some may have hoped.  It is understandable, however.  The game was designed for a smaller screen than whatever it is you're playing it on.  On the PSP it looks nothing short of fantastic.  But blowing up the picture in this way is going to cause for some blurry textures.  It also lacks quite the amount of detail due to being on the PSP as well.  Likewise, since the experience was designed for a portable system it plays as such.  On the other hand, however, you can use your PSP save data to play if you wish.The best part, however, is that with the exception of Metal Gear Online from Metal Gear Solid 3, you get all the extras from the two games.  The VR Missions from Metal Gear Solid 2 are still there.  As are the snake tales.  Metal Gear Solid 3 also includes the original Metal Gear 1 and 2 (something the essential collection didn't have).  The extras were more than we expected then and they're still nice to have here as well.The lack of the first Metal Gear Solid is somewhat regrettable but it is hard to imagine that the transition to HD would've been kind to the original game.  Given how Peace Walker was treated visually, the first game might not really be that good to look at in HD.  The limitations of the Playstation graphically don't make for a great transition to High Definition.  For those who can't be without the original Metal Gear Solid, however, you can easily head over to the PSN and download it from there.  It won't be HD, but you'll still be able to experience the game and story again.More than likely those who pick up this collection will have already experienced these games before.  And they're picking it up to re-experience them in HD.  If you haven't experienced Metal Gear Solid before the HD collection is one of the finest ways to experience it.  Given the cinematic quality of the games themselves, HD alone actually can justify a purchase.  They're good games worth re-exploring for fans.  And worth diving into for those who are curious to experience them.  It's three games in one (five, if you include Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2) and a very enjoyable collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2011"}

But On this game, they started from scratch. That is what makes MK5:Deadly Alliance such a good game. The only thing about it is sometimes the button combo's can be really frustrating. The graphics are a lot different and the story line is a lot more original than 4. Also they are finally not &quot;living&quot; off Lui Kang anymore. Finally a chance for a fresh story-line, and a chance to focus on more new characters. If you thought MK4 was alright, but lacked inventiveness, and love MK 1,2, &amp; Trilogy I suggest definitely buying this. MK has always been my favorite series of fighting games.

There are some warmup workouts, but the game focuses on training to box. If you love boxing, then you'll be set. If you're not a fan of boxing, then it makes sense that this probably isn't the cardio system for you.You really want to have two controllers to use this - not just a controller and a nunchuck. The controllers are what sense your hand motion, and there's a lot of activity that involves right jab, left hook, right uppercut, and so on. You want to be able to have both hands holding a controller to have those registering properly.The game's graphics are not up to modern Wii standards, so that's something you'll have to be OK with. With this being a fitness game, I don't hold it to as high a standard as an immersive world-exploring RPG game. They do have a few places you can work out in, and I love the wood-floored dojo type area by a forest.While the game says it uses a balance board, really that's just for a few exercises. So you use that for doing push-ups for example, and for doing leg lifts. It's absolutely fine not to have a balance board since all the boxing is done just standing on the floor.This is definitely a good workout. You're moving back and forth constantly, \"bouncing\" on your feet, and your arms feel it after a short while of quick punching.The voice of your trainer can be repetitive, and the \"music\" is all tinny electronic music, so neither of those are a win in my mind. With so many excellent games out there with motivational music and great voice acting, they didn't hit the mark here. It's one of those things where it might be fine for a week or two - but after months it can start to wear on you.Of course, it's easy enough to hit MUTE and put on your own music on your iPod :).I have probably every fitness game that's out on the Wii and absolutely I think the system is great for staying in shape. I love dancing with Just Dance 3, for example. So what it comes down to in the end is which game connects with activity YOU like to do. If you adore dancing and hate boxing, this probably isn't a good match. If you hate dancing and adore boxing, then this is probably just right! In my case I enjoy both, so I go back and forth depending on what mood I'm in. Both give me a workout that gets my heart pumping, and both engage me in different ways.I'll give this 4/5 stars. I really think they could have done MUCH better on the visuals, the voices, and the music, especially given Ubisoft's team of programmers and resources. And I think they could have incorporated some matches and other functionality, vs having it just be training.I purchased this game with my own funds in order to do this review.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2012"}

At 14 hours and only 50% done I think you will get your money's worth out of this game. If you like stealth, puzzles and finding hidden items this is a game for you. I just want to say that after getting into this game my opinion of Thief has grown more positive.  At first I wasn't too sure but the more I play the better I enjoy it. My original review starts now.Thief is a very unforgiving stealth game. There is no room for mistakes and trying to fight through is nearly impossible. Thief is about patience and timing. Combat is best done in the shadows and from a distance. I enjoy the challenge this game presents to the player. It is full of hidden loot and every environnent needs to be explored fully. The steampunk atmosphere and story are very reminiscent of Dishonored unfortunately. And although the map is large it is broken into tiny sections full of many loadscreens. There is a lot to do in the game though. There are many side quests and the story missions are quite long. Overall it looks good and the mechanics are decent but the slow pace may not appeal to everyone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2014"}

The game was unique and had aspects that was never done before. Now compared to AC2 and Brotherhood, the game is behind. I still think the game deserves a full 5 stars because AC2, Brotherhood, and the next installments wouldn't have existed without this masterpiece and reception.Story: Modern day, you are Desmond Miles, a descendant of the Assassins brotherhood and kidnapped by what is later revealed as the Templars. You are forced to replay the genetic memories of your ancestor, Altair during the 3rd crusades era. As Altair, a master assassin in the brotherhood, you are demoted and forced to start over. You are tasked with killing 9 people to regain your master status. The Templars are looking for a piece of Eden discovered in the memory, which is still being explained in the series. You later learn of a double-cross.Gameplay: 3rd-person action/adventure with open world exploration. You can complete your tasks in any order. Your targets are in Jerusalem, Acre, and Damascus. You have to locate the Brotherhood agent in that city who will provide you with the target. Before attempting the assassination, there are several quests you must perform to learn about your target in order to plot an attempt. This includes eavesdropping, interrogation, pick pocketing, and tasks given by other assassins and informers. Some of the side missions inside each city include climbing towers to a view point to map the city and saving citizens from guards. Other side missions include killing Templars and collecting flags. After each successful assassination, you are given a weapons upgrade. Assassinations are done with your hidden blade. In order to assassinate successfully, you have to have your alert meter low, meaning the guards aren't actively pursuing you. There are several methods to keep a low profile such as blending in with a crowd, sitting on a bench, and walking slow with your head down. Once alerted, guards will pursue you. In order to escape, you can do one of two things. Fight and defeat the guards, or run and hide. You can't be in the guards' line of sight before hiding. You must break the line of sight (indicating yellow on your meter), and then hide by blending in, sitting on a bench, hiding in a haystack, etc.Conclusion: Gameplay is smooth and a bit repetitive but still fun. Controls are easy but you have to make sure you are lined up properly before executing certain actions. I'm glad I own this and I can't wait to complete this series with Revelation and AC3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2011"}

The game has an interesting graphical style to it. The story is somewhat original. The gameplay is different from any other game I've played.The good thing about the game is that you roll around and pick things up.There are two small flaws with the game though. There are 3 levels: house, town, and world. The very first time I played on the house level was disastrous at the end because I became so big that the camera zoomed to outside of the house and I couldn't move around. This means that I had already mastered the level on my first try. Still, town and world are fun. The second problem with the game is the multiplayer.

Ferrari","summary":"Glad I rented it","reviewText":"I rented Borderlands based on my Brother-in-law telling me it was fun.  I am really glad I rented it for 8 bucks instead of buying it for 60.  The game is just okay really.  Nothing groundbreaking or exceptional about it.The environment is like a cartoon version of Fallout 3.  The NPCs you interract with are completely uninterresting and serve no other purpose other than to be a waypoint for your next task which boils down to go collect this many of this item or go kill this many of this enemy/animal and come back.  The aiming is a mess.  Not as bad as \"Turning Point\" mind you, but if my target reticle is red when I pull the trigger I should hit something.  Also, load times are nearly unbearably long.It may seem like I have nothing positive to say about the game, but I give it 3 stars based on it being just that.  An average to above average game that is fun to play.  It's by no means a Halo: Combat Evolved, or Knights of the Old Republic.  By those examples I mean it isn't a \"genre altering or defining\" title.I'll make a prediction here that may or may not come true that will validate my review.  All you folks who love this game now (and I'm not knocking you for that, different strokes and all) will find that come Tuesday 11/10/09 when CODMW2 comes out this game is going to take a back seat for a few weeks if not indeffinately until you realize one day \"hey wait I never actually finished Borderlands\" and pop it back into your X-box or whatever you have.  It's happened to better games with me before.Bottom Line time.  It's good for a rental if you need a distraction until CODMW2 comes out, but if you really need to play a great post-apocolyptic FPS/RPG and have an extra 60 bucks laying around spend it on Fallout 3: GOY edition.*EDIT*  Amazon edited my review as their price is now reduced to 50 dollars.

If you're not familiar with the series, it is a fighting game featuring a bunch of different characters from Nintendo games (and now a couple from other developers).  Each player starts at 0%, which goes up when they take damage.  The higher percentage, the farther they fly when they're hit.  The goal is to do as much damage as you can and knock your opponent off the screen.There are now 35 characters, including new ones like Meta Knight from the \"Kirby\" series, Pit from \"Kid Icarus\", and even Sonic the hedgehog and Solid Snake from \"Metal Gear\".  There are many new stages, new items, and characters can now use a Final Smash that allows them to do an extra strong attack when they break a Smash Ball.This game has wonderful graphics, almost the best, if not the best, on the Wii.  There are also a bunch of new trophies to collect.  (If you didn't know, the trophies are of characters, enemies, and items from different games, with a description of them.)  You can also collect many good songs from different games, too, that appear as CD's.  There are also hundreds of stickers, which can be used to make characters stronger in adventure mode.  There are also a lot of demos of old games you can play, though only for a very short time.The very best thing they've added to the game is an adventure mode called Subspace Emissary.  This is a side scrolling game that has a lot of levels with lots of enemies to fight, secrets to find, and a story with lots of cut scenes.  Even without finding all the secrets, this can last you a good 11 or 12 hours, which is pretty good considering it's pretty much a game within a game.This game is a lot of fun and gives you many hours of things to do, and if you like \"Super Smash Bros.\", you'll like this.

He departed China with 20 ships and over 600 passengers but when he reached his destination in Persia, only one ship and 18 passengers survived. He never stated what happened to the missing people or ships. You meet up with a former friend, Harry Flynn and old girlfriend Chloe Frazer. They have a job proposal for you to steal an oil lamp from an Istanbul museum. The lamp is rumored to have a map that leads to the lost treasures of Marco Polo. Once they acquire the lamp, the map is found inside that shows that the missing fleet of Marco Polo was transporting the Cintamani stone from the mythical city of Shambhala (Shangri-La) but was caught in a tsunami. Flynn double-crosses Drake and Drake ends up being caught by guards and thrown into prison. Chloe calls upon Drake's old partner Sully to help secure his release from jail. From this point, Drake sets off after Flynn, eventually running into Elena Fisher (the hot reporter from Uncharted 1). The story continues in various locations, eventually ending up in the center of Shambhala at the mythical tree of life.Gameplay: The characters from the first game return along with some new ones. Same gameplay as the first, sort of a Tomb Raider meets 3rd-person shooter/beat 'em up. Elena from the first game is hot, and the new chick (Chloe) in this game is hot, and who doesn't love two chicks fighting over a guy? You fight through waves of bad guys during your hunt for Flynn through various locations and levels including the museum in Istanbul, Borneo, a temple in Nepal, a train chase, a Tibetan village, Shambhala, etc.) Some mythical creatures are thrown in along with the bad guys. you get the same type of weapons including grenades, assault rifles, pistols, and close combat fighting.Conclusion: Controls are easy, good solid gameplay, excellent graphics, a truly great sequel to the original. I can't wait for Uncharted 3. If you loved Uncharted, then you will love Uncharted 2. Very well written story and very believable to some extent.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2011"}

(Nunchuk not included.)","reviewerName":"bulletstopper \"bulletstopper\"","summary":"Fun to be had here","reviewText":"My kids had to have this game, and I admit, I was a little apprehensive.  Then I figured that with the included controller, we would only be paying 8 bucks for the game.  It's worth every bit of that.  That really doesn't sound much like an endorsement, but all in all the package as a whole is pretty good.  The Ping Pong is super boring.  I haven't figured out how hitting that ball back and forth could be fun.  On Wiisports, Tennis, just works, but here, it's really more like a minigame off of Warioware.  The Duckhunt inspired, target game is really really good.  I loved that.  And the Combatlike, Tank, game is great.  There are some other gems that round out the selections.  All in all, there is some great fun to be had.  I figured that there would be a dog here or there, thankfully they are the exception and not the rule.  If you are looking for a new controller, and want to get something a little extra with it, you can't miss with Wiiplay.  I have noticed that the more people you have playing with you, the better the game gets.  Definately a party game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2007"}
