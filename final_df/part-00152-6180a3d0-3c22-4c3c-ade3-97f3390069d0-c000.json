It is utterly visually stunning, but aside from that, it's a total bore to play.I know, you're thinking \"But it's ROCKSTAR games! They made those awesome GTA games I love so much!\" - Let me clear this up: not everything Rockstar makes is a gem.  Not everything they make plays like GTA.  It may LOOK like it should, but that doesn't mean it does or will.This game looks AMAZING: the people's faces and the environment is easily the most-detailed to date.  BUT: You can't do SQUAT.  Oh look at that amazingly huge city!  Wouldn't it be nice to explore it?  Sure - go explore.  But just don't touch or open or interact or DO anything.  All you can do, is stick to the \"Script\" - you go here, look around in a confined area, talk to some people, that's it.  Repeat that over and over.  It's boring.All you do - well, 90% of what you do, is sit and ask people questions and try to determine if they're lying or not.  It LOOKS cool, but the novelty wears off quickly.  It also doesn't matter in the least if you choose right or wrong during the interviews (you can choose if someone is telling the truth, if you have \"doubt\", or if they are lying): You just continue on with the game.  Next interview.  It's shamefully dull.There are some minor chase scenes or action bits - but too far and few if you ask me.  The fact that this game is so gorgeous but that you can actually DO so little is mind-numbingly annoying.Not to mention - this game is THREE (3) discs!!!  Have you ever heard of that before?  I haven't had to switch discs on something since my old Commodore 128 days!!  (Yeah we had the 128, not the 64).---Please, do yourself a favor and PASS on this game.  I'm glad I bought this cheap and used or else I'd be more upset than I am already!!!---* UPDATE * : I'm giving this 1 star.  It deserves it.  I stopped playing.

I found the DS version to be just as fun - and far more portable!You get both the classic racetracks plus a few new ones. You get a variety of kart sizes and styles. Go for the small, super fast kart, or maybe opt for the larger, heavier one. It all depends on your gameplay style.In addition to the fun single player games, the DS wi-fi maeks it very easy to play online with up to 8 players! If you thought Mario Kart was fun zipping around against AI, you should try it against a few of your friends.If you want a bit of thinking, there are a variety of missions that you can take on. You can gather coins, try to beat time limits, and so on.I really appreciated that they didn't \"touch screen\" this to death. A lot of games brought to the DS go insane with touch screen features which make the game much harder to play. With Mario Kart, they use the lower screen for map information, which is really useful if you need it, but is nicely out of the way if you don't. It's the best of both worlds.What's really great about this game is that all ages love it. It's a game that grandparents can play with their grandkids for hours and hours and really have fun doing it.Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2006"}

Knisely","summary":"Don't read day 1 reviews","reviewText":"I have a sneaking suspicion that most of the negative reviews fall into 3 categories.1. &#34;No hard drive?!&#34;  Yes, it says on the cover that a hard drive is required, but this is a fairly new thing to check for.  So in their defense, it is a legitimate gripe to give a negative review to a game that can't be played or even returned for a refund.2. &#34;Server problems&#34;  Yes, it seems unfathomable that after a beta and an engine and system almost identical to BF3, that they would still, even today, have numerous server problems.  All servers are still showing 0/20, and Quick Match put me in about 4 empty servers in a row.  Thankfully, and I guess hopefully, this should resolve itself in time.3.  &#34;It's no different than BF3&#34;.  This is probably the more overused and tired complaint against games like BF3.  The success of titles like Halo and COD, and now BF, are due at least in part, to not reinventing the game with every subsequent release.  It would be difficult to maintain any semblance of a committed community if every game was completely different than the last.  So while gripe #1 and #2 are somewhat legitimate, they are not strikes against the game itself.  And gripe #3 is basically the illegitimate complaint of an insatiable audience that expects every release to blow their minds.Now, on to my review of the game.PROS:MultiplayerMost of the good things from BF3 have returned with respect to the experience once you're in the game.  So if you liked BF3 mutiplayer you should enjoy this.  No need to spend a bunch of time praising the things we all enjoy about BF...  Good weapons, good vehicles, great maps, and always a pretty unique and expansive experience.CONS:Some of these are almost unimaginable, but alas...- No ability to squad up before playing.-- I mean, seriously?  How could this possibly be a feature that was removed?  A squad based game with objective based multiplayer, but I can't squad up with my buddies before finding a game?  I'm at a loss for words at how monumentally stupid this is.- A community of selfish non-communicative players-- Yes, part of this game's problem, and this was my biggest gripe with BF3, is the community.  It is a game that sells itself as a more robust and team oriented shooter.  And yet, it suffers from community problems, in my opinion, far worse than COD.  Nobody talks, nobody goes for the objectives.  I'm always incredibly surprised when I get in a squad that works together and talks together.  This problem is exacerbated by the fact that you can't squad up beforehand.- Counter intuitive customization-- There is no way to customize your classes unless you are in a game or the test range.  The test range is a cool added feature, but why not let me customize my stuff in the My Solider section like in BF3?  And, once you get into the customization, it is incredibly backwards and difficult to navigate.I haven't played the campaign yet, but my closing thought is this.  Most of the problems, glitches, server issues, and even the lack of squad up prior to joining a server are probably due in large part to DICE and EA focusing on the next-gen version of the game.  It could also be due to the cinematic focus of the game.  Environment changes, buildings falling, etc. all these things take development time and focus away from simple issues like play-ability and the player experience.  In any case, a game praised by IGN for &#34;Putting Call of Duty: Ghosts to shame&#34; seems plagued with amateurish problems that don't belong in an epic big release like BF4.  The only reason it gets 3/5 stars is because enough of the good things from BF3 have come over to sustain the overall experience and the maps are really cool.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00006599O","description":"Turok: Evolutionis a prequel that takes us back to the origins of the Turok lineage. In the beginning of the game, we see our hero, Tal'Set, fighting nemesis Captain Tobias Bruckner in 1886 Texas. During the battle, a rift between their world and the Lost Lands opens and Tal'Set is sucked into it.Features and enhancements to this new installment in the Turok franchise include the groundbreaking Squad Dynamics System (SDS) for realistic enemy and allied squad AI, and an entirely new game engine built to take full advantage of the next-generation hardware platforms. All-new weapons including Variable Payload Cruise Missiles, Gravity Disrupter Beams, and the Swarm Bore--each with unique traits and damage. Flight sequences now enable players to soar through the skies on a winged pteranodon, and scripted event sequences bring the world to life with stunning detail.Turok: Evolutionfeatures 32 types of prehistoric and indigenous life rendered with frightening realism. The game is full of destructible objects and environments: shoot down trees over your enemies and collapse massive rock spires onto dinosaurs. The environments consist of lush, living jungles. Plants move as dinosaurs brush against them while trees sway in the wind. The game also includes stealth- and action-based gameplay directed by context-sensitive, mission-based sequences. Great care was also taken with the multiplayer modes, which were developed by a dedicated team of designers, programmers, and artists.","reviewerName":"Nick Schwartz","summary":"Worth a Rental","reviewText":"Turok Evolution is the perfect game for a five-night rental.  While it is far from the best the first-person shooter genre has to offer, it kept me coming back for more over the course of the five days I had it.The control is much improved over the old Nintendo 64 versions.  The setup makes sense, and the aiming is no longer overly responsive, and is far less frustrating.  The graphics, while not jaw-dropping, are still very impressive nonetheless, and the annoying fog from the Nintendo 64 days is virtually non-existent.  Levels now incorporate stealth, and flying, as well as a number of new and impressive weapons.Overall, it is worth a rental, especially for fans of the series, because this is probably the best installment thus far.  At a reasonable price it would probably be worth a purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2003"}

In my view, this is one of the best aspects of the game because, at first, you're pretty much of a sitting duck in the crappy plane and weaponry you start out with; but then when you've kicked butt to the point that you have a greater wealth of choices in aircraft capability it starts getting as if you really are investing something in your choice and might actually go with a less 'capable' plane because of some particular aspect of a mission only that one is good for--outfly or out dogfight, better strategy or just sheer adrenaline, ....Some of the planes are too manueverable, too fast, no good in tight spaces or no good at low altitude runs.  No one superplane is good for even one third of the missions.  This is basically what keeps playing the same missions over and over interesting and fresh, because as you try to accomplish the same mission in various planes you find there are drastically different advantages / disadvantages and that it influences how you go about the mission.This game makes you use your head to succeed.One thing I wish the Ace Combat series would come out with--I've only played Ace Combat 4 actually--is flight school.

I mean, shooting held-up soldiers in various extremities was fun, but after shooting them in 3 places, they just dropped dead! Where's the fun in that?Manhunt is one of the most ... what I can describe best as &quot;messed-up&quot; games I've ever played - and I don't just mean the gore factor. It's a dark, twisted horror b/snuff-movie of a game that had me hooked from the first level. At your arsenal, you have all sorts of weapons and non-weapons - plastic bags, knives, glass shards, and my favorite - piano wires - all very useful in making your prey sorry they were ever born. Your opponents go from tattooed hoods that shout obscenities to a torso with a bloody mush where the head used to be. All my favorite MG aspects are there - the sneaking, the sneaking-up, the shooting - with the best ever twist - surprise executions.That's right - you can go toe-to-toe in a stab/gun fight with your opponent - or just sneak up behind them and slit their torso/throat/crotch (with a scythe, nonetheless!), or just chop/blow their heads off, and use their remaining body parts to distract future opponents!Once a thug is pushing up daisies, why not throw him in the middle of the road, and use him as bait for some of his less intelligent buddies? Cut-off heads are always useful too - just throw them some distance to attract attention!The dank, smelly, ruined mess that is Carcer City fits this game like a glove - it really does make Liberty City look like the Garden of Eden. The environment, as well as the random ramblings of the insane do a great job at setting just the right mood - especially if you play the game at night.Manhunt is not a game for children, and it's not marketed as such. The type of material in this game can make even the most veteran game player wince - the amount of gore is plentiful, and the subject matter itself requires a fairly warped mind to be fully appreciated (chase and kill a grown man in a rabbit suit). I must say, however, that Rockstar North have outdone themselves again - I can't compare Manhunt to, say, the Grand Theft Auto series (kings of their own realm), but I'll go so far as to say that this is the best game I've seen since Vice City. And by the way, if you know your GTA3 trivia, you can probably guess one of the chief actors in the Shakespearean trainwreck of a play that is Manhunt.Thank you, Rockstar North, for consistently pushing the envelope.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2003"}

Ever dreamed of flying over the city streets in search of crime? Ever think about what you'd call yourself if you were a hero?Here's your chance to live your dreams.A little over a year ago, NC Soft released City of Heroes. The premise is simple: Paragon City fell to an alien invasion of the Rikti years ago. The city's heroes fought valiantly, with most dying in defense of their beloved home. Now the world needs a new generation of heroes, and that's where you come in. For the first time ever in an MMOPG, you can create the superhero of your dreams and fight crime. The possibilities of how you do this are huge.NC Soft is to be commended. They weren't afraid to think big, and with this game, everything is big. You start out by choosing a server to host your hero (there are 11 to choose from). Next you choose what type of hero you want to be. Each type has its strengths and weaknesses. You can be a blaster, with the ability to take down foes from long range. Maybe you want to be a scrapper and unleash your inner Wolverine. How about a controller, able to manipulate the minds of your enemies? Or become a Tanker and show the Hulk how it's supposed to be done. Finally, you could be a Defender, keeping your team healed during missions. There are two other choices (Warshade and Peacebringer), but you don't get to choose them until you have a character at level 50. Some hero types are better suited for solo missions, while some are almost helpless without a team. Hey, just create one of each and try everything.Then you get creative. You can choose practically any type of hero you want. Male or female, human or robot, tall or short, muscular or skinny...the list goes on and on. Design your own costume, and you've got hundreds of ways to do that. Capes don't become available until you reach level 20, and some incredible aura effects are open to you when you hit level 30 (burning eyes, glowing body, etc). You have to complete a mission for each, but they're worth it.After designing your hero, you're off to Paragon City to fight crime. As you defeat more enemies, you gain more XP points, which helps you reach higher levels. With each even level, you gain a new power. With each odd level, you gain two slots you use to enhance your current powers.There are so many fun things to do in Paragon. You can just hunt baddies and beat them up all day long, or you can go on missions with a team (or solo), or join a task force if you've got a lot of time on your hands. NC Soft continues to add things to the program, meaning you never know what's waiting for you when you log on. For Halloween, they unleashed giant monsters and smaller ones on the city. Earlier this year, huge, nasty snow creatures menaced the town. And most recently, they've opened the arenas. In an arena, you can pit yourself, your team, or your supergroup (think The Avengers or The JLA) against other players.The key to this game is finding good teammates and friends. When you join a supergroup, you have an ongoing batch of fellow heroes to call on at a moment's notice. If you join a team, you guys just stay together as long as you'd like and then everyone goes their separate ways. Bad guys are labeled with their level, so you can tell ahead of time if this is going to be a hard battle or a walk in the park.The question presents itself: Can I be ? Well, possibly-but not for long. NC Soft was careful to avoid anything resembling DC or Marvel superhero logos or insignias, and major costume designs (you can't be a web-covered guy, for instance), but there are some creative folks out there. On any given day you might see a Green Lantern, Flash, or Batman clone (and if you play for more than an hour, you're almost guaranteed to run into someone's idea of a Wolverine. He's got to be the most copied character in Paragon). But for the most part, the fun comes from seeing how different the heroes are. And thanks to legal pressure from Marvel, NC Soft has started policing things a little more. Create an obvious knockoff of a well-known character and you might just log in one day to see it changed and renamed \"GenericHero1234\". You get the chance to redesign him/her without losing your experience points, but keep your ideas fresh and original just to be safe.The graphics in this game are intense, and everything looks great. Just be warned, you'll have to have a video card that supports 3D graphics or it won't work properly.Now with the release of Issue 5 just around the corner, new villains will be released, and they'll be adding two new types of powers: archery and trick arrows (think Green Arrow), and Sonic powers (think Banshee or Black Canary). And later this year they'll be releasing \"City of Villains\", for those on the flip side of the coin.The ongoing price of this game is very reasonable compared to \"Everquest\" and \"The Matrix Online\". The price also includes a subscription to the \"City of Heroes\" comic book. Recently, the comic was picked up by Top Cow Publishers, and the story and artwork have become a lot more professional. From the first few issues I've seen, it looks ready to stand on its own with the big boys.With Marvel and DC both announcing plans to create their own similar MMORPG games, City of Heroes still stands out. Marvel has already said you won't get to play their characters, so I don't know how they plan to draw people away from this game to their own unless they're discounting the price dramatically.If you're looking to lose yourself in an incredible world of heroes and villains, come to Paragon City.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2005"}

{"product_name":"B001IK1BJ0","reviewerName":"Shannon B Davis \"Nepenthe\"","summary":"well-done RPG","reviewText":"A Bioware production through and through, Dragon Age conjures nostalgic memories of Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights.  It also shares some similarities with Lord of the Rings, a somwhat derivative fantastical plot about a dark evil threatening the land.  But we fantasy lovers do not mind playing the same story over and over again, nor do we mind always choosing between Dwarf and Elf, Rogue and Warrior.  These themes are the bread and butter of roleplaying games, video or otherwise.  I will state that I am a huge fan of CRPGS and have played most of the major rpgs on the Xbox 360 and on other platforms.  I prefer western rpgs over japanese rpgs.  So, for me, Dragon Age was a long anticipated game and I'm really enjoying it so far!The game allows the player to customize their character, choosing from three races and three classes.  Each combination has a limited choice of backgrounds, the first chapter of your story (taking about 2 hours to play through) - that changes the rest of the game.  This introduction also changes how you interact with others throughout the game.  So far I have seen the intro for female human warrior as a noble, and for elf mage - and they were very different, without giving anything away.  As the human warrior, I have gotten further into the main game and the fact that I am female has come up numerous times.  Although the game claims that men and women are pretty much equal, it does not go unnoticed that I'm a woman warrior, not resigning myself to embroidery.  It isn't such a big deal to be female for the Elf Mage so far.The interface is fairly complex, more typical of a PC game.  I prefer the simplicity ofJade Empire.  Perhaps this is why some reviewers have said that the game is better for PC.  It is still enjoyable on XBOX, but has a learning curve.Mass EffectandFallout 3both had a more \"fun\" combat interface.Combat is not difficult, on the Normal setting. So far I have been playing mainly in real time, not really using strategy or tactics yet.  I would have to spend some time reading the manual to further understand tactics, but the difficulty is not such that it has been required as yet.The world is complex.  Magic must be contained and is controlled by a religious authority, the Chantry.  One king rules over a freedom-loving and sometimes fractious nobles and landowners, and the society reminds me much of medieval Iceland.  In the south, wild, untamed lands contain barbarians - and the dark horde of the Blight, which now threatens to invade the civilized lands to the north.  The dialogue, as in all Bioware games, is excellent, with a sense of humor.  The conversation is clever, and contains adult themes (not to say it's inappropriate for children).The graphics are pretty good. They are somewhat better thanThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Game of the Year Edition, but have a similar \"feel\".  The font choices, the layout of the detail screens, are all very similar to Oblivion.  It doesn't come close to the beauty of award-winningAssassin's Creed.  One of my friends who has poor eyesight complained that the fonts were too small to read, and on some screens, like Options - they are extremely small.  However, ALL of the dialogue is voiced, so that helps.  The graphics are the only reason I didn't give this the full five stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00DC7O77A","description":"","reviewerName":"David Girod","summary":"Fun...But Frustrating","reviewText":"I've really enjoyed playing several games with my kids on the Wii U, from the &#34;Disney Infinity&#34; to the &#34;Super Mario&#34; to this new &#34;Donkey Kong Country&#34;, we've spent hours playing together.&#34;Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze&#34; starts as Donkey Kong and family find their island under attack and put into a deep freeze. Donkey Kong, with the help of Diddie, Dixie and Cranky, must island hop back to the frozen fortress and retake their home from a variety of icy villains.Like the previous entries in this series, it's all about team work and adding to Donkey Kong's abilities by having him partner up with Dixie, Diddie and Cranky, to overcome the baddies. The gameplay is a definate throw-back to the original titles in this series, and the game style featured in &#34;Donkey Kong Country Returns&#34; has been dropped. So if you are looking for an open world 3D experience, you won't like this title.The graphics are fantastic, the music is fun, the bad guys are new and fun.With that said, &#34;Tropical Freeze&#34; is a very, very tough game to play. The gameplay, while fun, is very difficult. My daughter has just about given up playing the game simply because it is so tough to beat. The boss battles go on forever!For instance there is one level where you have to beat three monkeys who team up to swing hammers at you and toss bombs. The first stage is avoiding the mallet swinging monkeys, and rolling into the one not swinging the hammer. Once you do this twice, it knocks one of the monkeys away, so you're down to facing two. The next stage has the two remaining monkeys dropping down and rolling after you, you have to jump over the rolling monkeys, wait until they sit up and then roll into them to knock them away. The next stage has those two monkey throwing bombs at you. Bombs made out of barbs and bombs made out of melons. You have to avoid the barb bombs, as touching them or being too close will make you lose a life. Once the melon bombs are tossed out you can pick those up and throw them back , once you blow up one of the monkeys, the last monkey remaining climbs back to the top of the screen....and then re-creates two more monkeys out of ice, so you're back at square one. The next stage has the two ice monkeys grabbing the feet of the 3rd monkey and swinging down tossing bombs you have to avoid. Once they throw a melon bomb, you pick it up and toss it at the monkey chain and blow it up. Now all three monkeys climb back up and begin swinging on vines trying to hit you with mallets or hitting you with a bomb. Now you have to roll into the last non-ice monkey, when he's not swinging a hammer, and take him out. Finally you've beaten the boss for this level. And this is like the 2nd or 3rd level boss, not the final boss. And each level's boss is as difficult if not moreso?!?!And as you play each level, you'll notice there are levels within each world that don't open up, I'm still trying to figure out how to open these levels to play. I'm guessing that I have to replay levels and Beat the Clock, or either collect all of the hidden puzzle pieces or make sure KONG is spelled out on each level....I'm not sure???So to wrap up, yes the game is fun, but if you are picking this up for kids, you may want to reconsider as it's a tough game to beat.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2014"}

Over 120 plus hours of total combined gameplay, numerous additions and enhancements, and critically-acclaimed game and art design.","reviewerName":"CJ","summary":"Amazing and slightly different RPG","reviewText":"I come from the perspective that this is the first Persona or SHin Megami Tensei game that I have ever looked at, intrigued by previous reviews for Persona 3 and the $30 starting price.  I will say that I have gotten my money's worth of entertainment in the last month.In brief, without giving too much of the plot away, Persona 3 is about a group of Japanese high school students with special powers who are out to save the world from monsters.  Yeah, that sounds really cheesy, but I found myself sucked into the complexity of the plot.  Characters that originally seemed one dimensional, due to the length of the game, become very multidimensional (and there are a good number of characters, both to command and to charm).  You advance in the game basically two ways - Sim dating/friendship style interactions, and dungeon (in this case, tower) crawling.  Although the game is fairly linear, there is quite a bit of strategy in maxing your social interactions and creating new personas (the things you summon to fight, which apparently there are 170-ish of).FES is the current updated edition of the game, which includes the answer, a straight dungeon crawl coda to the end of the main part, the journey.Here are some things to keep in mind:This game is loooooooong, and there are not a lot of shortcuts that I can see.  Long as approximately 70 hours of game time, possibly 100, depending on what you do.  And this game is not donkey kong- it is not satisfying in little time bites.  So it's a time commitment, be aware before you start and get hooked.The whole using the fake gun to your head to summon the personas some may find objectionable, though you basically do not notice it after a few hours of playing.In addition, many of the personas use religious imagery from most of the major world religions, living and dead - so some may find that objectionable as well.I will have to say that the sex and violence is kept to a minimum in general - there is teen dating and suggestive dialogue, but not overt teen sex, and minimum blood and gore.It is a combo of dungeon crawl and heavy social RPG interaction, so if you don't like that...I personally loved this game, and look forward to the US release of persona 4.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Sylph StarWind \"sylphstarwind35\"","summary":"High requirements, but worth it","reviewText":"I'm not a Star Wars fanatic, but I really like KotOR. The thing that got me was the interation with other characters. You can talk to each person in your party to learn about their background (although some will say less than others), and just about anyone you see outside of battle. They each have interesting things to say. They may tell you how helpful Jedis are or tell you that you suck, or give you information on how to complete your quest. It's alot of fun.The combat isn't really exciting, though. You click on what kind of attack, ability or item you want to use and wait until the enemy dies. You can use many different types of weapons and armor, ranging from blaster pistols to light sabres to headsets that increase your stats. There are items to heal and to boost your stats in battle. There isn't an extreme amount of fighting when you're in the field, so it doesn't get too annoying like it can in some rpgs. But there is enough to make money or find items, and to keep you occupied.The only real problem I had with this game is that it doesn't run well. My computer's decent, since my dad is a computer technician and he keeps it in good shape, but the game still has a lot of slowdown when it gets hot. During the summer, if you don't have air conditioning, you may not be able to play at all. Now its fall and its fairly cool, but I can only play the game for about an hour before I have to stop. So, unless you have a really souped-up computer, you probably won't be able to play for very long before giving your computer a break. If you have a crappy computer that freezes up a lot or moves really slow, this game will be of no use except maybe as a paperweight or gift.Final verdict: Definitely buy if you have a great computer, but if you have just an alright computer, expect slowdowns.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2005"}

This is because Turn 10 has actively listened and responded to fan feedback, and has made changes.These changes include:- Adjusted career winnings.- Reduced car prices.- Increased \"Forza Rewards\" money.- Road America track download for FREE.- Long Beach Circuit track download for FREE.As a result of these changes, the game required much less grinding to build up your garage.  Buying tokens now feels like an optional shortcut instead of a necessity.  It feels less like the \"free-to-play\" business model that it did before.I'd like to give the game a 5 star rating, but the microtransaction monetization scheme is still present... even if it much less obnoxious now.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Turn 10 and Microsoft are charging $60 - $80 for Forza 5, depending on the version you get. However, despite the full price tag, they are treating this like a \"free-to-play\" game. As it aggressively pushes for microtransactions.You might hear a lot of players say \"Oh, you don't need to buy tokens!\" And they're right, you don't NEED to, but the game has been designed from the ground up to milk extra cash out of you.Proof:- The storefront is gone- The auction house is gone- Gifting cars to your friends is gone- Sharing your cars in a Club is gone- Earning cars as level rewards is gone- Affinity bonuses don't get you free parts anymore- You can't sell cars back for money anymore- You can't sell parts back for money anymoreThe end result of these changes is this:Getting new cars is a LOT more time consuming. Earning enough money to buy and upgrade multiple exotic cars requires excessive grinding... or buying tokens of course.Forza 5 throws out so many of the things that made previous Forza titles great so that they can milk their loyal customers as much as possible. It's like a slap in the face to someone like me, who has been loyal to the franchise for eight whole years.Skip this entry. With any luck Forza 6 will avoid these downfalls.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2013"}

When this game was originally released in the U.S. as \"Final Fantasy 2\" on the Super Nintendo; this genre barely existed stateside.  But those of us that picked it up had our tastes in video games -if not in all entertainment- permanently changed after playing FF4.  There were two kinds of people I showed this to back in the day: people who couldn't even comprehend a game where instead of controlling a character directly you issued them orders and watched them carry them out, and people who became instant hardcore RPG fanatics.  Type B: this one's for you.FF for the NES was a cute little adventure where you handpicked your party out of a small array of cookie-cutter archetypes and set about hunting treasure and fighting monsters and such.  It was a start.  That and \"Dragon Quest\" were the only games in town at that time.  Then, along with the SNES came this mindblower.  Having been skipped over by two Japanese sequels, Americans were treated to their first video game that was on par with other mediums of entertainment.  Mario could jump around, Sonic was fast, Samus had cool weapons, and Link had massive worlds to explore, but did you ever really FEEL for them?  Did you ever have to watch them die for reals, knowing that you wouldn't be playing as them again in this playthrough?  this game made me feel loss, excitement, accomplishment, and a genuine NEED to see what was going to happen next.  FF4 has a story that could compete with the best novels, great art designs, wonderful characters with unique abilities and personalities, epic powers at your control, and what I still consider to be the finest score ever in a video game.  This one changed video games from a childhood diversion to a lifelong obsession for me.  I've spent nearly two decades wishing for a direct sequel (FF: Mystic Quest\" was a HUGE letdown), a cartoon series, a movie, something/anything to pay homage to the video game that deserves it most.Final Fantasy VIIon Playstation was the first huge hit of the series and the one that gets most of the love from younger fans, but it lacks the flawless execution, focus, and originality of 4.  Nonetheless, it's popularity earned it a cool CGmovieand spin-offs.  But my prayers have been answered in a way with this ground-up remake of my favorite game of all time. I bought theNintendo DSjust for this game.  Now let's just hope it catches on this time around and gets the FF7-like treatment it deserves.I showed the opening animation to a woman at work and her jaw dropped.  \"SO COOL!\" were her exact words.  That barely begins to describe how much I enjoyed seeing my favorite characters realized in 3D glory after some 17 years of picturing it in my head.  FF4 has been faithfully reproduced in it's entirety with completely redone graphics, new character models, actual cutscenes, some voice-acting, and many more new additions that only make this classic better.  You can now raise and train your very own monster who can be conjured to battle in your summoner's place using techniques learned from your party.  The training consists of several mini-games that use the DS's stylus in interesting ways.  You can even draw the monster's face however you like.  Very cool. The dual-screens make using the mini-map extremely handy.  The augment capability adds some customization to the game and assures that even when you say goodbye to your favorite characters, some of their talents can still help you out.  The only way I could be happier with what I got was if it had been given the full-on next-gen treatment on the Xbox 360.  And yes, I would buy this game yet again to experience that.  It is that good.  A hundred bloatedLost Odysseys,Legend of Dragoons, andBlue Dragons as well as subsequent Final Fantasy games have tried and failed to recapture the one-of-a-kind character work, epic story, unforgettable score, and perfect pacing of this almost-forgotten relic of a genre that is still going strong in part because of the groundwork laid by this title. This is the most fun one can have with one tiny game cartridge.I spend most of my free time watching genre films, reading comic books and novels, playing story-based video games, and watching any outstanding television series out there, so rest assured that I know a great story when I see one regardless of the medium.  Playing through FF4 -even for the dozenth time- gives me the same feeling I get when watching theStar Wars Trilogyor readingThe Lord of the Rings.  Great fiction is great fiction and this is the kind of game, dated as it is, that reminds me why I'm still doing this at age 30.  If you've ever enjoyed a role-playing game in any way, shape, or form don't hesitate to pick this up.  It is the best Japanese RPG of all time and it accomplishes that without mindblowing graphics, dozens of lengthy cutscenes, or even decent voice-acting.  Buy it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2008"}

Players will face never-before-seen enemies that make Nemesis seem like a kitten. You'll be wishing for the usual Resident Evil zombies!","summary":"A PHENOMENAL AND MIND-BLOWING GAME  10 OUT OF 10","reviewText":"This game is the main reason I purchased a PS2, and I'm damn well glad I purchased the system for this thrilling masterpiece. Before RE4, I struggled with the past numbered entries. I enjoyed them, but they were frustrating as hell. RE1: Why are there so many locked doors?! Why can't fight off a zombie when he tries to eat me? Ugh... SO MUCH CRAP TO FIND! RE2: Who the hell builds a police station like this?! There shouldn't be this many locked doors and passageways in a police station! Damn you lickers and zombie dogs! RE3: Ahhh!! GO AWAY NEMESIS, GO AWAY! Run Jill Valentine run, you slow b**ch! DAMMIT! I'm dead from a f***ing rocket launcher... FANTASTIC. But RE4 completely rebuilt the franchise from scratch and gave it new life. If you didn't play RE4 solely for the fact you had many troubles with the past entries. Worry not, this entry has eased the difficulty by miles and it's paced far better than the past entries. This means those long moments of nothing are pretty much eliminated.WHAT THE GAME IS: This game is a mix between survival-horror and third-person shooter, though it feels more like a third-person shooter. Leon Kennedy (The guy from RE2 and he had a brief role in Gaiden) has been sent on a mission to rescue the President's kidnapped daughter; Ashley Graham; in an obscure part of what appears to be Spain. During his mission there, the villagers attack and attempt to kill Leon. It also turns out these villagers are infected with something. These guys aren't the rotting corpses you remember from the old RE games, these guys are meaner and more deadly. He must find the source of the outbreak and look for the secrets surrounding a mysterious organization that operates there.GRAPHICS: Who said PS2 visuals are bad? This game looks great and even looks better than some of my Xbox 360 games. Overall, the visuals look great and really know how to milk the PS2 hardware for what it's worth.MUSIC: There is little present most of the time, something I miss from the old RE games because there was always some kind of creepy music in the background. It comes up at key moments but is sadly absent most of the time.SOUND: Shooting, dying screams, chainsaws, and exploding heads.GAMEPLAY: This game introduced the over-the-shoulder camera which works quite well when shooting. The shooting mechanics work well and use the same button layout as the past RE games (R1 to aim, X to fire). You  get to shoot lots of zombies, and ammo is far more plentiful than most likely all the other RE games combined. There is a great selection of weapons to buy or find like guns, rocket launchers, and grenades. There are a bunch of other items to buy in the game as well. This game also has an upgrades system in which for a fee of some sort you can have your weapons upgraded to enlarge fire power and how much ammo a weapon can carry. But be warned the item compression system from the old RE games is still here, meaning you can only carry a certain number of items. This item compression system is at least far better than the old ones, allowing you to carry a large number of items before running out of room. You can also buy another box if you find your current one too small. This game also has a lot more health recovering items as well. You can even shoot fish and eat them along with chicken eggs to heal you. This game's main focus; shooting; works very well and the targeting system is among the most reliable I've ever used in a game. This game has great boss battles that are carefully balanced and heart-racing. This game relies on some timed button press scenes like the boulder scene or dodging some other large object that's coming at you. One part of the game I found rather surprising was the escort mission. All gamers pretty much hate escort missions because the person you're protecting is annoying and you'd rather see them die than let them live because it would just be a burden. Not in this game. The escort mission wasn't tedious or frustrating at all, and it was quite nice for a change to protect someone who isn't annoying as hell. Puzzles are cleverly devised in this game, and can be real brain-teasers at times and they weren't boring to solve. Every part of the gameplay is polished to perfection and can't really think of a way to knock off points against it. GO BUY THIS GAME NOW.OVERALL: This game is a superb and phenomenal and the gameplay is perfect.THE GOOD: Perfect gameplay, lots of guns, lots of zombies, lots of ammo, lots of health recovery, great story, an escort mission that doesn't suck, it's thrilling, good boss battles, great characters, and great graphics.THE BAD: The lack of music is the only thing that's wrong with this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2008"}

Gibbs \"Horror Soundtrack Collector\"","summary":"Survival Horror at it's Best","reviewText":"Very few games can top resident Evil 4 overall.  I've played God of War and the Prince of Persia games (which both rated high), but as far as I'm concerned, they can't even touch resident Evil 4.  Unlike it's other 'Relative Evil's', Resident Evil 4 focuses much more on action and progression versus finding the key and backtracking.  The enemies are quick and challenging and as Leon Kennedy or Ada Wong, you need SOCOM skills to pull off the kills.  No annoying camera angels to contend with anymore either.  When you aim, the behind the back view goes into over-the-shoulder, making much more sense in the long run.  The atmosphere is extremely engaging, thanks to a great musical score and excellent graphical environments.  It stands up well against it's brother, 'Silent Hill' in terms of atmosphere, where the other 'Evil's' soon became redundant.  The game itself is HUGE.  I kept thinking that soon I'd reach the end and that would be it, but no, the environments just kept expanding.  Even when I did beat it, I got to play a whole new game as Ada Wong and than other game with Ada and even more the Mercenaries Game (which included good old HUNK from Resident Evil 2).  So, as far as replay and game length, this game takes the cake for action games.  As far as the graphics go, I was blown away by how smooth enemies move and how smart the AI is.  No more of the boring zombies that simply lunge at you.  Now, you're up against fast moving angry possessed folks with pitch-forks and chainsaws that chase you down and hunt you from all angles.  It's great that you can actually use the environments to your advantage by pushing crates in front of doors to block enemies, etc.  What's even better is when the enemies start hacking away at the door, trying even harder to kill you, versus waiting outside until you're ready for them.  There's some standard puzzle-fare and a few 'find-the-key, go-back-and-unlock', but the action takes over and forces the game along at a perfect pace.  the character acting is far better than any other game in the series and the story works well to draw away from the Umbrella storyline (which was getting tired anyways).  All in all, this is the BEST Resident Evil Game and as far as I'm concerned, the BEST Playstation 2 game.  If you don't own it (maybe because you hate the Resident Evil series or Survival Horror in general), buy it and try it.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2007"}

{"product_name":"B003QX4F7C","description":"","reviewerName":"James Skemp \"JamesRSkemp.com\"","summary":"A masterpiece","reviewText":"I picked up Yakuza 4 without having played any of the previous iterations of the game. After looking at reviews online I thought it might have a pretty good story, and provide a good amount of entertainment.After playing a little under an hour of the game I was quite impressed what I had seen. Used copies of Yakuza 3 were available locally, at a pretty decent price, so I decided to pick up a copy of Yakuza 3 and play that first (since Yakuza 1 and 2 were a little harder to find, and more importantly on the PlayStation 2).You can find my review of Yakuza 3 elsewhere, but I'll save you the effort - I found it to be one of the best games I've played.So when I started Yakuza 4 back up I had high expectations for this.Instead of sticking with one character in this game, like you do in the others of the series, you play through the stories of 4 different characters who then combine forces for a final act. Each characters has their own distinctive style which can honestly be a little frustrating at first (especially with the second character, when you get thrust in a very difficult battle early on). However, their styles match their character, and by the time you finish their distinct acts you'll be in complete control of their style. Otherwise combat hasn't changed much. For newcomers, it's mostly short range attacks. You can get away with button 'mashing' for many of the average battles, but bosses may require actual planning and thought. With a few exceptions, I found combat to be easier in this iteration than in Yakuza 3.The game mostly takes place in one area, but instead of being restricted to the streets like last time you can now travel on the roofs and in underground areas. For the most part, however, you'll find yourself on the streets and use the others for either main or sub-story activities. Chase segments have also decreased, and I believe become easier. There was one of these that kicked my butt in Yakuza 3, but this time my three losses were from one particuarly difficult battle (already mentioned above).The story is the best part of the game, and one might argue it surpasses the story of Yakuza 3. As the story goes on each of the four characters acts through certain events, with each coming to the realization at the end that their paths are tied together.A number of characters from previous iterations make an appearance, but even if you haven't played the previous games you'll still have an understanding of what's going on (you just might not feel the full impact).With combat being what it is, and the story a masterpiece the game already has 5 of 5 stars from me. However, for the U.S. release of Yakuza 4 they kept in many of the mini-games that were in the original release. While the virtual fighter makes an appearance again, and is a pain in the butt this time, I found the other mini-games (that I played) to be rather fun.By the time I finished the main story, and finishing almost all the sub-stories I could, as well as all the fighter trainings (optional) and one of the hostess trainings (optional) I was at 59 hours and 43 minutes, with 51.13% completion. While playing Yakuza 3 I had decided that I liked the game and story so much that I would pick up the first two in the series. Once I've finished some of the other games in my catalog I'll definitely be going through Yakuza 1 and 2, and then re-playing 3 and 4.For a near-perfect story and all-around great experience, I give Yakuza 4 5 of 5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8M4","description":"It's often argued that Nintendo makes the best video games in the world,  but one thing the company isn't known for is scary games. If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster. While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C. Persia. And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Chris Peters","summary":"An intelligent, sophisticated twist on survival horror","reviewText":"Lucky Nintendo fans - first the remake of Resident Evil, and now Eternal Darkness, yet another horror game in which you are killing zombies in a mansion with limited ammo.  The similarities stop there, though, as ED manages to blow the doors off of everything Resident Evil established.The plot is ED's shinest feature - you literally watch a supernatural cult develop through 2000 years of history.  Large, Lovecraftian creatures who think nothing of swallowing small planets like Earth are battling each other across the universe and we just happen to be at the wrong place.  You'll explore a few special temples at various points in history, as a Roman legionare, or Gulf-war firefighter, or Franciscan monk, or Indiana Jones-type archeologist, etc.  It's fascinating to visit the same places 200 years later and watch how they change, or how different people in history react to supernatural oddities.Gamewise, ED is pretty standard for survival horror - exploration, puzzles, and combat.  The exploration is fun because of the above mentioned time-traveling element, and the puzzles are rather easy, with hardly a stumper in the enter game.  Combat is perhaps the best, with the right combination of stratgey and action.  Monsters are pretty easy to pick off by themselves, but it takes time, and they often come at you in waves, forcing you to think fast and direct your attacks effectively.  Magic is very fun, in that you can explore and experiment, learning new spells before the game is ready to give them to you.The much touted \"insanty effects\" are very interesting, and certainly add to the spine-crawling horror of the game, but I felt it was too easy to avoid them.  I don't want to give everything away, but as you encounter strange monsters your sanity level drops, and eventually the walls start bleeding, statues and paints turn their heads to look at you, and even weirder things happen, including effects that jump out at you the player, and not just the character.Graphically, I can't say ED is \"perfect\".  It can be pretty ugly at times, especially the character models, and the animation is kinda weird.All signs say this game doesn't play well a second time through - you know the story, and the magic system completely.  There is only 1 real secret in the game, and 1 alternate ending.  Maybe it might be interesting to re-experience the very complicated plot a second time, but certainly not a third.  Still, I consider ED a worthy purchase, my first for the Gamecube, in fact.  Buy it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00000J9J9","description":"One of the best things about the Game Boy Color is that it's  basically an original Nintendo Entertainment System that can fit in  your pocket. What this means for gamers is that many of the great games  for the classic system are being ported to the Game Boy Color, giving  us a chance to re-play (or in some cases discover) the best game titles  from the '80s.Nintendo's ownSuper Mario Bros. Deluxeis among the first of  these conversions, and it certainly remains one of the best. Actually,  calling this game a conversion really doesn't do it justice. This  version actually contains more levels than the original game, including  the entire Japanese version and a slew of extras (such as a two-player  mode).The controls in this game are easy to grasp--even for novice gamers.  All Mario can do is jump (and shoot fireballs with the right power- ups), but it is amazing to see how much gameplay can be squeezed from  these simple actions when the controls work in direct harmony with a  player's thoughts. The only element of this game that could have been  better is that the Game Boy Color's screen isn't quite large enough to  show the entire layout of the original game screen, so players may  occasionally need to press up and down on the control pad to see some  offscreen action. While this can be distracting, it ultimately has  minimal impact on gameplay. If you are looking for the quintessential  side-scrolling platform game, you can't do much better thanSuper  Mario Bros.

Normally, this idea would have sold millions of copies but Nintendo went an extra mile or two. Super Mario Bros Deluxe is the original game plus extra content that equaled a must buy title. If you were a Game Boy Color owner, you immediately bought this and played the hell out of it.The PROS: You get the original Super Mario Bros, a You Vs. Boo mode where you race against a ghost through some of the game stages, a 2 player VS mode where you and another place race against each other (connected via the cable link), a Challenge mode where for each stage you have to find 5 red coins, a Yoshi egg and beat the high score. There's also extra content like the ability to print images from the GB printer (sold separately), a program that tells you where the Yoshi eggs are hidden, a built in calendar and a fortune teller program.The CONS: None.It's a must own title back then and a real treat to play nowadays if you still have the Game Boy Color or Game Boy Advance SP.

Free Play Mode which allowsyou to change the Difficulty, Number of Lives,and at what score amount you gain extra lives.You CANNOT Gain TROPHIES IN THIS MODE!for trophy Hunting, you must play Score Attack modewhich seems to be a more difficult Arcade Port of the gamewith only a few lives and fewer continues.so the trophies will be a challenge to aquire.again it's an excellent game bundleand at under a buck a game it's a decent dealif you can overlook a few control issuesand a few Horrible sound issues. 3 stars for the overall package 4 stars for Fun!Graphics: Nicely redone in HD 5 starsGameplay: same as it was in the 80's and 90's 4 starsControls: mostly good though a few stinkers (looking at you APB, Marble Madness)4 starsSound: Mostly what you's expect with a few Horrible titles (Smash TV, Wizard of Wor)1 starFun: these games are still fun to me. others may not feel the same 4 starsOverall: a solid collection of 31 retro games marred by sound issues.too bad it's a fantastic HD package and they did a fantastc job on the graphics,I only wish they had done as good a job on the sound as they did on the graphics.these are very old school games that you have to know to love.so if you know these games, you know what you're getting into. 3 stars overall.---Full Game list:---------------720 - Skateboard through the neighborhood and earn a ticket to compete at the big skate park.A.P.B. - Drive around as Officer Bob to ticket and arrest law-breakers and meet your ticket quota.Arch Rivals - Outscore your opponent in this classic basketball game.Bubbles - Maneuver around dirty objects as a soapy bubble trying to clean a kitchen sink.Championship Sprint - Race to the finish in this classic speed game.Tournament Cyberball 2072 - Control a robotic football team and score touchdowns with exploding Cyberballs and short-circuiting robo-offenders.Defender - Defend a far-off planet from waves of invading aliens while protecting the human race in this shooting game.Defender II - Deliver humans to safety through the teleporting gateway, all while defending against attacking alien forces.Gauntlet - Venture through dungeons as one of four fantasy-based characters to vanquish enemies and collect treasures and potions.Gauntlet II - Reprise the role of your favorite fictional characters to embark on a new quest with all new levels, enemies and challenges.Joust - Mount a flying ostrich and fly through levels by toppling groups of buzzard-riding knights.Joust 2 - Transform your ostrich into a powerful Pegasus to defend against the enemy buzzard-riding knights.Marble Madness - Glide a marble through mazes and obstacles in this platform game.Pit-Fighter - Be the last man standing to punch, kick, and beat your opponent in the fighting pit.Rampage - Take control of gigantic mutants to demolish the city and terrorize civilization.Rampart - Defend your castles by attacking oncoming forces and repairing any damage done to your territory.Robotron 2084 - Battle waves of robots to protect the last human family from annihilation.Root Beer Tapper - Serve up mugs of root beer to thirsty patrons before the time runs out.Satan's Hollow - Build a bridge across a lava river and destroy gargoyles in order to reach the final level, a battle against Satan himself.Sinistar - Blast planets and collect crystals to create deadly Sinibombs to defeat the evil Sinistar.Smash TV - Advance through a vicious game show by playing for cash, keys, and the ultimate prize, your life.Spy Hunter - Hunt down enemy agents while cruising for weapons and protecting civilians.Spy Hunter II - Gather weapons and set-up obstacles to destroy enemy agents in a 3D view.Super Off Road - Race around the tracks in an off-road truck to beat the other contenders.Super Sprint - Speed around twisty tracks and advance through the circuit to be named the racing champion.Toobin' - Splash through rivers in an innertube to collect treasures and race against opponents.Total Carnage - Play as the Doomsday Squad to rescue hostages and capture the evil dictatorVindicators Part II - Power up to fill your depleting fuel tank and escape from oncoming attacks.Wizard of Wor - Navigate through monster-filled dungeons to defeat the creatures within.Xenophobe - Wander around a space station and shoot killer aliens before the time runs out.Xybots - Dash through the 3D maze to fight Xybot robots bent on human destruction.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2012"}

The game struck me as unique. The emphasis was not on shooting but on sneaking. Even at that time I was amazed at how much depth was poured into a an 8 bit Ninetendo game. Now seventeen years later Hideo Kojima brings his vision to the Playstation 2 in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. And the result is an absolute masterpiece!!The year is 1964. The Cold War is at it's zenith. And the man known only as Snake is being sent into the jungle to stop an American defector known as The Boss from unleashing nuclear armgeddon.Hideo Kojima has proven time and time again why he's the premiere developer in the video game industry. When it seems as though the Metal Gear series has run the gamut in terms of gameplay, Kojima brings a new aspect into the fray; survival! In Snake Eater, you must not only collect food to eat, but also heal wounds and treat injuries to stay alive. This new twist on the stealth/action genre gives the player a feeling that the mission is more arduous and draining than in previous games. Consuming meal packs is not enough this time. It's eat or be eaten (in some cases hungry crocodiles will eat you). During the game you will happen upon plants and animals that you can use for food or medicine. Snakes can be eaten, but later on some snakes are venomous and can inflict injury on you. A lesson I learned the hard way.As with every Metal Gear game, the focus is on stealth. In Snake Eater you not only need to pay attention to the enemy but also your surroundings. In the right hand corner there is a \"Camo Index\". Certain camoflauge patterns will blend in better with your surroundings. The same goes for different face paints you apply.The graphics are superb. In a time when people are saying that the Playstation 2 is looking dated, it's amazing that a developer like Hideo Kojima can squeeze some outstanding graphics out of the machine. The game takes place mostley in natural environments. But it never looks fake or blocky. Grass sways, animals wander about and mud makes audible \"squishes\". It's a feast for the eyes as well as the ears. This game is loaded with ambient sound to make you feel as if you're in the jungle. Only one problem with the sound; the codec messages from the Major are prone to audio dropouts occasionally. Probably a result of the new graphics engine.The controls are very tight and responsive. A few new features have been added. The Close Quarter Combat system is a highly effective way of disarming enemys. Although it is a bit difficult to use at times, there are a variety of ways to take down an enemy. You can also interrogate enemies now. The best thing is to play around with the CQC system to get used to it.Alot has been made of the camera angles. The camera is in a set position so to speak. Why is this? Ever since the very first Metal Gear game the camera has been essentially the same. It gives the series continuity. Throughout the game there are things that fans of the series will recognize from the first game. Things like questions marks over the enemies heads. Z's rising out of sleeping soliders, etc. As well as one of my favorites, the return of the cardboard box!!The storyline is what you've come to expect from a Metal Gear game. Only this time, you are not playing as Solid Snake. You are playing as \"Snake\", or as he is more commonly referred to by fans of the series, Big Boss. But because Solid Snake is a clone of Big Boss, you are in a sense playing as Solid Snake throughout the game. The story may seem a bit over the top, but it's these moments that make it memorable. The characters are well developed, though some may complain about the length of the cutscenes. I, however, found the cutscenes added to the tension and the atmosphere. Something that other stealth games (are you listening Ubi Soft!!) could desperatley use.There are some bonus modes in Snake Eater. There is a Briefing Viewer, Camoflauge Download, and a mini-game called Snake vs. Monkey where Solid Snake tracks down the monkeys from Ape Escape in a time attack game. Sounds stupid, but it's loads of fun and breaks up the brooding and heaviness that the main game gets into.This is without a doubt one of the greatest games I've ever played. If you're not playing it right now then run out and get a copy right now!! There are so many things right about this game that it's hard to find anything \"wrong\". This is one for the ages!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2004"}
{"product_name":"B001NX4DUQ","reviewerName":"TheTruthHurts","summary":"The best game of 2010...","reviewText":"Sure, it's only February, but I've owned enough games over the development cycle of the XBOX 360 (currently at 51) to know that a). the critical consensus (in this case a 73 (according to a certain site that everyone seems to regard as the bottom line in gaming)) simply cannot be trusted or taken at face value, b). if it doesn't grab your attention immediately, and maintain it throughout at least the majority of its duration, it is NOT A GOOD GAME, and c). hype and reputation do not, a solid sequel, necessarily make.  I've seen what's been released so far this year, and what's on the calendar, and I'm not at all impressed (e.g. the utterly uninspired 88-rated \"Bioshock 2\" (just finished it...and would still be sleeping if not for this 50,000 volt stunner) or the 96-rated sequel to the highly overrated, should-have-been-the-masterpiece-it-was-unjustly-labeled-as \"Mass Effect;\" more on these later).More importantly, I simply feel compelled to make myself the first reviewer (of which I am aware) on Amazon on record as stating that this is, and will almost certainly remain, the best game of 2010 (unless my assumption that \"God of War 3\" won't be as spectacular, fresh, and exciting as critics will have you believe is incorrect).Why, might you ask, am I able to award \"Dante's Inferno\" such high praise? You guessed it...\"God of War\" is not now, and has never been, a part of my life.  Thus, I am not blinded by some kind of insatiable urge to demonize and degrade \"Dante\" as if it exists merely as some sort of bastardization of that title...it is what it is...and on its own two legs, it is simply brilliant.  You can (and inevitably will) draw your own comparisons.  More on this discussion later...Let's begin. Almost immediately, we're treated to the graphic premise of the story (I couldn't care less how well it adheres to Dante's tale (much like the brilliant \"Beowulf,\" (the film, that is), this is entertainment, folks, lest ye forget...)); an enchanting damsel has been heartlessly murdered, and Dante is left to atone for his sins to reclaim her soul from the depths of Hell. Simple enough...but the way in which the (literal) geniuses at Visceral have *presented* this *makes you care about Dante's plight*.  It is, in a word, visceral.  The damsel is classically beautiful (understated, as per the era), and seeing her disrobed, as it were, and stolen away, concerned me. In fact, it made me angry. Visceral instantly made me want to spend the next seven hours of my life rescuing this soul (imagine that...\"save me, Big Daddy\"...\"sorry, the game is a tedious chore unless I harvest you\"), and thus I proceeded to do so. Folks, please disregard the reviews you've heard that would have you believe that \"well, it starts out exciting enough, but quickly loses steam.\" Wrong, and completely unfounded. The game starts with panache (when you claim the beast, you will surely agree...I'm still smiling), and it only gets better as it goes... all the way until the grand finale. Lust...Anger...Violence...Treachery...awesome, all of them, as is each and every adjacent circle, including the much-maligned \"Fraud\" (folks...should Dante not be tested?).  I refuse to spoil any of it for you...but if you think Cleopatra's demise is the best part of the game, and the epitome of awesomeness (as I immediately did), you haven't even started the journey yet.Graphically, the game is utterly fantastic...I'm still wondering how they did it. 60 FPS @ 720p without a hitch (indicating an unlocked framerate far higher than 60)...proof positive that Visceral is leading this generation's technological front (most unlike the staircased 600p \"Modern Warfare\" and its sequel that look utterly fantastic only on a 480i CRT).  The art design is simply brilliant...never has this been done before in a game with such vivid imagination, attention to detail, and shock-value. It's simply incredible. The bosses in this game are bar-none the most impressive that I've ever seen (sorry, \"Lost Planet\"). When you get to \"Anger,\" you'll know what I'm talking about. Awesome (and I don't mean \"awesome, dude;\" I mean utterly awe-inspiring (especially at 60FPS))! Audially, the game is phenomenal; the score (created by the same man who did \"Bioshock\"'s great music) is on par with anything you've experienced via film, and the voice acting is wholly inspired and (most importantly) genuine...imagine that. Not for one second did I feel like I was listening to someone who just finished co-starring in the failed pilot of \"Airwolf 2010\" and needed a hot meal (\"Metal Gear Solid 2\" comes to mind first).\"Keep it simple, stupid.\" What a concept. You guessed it...this applies to \"Dante's Inferno's\" playability and upgrade system. I cannot describe how bored I am with the concept of having to learn six thousand variations (of the same moves) to play a game successfully (\"Ninja Gaiden II,\" etc.). It is possible to beat this game using only the X and Y buttons, and it's great fun doing so. However, there IS INDEED a leveling system that allows you to gain additional strength and \"moves,\" that keep the game interesting (when your jaw isn't on the floor while staring at the incredible artistry behind the characters). It is not for one second boring, or plain. Yes, we've seen it before...but THANK GOD for that.Finally, let's revert to the prior discussion of \"God of War;\" in no way is this game a copy of anything any more than any other game is a copy of the game that developed the style (\"God of War\" was a copy of many precedents, folks...it just \"did things better,\" according to critics (hmm...sounds familiar)). There is nothing \"deeper\" than the circles of Hell, or am I mistaken?  In any regard, I will not compare the two titles; however, I will simply state that every platformer that has been produced since \"Super Mario Brothers\" is a \"copy;\" every FPS produced since \"Duck Hunt\" (well...maybe \"Wolfenstein\" or \"Doom\") is a \"copy,\" and every other game you've ever played had, at some level, elements COMPLETELY \"BORROWED\" from their precedents. Have you played \"Modern Warfare\" lately? Was it brand new, completely original, and utterly fresh? NO. It was simply done MUCH BETTER than its precedents. Huh. Apparently, though, \"Dante's Inferno\" isn't welcome to this same kind of comparison, regardless of the fact that it's been made MUCH BETTER than its predecessors (that also borrowed heavily from their predecessors). Why? As far as I can deduce, because \"God of War III\" is coming out (I hear) in a month or so. So, OBVIOUSLY, Visceral's only aim was to produce a near-clone to steal some of the spotlight from what they figured would be the PS3's best-selling title of the year shortly before its release, because they knew it couldn't compete with the game it \"completely ripped off.\" Hilarious. 360 owners alone will inevitably provide the sales needed for the sequel, as they all ultimately discover how incredible, fresh, and original this game truly is and agree that a summation of 73 is simply blasphemous considering the level of impact and polish contained within...Visceral, I'd like to personally thank you for absolving the sins of uninspired developers and absent-minded copycats who've produced little but disingenuous *true* carbon-copies of \"hack and slash\"-ers (the laughably overrated \"Bayonetta,\" \"Devil May Cry 4 ,\" etc...the list is endless)...I'd all but lost  faith in the genre...and then came this little (relatively) devil to completely reinvigorate my interest and reinstall my hope in mankind (well, at least in devs. that are truly interested in making fresh, exciting, INVOLVING games for folks to partake in).For God's sake (and Beatrice's), play this game for what it is; a brilliantly well-made, inspired, exciting, enthralling, engaging action-adventure through some of the absolute coolest and most original level designs anyone has ever created, all garnished with some of the most graphic imagery you're ever likely to see in an M-rated title (this is not a game for the kiddies, though inevitably (if not already) this will naturally be the game they're passing around to their friends in school). You really owe it to yourself...and to Visceral...to witness their brilliance first-hand I simply CANNOT WAIT for Dead Space 2, and am even more excited to see \"Dante's Inferno 2\" in 2012 (believe it). Visceral is quickly on their way to becoming my dev. of choice...and the competition had best run like h_ll!Edit (3/4/10):  if you've voted \"unhelpful,\" and didn't comment or write a review of your own, then I feel that it's safe to assume that you didn't actually read the review. Show the courage of Dante and prove yourselves!Edit (1/18/11): Yup...I was right. :)  Now where the hell is the PC port, EA?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2010"}

One of my little plans in life was to win every offline Final Fantasy game, so far from I to VII it is done...Because I don't have as many available time as before, it was very difficult for me to continue with the VIII, which I started for PSOne and left after a mission to some island, that was many years ago...But!I decided to start from the newest and go back to VIII again, for this endeavor I purchased a PS3 with my brothers and Final Fantasy XIII... WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN VII and XIII? This isn't Final Fantasy!!! VIII was becoming boring and without excitement, but I thought that was corrected in IX and onwards.... How mistaken I was.Final Fantasy XIII is boring, the \"linear\" argument is real, the characters aren't likable, the story doesn't have any appeal. They should have named this game something like \"Interactive Movie in a Setting that Looks like Pandora from Avatar with 3D characters that have 1D personality\", thats one dimension less than the SNES 2D characters, who felt as real people you may have wished to know in some games.One thing I can positively comment on are the graphics, they are gorgeous and look like places I have visited. The music is repetitive... I left the game at the chapter when Sazh and Vanille are together and the weather changes from rainy to sunny.My objective of playing all the offline Final Fantasy games is now pointless.

But after (finally!) getting a taste of this, I couldn't resist.  From what I've experienced firsthand, the long-awaited 'sequel' to the game that started the fighting genre is pretty much everything we expected, and more-or-less of what we wanted.Inspired by a Japanese painting style, the '2.5D' graphics make SFIV a living canvas.  From Ryu's scorching fireball to the fighters' new Focus Attacks to their cinematic Ultra Moves, it's obvious that the franchise has come a long way since the long-forgotten EX series.  Speaking of special moves and combos, a joystick is still recommended if you ever want to execute them.  At least you can configure the controls to, for example, pull off 3-button attacks with one attack button.It's great to see the 12 original World Warriors strut their stuff again.  And throwing 4 new characters, 6 fighters from \"Street Fighter Alpha,\" 2 secret characters, and a new boss sets the stage for new challenges and old rivalries.  So the only real gripe with SFIV is the $60 price tag.This review will be revised with further testing of the product.This game is rated T for Teen: Alcohol Reference, Suggestive Themes, Violence.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2009"}

It's attractive.The screen is absolutely fantastic.  I bought a DS for myself and gave it to the kids because it just felt too \"old tech.\"  I don't care about touch screens.  The PSP screen is the best I've seen in handheld gaming.The bad:The PSP loses its first (of five) stars for AWFUL CONTROLS.  I appreciate their inclusion of the thumbstick--but to exclude the other?  And the location of the thumbstick?  I STILL haven't figured out how to hold it comfortably (in my fingertips?  Pressed against my palms?).

{"product_name":"B001C6GVI6","reviewerName":"GintaxAlvissforever","summary":"One of the greatest RPG Made","reviewText":"Everyone has pretty much said what I wanted to say about the game. Taking after Persona 3, Persona 4 builds on what Persona 3 did wrong such as the battle system.The dungeon is different now. Instead of going into Tartarus and climbing the top at your own pace, you have a limited number of time to save a party member in the TV world before their dead body shows up and if that's the case, you can rewind things a week back to fix things. This is a huge improvement from Persona 3 where once you're stuck, you're stuck and have to bare with it. This makes the game very lenient so you don't have to start all over again.Out of all the Persona games, this is probably the most optimistic of all the games where what the protagonists do is for nothing. Something is actually accomplished in this game and its possible to get a happy ending unlike the other games where a \"happy ending\" is stretching it.This game fleshes out all the characters to its fullest and touches on subjects other games wouldn't bother touching. It's a joke in the fandom that almost everyone in the cast except Rise is ambiguously gay/lesbian/bi/transexual.Which is probably my only problem. If the game touched on Kanji's sexuality, I wish there would have been a gay option. Yes you can date all the girls in the game without repercussion unlike Persona 3 where the other girls got jealous if you hung out with another girl to complete the social link (which is why you complete the entire social link first), but I feel like it was a waste to have the MC have options to hit on Yosuke but then not doing anything about it in the end and just leaving them at \"best friends\" when it's obvious that if you pick all the Yosuke options it seems to be more than that. It's the only gripe I have that was made worse on the Vita version (more scenes to be with Yosuke but things still weren't done) but it's not enough to ruin the game experience or lower my rating. Just me being a fangirl of the MC/Yosuke pairing. What can I say?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00005NZ1G","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play. However you choose to hero your way throughHalo: Combat Evolved, the action should break in your new Xbox in explosive style.","reviewerName":"Jonathan","summary":"A standard-setter","reviewText":"Much like the N64's Goldeneye and the PC's Half-Life and Rainbow Six, Halo is one of those yardstick first-person shooters that people will be comparing games to for years to come.That's not to say the game is without its faults. Some levels are very repetitive - gee, I've only been down this corridor or one that looks just like it FIFTEEN TIMES! - and the allied AI is downright frustrating sometimes. There are some other minor things that get on my nerves, but they're relatively minor.That said, Halo is one of my favorite shooters ever. Enemy AI is top-notch, especially on the harder difficulties, and the outdoor environments are amazing, particularly the beach level and the snow valley. The weapons are varied and, amazingly, are all useful. Also, the plot, while a little on the thin side, is engaging. I especially love Cortana, the wisecracking AI that accompanies the player throughout the game (truly, the little voice inside your head).If you're looking for a very good first-person shooter, Halo is a great choice.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2008"}

{"product_name":"B001E8VB3C","reviewerName":"trashcanman","summary":"'Bout time.","reviewText":"Batman and video games haven't really gotten along in the past.  Considering the action hero nature of the character this seems a bit strange, but as a whole games based on big-name established franchises tend to spend all of their time,energy, and capitol acquiring the rights and likenesses and very little on actually making the thing worth playing.  Well all that has changed.  Not only is \"Batman: Arkham Asylum\" a worthy video game portrayal of the Dark Knights exploits that is a long time coming, but it may seriously be the best and darkest version of the character yet outside of comics.  It's practically a playable horror film and it does justice to nearly every iteration to come before it.  Any batfans out there with a current-gen gaming system NEED to buy this game.  It's got everything anyone with any knowledge of Batman could ask for.First, story.  Written byBatman - The Animated Seriesmastermind Paul Dini and utilizing the three most memorable voices of that show means an automatic A+.  Focusing on Arkham Asylum means that there is plenty of room for cameos and references to Batman's bottomless rogue's gallery, but the story itself focuses on a few primary characters which was a very wise decision.  No Robin or Nightwing or Batgirls or Spoiler or Huntress following you around (though ex-Batgirl Oracle provides verbal support) and the supervillains you face are relatively few, but extremely memorable.  That way there's room for more in the sequel and nobody who made the game gets shrifted here.  Mostly, this is a classic Batman vs. Joker tale.  you can't go wrong there.  Now, one would imagine that the game would be fairly dark, but then end result makes The Dark Knight look tame.  Killer Croc is an absolute horror, Scarecrow-induced hallucinations are amazingly creepy, and the general extreme psychosis of the villains is literally jarring at times.  You can find and aquire a series of taped interviews with each villain and let's just say you don't want to get into pathological killer Victor Zsasz's head.  Riddler offers his shrink a new answer to a classic riddle that involves dismembering a baby in one of his sessions.  Yikes.  This game is DARK.Gameplay is a lot of fun, taking the best aspects of several other games and combining them to make you able to do everything The Caped Crusader does.  Combat is somewhat similar toFable IIin feel while the platforming and exploring is a lot likeAssassin's Creed.  Then there is a stealth aspect that is reminiscent of the Playstation classicTenchu: Stealth Assassinsand the more modernSplinter Cellseries'.  The Riddler supplies you with a ton of secrets to uncover including a series of visual puzzles where you have to visually \"photograph\" an object or feature for which he gives you a clue.  This alone will keep you playing for hours and hours at a time trying to unlock all of the goodies.  To help you find what you're looking for, you've got a \"detective mode\" on your cowl that allows you to see important objects more clearly.  Batman can sneak, dash, dodge, use his grappling line, glide, climb, blow stuff up, and even hang villains upside down from a perch. And oh yes, there will be gadgets. And all that's before the fight.  Plenty of options as to how to handle any given situation.  Boss battles are all very different and seldom even have much to do with combat.  It's usually something like finding a way to eliminate Zsasz before he kills his hostage, being pursued by Croc on a plank bridge in the sewers, or sneaking around a giant Scarecrow while under the influence of his gas.  It's a pass or fail thing, and you do not want Killer Croc biting you in the face so do be careful.Visually, \"Arkham Asylum\" is everything it should be and more.  Having enjoyed The Caped Crusader extensively in every possible medium I can honestly that I have never seen a better set of character models.  Every character is just striking in appearance.  Scarecrow has a Freddy Krueger-ish makeover, Croc is plain horrifying, Harley Quinn looks much less playful and much more psychotic, Poison Ivy is otherworldy, and Joker is a perfect amalgamation of all of the different versions of him over the years.  It's really amazing what they did with him here.  And did I mention this game is DARK?  The landscapes are fantastic, and the asylum looks like the inmates have indeed taken it over with gnawed rats, dead guards, and general disarray giving the place character.  Little details are there to treat hardcore batfans such as a poster for Penguin's Iceberg Lounge or cells and objects strewn about that obviously belong to foes like Calendar Man or Bane (nice teddy bear).  Shoot, they never even bothered clearing out Harley's desk!  You can't beat the look and attention to detail of this game.  I was actually looking for a way to free an inmate that was impersonating another character at one point.  Made me feel dumb when he started laughing at me as I snapped him to solve a riddle and reveal his identity.  Great stuff.Alright, so you plowed through the story and you don't want to spend umpteen hours searching for freaking hidden question marks. Want more?  Considering the finite number of enemies to take out, I know I wanted much more action.  Well, that's why we have challenge mode.  The premise is simple: either kick as much tail a humanly possible in pitched combat with a set time limit or take out a number of gunmen without being seen and perforated, depending on the individual level.  Since these were the things I wanted more of in the otherwise nearly-flawless story mode, that makes this feature a godsend.  So with that in mid, there is only one complaint I have about this game other then just wanting more (I'm greedy like that): in order to find all of the things you need to find you wind up spending most of your time using detective vision which doesn't allow you to fully immerse yourself in the killer graphics at all times.  That is all.  I know I'll be tuning in next game; same bat-gameplay, same bat-console.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2009"}

Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"Big, dumb and fun","reviewText":"There is an argument that games can be a truly transformative and liberating artform, a way of transmitting ideas and narratives and developing characters in ways that traditional film and literature cannot hope to match. There is also an argument that, whilst that is true, games should also seek new ways of including as many ludicrous explosions and insane stunts as possible whilst allowing the player to go mental with an Uzi whilst dangling from a helicopter. Just Cause 2 is the ultimate exploration of the latter idea.The setting is the island-nation of Panau, which stretches across a massive 400 square kilometres. For the record, that's thirty times the size of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and twenty-five times the size of Skyrim. It's an absolutely massive environment taking in frozen, snow-blown mountains, burning deserts and lush, tropical jungle, as well as the skyscraper-strewn metropolis of Panau City. Playing as Rico, you can use ground vehicles ranging from tuk-tuks to armoured personnel carriers (via sports cars, bikes and fire engines) as well as a variety of helicopters, boats, jet fighters and airliners. An arsenal of weaponry is available including submachine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, grenades, explosives and Magnum-like hand cannons. Rico has a grappling hook which he can use to grab lifts on passing aircraft or cars (and then hijack them), or ascend to the roofs of buildings quickly. He can also use it as a weapon, pulling enemies off high ledges or - most entertainingly - attaching them to passing vehicles or exploding gas canisters.The game has a central storyline which is worthwhile enough, with a few good gags and a few satirical jabs aimed at American foreign policy, but it's mainly worth playing for the missions, which tend to be more epic and inventive than most of the game. The bulk of the game is spent playing missions for each of the three rebel factions, helping them expand their territory over larger portions of the maps. The faction missions are enjoyable, but tend to be brief and rather easy. Disappointingly, they also don't overlap. In fact, bizarrely, each of the three factions seems completely unaware of the existence of the others, even when their territory meets. The faction missions also just peter out in the end, with no big pay-off or final mission for each faction, which feels like a bit of missed opportunity.Where the game's true appeal lies is in its enormous open world. The game scores everything by how much chaos you cause. The more chaos you cause, the more missions, weapons and vehicles you unlock and more unstable the regime becomes. You cause chaos by completing missions but also destroying government property, such as petrol stations, oil depots and military bases. Sufficiently impressive explosions also add to your chaos score. In short, whilst going absolutely ballistically nuts in, say, a GTA game is a fun diversion, in Just Cause 2 it's part of the core game design. To get to 100% game completion, you need to pretty much destroy every single bit of government property on the map (which, given the map's overwhelming size, will take weeks, if not months) and pick up every single upgrade (since there's literally thousands of them, this will also take a while). To make this more achievable, the game breaks the completion score down by location and settlement, with each settlement having it's own sub-score so you know if you have to do more stuff there or can move on.This is the the core of Just Cause 2's appeal: going crazy and blowing everything up is built into the game design rather than being left as an optional extra, and makes the game more entertaining. Everything else, even the missions, are designed around this idea (so whilst doing a story mission in an enemy base, you may wish to simultaneously level the place and get all the upgrades to put it towards your overall score). This is useful as the main storyline, whilst amusing, is rather brief if you tear right through it.Visually, the game looks astonishing, even three years after release. The draw distances are staggering, the views of the islands are incredible either by day or night (and at night the sight of the lights of villages on the sides of mountains a dozen miles away is particularly evocative) and the attention to detail is mind-blowing. Each island is packed with towns, villages, remote homesteads, ruined temples and other features of interest. You could play this game for months and still never see all there is to see. It's bigger than many MMORPG worlds (Panau is five times the size of the entire planet in World of WarCraft, for example).Unfortunately, where Just Cause 2 does break down is repetition. The game world is enormous, but there is a limit on what you can do. In fact, whilst the game world is far vaster than any GTA game, you're still limited to blowing things up, doing story missions or taking part in races. GTA4's attempts to give you more stuff to do through bowling, mini-games etc may have been fairly naff, but at least it was an attempt to give the player more activities to pursue in its open world (something GTA5 sounds like it will improve on further). It's unlikely that many players will get to 100% completion in Just Cause 2 because to do so would involve attacking dozens and dozens of near-identical military bases, exploring dozens and dozens of near-identical towns and villages and base-jumping around lots of very similar skyscrapers in the city, whilst having to painstakingly explore every nook and cranny to make sure you haven't missed a hidden upgrade crate. The game world is vast, huge and overwhelmingly impressive, but it will eventually get a little stale. This will vary by player, and for me it didn't happen until almost 35 hours in the game and 40% completion (accomplished by completing every faction and storyline mission, destroying almost twenty military bases and generally causing lots of random havoc). Certainly there is more than enough game here for your money, enhanced further on the PC version by both the more lush visuals and the impressive multiplayer mode (added by modders).Just Cause 2 (****) is a big, dumb and amusing game set in possibly the greatest environment ever created for a game. Some might wish for a stronger narrative, or more variance in the missions and locations, but as an open-world sandbox designed for having fun, Just Cause 2 is now the game to beat.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2013"}

Was it worth it?","reviewText":"First of all I wish to thank you, as a reader, for finding my preview helpful in the XBOX and the GameCube review section (You can check it out if you want to) . Now that I got my hands on the game and played it , I must say that Prince Of Persia:Warrior Within has lived up to the expectations, albeit with some difficulty. Let me briefly state why Prince of WW, though a great game on its own,  falls below its predecessor in some aspects.First, the cons. In the preview, I did mention that the environment in Warrior Within would be the exact opposite of Sands of Time (SOT), and it is. But Ubisoft has taken one step further and encompassed nearly the entire game in a perpetual state of bleakness. Right from the onset, the story is grim but gritty. Somewhere deep down, you'd realise this will be an uncomfortable shift of play from the previous version. Sands of Time was an ethereal experience that didn't force you to take the game too seriously. You enjoyed playing it, without actually feeling so. But in WW, you are constantly forced to ask just why the Prince is not the same likeable, naive guy we know. In WW, he appears self-centered, merciless almost paranoid of his safety and wouldn't think twice of striking down anyone so long as it ensures his survival. This really makes you wonder whether to root for him or despise him. But you cannot ignore him. Because POP: WW has far more positive offerings than most other famous sequels in the market.Story:The story is very interesting. 10 yrs down the line, after the events of the first game, the Prince is a self-outcast : having honed his already formidable skills in countless battles to achieve supreme combat mastery. But since the Prince invariably 'cheated' death (or fate, rather) and altered the flow of time, an indestructible incarnation of fate called the \"Dahaka\" is after him to restore order and settle scores once and for all. There is no means to escape it. The Prince must now travel across the treacherous seas and locate the Island of Time, where he must prevent the Empress from creating the Sands of Time, thus forever destroying the effects of SOT and the Dahaka's existence a well. It is paradoxical, no doubt, but the events that move the game forward really pull u into it.Gameplay, Graphics and Sound:What can I say about the gameplay that I haven't already covered in the preview. It is really innovative and fluid. The Prince may be vulnerable, but he has outstanding abilities. This leaner, meaner Prince has received some real makeover in combat. A number of new basic slashing techniques have been added and more specialized moves will follow once you come across new weapons. Ubisoft has put its maximum effort into this area and the result is there to see. Though not as deep as say Ninja Gaiden , the combat is nonetheless engaging. There are a multitude of weapons and all have varying degrees of damage. Furthermore, the Prince has an ability to impale a foe by throwing his secondary weapon. I have absolutely no second opinion regarding gameplay. It is fresh and fun and it is completely different from the first title.As for the graphics, WW stays true to its roots, adding greater texture detail and enhanced character animation. WW has superb soft lighting (or is it bloom lighting?) that is on par, if not better than SOT. The fortress itself is daunting in appearance, but WW has added a new concept to time reversal wherein you can jump to and fro the same locale but in different time periods. So if a room appears decayed and dirty in the present, it would look plush and pristine in the past. The effect is surreal. The XBOX hands down shows better loading and graphical performance. But WW has been coded to perform optimally in any console so you should find yourself enjoying it no matter what u have. Certain locales like the Palace gardens , share the same awe-inspiring feeling as in SOT. The developers thankfully have been faithful to the game's look, but it does have some issues in character's facial modelling and frame rate, but that's all. The in-game FMVs show respectable animation which by default should be, in a game of this scope. All in all, POP:WW is every bit, if not more grand in appearance than its predecessor. Lovely.As for the level design, which was the heart and soul of  SOT, WW has its brilliant moments in spades. The traps are more treacherous and intelligently placed.  Certain Palace levels take your breath away. Also, the basic platforming hasn't changed and the Prince has some new moves like grabbing onto a curtain and split-jumping onto a platform. But for some reason, platforming now appears 'forced' into play rather than being part of the overall experience. This is sad and considerably reduces the overall excitement. It is reasonably enough to say WW took platforming as a means to move from one area to another while the brunt of the time goes to combat.Sound in one word : Fair. Nothing more than that. The ambient sounds are solid, but the score is disappointing.  Some hard rock theme by Godsmack I cant place at all. Be assured that WW will not be known for its soundtrack, though it is dynamic in combat. The score has to grow on you. And to an extent , it does. I find the theme song in the opening menu display to be absoltely superb. Overall, I stand by what I said at the start.The game however is longer and open-ended. The enemies are also much varied than before and they do fight with some AI. And they are definitely a great improvement from SOT. Faster and harder. But once you get to know their tactics, they are quite easy to dispose off. One move whereby you can throw your foe off the cliff, makes things ridiculously simple.  Ultimately, what u get the first time through, is pretty much it.Overall, my review seems to point out more cons than pros. To an extent yes, because Prince of Persia:Warrior Within is like a Ferrari with some dirt spots on the hood. You see the spots first, though it's the fantastic car that you should be looking at. It is more like an abberation than being intentional. But it is still obvious to look at. And that is a bit disconcerting. The Prince has changed a lot and his personality hits you in the guts.  Nevertheless WW is one hell of an achievement. Ubisoft, in just one year, has managed to change the franchise completely and still deliver a kick-ass adventure. The combat and the graphics alone are sufficient to carry it through. Once you sit in the drivers's seat, everything else is just a blur and you wont care what 'spots' it has. I suggest you buy this game, for it does have enjoyable enhancements that would have taken other titles years to implement. The developers have listened to some pertinent suggestions but ignored others. Yet they have undoubtedly treated us to a worthy sequel, rounding of an amazing year in gaming (Halo 2, Half Life 2, Ninja Gaiden , Chronicles of Riddick and the like...). Let us hope the Prince brings us another rendition that will stay true to the beauty and grandeur of Sands of Time and Warrior Within.Have a nice day.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2004"}

Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"A masterpiece of Disney/Square fusion","reviewText":"Admittingly, I had played through this game without playing the original Kingdom Hearts.  It wasn't until I started playing KH1 that I realized JUST HOW GOOD Kingdom Hearts II was in comparison.It shockes me that IGN rated KHII as a 7.6 but gave the original a 9.1  Because KHII exceeds the original in almost every way possible.First of all, do NOT think you need to be a Final Fantasy fan to enjoy this game.  While it's cool to see those characters integrated in, it's not at all necessary.  If you love Disney and action RPG's, you will love this game.The single most frustrating thing with the original Kingdom Hearts was the CAMERA.  Whoever decided in that build to map it to the L2/R2 buttons should have been fired.  KHII fixed this perfectly by mapping it to the R Analog stick, and it just FEELS so natural.The next frustrating thing about KH1 was the Gummi Ship levels, it was just gosh awful.  KHII did a fantastic job and it's almost like a whole other game.  Yes, it's still insanely frustrating to build your own Gummi Ship, but use the Falcon (I like the 2nd blueprint) and you should get through all the routes just fine (it's especially good for clearing the first 2-3 routes on subsequent go arounds).Next, graphics and sound.  If KHI cracked the barrier, KH2 smashed it in every way possible.  Almost all of the Disney characters voices are spot on (and original in some cases).  The actual venues themselves looks great, and color just pops out everywhere in the game.There are a couple minor gripes, which I will list below:- Munny is very hard to come by in most parts of this game.  So be prepared to fight a lot if you want to make things easier for you.- Along the same vein as munny, if you're working to synthsize a lot of things, you're going to be doing a LOT of backtracking through the levels.  But it's not at all necessary to complete the main quest.- Probably the one thing KH1 has over KH2 is a much harder difficulty.  In fact, you pretty much can ignore using Sora's magic for most of this game and just use the X button.  Most bosses end up being fairly easy if you use the combos of the charcters who join your party (Mulan, Auron, etc.).- And yes, it is STILL a pain to design your own Gummi Ship.But overall, this is by far one of the best action RPG's for the PS2, period, and I'm anxious to see what they have planned for KH3 with the next gen systems.If your wife's a Disney fan, or if your kids are, and if you like good action RPG's, you cannot go wrong with this game.  If you are a FF fan, this is a great game for you as well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2009"}

Some people liked the game, but most didn't. When GTA:2 came out, it had very similar reviews: mixed ones. However, when GTA:3 came out for the PS2 about 5 years ago, everything changed. The game got between 8-10 ratings everywhere. ( Mostly 9-10 ) The GTA series had gone full 3D and made for an extremely fun title to play. Vice City also came out about 2 years later, and it also got rave reviews. San Andreas came out not too long ago and got great reviews, too. But now, Rockstar has decided to put GTA on the PSP, and it is a great game. It takes GTA 3, and puts it on a handheld; the WHOLE game.This game is different than GTA 3 because it has an entirely different story. You play as Toni Cipriani who was forced into hiding after killing a \"made man\", but now in LCS you get to take him and make things right. The story line is a pretty good one so far, full of great voice acting.Pros: City looks nearly the same as GTA 3, very similar controls as PS2 versions of the GTA series, unbelievable graphics for a handheld, nice voice acting, great sound and radio stations, awesome!!Cons: When going gast in a vehicle and crashing, game pauses temporarily, Many may have wanted a different city, choppy OCCASIONALLY, graphical blurs, hard missions at beginning of game. ( For instance, you with fists against 5 or more guys with guns. )Graphics: 9.5/10. This is a handheld, Remember that, and the graphics are un..be..li..evable. The game looks just as good ) if not better ) than GTA 3, and it's dandy!Sound: 9/10. Radio stations are back, my personal favorite? Chatterbox. Still a great station with better humor than GTA 3 at times. Voice acting is superb, too. Cars sound great, guns sound great, everything does.Control: 9/10. Easy to get used to for sure. Very similar to GTA's for the PS2... not much more to say.Fun: 9/10. Multiplayer? Haven't played it yet, but I've heard it's \"addicting\" and it's \"hard to stop playing it during class\". You can't swim or clib things like in San Andreas, but there are now motorcycles and stuff in Liberty City Stories, as well as new cars, and of course the new story line.

Featuring detailed environments and complicated new battle mechanisms, this game demands a different kind of perspective than the first-person shooters from the original Halo series. You'll need to uncover the hidden strengths and weaknesses of each unit and play them to your tactical advantage, and that's just the beginning.UNSC: Be Part of a Legendary ConflictThe story opens with UNSC forces retaking the planet Harvest from the Covenant. At your disposal -- should you choose to take command of UNSC forces -- will be everything from a corps of highly-trained Marines to the Warthogs, Scorpions, and Hornets you'll need for air and land attacks. You'll take stock of the map and decide between holding your ground or advancing on enemy strongholds, all while trying to navigate the local terrain and outsmart Covenant forces. And when you need something extra to tip the tide in your favor, UNSC leaders can provide you with the ability to mobilize highly specialized units or call the Spirit of Fire vessel for support from above.Covenant: A Capable, Playable Enemy FactionThat's right, Covenant is playable in this corner of the Halo universe. This alliance of alien species has manipulated advanced technology, firepower, and tactical prowess into a powerful force that is engaged in a Genocidal war against human race, having branded humans as heretics. With the ability to play as these tough, alien fighters, you'll have advanced shield technology, the modular Citadel at the heart of Covenant's colonizing power, and, of course, the iconic Scarab attack vehicle at your disposal, adding a whole new dimension to your strategic warfare. The Scarab is a terrifying military vehicle crafted from heavy mining equipment. And with a mining laser that delivers massive damage across battlefields large and small, turrets for taking on air attacks, and the ability to clamber over any terrain, what's not to love about commanding Scarabs instead of fighting against them?Developed Exclusively for Xbox 360Most console RTS games are adapted from existing PC games, which can make their controls bulky or awkward, butHalo Warshas been developed for Xbox 360 from the ground up. This means the controls are sensitive, intuitive, and easy-to-operate in the midst of battle. And the UI is just as intuitive, so whether you're managing a unit of marines or a deadly machine, you can focus on creating a battle strategy instead of worrying about how to overcome a clumsy controller.No matter which faction you choose to play as, you can test your skills against those of other players in online skirmishes that allow up to six players with the New Xbox Experience through Xbox LIVE.","reviewerName":"Renfield \"Up the Irons\"","summary":"Do not play this game if you are suicidal.","reviewText":"This has seriously gotta be the worst game ever, next to Superman 64!

However, in Skyrim, Bethesda have upped the ante considerably in gameplay and especially in the virtual world they have created.Compared to the previous installment, Skyrim is streamlined in some ways (simpler character advancement, more plain menus, fewer mechanics like repair and so on), but in exchange for these trimmed items, the developers have served up a more detailed, more believable, more varied world to explore, plunder and linger in.  And it's frankly fantastic.Unlike other recent and popular RPG titles (such as The Witcher 2 (an excellent game in its own right) and Dragon Age 2), Skyrim is truly an open-world game.  You can travel where you want, how you want, and do what you want when you want.  The treadmill style leveling from Oblivion is present yet very toned down, and the gameworld is open to be experienced however you like.Finally, the dungeons are simply superb.  The designs are not repetitive, the mechanics are interesting (especially in dungeons with traps and puzzles and the like) and the right balance of fun and challenge seems to have been struck again and again and again.

{"product_name":"B001BX6JUA","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Sequel better than the original","reviewText":"A lot of people were just happy with having only a guitar when \"Guitar Hero 3\" came out but then in came Rock Band and completely blew people away by not only having guitar but being able to sing and drum as well. Once the face of music gaming, seems strange to find Guitar Hero trying to copy Harmonix and release their own \"Rock Band\". It's like trying to copy your neighbor's delicious apple pie recipe only not knowing how to actually make the thing so yours is tasty, but the other is pure sex...in food form. Anyway, in comes Harmonix to deliver \"World Tour\"'s biggest contender, the sequel to Rock Band. With some great song choices, improvements and features as well as past compatibility with the first, Rock Band made not have the name of their rivals but they have arguably a better game.With a music game it all comes down strictly to the song list and to that end, Rock Band 2 succeeds quite well. From Bon Jovi, The Who, AC/DC, Jimmy Eat World, Mastadon, Metallica, Lush, Lacuna Coil and many others, it's hard not to feel jazzed going through the gigs and have a cool song pop up and go \"ooh, I love this one\". That being said there is some rather dubious choices as well with a couple of \"who the hell are these guys?\"-type of bands to song choices that while good, could've had better selection. \"So Whatcha Want\" is rather...boring on one instrument but then you have this one song called \"Rob the Prez-o-Dent\" which is just awful. They sound like a Spinal Tap parody only with the hilarity. The bonus about all this is that the songs from the first game can be shuffled over for a MS point deduction and your DLC will transfer over.The other thing I prefer in Rock Band 2 that World Tour doesn't have is a real sense of audience and interface usage. Be awesome at a song and the audience will actually sing along (which goes amazingly during \"Livin on a Prayer\") and even hum riffs or guitar solos and you really feel like you're onstage...sort of. In World Tour you only have one shot to nail the song and if someone fails, then poof! Booed and knocked off the stage. Here, you can save or be saved. Overdrive is activated by fills where you can do anything whereas in World Tour you have to do it within the song which can be slightly tricky on some of the more faster expert songs.Changed around is the tour mode which is different than the \"play 5 songs and move to next gig\" style of the previous game. Now you can have mystery setlists, themed marathons, playing for extra cash or fans, shoot a music video, do benefit shows, hire staff and the like. This makes it a lot more of a progression than last time. They also added online mode which is also cool though sometimes you run into people who are um, shall we say, less adept at saving and overdrive usage than others. Only thing I wish solo tour had and it's really a small gripe is that your band members keep being replaced. It's like I have this weird rotating cast so one gig I'll have that weird goth freak with the spiky hair for a singer than all of a sudden it's some exercising nerd with glasses and a purple coat? Bah.With drum trainer and fill trainer modes for practice, battle of the bands and challenges, there's plenty to love about Rock Band 2. Does this mean it's a better game than Guitar Hero: World Tour? Well it's really a matter of preference since the instruments are better on World Tour yet the songlist and gameplay is better here so if you want to experience both, better to just buy a World Tour full set and Rock Band 2 separately. However, if you'd rather not have so much stuff from past GH/Rock Band purchases, better to just stick with this one. Your neighbors will hate you for it and that's the whole point, no?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2009"}

It's slightly tedious but generally fun.You are a girl who is turning 14 tomorrow. You've just discovered that your father is alive, after 10 years of living with your aunt Jessica.  There is a LOT of talking involved as you go through your tasks. You take a ship to Blood Edward Island, to meet your father. Of course he's not there to meet you, so you begin your adventure of exploring the island.In no time at all you've met \"D\", a ghost representation of a boy about your age. You two quickly decide you're soulmates, as both of you are looking to find your father and explore your memories.The puzzles are reasonably complex - the game is rated \"teen\" so this game wasn't meant for the little ones. They expect you to have at least a reasonable ability to remember clues and figure out puzzles. That being said, a lot of the puzzles are maddening because it's obvious what you have to do. It's just your CHARACTER that is completely clueless and doesn't get it. You have to click, click, click until she finally gets it. Sometimes you can't even pick up an object that you figure you'll need until you go somewhere else, see the \"destination object\", then trek back to the first object and pick it up then.Another issue I have is that some of the puzzles involve a lot of mindless screen rubbing. In one situation you have to clear a brass sign of rust. That means you have to sit there scrubbing your DS screen repeatedly until all of the rust comes off. There's enough wear and tear on a DS screen (and yes I do have a screen protector on it) to worry about the sensors wearing out, without actively doing something like this to it.Finally, there is a lot of random screen clicking that you have to do to even find things. You look at a sign and you SEE the pieces of it beneath the sign - but when you click on them it just says they are wooden pieces. You have to click in an exact spot to actually rearrange them. You look at a gate and it looks like a plain gate. You have to click on it further to see the lock mechanism.  It means you waste a lot of time randomly clicking all over just in case something is active. This girl should have better eyes than that.That all being said, I really do love puzzle games in general. The idea of a young teen girl trying to figure out who she is is rather cliche, but it gives her the chance to be both 'going out on her own' and 'nervous about being alone'. Having the ghost boy tag along is a nice touch - it's not too long ago that the main character would have \"of course\" been male, maybe with a helpless female sidekick.I'll give this a 3.5/5 for a fun concept and nice graphics, but a little too short and tedious. Maybe the gamemakers will come out with a sequel that is more filled out and easier to use.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2005"}

Here is/are my complaints about this game:1- There is no way a lambo and hummer are on the same level. This is impossible in the real world and not even tangible in the video game racing world. So stop doing this cause it just makes you look like you don't know what you are doing. We understand its a arcade racer make it believable. Mariocart made it believable so can you. And having a lambo being beaten by a hummer its just not working.2. If you are driving a vw bettle without nitro, coolair intake, tubro/supercharger and your rival is driving the same exact car without said features then why is my rival always 50ft ahead of me and seem to 'hit' every single one of there powerups?? And I can't land one shot when they are inches in front of me? Again mario cart you were able to hit who you wanted to hit and even a miss fire resulted in something happening on the track.3. Speaking of tracks why does this game feel almost like a baja racer game? Really if you are not going to be using real locations don't make up tracks that makes driving, drifting, cornering, drafting or anything that has to deal with driving physics period impossible.4. and your selling point in the game is power ups, so why is this part of your game almost useless? Yes people the one aspect of the game that is suppose to be the star was almost forgotten. Turbo is a nice touch, the single shot,mine, and locked on shot are all good features but the lighting bolt that should never be used when you are out in front is useless unless you are chasing down a car or want to level the playing field. The triple shot is the worse one of them all cause you are suppose to be able to shoot it backwards but guess what people don't count on doing that so much. And why should I need a fix up my car power up? yes you will need these cause certain cars have shorter life spans then others. Remember the lambo and hummer comparsion earlier, the hummer has a higher life bar then the lambo. Don't believe me look at if you decide pick this game up.Which brings me to my concluding results for this game and its play the SNES version if you want to play this kind of driving game but stay clear of this overhyped, overbudgeted, miss the mark completely, useless title. Yes people I will be selling this game before I lose anymore money. The only sad thing is that this game REALLY tried to be mariocart with mustangs,lambos,hummers and bettles. Yes there is a vintage VW in the game, and can some one please tell me if a factory Ford focus can really beat a stock nissan 357z? I know the answer but I had to put that out cause that was one of the races that had me almost throw the disc against the wall that I lost.YES!!! The game is that bad. Go play mario cart for the SNES or even the new mario cart for the WII if you want a true arcade racing title. At lest they were able to give you options when you picked mario or toadstool, I mean even the princess peach floated for a while to help give you a egde. They could have done saomething like that here. And if they did the first open race was not a good impression cause I didn't even want to finish.SO do you rent or buy? I say neither. If you are a racing fan of any kind this will leave a bad taste in your mouth for a while.

{"product_name":"B00GANWVJE","description":"","reviewerName":"Stephen M. Sturgeon","summary":"Innovative yet retro at the same time.","reviewText":"I've been playing Zelda since the good old 8-bit days. In fact, the original Legend of Zelda was my first game to own on the NES (aside from the packed in Mario and Duck Hunt).  I have loved nearly every incarnation of Zelda, whether it be the top down 8-bit and 16 bit games, or the later 3D games from the N64 on.But there have been several things that have been missing from Zelda since the 16 bit days that \"A Link Between Worlds\" absolutely nails.Not only is sequence breaking made easy, there's no sequence to break after the first three dungeons. It's very much a go anywhere do anything game. While you may say that recent Zelda's are like that too, go play the original 8-bit Zelda and then play any of the recent games. You'll see how much more you're truly being corralled to the next point in later games.A Link Between Worlds will not hold your hand. Aside from a very brief tutorial about the newer mechanics, you're on your own to figure things out. Again, this is something that hasn't been done in a long time.This is great for retro gamers. This is classic Zelda at its finest. But even new gamers should enjoy this. While Link Between Worlds may feel more like a throw back to Zelda games of old, there are still some innovations that keep it fresh.The ability to rent/buy all your equipment from the start was an idea that I was kinda iffy on at first. But as I played through it I began to see its brillience. You can rent any of the usual pieces of equipment, but if you die, you lose everything you rented. That makes for even more of an incentive to make sure you don't die.And when you start to buy them later, they are expensive. You won't be able to get everything at once. This means you have to choose what's really important to get right at that moment. It adds a layer of strategy and decision making that you don't really get when everythings handed to you at the prescribed moment of opening a particular chest.And really, that's just a taste of the innovation this game has. The switching to the 2D plane, really paying attention to the layout of two different worlds while you travel between them to reach previously unreachable places (moreso than even Link to the Past). While this may seem very familiar to anyone who's played A Link to the Past at first glance, you'll find out very quickly that it is it's own game. In fact, some times puzzles will play to expectations you may have from playing Link to the Past and totally turn your expectations against you.To wrap things up, it's a fun game. It has a retro taste that long time players will love. At the same time, it's innovative enough that players new and old will find something new to keep them playing. I highly suggest this game if you are the least bit of a Zelda fan.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2013"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E1JS","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher Engel","summary":"A few notes besides all that's been said","reviewText":"You've read everything by now. Here are a few things that are most worth mentioning.1. The balance in this game is still very off as of this writing. There are extremely clear counter-characters to each other, in which one has no chance against the other in even mediocre hands. For instance, Baraka has absolutely no chance to win a match against Noob or Sub-Zero, since he has exactly zero moves that will work against them. Noob will just spam the way-too-powerful and ultra-rapid shadow copies, and Sub-Zero will do that thing where he leaves a copy of himself that, if touched, freezes you. Baraka can do nothing whatsoever about that, because his best long-range move counts as a melee attack, freezing him. Then we've got characters like Ermac who have moves that simply should not exist. There should not be any X-Ray attack that requires ducking and blocking, with no warning, to have a chance at stopping it. Ermac's X-Ray is absurdly powerful and also has a massive hitbox; compared to almost anyone else, this is lunacy. It's actually okay that Sheeva's works from *anywhere on the screen* as long as you're grounded, because you can see it coming a split-second before she does it and just get in the air, making it useless. Not so with Ermac.Unfortunately for everyone who enjoys fighting games online solely to win and not for fun, MK suffers the same fate SFIV has: There are only a couple of newb-friendly characters that can be extremely easily made effective against even moderately-skilled players. Just as SFIV has Ryu and Ken and their thirteen hundred costumes they pass off as separate characters to completely dominate the online scene there, get ready here for Scorpion, Scorpion, Scorpion, nonstop, because he's incredibly easy to play and requires no more than a simple combo to learn and use well.Here's why Scorpion stands out as particularly offensive: He appears to be the only character that you cannot defend against. I'm referring to his unblockable move in which he summons fire underneath your character, causing decent damage. This is completely unblockable and unpredictable, with no warning for it. The obvious answer for this is to stay in the air, right? Well, no, because of the fact that his rope-spear hits very high, making it highly likely that it'll hit you in the air. If that doesn't do it, his extremely simple-to-perform teleport attack, also having no warning, will hit you instead. This means two important things: Scorpion is as newb-friendly as it gets, and you will see him constantly.I'm so sick of Scorpion players that it's beginning to wear me down. Scorpion has the very serious problem of having an unblockable move as well as a teleport attack. This means he can do one or the other, and there is nothing you can do about it. Nothing. There is no counter to this, except just hoping you guess right on which he's going to do next. If you guess right, you get some free hits in. Guess wrong, and you get punished. There's no warning of any kind, so it's only a guessing game. If you get scorched from below, which is completely unblockable, it leaves you totally open. But if you dodge it, which can only be done by jumping, you're now vulnerable to the teleport attacks and the rope-spear. So I'm really sick of seeing the same Scorpion combo a million times, and yet always capable of getting hit by it no matter what I do.2. As expected, GameSpy runs the multiplayer aspect of this, and thus suffers from the same issues it always has: Way-too-frequent disconnects, occasional lag spikes, and a joke of a matchmaking system that's so bad that no one uses it. Also, the chat channel that takes up half the screen, which is completely unmoderated, allows macros, and is polluted on a nonstop basis with all the stuff you thought only happened on Xbox Live. You might not mind it at first, but play as much as I do, and after weeks and weeks of every racist slur you can think of, every ethnic slur, every trolling statement you can come up with just to annoy everyone else, all the spamming in the world of the exact same message, and people who do nothing but sit in the chat channel and say nonsense all day while you're just trying to find a match, you'll get tired of it, too. To this day, there is no way to disable it. You cannot disable this chat, which is completely unmoderated, and is outside of Sony's regular moderators that suspended my account for a week once just for taunting someone in a poker game on PSN Home. No one watches it, and there is never anything but spam in it. There is *never* any meaningful discussion--heck, there's no discussion at all.3. It's as if they designed the moves in this game to be spammed like Ryu's Hadoken. Liu Kang in particular has a one-two-three combo, extremely easy to perform, that can be repeated at least four times before you can break out of it. There is nothing complicated about this: He can just do it over and over again, because you'll be airborne and defenseless without a break, so a massive chunk of your life bar disappears every time a Liu Kang player gets to do this. It's infuriating, and insanely stupid. At least make it hard to do the combo, for Christ's sake. Nightwolf also has the unique ability to dash forward while punching, which he can use if you're in the air repeatedly just to chip away damage. No other character can do this, and it is literally nothing but tapping forward and square button. There are other instances of this, but let's just say there are things that should not be.4. The chat channel, again. Anyone who's played the game knows you *have* to join the chat channel to either challenge or be challenged. This chat channel is not moderated in any fashion, so on half the screen you'll have the biggest collection of racial slurs, curse words you might not have known existed in your zip code, and the same message being spammed nonstop for pages. It's horrifying, to say the least, and it's impossible to disable or get past. You want to play, you have to see the chat channel, and it's pretty hard to ignore. This morning, for instance, someone was spamming \"im black fight me\". Another was spamming something I can't repeat here. Another, rather hilariously actually, was \"I SUCK DONT LET MY RECORD FOOL U\". Think about that. Now think about seeing those things every single time you log on.5. The game is flat-out wrong about its own distance requirements for fatalities. Some fatalities are simply incorrect in what they say. Kung Lao, for instance, has one labeled as \"sweeping distance\", which translates to just outside the sweeping range of most characters, a little further than one step away. This fatality should actually be done right next to your opponent, with no distance between you. If you attempt to do anything else, you will very likely be too far to perform it, confused as to what you're doing wrong. This also applies to a variety of characters, and it applies to \"jumping distance\" as well, as this is only a rough estimate of distance, and will require some practice to get right. Then you've got some fatalities, like Freddy Krueger's, that can be done literally anywhere on the map, completely regardless of distance, but will still be listed as a specific distance.6. This is kind of minor, but the boss characters are only boss characters because they are not easily stunned like every other character. For instance, an uppercut won't necessarily knock them up like it would any other character. Expect to get hit hard if you go for it and don't hit it. You have no hope of beating them up close, but they have an incredibly stupid weakness: They like to taunt. A lot. That's when you hit them, because while they're taunting, they're defenseless. All you really need to do is stand back and dodge and block until they use a taunt, then get some hits in, jump back, and repeat. It's completely impossible to lose this way. The only other way is to hope your moves aren't simply ignored by the AI, and you get beaten to death with a 50% combo.7. All three boss characters have their own fatalities, special moves, and every single thing every other character has, except the ability to be used by the player. Um, why? Is that really too much to ask for? It couldn't possibly take much effort to make them playable, considering that their design is already complete in almost every way. As some have seen, they are indeed in the game's character select screen--but they are unreachable and invisible. They can even be used in Fatality Tutorials, and they have their own special move and fatality inputs. Strange, huh?8. Whether an attack is high or low or not is critical to how you defend against it, but quite a few attacks don't make sense here. Attacks that are very clearly hitting low will be registered as high, inexplicably, costing you a big hit until you learn to repress the instinct to block low when they're obviously hitting you low. Yeah, this takes some getting used to.9. I never want to see another Scorpion again. Ever. At least half the players you encounter will use Scorpion at least once because he's extremely simple to play and also effective. Sub-Zero is also extremely prominent. You will virtually never see Jax, Baraka, Sonya, or almost anyone. Now, it's not as bad as SFIV's Ryu and Ken issue that, to this day, is still so bad that people who just want to play for fun, like me, refuse to play online, simply because there are clearly elite characters among the others.10. Jesus Christ, why did they give Scorpion that unblockable fire move AND a teleport attack in case it fails? What were they thinking? Why is it literally impossible to block his attacks if I guess his next one wrong without using two bars for a breaker?11. Still, the game's not bad. It sure isn't perfect, but it's the best anyone's going to do for the time being in terms of Mortal Kombat. While riddled with technical and balance issues, you still get to beat people and fatality the hell out of them. That's why we play these games at all, right? Who would play a Mortal Kombat game without totally over-the-top blood-spraying fatalities? Right. Since the game does, in fact, have hilariously extreme displays of violence during fatalities, that makes it all worthwhile, really.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2012"}

It took a little bit to get used to the moves and being able to follow a routine, but once mastered it is a lot of fun.  While there is a work out section, I have not used it.  Instead I have 4 - 5 favorite songs I use to put together my own fun workout.  My son and I have also played against each other, seeing who can get the most points (the more accurate you are, the more points you get).  The game has different levels, we have not made it past the beginners level yet. And it can also be played as a competition with several players.  Since the song selection is a wide range, there are several songs I really don't like.  I am hoping that there will be add-on songs that can be downloaded (being able to view them first before purchasing, because there are songs I thought I might like, but did not care for the dance moves at all).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2011"}

You should be able to pick it up and learn the basic mechanics of the game fairly quickly. Most of the courses (of which there are many) are designed so that you are supposed to drift, rather than brake, through the turns. Drifting also builds up your nitrous so you can get boosts later on.My only complaint is that the game gets pretty difficult. It seems that a cheap tactic was used to make the game more difficult. You see, it is fairly easy to drive the courses faster than all of the other racers. Unfortunately, this does not always mean you win. You will start out in last place out of 12 cars every single time. The lead car will start out with about a 20 second lead and you have three laps to catch up. So it's not like you can ever get a good start and jump into first place and just worry about holding onto the lead for the rest of the race. You are chasing another car almost the entire race. What gets frustrating is that you will often finish a few seconds behind the first place car and realize that you technically finished the race faster than he did, but you still lost the race.I guess I learned to get over that annoying detail since the game itself was just incredible. Until Gran Turismo 4 comes out (and maybe even after, who knows?), this is the best racing game on the PSP.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2005"}
{"product_name":"B002BSA1MQ","description":"","reviewerName":"EMAN NEP","summary":"MEH . . . UNIMPRESSED","reviewText":"Having heard good things about the first CRYSIS game, I was eager to give CRYSIS 2 a spin to see what the hype was all about. While I can certainly see why this series commands such a following, at the same time I was a bit underwhelmed with what was presented. . .STORY: Absolutely throwaway. Right from the get-go I had no clue what was going on. So New York is under attack by aliens and patrolled by soldiers. What else is new? I would even say that the story felt a bit like Pac-Man in that I was basically chasing dots (the blue destination dots) just going from point to point.CHARACTERS: Not very interesting. Let's see, I play the role of a mute maniac with a machine gun and yes, there's the scientist guy with Tourette's syndrome.GRAPHICS: Pretty good, but I felt that a lot of the environments were too dark and drab to really appreciate it. I specifically remember towards the beginning of the game where I saw this brass-colored blob on the ground next to a mounted machine gun. Guess what it was? Probably the ugliest-looking bullet casings I have ever seen in a game.GAMEPLAY: This is where the game gets some points in its favor . . .--Headshots to every soldier in sight while cloaked is definitely entertaining.--Holding your ground with armor activated and blasting everything to bits is also entertaining.--I also liked the ability to modify weapons on the go, everything from sights to firing modes to secondary weapons.--Some fairly interesting scripted sequences.--IR mode makes you feel like Predator.--A little bit of freedom in how you get to your destination.. . . but still, all is not rosy and peachy. . .--The main premise of CRYSIS is that you have a really powerful suit . . . but you start the game with almost all of your abilities locked in the name of \"holding your hand\" tutorial-style.--I was absolutely baffled by the following: You can throw a bottle or bag of trash across the room. You can turn a computer on, work the printer and water cooler . . . but God forbid that you be able to do something useful like turn on a light-switch, pull the fire alarm for a diversion or interact with some of those infected people. I don't understand why a programmer would dedicate lines of code to allow my character to do something that is basically meaningless.--Absolutely horrific AI. I stood on the second level of a building. At my feet was a hole in the floor where I was looking down on the heads of a bunch of soldiers. Do you think they ever bothered to look up? Even after bodies started heaping up in full view? Nope. They just walked around like the oblivious idiots they were. If you want to see some reactive AI, play F.E.A.R.--Okay, so I've already told you that the AI is stupid. So why am I still dying? It's because one of the few good things about this game is that damage is somewhat realistic. Despite your Nano-suit, if you try and go Gung-Ho into the midst of battle, you're not going to last long.--Unimpressive upgrades. I was really looking forward to upgrading my Nano-Suit. Let's see, there's bullet tracking, which sounds pointless because I'm cloaked almost the whole time and kill everyone before they even get a shot out. There's a bonus for ledge-grabbing and sprinting . . . also pointless because again, I stay cloaked most of the time and move slowly to make the most of it.I basically unlocked the first two rows of upgrades for my suit and didn't find a single one that seemed worthwhile, considering the rarity of finding aliens to kill to be able to afford them.OVERALL: I probably played a good 5-6 hours worth of this game (I got as far as finding the Hive), but in all that time the only upgrades available were pretty much worthless, which basically reduced this game to something that was half FPS and half Metal Gear. The lack of enemies was disappointing (nameless soldiers and chthonic aliens . . . again) and made even more disappointing given how stupid their AI was. Toss in a dark and drab environment and an absolutely uninspired story and you basically have a game that is worth a rental, no more.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2012"}

Because of this, there are some SERIOUS design flaws with the system.For starters, there is some heavy duty processing power inside this little plastic box. Because of this, the system becomes VERY hot. Overheating is a common problem. The 360 demands open space.Then there is the DVD-drive. It's made out of a flimsy piece of plastic that ejects from the console (how long will that last?). The system requires that games constantly spin within the drive at 12x speed (aka OVERDRIVE). At times it sounds like you may have a mini motorcyle in your room. This cannot be good. Moving or even slightly bumping the console while a game is being played will scratch the disc entirely.There is just so much computing power crammed into a cheap little piece of plastic that eventually something will go wrong. Many people are on their 3rd or 4th replacements from Microsoft.At this point in time, the 360 is NOT a reliable machine. You should be able to trust that your $300+ investment was put together with care and craftsmanship - not so at this juncture.Wait until MS has perfected the manufacturing process.

{"product_name":"B00320JDWG","description":"","reviewerName":"Evildead11","summary":"Good, Fun Game That Won't Blow You Away","reviewText":"Being a huge fan of shooters (first-person or third-person) and also a huge fan of military-based games, this game caught my attention when it was released.  I typically check reviews of any game before I purchase it, and this one had some mixed reviews.  I decided to give it a shot.  Right off the bat, I found it enjoyable.  The control scheme is solid, the voice acting is good and graphics are nice.  After getting about 3/4 of the way through the campaign, I can say a few things about Spec Ops The Line.  First, the story is good and provides plenty of motivation to finish the game to find out what happens in the end...and there are four different possible endings.  These endings depend on certain in-game choices that you make.  Some of these choices are fairly emotional and can actually be difficult to make.  This makes the game interesting and provides some decent replay value.  The control scheme is good and what you'd expect from a shooter.  It plays very much like Gears of War, using the same type of cover system.  However, the cover system is clunky...sometimes you take or move away from cover when you don't want to and you end up dead.  Also, if you are not COMPLETELY behind cover, you are open to be shot.  For example, if your big toe happens to be peeking from behind your cover, the enemy tends to have great aim...this results in you being hit...and sometimes being killed.  The game on normal mode is not very easy.  You can only absorb a shot or two before you bite it.  But that's ok if you like a bit of a challenge.  Another thing that I found annoying is the shear volume of enemy soldiers that your tiny 3-man Delta squad is faced with defeating.  Per the story line, you are supposedly taking on a platoon or batallion of soldiers with some local militia at their aid.  However, most firefights seem like you are taking on 20-30 soldiers at a time.  I'm 75% through the campaign and I've killed enough soldiers to make up an entire army...a bit much?  Finally, your AI team are idiots.  They do kill their fair share of enemies, but they do not follow commands consistently and they are constantly getting wounded, forcing you to heal them before they bleed out, resulting in game over.  This usually means you are forced to run from cover to save them and more times than not results in your own death.PROS- Great story- Good graphics- Good control scheme- Good voice acting- FunCONS- Cover system needs work- Can be overwhelmingly difficult, especially on harder levels.  It seems like your 3-person squad is taking on an entire army.- AI is not smart and is more of a hinderance than a help.Despite it's flaws, this game is certainly fun and well worth the play.  It's not worth $60.00, but if you can get your hands on it for $40.00 or less, I would recommend you pick it up.  I'm not much of a multiplayer guy, so I can't comment on it.  I've heard that it is lacking, though.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2012"}

IT'S GREAT!!! this is the only game i have played in the last 17 years that has made me feel like this. this game is truely magical. if you were a kid and spent years playing and replaying the ninja gaiden series on the nes, then you need to play this game. it will regress you back to childhood all over again. it is now 4 am on the following day and that's my 2 cents. good night. oh, today, i just got through beating the god of war collection and i think i'm even having more fun with this game than i did with gow 1&2. please gow fans, don't add comments telling me that i'm an idiot because i like ninja gaiden sigma over gow. i just do and that's the way it is and i forsee myself playing this one through to completion on all difficulty levels at 100% completion with the highest ratings on each level. THAT'S HOW MUCH I LIKE IT!  i really liked the gow collection, but the gow collection just got put back on my shelf where it will stay forever never to be played again. this one, i believe, will have a different fate.-UPDATE-10-29-10 I JUST BEAT NINJA GAIDEN SIGMA TONIGHT!!! i'm so proud of myself. this game is not an easy one and it isn't short either. i played several hours a night for a little more than 2 weeks (excluding sundays for the sabbath) and the only downside for me is that this game is just too long. this is good for teenagers and college kids who don't have alot of money for games to have such an extended campaign as this one. however, i am a retired military officer and millionaire and have a library of well over 15,000 games. i've maybe played 1 out of every 20. i'm surprised i beat this one and stuck with it for so long. i just couldn't help it. the gameplay sucked me in and didn't let me go until the last boss laid dead in his tracks. incredible game. too long for me-probably not for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2010"}

{"product_name":"B006WQR3OM","description":"","reviewerName":"Dagger One Bravo","summary":"Broken or Cheating","reviewText":"Before I pick it apart, let me say, at risk of contradicting my two stars, that this game is a lot of fun. Not because it's such a great game but because it's so diferent from all the mindless crap that we usually have these days. In a lot of ways it reminds me of an older, short-lived game franchise called Full Spectrum Warrior. Man, I loved those games. Arguably, my two favourite games of all time and XCom Enemy Unknown plays a lot like them, with the addition of base management.Be that as it may, the experience is utterly ruined by what is either horrendous programming flaws or built-in cheats and poor implementation of certain features.Anyway, I don't know about the rest of you but I think I'm beginning to see a trend in videogames these days. Seems like more and more games are being released with mechanics that are either broken (and never get fixed or even addressed) or intentionally dysfunctional. Intentionally dysfunctional because making them that way is easier (and cheaper) than taking the time to design and implement genuinely challenging aspects and scenarios to a videogame. Yes, Arenanet, I am looking at you and that tripe you call Guild Wars 2.Amongst some other issues, here's the three main problems with this game and if you aren't familiar with the game or how turn-based games like this one work, read on. You will be.:Hit probability. The combat portion of this game revolves entirely around your percentage chance to hit a target (and your decision to try) based on several factors including but not limited to distance from the target, angle of attack, height, and weapon stats. Then, after all those factors are considered and your hit probability calculated, there is still a dice-roll (RNG) to contend with that determines if you actually do hit that target or not (fine, of course) but it seems as if the dice-roll has little or no relation to your hit probability at all. It plays almost as if the two programs act completely independent of one another.I mean, of course there's going to be a dice-roll. If not, every high probability shot would just be a hit but the dice-roll is also supposed to fall in or out of your favour to a certain degree based on the precalculated hit probability but throughout this game, even on easy mode, you will consistently miss targets when you have a 90-100% hit probability and by \"consistently\" I don't just mean that it happens more than it should. I mean that it will happen as many as 3 times in a row on the same target, from different angles and all with very high (90-100%) hit probability and I have had, also consistently, this scenario occur more than once during the same mission.This happens to an amazing degree. There are times when I've moved my unit to within 4 tiles of a target, completely negated it's cover, had a 100% probability of hit and STILL missed the target. A target which, as soon as my turn is over, turns immediately around and blasts me with his green goop-shooter, taking away 4-8 health points, leaving me with the only option of sitting and waiting for the next target to move into position and finish that unit off.The second problem is this:Inconsistent determination of both hit probability and line of sight. This is less of a problem in terms of frequency but seems to cause an equal degree of frustration. Let's say, for example, that you're 15 tiles away from a target, facinf straight into it's cover. You have line of sight and your hit probability is 56% on a unit that you have 2 turns with so, instead of gambling that meh shot you move to a position thats 9 tiles away from the target and angled to it's cover. Seems like you're hit probability would go up, correct? Don't always bet on it. Sometimes it will go DOWN and sometimes you will completely lose line of sight. The latter incidence is rare but it does happen. The biggest problem with this is that your target never loses HIS line of sight so the only thing you've accomplished is to have put your unit in a better position to get hit.Along these same lines, it isn't actually uncommon to have a very high hit probability on a target far away from you that you really can't even see and a very low hit probability on a target very close to you and virtually without cover. This is a problem because those targets closest to you are the ones that have the highest hit probability on your units and are the most able to reposition and still have a turn left to fire, usually making them priority targets. When this happens, there's not a lot you can do about it but expect to take a hit or even lose a unit because these things NEVER seem to happen to the AI, just us.Problem three:Seemingly no way to remedy the situation on the ground. By that, I mean this: One major goal of the game is to keep the countries of the world calm or they will panic and eventually withdraw their support and thus their funds, ultimately putting you out of business and ending the game. If you ignore a threat to their region, the countries will understandably begin to panic but a lot of times, I'd even say more often than not, they begin to panic for seemingly no reason at all or at least, not for one that you can determine. Just seems to be some random thing programmed into the game and there's nothing you can really do about it. Unless you just happen to get a randomly generated mission in one of those panicking countries you can pretty much write it off as an eventual loss. There are some things you CAN do like send satellites to those regions or honor some sort of material request but if you can't build anymore satellites or if you need another uplink to deploy onee you're screwed outside of getting one of the aforementioned randomnly generated missions in that country.These countries begin panicking very early in the game when it still takes as many as 20 days to build a new uplink which you can't even start until the 5 day excavation gets finished. You just have to live with it (And call it fun, I guess.) until by some miracle of successive, ideally located random missions occurs and turns it all around or the game ends due to a lack of them.Problems 4-.....:4. The inventory is just plain dumb. You can have an armour set, a weapon, side weapon and 2 optionals. That's it. That's ALL!But here's where it gets really dumb: You can't pitch your mostly useless pistol to open a slot for, say, a grenade or a medkit. No! You have to lug that useless pistol everywhere you go. I don't think you can even leave it behind and carry an empty slot into battle.Here's where it get's really REALLY dumb: For some reason that makes sense only to the XCom developers, you are unable to carry a grenade or a medkit or even wear a nano-vest if you have a scope on your rifle (and vice-versa). I don't know, maybe the Xcom engineers designed grenades that are mounted to the tops of all their weapons. Yeah, that's probably it.5. Loadout management and unit selection is pretty crappy.6. Unit designation is random, occuring on promotion of a rookie so you may (and I have) end up with a barracks full of snipers and heavies and maybe one support or assault unit. It happens and you have to keep using more and more rookies to overcome that nonsense. You can't decide for yourself what role that rookie will play when he/she gets promoted. Never mind that you're the \"commander\". It isn't your decision. Pretty stupid, if you ask me.7. Economy sucks. I don't really care about economies. The less I have to manage them, the better but the economy in this game is stripped too much even for me and may as well not even be there.8. Engaging UFOs is less than spectacular, doesn't seem to make much sense a lot of the time and the outcomes seem to be completely random. Maybe because it just doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to me, I don't know but whatever....9. Frequent crashes. The game seems to randomly crash just as soon as I confirm a shot (as in hit the \"ok\" button to tell the game that yes, I want to shoot a particular target) It just CTDs instantly and only when I confirm a shot. It isn't a rampant thing but it does happen much more than it ought to.10. I'm sure I could think of more stuff but that's enough.Anyway, that's XCom Enemy Unknown and anyone who has played this game can't say that these things don't happen without calling themselves liars. Outside of the crashes, which might be a problem on my end, the rest is the software and the design.Like I said at the top, the game is a lot of fun but not because it's some masterpiece of design or labour of love over at Firaxis. It's so much fun because it's so much different from what most shooter-type games are, but that's as far as it goes and the fun factor wears off pretty quickly when you start losing your @ss due to whatever is going on with the programming and poor implementation of features, be it intentional or just shoddy.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2013"}

While some of the controls are the same and the characters are the same, the gameplay is very different.  This may turn some people off, and it may make others look at this game is a very different light.Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy was a great game, and so is the sequal, Jak II.  One of the first things that you will notice is that the &quot;hub&quot; world, Haven City, is HUGE! There are numerous alleys, shops, buildings, caverns and dark places for you to explore.  The city is massive and covers a lot of ground.  The setting has been darkened up a bit as well, Jak has gone through some...interesting changes since we saw him last.  His powers have increased...as well as his attitude.The majority of gameplay is taken up by mission structured objectives.  You need to go to point A and do B and your reward is C.  The missions range in scope from racing to escort missions.  The game developers have obviously taken a hint from the Grand Theft Auto series in terms of gameplay.  Virtually every vehicle can be hijacked and ridden around the city.  Guards are patrolling the streets, and if you make trouble, they will chase you down and shoot some pretty wicked weapons in your general direction- to avoid them you need to either hide or outrun them.The camera is great, and can be repositioned to help you out with the trouble spots.  As expected, the graphics are smooth and lush, with a great style of animation incorporated into the final product.  There are no load times and the scenery flows together nicely.  As I mentioned earlier, the world on which we find outselves is massive and there are many objectives to accomplish before we can unlock all its secrets.  The addition of a map option is a great help as the size of Jak II's world(s) can sometimes be overwhelming and confusing.The only thing that detracts from the game is the difficulty level on some of the missions.  I have found myself trying for over an hour at times to clear one objective or another.  The game can be downright brutal, cruel, sadistic and even petty...yet I always find myself going back into the fray for more.  This game is unique and by all means shoud be rented before you go and buy it.  Naughty Dog has tried something new, they have tried to grow with the times and create something that stands on its own.

The Ball Busters area mine of sorts and while cool when they work it's rarethat xeno will actually walk near it. the extra skins are aboutas generic as could be and were not worth tossing in.the firing range while helpful, proves fairly useless after a few MP matches.the patches and paperwork is very detailed that this package comes withsuch as the certificate, sulaco schematic is very detailed and looks like a true blueprint and the iron on patches are nicely embroidered.the poly resin statue is well detailed but the alien figure is loose in mineand it just seems a little underwhelming. for 100 bucks pass on the collectors edition unless you absolutely Must have the Power Loader.Driving the power loader on the other hand is dull and rather glitchywhich is a sad thing to see in such an iconic moment.the sound effects of the xenos and weapons are top notchI only wish the voice acting were better considering all the starsthey dug up for this game. it had so much potential andyet again it was wasted (unless patches redeem the game somehow)it's a shame the writers didn't take more time on the storyso they could have finally answered all those Aliens film questionsfans always wanted answered.Multiplayer modes:Team Deathmatch: pretty standard xenos vs marines 2 rounds 5 min each.one round as marines the other as xenos 6 vs 6Extermination: marines run to points on the map to destroy alien eggs.aliens try to kill marines.you have to stand in the marked point for fifteen secondsand this can be Very Hard to do. still a farrly redeeming mode. 5 vs 5Survivor mode: 2 teams as per the other modes but 4 on 4 marines must survive the time limit. the player cannotrespawn and is gone once dead, ammo is limited too. this mode wasfairly dull to be honest go for team deathmatch over this one.Escape Mode: the Big mode here as it's by far the most fun of them all.marines try to escape and complete objectives while fighting off xenos.it can get tense at times. the better the marines work togetherthe easier it is to kill off the xenos. the xenos lose if the marines escape,or after fifteen minutes scores get tallied and a winner is declared. 4 vs 4Graphics: 2 of 5 stars got some environments right, the rest is ugly.Sound: pretty spot on and rather Epic 5 stars!Gameplay: after some severe patching it might get better as of now it's 2 stars.Fun: the Singleplayer is flawed but loads of fan service and easter eggsthe Multiplayer has all the potential to be great 3 starsOverall: I'd advise a wait on this game until they add a whole lotmore patches and polish as of now it's long lobby times,bad framerates, lag, texture issues and pop in, not really a complete gamewait until the price drops and most issues are fixed.I can only recommend a rental at bestthe game is a Three Star Game at best (as of this writing)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2013"}
{"product_name":"B001IK1BWC","reviewerName":"VA Gamer","summary":"The best RPG of 2009","reviewText":"Before diving into the review, a brief summary: Dragon Age Origins is the epic role playing game that many of us have been waiting for since we first fell in love with the genre with the classic Baldur's Gate. It drops the player into an immersive fantasy world rich with lore and compelling settings. The aesthetics and score are as pleasing and engrossing as a good cinematic feature or novel. And while it is spectacular in just about every way, it is not without its faults (mostly technical in nature, and affects players with very specific computer hardware as far as I can tell - I'll explain more later). In short, if you're a fan of the genre you will do yourself a favor by purchasing and experiencing this game. I have never felt more comfortable suggesting a RPG to the Internet-at-large as I do right now with Dragon Age. I will swear upon whatever holy text you prefer that it's the best single-player RPG to come along since Fallout 3. If you're not a theist, I suppose I could place my hand upon a photograph of Carl Sagan before making the same solemn vow. But I digress. Onto the review. Aspects I found positive are preceded by a (+), negative aspects a (-).GAME PLAY(+) Dragon Age (hereby referred to as \"DA\") plays like a perfect hybrid of turn-based and real-time RPGs of yore. The controls are a mash up of overhead tactical maneuvering ala Baldur's Gate and the third-person RTS-like mechanics found in Knights of the Old Republic. You control character movement with either the WASD keyboard directions familiar to MMO and FPS players, or via mouse-click navigation (concurrently). You can play from a third-person perspective to get a full view of the world around you, or zoom out into an overhead tactical view to aid in unit placement and positioning (in which the graphics take on the painted look and feel of Baldur's Gate - a nice touch). The camera may be controlled with either the keyboard or mouse. All around, stellar.(+) The UI makes a powerful and elegant use of economy of space (it fits a lot into a little, all while looking and playing extremely well)(+) Character customization is as rich if not richer than any other RPG hybrid or pure RPG on the market - past or present. You have standard archetypes (warrior, mage, rogue) which alone have various \"trees\" or avenues of progression focusing upon things like weapon preference (sword + shield, dual wield, two-handed, etc) or general and crafting skills. In addition there are specialist classes that excel at specific vocations (such as the mage-nullifying Templar, shape shifting mage, or crit-happy Duelist - to name a few). On top of this, special abilities and vocations may be unlocked by finding rare items or special quests (often a combination of both)(+) Combat is highly tactical, taking into account elevation, range, \"crowd control\" mechanics, and vast synergy between the abilities of your party members(+) A deep tactics system can be utilized, in which you assign a custom AI to each of your characters based upon a variety of criteria and situations. For example, you can tell your mage that every time they're surrounding by two or more melee mobs, they cast a certain crowd control spell. If a party member has less than 50% health, heal them. Or have your tank taunt mobs that attack the mage. Or have the rogue stun the mobs your main character is fighting. Etc.(-) Melee-centric characters draw from a pool of stamina to perform their various abilities and group-enhancing skills. This pool feels very limited, even when you invest heavily into the stat that grants more stamina. It's further hampered by injuries that your characters will sustain, on occasion, while fighting (which are treated with injury kits or by resting at your camp). Hopefully this will be tweaked in a future patch.STORY, PRESENTATION, & SETTING(+) The seemingly hackneyed story (you`re the last in a long line of sacred warriors who's mission is to vanquish a very particular foe) quickly unfolds into a compelling, immersive, and interesting tale that rivals those found in quality fantasy novels and movies. Each race, town, city, and region are wholly unique and diverse - from the political intrigue of Dwarven society to the juxtaposition of the city and forest Elves (and the layers of complexity involved therein). I can't go too much into this without potentially spoiling the many excellent stories. Suffice to say, it's superb.(+) While the world isn't technically \"open\", being divided into many instanced zones (if you will), it is nevertheless truly vast. Most areas are substantially large. There is no limit to draw distance: your viewing distance is essentially to infinity, and most zones can be fully explored to the smallest nook and cranny (and it pays to do so). You unlock more areas as the game progresses (and the areas vary depending upon your origin and choices), and there's a complete underground zone in addition to the zone all non-Dwarves start within.(+) The story is always evolving and changing. Your most minor, or major, decisions regarding plot or character interactions will have lasting repercussions that may not come to fruition for some time. You can build intimate relationships with characters, and being an active participant in the dialogue and lore pay huge dividends in the end(+) Replayability is very high - due largely to the aforementioned dynamic story, as well as the \"Origins\" part of the DA title: different race and class combinations have different starting stories, and merge into the overall arc in different ways and at different timesPERFORMANCE(+) The games looks, sounds, and plays perfectly well on middling hardware(-) If you own a dual or quad core AMD CPU, expect gradually increasing load times as your session time increases (the longer you play and the more you transition between zones, the longer the load times become). From 5 to 7 seconds at first, upwards of 5 minutes after 45 minutes to an hour of play. This can be resolved by restarting the game, which literally only takes about 20 seconds. But still, it's frustrating, and many people are reporting it on the official forums. Hopefully it will be patched.(-) The first PC patch was a bit of a goof: the new build included a newer version of the Visual C++ 2005 runtime, while the retail version had an older build. The result was that many people couldn't launch the game after patching. A trivial issue for the computer savvy (I just checked my event logs and saw the issue then patched), but the lay person would have no idea what's going on. After days Bioware has yet to respond officially with the obvious fix, leaving it to the community to resolve. That behavior and communication casts doubt upon the level of commitment Bioware has in regards to DA from a technical support perspective.Overall, the few technical issues are far outweighed by the overall quality of the game. I would provide a more in-depth review, but I am honestly afraid that I'll accidentally spoil something, as this game is ridiculously vast. Buy this game. You will not be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2009"}

Wow.","reviewText":"Back in the Nintendo 64 days, Mario, Nintendo's mascot, was in the uber-successful Mario 64. And pretty much since then Nintendo's been trying to have it's \"sequel\" or successor. They did that with Mario Sunshine but it probably wasn't what we had in mind. Paper Mario was released then and it had Mario and Co. as 2D characters in 3D backgrounds so Mario was essentially paper-thin literally. We now have the \"sequel\" to the original and it vastly improves on the original.Story: One would be pretty stupid to try and think the Mario storylines were deep or original. Princess Toadstool is kidnapped and Mario must save the day by beating Bowser. Well Toadstool has been kidnapped only it's not Bowser's fault. This apparently ties into a treasure map and the mysterious Thousand Year Door.Graphics: Basically with these kind of games like Wind Waker is that they're beautiful only on a different level. Nowhere near the brightness of Mario Sunshine, the realistic ultra-detailed Resident Evil 4 or the brilliant level design of Metroid Prime but it more than captures the essence of the game.Sound/Music: Maybe they learned that Mario Sunshine's voice acting was pretty bad so Nintendo isn't even bothering. You still get Mario's \"let's-a go!\" or \"oh yea!\" and some other voice samples but nothing full speech. The music isn't immediately catchy but it fits.Gameplay: All games come down to this. Paper Mario's \"gimmick\" is that it revolves around, yes, Mario as paper form. In this form he can fold himself into a plane and fly to a far platform, squash himself and launch himself into the air or squeeze through tough spaces.The battles in Paper Mario unfold on a stage with it's own audience. This probably one of the most unique ideas to come in a long time. Basically battles are like Paper Mario and Superstar Saga with timed presses and dodges and you get a cast of characters to be your battle buddy.The audience however plays a key part in everything. Let's say you're not showing off your extra damage attacks or not using cool moves then the audience goes down and some members will even through rocks at you. However, if you're the fan favorite they'll throw goodies on stage. There is also stage elements like the stage can collapse or these spiky guys can randomly fall from the ceiling. This isn't a press A constantly RPG, you'll be busy.One of the big pluses is the dialogue. The dialogue in Paper Mario 64 was downright horrible. Here, it can actually be downright funny. My ever favorite Bowser line: \"Crystal Stars you say? They sound like world conquering tools, I want them!\". And Luigi doesn't join you on the quest but he has his own quest to tell you about should you go chat to him.It's sad that games like this get past over for others which is a shame cause this is one of the Gamecube's must-play titles.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2005"}

And I'm even less of a first person shooter fan. The FPS genre of game seem to be inanely redundant. So naturally I was skeptical about Activision's Call of Duty. Fortunatley this is one game that not only breaks the some of the FPS shooter stigmas, it SHATTERS them.In Call of Duty, you play as three different characters. Private Martin, a US Airborne Ranger, Private Evans with the British Special Air Services, and a Russian conscript named Alexi. Each character has thier own individual weapons according to thier nation of origin. You can also pick up weapons of fallen commrades and German soldiers so there's no shortage of firepower. You can also control such weapons as anti-tank rifles, machine guns, and anti-aircraft flak guns. Aside from the weapons, the thing that makes Call of Duty standout among games that it places you in the middle of some large scale battles. Activision and Infinity Ward have captured the chaos and the gritty realism that soldiers must have endured during the second World War. You'll have A.I. squad mates who will fight along your side and are an integral part of the action. There are various missions that do resemble most of what people would recognise from a standard first person shooter (walking around and arbitrarily blowing away random non-descript bad guys, reloading, picking up the occasional item and flipping a lever here and there). But those missions aren't the main focus. Also the controls are pretty much the same as any first person shooter out there. They can also be customised to fit the player's preferences.The graphics on this game are very good. You really get the feeling that you are in war torn Europe. Bombed out buildings, trees, and burned out cars line dot the landscape.  There was some doubt whether or not my computer would run it. But given my specs;800mhz AMD Athlon processor256 SDRAM64mb Nvidia GeForce2/MX400 video cardI was able to run the game at pretty much it's default settings of 800x600 screen resolution with minimal slowdown. One thing I would recomend is updating your video card's drivers before installing the game. NVidia has a special setting in it's newest drivers specifically for Call of Duty, though I have not had to make any adjustments. The game is pretty big in size. You'll need 1.4 gigs of disc drive space over two discs and DirectX 9 which is included.So why does Call of Duty get 4 stars and not 5 out of 5? Well it does lose a point for being a first person shooter. Albiet a VERY good first shooter.Call of Duty should serve as a benchmark in the PC gaming world. It's been able to take a genre that has been essentially unchanged for the last few years and has managed to breathe new life into it. This game definitley falls into the &quot;must play&quot; column.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2004"}

It wasn't until I started seeing media for The Witcher 2 that my interest was piqued due to the crazy good review *that* game was getting. I wanted to play 2, but the completionist in me required me to play the first one, ESPECIALLY so once I found out the first one's save game imports to impact the second game's story.I'm glad I waited.From what I've heard, numerous bugs and glitches were resolved in the ensuing years, the voicework was completely redone (and I shudder to think of how bad it was before, because even now i wouldn't call it &#34;good&#34;), and a number of new character models were added (again, there are still too many recycled faces in this game, but I hear it was even worse before).So this sounds bad,right? Not So! Yes the game has its faults. It's definitely not a AAA title, and you can tell. But despite the terrible voice work, duplicate character models, & wonky animation, this is a game with a deep immersive world that will suck you in for hours at a time, with an intricate story that for the most part is paced well (except chapter two, which is a struggle to put it mildly). My only piece of advice to the programmers: Next to escort missions, making a primary mission require you to find ten of ANYTHING through constant backtracking to advance the game should be at the top of the list of things not to do in a game. As a secondary quest? MAYBE...But warts and all, this is a great game, and anyone who's interested in playing TW2 or the upcoming TW3 for pc, would be well advised to check out the original. Technically you don't *need* to, to drop into the new games, but it's provides a lot of interesting backstory and is a fun, if quirky, game that takes a lot of chances, which is admirable.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2014"}

Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"I'm glad I tried this one","reviewText":"Starting up the game of Star Ocean, the first look of it did not get me very interested. Big-eyed cutesy characters wandering around a leisure complex with nothing really happening. But, many hours later, how far away that opening all seems. Now they are battling to save not only themselves and their loved ones, but the entire existence of their world! Yes, I know, that old cliche. But did it improve after that opening? Oh yes.Star Ocean is a complex game to say the least. Lets start with the battle system. Traditional RPG players may not be that keen to hear that battles are in real-time, with a team of three fighters, only one of which at a time is player controlled. Sounds a bit tame? Far from it. The first introduction to fighting is done via a simulator that the main characters use in a holiday resort. You only get one practise go, and I got soundly thrashed. What the hell was going on? The battle was non stop action, everyone dashing around doing their own thing at once, damage counters pinging all over the screen...and then I was dead. Luckily things get a LOT easier once you are stranded outside on your own, with some very simple fights to ease you into the system. Initailly I though \"Where's the fun in sharing the battle with 2 computor controlled allies?\" But I was wrong, After playing for a while, I gradually started switching between all three, just to see what I could make them do, and to see if my judgement was better than whatever the AI was making them do. And it's there that the fun starts. The battle action is highly customizable. Every aspect of the AI is pre-set by you, and switching characters can be done in a second, any time you see a comrade in a jam, or if you know they have an awesome skill that would be handy to use just about...now. The battles do look insanely frantic on screen, but luckily for those who need time to think mid-fight, lots of important choices cause the action to freeze while you pick from the menu of character swapping, magic casting, even down to items currently equipped and AI settings. There are several skills per character, and you have the option of setting your favourite four at any one time to short cut buttons...so if you are well prepared, you can just run in and start dishing out your favourite moves, no stopping. As characters level up, you'll swap continually to see what their new tricks look like in practise.So, battles - bewildering at first, but soon sorted. And they really look great. You can run all over the place at will (the battle arenas can be huge), cast spells that fill the screen with special effects, or make your characters leap all over the place as they deliver great long chains of hits. Wait till you learn \"Explosion\" or \"Stone Rain\"...the on-screen chaos will make your eyes reel!What else...The story? It's fine by me. Every cliche is here, though. The confused hero with a power he doesn't understand, the childhood female friend who is frail but weilds the strongest healing and magic skills, the warring oppressors who turn out to be allies when an even greater evil reveals itself...it's all familiar ground. But the playable charcters are well developed in this game, and you'll certainly have your favourites. The excellent voice acting makes them come alive, and there's lots of it, which pays off. There are sidequests as you'd expect, with some optional dungeons and \"errand running\" type tasks. There's also the standard \"entertainment\" venue where you can engage in racing (bunnies!), play a chess-style tournament and take part in a fighting arena. But the major addition to gameplay is item invention, which I found to be very confusing. Inventions cannot be made to order, as the process requires that you experiment with mixing several factors and seeing what the result is. This takes a lot of time and patience - or of course referring to a guide, and even then you still need a certain amount of luck. I dabbled a bit with it, but it will take dedicated completists to get the most out of this side project. Of course the rewards for your hard work are some of the most powerful items in the game, so it's only fair I suppose.I heartily recommend this game to RPG fans. Even though the story is somewhat predictable it delivers a surprising twist on where the ultimate threat actually comes from. My lips are sealed...it's a great plot revelation that I'm not going to spoil here. The amount of playtime depends on you - enemies in dungeons are always visible on screen, and can be avoided at will or encountered many times over (most areas re-spawn monsters if you exit) if you want to gain levels. The game graphics look pretty good throughout, monsters are well designed, and there is a good in game map that gets filled in as you explore an area - with a bonus for visiting 100% of the area. Camera view can be rotated at will, so it's your fault if you run into a nasty surprise. And some of the battles are hard...this game is no pushover. Some of the dungeons have save points that are very far apart, and the dungeons can be massive. But don't worry, you'll want to finish it - all two discs worth. Good fun and lots to do make this one a winner.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2004"}

The more I read them, the more I saw people who probably played this game for 5 hours and gave up.  It's obvious with the way they write.  Here I will show you why this game is definately a showboat that could have been unbelievably great if it didn't have such miniscule problems.You star as a 19 year old snotty nosed teenager named Fayt.  He whines, doesn't like violating some OPT agreement, and you'll generally will not be able to deal with him the first half of the game.  I personally would have rather been Nel or Cliff, but unlike Star Ocean: The Second Story, you don't get a choice in what character you play.The game starts off at a snails pace.  Mostly because it's so big and freebase you'll have a hard time knowing where to go. ((Hint:  Buy the strategy guide, it's worth it.)) Pretty soon the story unfolds and you find yourself on a planet alone and not knowing where to go.  You meet up with some future friends of yours like Cliff, a girl who looks like Sophia, Roger, and other members of Qwark.  Then you find out you have special powers, and you eventually set out on a quest to find you dad.Confused about the plot yet?  So was I.  If you compare this game with say any Final Fantasy game, you'll find better written scripts there.  But if you compare the battle system of FF to Star Ocean, you'll wonder why FF didn't pick up on this sooner.Battle are done in real time, and are the best part of the game.  Whenever you fight, you have to make split second decision making, or else your entire party could die in 4 seconds.  This makes strategy important when you fight, and what is lacking from all RPGs lately; skill.Building up your characters isn't as important as to how you fight.  If you have a level 99 character in this game you'll have all the abilities, but if you don't know how to fight, you'll still get wiped out in record time.  Most people who are traditional turn-based RPG sissies may say this game is too hard, I on the other hand, loved the challenge.Anyone who likes to craft in RPGs is going to love this game too. This game has an extensive crafting system very similar to online RPGs nowadays.  Rare and extremely exlcusive items can all be made, and ultimately determine the performance of your characters when they battle.Although Fayt starts off whiny, he eventually becomes a man and starts showing some spunk for actually having a pair.  Cliff is probably the best comic relief of the game, while Nel keeps things serious.  Sophia, Roger, and the teenie-bopper characters are typical Manga throwaways that I had no time for to listen to.  Overall though there is extensive character development for each of the people in your party, and private actions determine whether or not  you get to see their endings after the final boss.Despite the good points of the game, there were several downpoints that many have agreed with as making this game less than phenominal.- A horrible and sometimes boring story line.  This really pissed me off the most.  The story for the most part is predictable and flat out hair pulling at points.  For instance, the story of Maria is about 30 minutes long, and I could already guess what was going to happen by the time their ship was going to explode.- Odd loading times on the older fat PS2s.  I hear this isn't the case for the streamlined version.- Retarded AI settings:  Sometimes the team mate charaters just stand there like hindu cows until you give them the order to attack all out.- No adequate dodge or blocking system given.  ( You have the ability to sidestep or just stand there until your fury is at 100%, but I rarely ever used the two.)-  Absolutely wretched character voices.  When Fayt cries like a baby in a couple of the scenes, I turned off the voices.  The game is sometimes better played without them.  Nel probably had the best voice acting along with some of the NPCs she understudied.Despite the downfalls, I would have to agree with most of the other reviewers out there and say this game is worth buying on the gameplay alone.  Despite bad storyline plotting, there are some interesting moments that kept me coming back, and for the value of time you can play this game (ranging from 70 hours for the main quest, over 200+ hours for all the battle trophies if you're hardcore)  this game is well worth the 20 bucks.A lot of people who reveiw this are going to tell you this game was too hard, too complex, too boring.  The choice is ultimately up to you whether you want an RPG ahead of its time that takes skill to win, or stick to turn based brainless fights.  Either way, I imagine more RPGs are going to take this format with future games.  I know FFXI already has, I wonder whats next?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2006"}

Yep. Pretty short too even on veteran difficulty. No character development, flat story, narrow objectives. The game goes back and forth and doesnt do a very good job, at one point your following soap mactavish who has just been promoted captain as you play alongside him with a recruit named roach. On the other side you play a guy named rameriz who follows captain foleys orders etc. The campaign is just not fun, not to mention ((((((*spoiler*)))))))) ghost and roach die near the end. I can remember starring at the screen in disbelief as nikoli and captain price drag soap mactavish in the helicopter. I just could not belive how horrible of a campaign it was, especially after seeing stuff like the e3 trailer where you get to climb glaciers. Thats pretty much the only interactive thing in the campaign besides snowmobiling but we already did that back when james bond was around for the original xbox. We dont get to kill makarov....bummer, I guess that brings up mw3. I dont think i will be preordering mw3.campaign rating 0/10 stars for me. Very Disappointed. Not as fun as the original COD.Special Ops: Special ops is pretty cool, its a mode in the game where you can go through missions (not related to the campaign) and earn stars for completion of each mission. There are some levels,however, that cannot be achieved unless you have someone else playing with you.Multiplayer: heres the part that most people have bought MW2 is the multiplayer. At first, I played the multiplayer and felt like I was playing halo, you would spawn and then five seconds later you would die. After awhile, trying out all the different modes like 3rd person, search and destroy my love for mw came back. With so many weapons, and upgrades, big maps (good maps at that) you cant go wrong with mw2.Overall: Overall I was hoping I could have an awesome story/experiance that I could say to all my buddies and say wow what an awesome game experiance. I didnt really get that from the campaign, instead I felt like infinityward was just going halo on me with the whole prestige edition etc, I think its ubsurd people would pay 100$ for some 5$ night vision goggles. I think if the multiplayer wasnt so strong, mw would be a flop. Anyways thats my review on mw2, Its a great game to rent and buy, I wish the campaign would have been good, the special ops is ok but not great, the multiplayer does however provide long term replay value. So while some of my hopes fell short in some areas of the game, im sure other people would appreciate. See you on the field.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2009"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J998","description":"","reviewerName":"Siklootd","summary":"Just as Good as PS3 Version","reviewText":"Mortal Kombat for the Xbox 360 is a game that has been met with generally positive reviews from critics and fans alike.  Despite the fact that the game lacks any console exclusive content, the game stands on its own, based on its own merit and characters that the series has already developed with past iterations of the game.  The lack of a console exclusive character, such as Kratos on the PS3, has left the game open to attacks from fans, but is the addition needed?  The answer is no.  The inclusion of Kratos is a great bit of fan service, but the majority of fans will spend their time playing with \"klassic\" characters from the MK world, and this game has plenty of familiar faces to satisfy long time fans of the infamous fighting franchise.Mortal Kombat is a gaming franchise that has seen its fair share of ups and downs. What began as an immensely popular arcade fighter back in the early 90s, has slowly devolved into a mediocre fighting game that always felt \"rushed\" and never felt complete. The developers had toyed with various ideas throughout the years starting with Mortal Kombat 4. With their first step into the 3D world, Midway made Mortal Kombat 4 a game with 3D graphics that fought within a two dimensional playing field. However, the combat system was generic, utilizing a system in which all the characters played exactly the same and even had the same combos. This took the feel of \"genuineness\" out of each fighter, and the introduction of weapons in Mortal Kombat 4 also felt tacked on.Onto Deadly Alliance, where the developers made every character unique once again, and this time expanded upon the weapons system added in the previous title. However, due to the lack of characters, and the one fatality format of the game, it never felt the same as previous entries in the franchise such as Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, Mortal Kombat Trilogy, or Mortal Kombat 2. Midway mixed up the formula again in Deception, bringing back many classic fighters, adding in some more, and creating new game modes such as Chess Kombat, Puzzle Kombat, and Konquest Mode. However, Konquest Mode was a poorly developed story mode that felt tacked on, and never allowed the user to truly feel like they accomplished anything by beating it despite its immensely long duration of playtime. With Mortal Kombat Armageddon, the developers thought that by returning every character from all previous entries would add enough flare to help revitalize the franchise. However, Armageddon was lacking in variety (with several challenge ladders constantly repeating themselves, level design lacking, and AI extremely dumbed down). The air combat was a nice touch but didn't add enough \"oomph\" to get the series back on track.The only Mortal Kombat game to be released this generation did not feel like a true entry into the franchise due to the lack of true violence in which the series is known for. So, Ed Boon decided that a return to a more \"klassic\" approach may be exactly what is needed to return the gaming franchise back to its glory days. That's where \"Mortal Kombat\" (9 or 2011 whatever you want to call it) came into play. Seeing a return to two dimensional fighting is a major plus, adding to the challenge and the ability to perform more complex combos similar to those seen within Capcom fighting games.The game does more than simply return to the 2D realm of fighting, it brings back classic elements of previous titles that long time fans of the series are sure to appreciate. With the move into 3D, the developers had dropped many aspects of the series in the process. The most notable changes were to characters' move sets. On games such as Deadly Alliance and Deception, classic character moves such as Cyrax's net, Sektor's homing missiles, Scorpion's scissor kick, and most notably Shang Tsung's morphing ability. With \"Mortal Kombat (9, 2011)\", Ed Boon resurrected all of these old moves. Classic moves such as Johnny Cage's crouch punch have returned, alongside other notable classics such as Reptile's energy balls, Jax's \"gotcha grab\", Noob Saibot's cloud attack, etc. All of these moves were abandoned after Mortal Kombat trilogy, and it's great to see a return of such notable attacks that had defined these characters during their early years.Besides a return of classic moves, this latest entry also sees a return of classic modes such as \"Test Your Might\". The game also features the return of many classic elements such as Dan Forden and his trademark \"Toasty\" appearing on the bottom of the screen. Stage fatalities for classic levels have reappeared with levels like the Deadpool and the Pit making a return. Re-imagining of character designs are also present with each fighter resembling their 2D counterpart in a more updated and modern manner. The return of Babalities brings back that classic MK humor that helps take a break from the excessive amount of killing.The story mode is extremely well developed and covers the events immediately following MK Armageddon. With Shao Kahn winning and defeating every opponent in the process, Raiden is forced to use a method of time travel to warn his past iteration about the dire future that awaits unless he can change it. Raiden tries to change the future as much as possible, and in the process, new characters are born. Gamers will see the rise of new faces such as Smoke remaining human and Sub-Zero getting automated in his place. It's a very interesting plot that the developers went with, and the story mode feels well fleshed out, rather than rushed like in previous entries.The PS3 version sees the added benefit of playing as Kratos, lead character from Sony's hit franchise \"God of War\". Despite the fact that Kratos fits the game design quite well, his appearance is more of a gimmick than a necessity, and with so many other characters available for playtime, it is quite easy to ignore his existence within the game.  His play style is also somewhat counter-intuitive, relying on slow movements and heavy attacks that are difficult to land.  Although he is a great character (my favorite video game character of all time) his appearance was not needed to make Mortal Kombat a great game, NetherRealm Studios succeeded at creating a great return to form for the series, with or without the appearance of Kratos.Overall, this is a game that all long time fans of the series have been looking forward to, and NetherRealm Studios delivered on bringing back fanfare to the series. The game feels like it was tailored to the fans with so many classic elements making a reappearance. All the little touches will not go unnoticed by devoted fans, and this game may be exactly what the series needed to reestablish itself as a true contender within the fighting game genre. An instant \"Klassic\".","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005YTYJ","description":"WithGrand Theft Auto III, Rockstar proves that not all  developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games.  This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular  predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any  criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the  local population for their money (or weapons), make time with  prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking  more structure can embark on dozens of plot-driven missions or steal  cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and go on vigilante  missions. Grab a cab and play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi.  Take a fire truck and earn money putting out fires. The game just never  gets boring.As in real life, there are consequences for your criminality. As your  random acts of mayhem mount up, the police start hounding you,  eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you  continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily  the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are  packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every  category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump  trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically  when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific  detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic,  pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing.  Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine  different radio stations whenever you are in a car.

Spiderman 2 starts out as a wonderful game, the ability to visit street level and foil \"everyday crimes\" around the city is awesome. But the \"level bosses\" (fights that you must complete to move on) are terribly designed. One level (Mysterio's burning theatre) is impossibly difficult simply because of the terrible web slinging controls the game has employed. Another level (Statue of Liberty) is so bad that you'll want to return the game. This game deserves no honors whatsoever, since the designers spent too much time trying to do \"cool\" things, rather than making it playable.

Basically this game takes 6-10 hours to beat and unlock the extras.  The comparisons to Super Mario Brothers 3 must be some sick peoples' ideas of jokes.  At the very surface this has some similarities to SMB3, but they are superficial at best.There is little challenge in this game.  You will lose lives, yes.  But when you have 200+ extra lives, it doesn't really matter.  So you can be bold without worrying too much about having to restart.  Extra lives are WAY too easy to come by.The goal more than anything seems to be collecting coins.  Even beating the game (both realms) seems trivial.  There are 6 worlds with 6 stages (or so) each.  Then there are 3 special worlds.  Then there are the Rainbow Worlds to secretly unlock.But all of this can be accomplished in an afternoon if one is dedicated.Buy the much better 3DS Mario title:Super Mario 3D Land.  It is by far the superior game.  If you have access to this game either through a game rental store or site, or local library, or even a friend, then borrow it for a few days.  You'll probably get bored quickly.Update: There is new DLC for this title, but it involves more coin challenge games and such.  I still think that this is not as good as the previous entry, New Super Mario Brothers for the DS or Super Mario in 3D Land.  It's not a bad game, but on playing some more I just realize that it's far too easy to get extra lives, hence the risks of dying are not great.  I would honestly rather play the original Super Mario Bros. 1 or 2 (the real SMB2 that we call 'The Lost Levels' in the US).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2012"}

Indeed, Deus Ex was way ahead of its time; one of those games that merge two genres almost seamlessly (RPG and FPS). By 2007 standard, graphic will look somewhat dated, but gameplay still rocks, whether you chose to run and gun or sneak and peak, Deus Ex offers multiple paths to complete objectives.On top of the outstanding gameplay, Deus Ex serves up tons of sci-fi elements mixed in with heavy doses of conspiracy theories. Indeed, playing Deus Ex can feel like immersing yourself in a noirish/cyber-funk/sci-fi novel rather than playing a game.Deus Ex is not perfect (which is good, because personally, I will have a hard time living in the \"real world\" after playing the perfect game) ie.  enemies AI could be better. Sound-wise, music and voice acting is good, but most of the weapons sound weak. Also, the main quest is somewhat linear - I wish you have a choice of which faction to side with. However, there are 3 different endinds depend on the choice you make, and trust me, if you get this far, you'll do all 3 because the game intrigues you so much.After all these times, Deus Ex is still in a class by itself. I can only think of 1 other game with sci-fi themed FPS/RPG elements that might come close to Deus Ex: System Shock 2. Therefore, if you want an alternative from the fantasy themed dungeon and dragon type RPG games - Deus Ex is the game to play.Other good sci-fi RPG games that I also recommend after Deus Ex: Star Wars - Knights of the Old Republic series, System Shock 2, and Fallout series. If you know any other good sci-fi RPG games, please let me know.PS. Although listed for Windows 98 & ME, Deus Ex runs flawlessly on XP.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2007"}

So why do I prefer this original over PS3? Is it because of its graphics? No. It's because of its game library.The Playstation had a good amount of games that I actually WANTED, and they weren't on other systems, and even if some were, those versions on the other systems would be inferior to what this classic system had to offer. Such examples are Mega Man X4, Pac-Man World, Rayman, Frogger, Spyro (Well, I bought A Spyro game), etc (And maybe the original Crash, too, once I buy that game). If you want, you can go see my reviews for some of those games.The games do not have online play, nor do they have DLC (What do you expect from a 90s console?), but what they DO have will keep you at these games for a very long time.

Everybody from MK 1 to Deption return there are  only 2 new characters Taven & Daegon. They're 2 brothers on quest of sorts. Taven proves to be the good 1 while Daegon is evil he is assisted by ' returning Shinnok who we haven't seen since MK after he was easy to pwn. Daegon awoke centuries before Taven he founded The Red Dragon. Taven & Dragon's parents created Blaze he oversees all the relms. Delia Taven & Daegon's Mother prophesied that there would be a time when a fighters power would become a threat to all existence. See every fighter from MK 1 to this game wants to defeat Blaze in order to get The Ultimate Power. If that isn't bad enough Shao Kahn Shang Tsung Quan Chi & Onaga are all working together to get it. In The Konquest mode you find out that Raiden struck a deal with Shao Kahn Shang Tsung Quan Chi & Onaga. Of the 3D Mortal Kombat's this is my favorite you got all the characters including Sareena from the dreadful Mytholgies. My only problems were no art work for the endings. You can atleast get creative with the custom fatalities . Hara Kiri's are gone but the death traos are still there in fact they up'd them. Konquest can be a pain but they improved it. Blaze to me is another generic monster both him & Onaga were the worst bosses you can say Shinnok all you want but he was a Fallen Elder God & he had a history with Raiden.  I would've loved a separate quest for Daegon. I enjoy playing as bosses Motaro isn't a centar  but they foun a way explain it better storyline wise than just memory problems.

{"product_name":"B00149MEWI","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"A surprising and welcome addition","reviewText":"Silent Hill: Homecoming is a noteworthy addition to the series for 2 reasons: one, it is not made by long-time makers Team Silent in Japan but rather American company Double Helix. Two, it adds new things never seen in the series such as a new camera style and combat mechanics. Fans were understandably skeptical and thought \"god I hope it doesn't suck\". While it's not flawless, I have to say I really enjoyed the game and as a fan of the series I don't consider this a blemish or an absolute triumph the way Resident Evil 4's overhaul was. It's entertaining and creepy and that's really all I was looking for when I played.Story: You play as Alex Sheperd, a young soldier returning from the war when news that his younger brother, Josh, is missing. Coming into the town of Sheperd's Glen, Alex finds the town strangely deserted save for a few residents who act less than normal, a thick layer of fog and strange creatures around.  Alex has to uncover the truth of what's happening to his hometown as well as find his brother and almost literally has to go to hell and back to do so. The one issue people might have with the plot is that it's probably the most straightforward of the series. In a series known for being slightly ambiguous, there's really nothing here you have to ponder over or ask people online what it was you just saw.  While the actual story is interesting, some might not like that it's a bit easier to \"get\" a Silent Hill game.Graphics: Originally the game previously had static camera angles which made it frustrating when escaping from a creature had you running back to them thanks to the angle switch. Now the camera is more free-roam in a 3D environment and it is way easier to navigate the levels.  Plus the levels are actually quite detailed and from the peeling paint and missing floors to the grimy and industrial look of the transformed versions of levels look quite foreboding and grimy. Only issue is that character faces look kind of...strange and your flashlight frequently goes from uber-bright to near useless. But the fog outside and the grain filter on several cutscenes is quite good.Sound/Music: For those who have worries about the soundtrack well no fear, Akira Yamaoka is here with his trademark rock pieces as well as vocals by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn just like always. It's what makes the game quite special since everything about it in the sound mix from the ambience to win a drum piece would start up and the delicate and haunting piano themes help to punctuate certain moments. As for voice acting, everyone particularly Alex is well done that is except for one character: the reason you're playing through the game in the first place, Josh. He barely emotes and he's so flat and disinterested sounding that you can't believe you gotta save the little snot.Gameplay: Since the camera's changed, the environments are a lot more spaced out, fully 3D so you have to push stuff out of the way, duck under openings, and climb over ledges and whatnot. In addition, the same items return from first aid kits to health packs and weaponry. Your inventory (health drinks, puzzle items) are on the LB whereas combat (knife, pipe, guns as well as option to turn off flashlight and the radio) is on the RB. It's a lot easier system to use than having to cycle through menus though occasionally I'll use a health drink when I didn't mean to. But I quite like the control scheme and camera and I kind of dread returning to the old style now. Only thing I wish was different is the puzzles since unlike Resident Evil's old love of doors that need emblems rather than just, you know, a normal key, Silent Hill's puzzles range from little logic puzzles to the always-popular sliding block kind. They're a bit too flow-breaking and never really sat well with me on this one.Overhauled is the combat system and it's one of those \"works but other times doesn't\" additions. Whereas Resident Evil 4's gameplay change helped it for the better, it helps it here but doesn't perfect it. Basically holding LT puts you in combat stance or aim mode and A is your weak attack while X is your strong attack which can be held for an even stronger attack (your log chopping swing for the axe, or baseball swing for pipe for example) and your B will act is the mandatory dodge button. While enemies were easily avoided in previous games, because of the level layout such as cramped rooms, it's hard to escape enemies so you have to fight but some have really cheap attacks such as Siam while the Smog can best be killed using handgun ammo and it's always best not to waste those. It's much better than before but it's still got a few kinks.In a strange bit of irony, Silent Hill 4: The Room and even 3 was criticized for being too stagnant, too familiar to past entries whereas Homecoming with its changes for the better has people lamenting the old style. I think they just don't like Americans doing it, personally and speaking as a fan I quite like this one but not necessarily loved. For me, nothing beats Silent Hill 2 but as a new entry in the series, Homecoming works quite well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature.

{"product_name":"B00004U5VF","description":"The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.--Jeff Gerstmann--Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Although it doesn't beat Chrono Trigger as my favorite game, it's still awesome nonetheless. Simon Belmont's quest is to destroy Dracula when he rises out of his grave every one hundred years as a part of the Belmont family tradition. But you have no idea what a wildly fun game awaits you. Though in reality this game is a remake of the original NES classic, it's so gorgeously detailed in its wonderful 2D graphics and environments. The gameplay is simple, yet great. The whipping techniques are a lot of fun to use. You collect various items such as new weapons, health, hearts and more during your quest to slay Dracula and encounter some incredibly strange enemies. The boss battles are spectacular and you can't help but feel a sense of awe when you fight in them. The only flaw to the game is the fact you die instantly when you touch spikes, when is a real problem in the tough eighth stage. If you own a Super Nintendo, there is absolutely no reason you should not own this excellent game. This game is a classic that should never be forgotten, even you play the first Castlevania or Symphony of the Night for the Playstation (Speaking of Symphony of the Night, I plan to own that game one day because it looks so freaking cool!).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2008"}

Randall","summary":"Mediocre sequel, but still fun","reviewText":"After the enormous success, critically and commercially, of the Nintendo GameCube's stellar \"Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader\", it should not come as a complete surprise that the sequel (two years in the making) would be somewhat of a letdown.  \"Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike\" is a solid, serviceable addition to the Star Wars library of games, but it is certainly the least of the top-flight Rogue Squadron series.Part of the problem that plagues \"Rebel Strike\" is the fact that its designers are simply running out of scenarios to use for individual stages.  Whereas \"Rogue Leader\" was a crisp, tight depiction of the main battles of the original trilogy with a few previously little known intermediate missions thrown in which meshed seamlessly with the rest of the challenges.  \"Rebel Strike\" seems to be more a collection of `everything else'.  It is the `rest of the turkey' to \"Rogue Leader's\" `white meat'.  Some of the stages don't seem to make much sense in the overall of scheme of things (`Deception at Destrillion' is a classic example) and others that just doesn't seem to have any rhyme or reason to it's structure and ends up abruptly completing (`Relics of Geonosis').  Much was made of the separate paths one can take with either Luke Skywalker or Wedge Antilles, but in the end it amounts to very little since each of their separate missions need to be completed.The game's biggest failing, however, stems from the fact that the designers strayed from the spaceship-based missions that they were so accomplished at and included some poorly conceived missions that take the player on foot or has them using speeder bikes or Imperial walkers.  The interface for the foot missions is poorly designed in that the camera angles are terrible and frequently cause the player to lose the direction of where they are going.  Combat on foot is very pedestrian as well.  The speeder bike mission is simply tedious and is the most aggravating challenge in any of the Rogue Squadron games since the `Beggar's Canyon' mission in the first game.  The less said about the walkers, the better.Despite all of these glaring flaws, \"Rebel Strike\" is still a compulsively playable game.  Graphically, the designers at Factor 5 have outdone themselves when it comes to detail and realism.  As visually compelling as \"Rogue Leader\" was, its sequel trumps it.  The space battle missions also meet the high standards set in previous games (\"Shipyards at Fondor\" is very good).Overall, \"Rebel Strike\" lacks the replay value of its two predecessors, and that has to be held against it.  Questing after the gold medals in this game is not as compelling or rewarding as in earlier versions.  Still, it is a solid game and worth adding to one's Gamecube collection.  One can just hope than any future installments are designed with the \"Rogue Leader\" playbook in mind, instead.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2004"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J6DC","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Gordon","summary":"Castlevania Finally Gets Its Due In 3D","reviewText":"From the mid 1980s through the mid 1990s, Castlevania meant something different than it did after Symphony of the Night shifted the series' focus to one more inspired by Metroid.  Back then, Castlevania was more about straightforward action inspired by gothic horror, as opposed to backtracking within a single location to open up previously blocked paths with new abilities.  It was the sister franchise to the Ghosts and Goblins games, another series that successfully melded horror themes onto the heroic action-platforming genre. Oddly enough, my first experience with the franchise was the open-ended Castlevania II: Simon's Quest, which deviated from the linear approach of the first game.  That being said, Simon's Quest focused on the open countryside surrounding Dracula's castle, as opposed to the castle itself.  Castlevania III and Super Castlevania IV both attempted to merge the 2 approaches, by adding a fair amount of gameplay outside the castle, while still keeping Castlevania itself the star.  When the focus of gaming switched to 3D and polygons, however, the Castlevania franchise was unable to make the jump successfully.  Early attempts to figure out how to translate the fast, twitch-based action of the Castlevania series into three dimensions did not fare well, in part because, frankly, the technology wasn't up to the task at the time (in retrospect, the plethora of slow-paced 3D games overall from the mid-90s to 2001 was clearly a result of those limitations).  As a result, the mantra became that Castlevania simply wouldn't work in 3D, and despite a couple of later attempts at a 3D Castlevania, conventional wisdom seemed to indicate Castlevania was to be relegated to 2D handheld titles.Ironically, it took a completely unrelated franchise- God of War- to prove that the basics of Castlevania _could_ work in 3D with some effort on the production side.  In many ways, God of War was sort of a 3D Castlevania, but re-skinned with Greek mythology and an overdose of hostile attitude.  Several years later, the Uncharted franchise provided a new take on 3D platforming.  It's no surprise that Castlevania: Lords of Shadow borrows liberally from both franchises in its mostly successful bid to reclaim the franchise's former mainstream glory.You'll hear a lot of fans say this was never intended to be a Castlevania game from its inception, and that the Castlevania elements that are present were shoe-horned into it later in production.  It is true that this game, as a \"reboot\" of sorts of the franchise, may often seem more inspired by high fantasy than gothic horror, or the Universal Studios movie monster gallery that the franchise is known for.  Still, the game does the overall feel of the series' earlier entries justice, in somewhat the same way Maximo for the PS2 paid respect to the Ghosts 'n Goblins games, while still deviating from that series in some major ways. You will fight vampires, skeletons, demons and werewolves, but you'll also fight goblins, giant spiders and trolls.  And be assured, there's a fair amount of game here, with gameplay elements such as riding a giant boar through jungle ruins, outsmarting a vampire child in a chess-like game, making it through the inside of an enchanted music box, teleporting through portals in the sand-swept abyss of the damned, and taking on titanic enemies many times larger than your character.[SORT OF SPOILER ALERT]--------------The main character Gabriel Belmont is certainly a more likeable protagonist than God of War's Kratos, which makes it a bit easier to enjoy the proceedings.  The one area where Castlevania fans may be divided as to their enjoyment of the game is how the typical Castlevania storyline is subverted.  This game predates the Belmont vs. Dracula conflict, and as a result, the game's creators don't provide the ending boss battle that many would expect.  Fortunately, the ending boss is the next best thing, and provide a rather suitable Adversary, if you know what I mean.  I would advise that one stays through the ending credits for the final cutscene, however, as it more or less cements this game as an origin story of sorts for the Castlevania conflict.--------------------[END SPOILERS]The voice acting is well done, as are the graphics.  The game throws a fabulous variety of settings and moods at you.  Waterfalls littered with falling autumnal leaves, snowswept forests, foul swamplands, fog-haunted dead woods, decaying castles and abbeys, and many other environments are portrayed well.  The gameplay mechanics are surprisingly deep, with light and dark powers both available and needed to survive, and some other abilities that open up as the game progresses.  The game can get pretty difficult, and there's an old-school tenacity to the challenge curve here.  There's also the ability to go back and replay past levels with new powers, which often allows the player to uncover power up items in previously unreachable areas.  It's surprising that this is the same team that was behind the poorly received \"Clive Barker's Jericho\", as it feels like there was a lot of love poured into this game (a sign that sometimes developers just need time to improve their craft, perhaps).  Perhaps the weakest aspect of the game is the troublesome fixed camera, which sometimes makes precise platforming hard to pull off in certain situations.At the end of the day, I recommend this game, as it seems like deep, single-player action games are harder to find in these days where the focus seems to be more on multiplayer gaming and maximizing downloadable content sales.  While at times a bit rough-edged, if you're into games such as God of War and Ninja Gaiden, and are looking for a companion piece to those franchises, this game is a worthwhile buy.  I, for one, look forward to a sequel in the not-too-distant future.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2011"}
{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"-Non Fanboy Review- Great system, lacks software","reviewText":"The Wii U is a system I swore up and down I would never get. My girlfriend brings one home and I'm standing there looking at the thing like after you had an awkward fight. There's Injustice: Gods Among Us sitting there in it's tantalizing glory waiting for me to play it. I pull open the box and hook it up. Setting up systems is a nice feeling and doesn't happen very often.After setting it all up, I realize that the first feature to really get me to like the console is the TV remote feature. It's really neat and not something that has ever been implemented into a console before. After I create my Nintendo account and pop in Injustice I start liking the system. The gamepad is easy to hold and super light. This was key to be sure that long periods of play time didn't cramp your hands. The dual analog sticks are very nice and the button layout is perfect. The ergonomics of the gamepad are just spot on. Anyone in doubt, even hardcore haters, just know that this is one of my favorite controllers. The DSi XL stylus comes out and that even surprised me. The triggers and bumpers in the back are laid out perfect. I applaud Nintendo for getting this right. It's so useful! There's so many possibilities with this thing, but the system is only 6 months old.I then notice that the game is playing on the screen. Even if you hate Nintendo it will make you giddy. It's a really cool thing to see. You can take the gamepad, plug in headphones, and play while someone's doing something else on the TV. Why wasn't this around 20 years ago?! This is only for games that don't use the gamepad for much though. My only major complaint is the battery life. Nintendo made this huge oversight and it needs to be fixed.The Wii U was designed for people who already own a Wii, that's obvious. It comes with a Wii sensor bar but no Wiimotes? Pretty stupid actually. I do like that it emulates the Wii menu and you can still use the Wii shop channel. It's nice to see Wii games upscaled into HD, not as crisp as the Wii U games, but still nice.This is also Nintendo's first HD console. They are behind in times (they always are) but the Wii U looks razor sharp on my 50&#8243; 1080p plasma. The colors are rich and vibrant, and some of the games look pretty good. The only issue is that the Wii U has weaker hardware than current gen consoles when it comes to processing power. Nintendo fan boys can scream all they want that it's a next-gen console, but in terms of power it isn't. This is what the Wii should have been.The Wii U has a tri-core 1.24 Ghz \"Expresso\" CPU. Sad. I think Nintendo was trying to keep down costs, but the gamepad seems to have cost them more than the unit itself because it seems like two systems in one. The Wii U has a 550 Mhz GPU \"Latte\" that is AMD based and totally custom made. Combined the Wii U is about 4x as powerful as the PS3, but that's not that big of a jump. The GPU has slightly faster clock and BUS speeds. The Xbox 360 has a tri-core 3.2 GHz CPU while the PS3 has an 8 core CPU (1 PPE 7 SPEs) so right now the Wii U is only about 4x as powerful as the current gen consoles. It's not the big jump that everyone expects. It's like from the GameCube to the Wii (the Wii was only 4x as powerful as the GameCube). It isn't nearly as powerful (about a fraction) as the top PC rigs and Xbox One and PS4. The big disappointment is that the Wii U doesn't support DirectX 11 architecture like the Xbox One and PS4 do. Don't expect seeing Crysis 3 or any other DX11 game on the Wii U. The Wii U has 2GB of DDR3 RAM at 1600Mhz which is about slightly above average RAM speed that people use in PCs. 1GB is held off for system stuff so developers still only have 1GB to work with. Still better than the 256MB that's on current gen consoles, so this is the only leg up the Wii U has. It's still 10x as powerful as the Wii, but that's not saying much.In the end it comes down to games, right now the Wii U is lacking. There are quite a few high budget ports, but they're ports. These games people have played on other consoles. Thankfully there's a huge Wii library out there you can play while you wait, but even the eShop is pretty much empty. I'm impressed with the hardware, but not so much the software. All we can do is wait and see.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2013"}

The game is packed with lots of events, including running, swimming, Javelin throw, Long jumping, triple jumping, etc. The best events in this game are the Dream events, and for one major reason: It combines Mario and Sonic elements into Olympic sports.Dream Race feels like a fun Mario Kart spin-off. It is complete with obstacles, speed panels, and Mario Kart-y items. Dream Platform takes skydiving to big heights (No pun intended) with the Mario bricks, the items, and the button patterns from the Trampoline event. It makes everything a lot more fun.Another great inclusion is playing with your Miis. While it's pretty cool playing with Mario and Sonic in the same game screen, how about add in a Mii version of, oh I don't know, Pac-Man? Or maybe Shigeru Miyamoto (Creator of Mario)?One thing that I just find to be very moan-inducing are the non-Olympic minigames that unlock Olymics trivia if you beat them. Why are they moan-inducing? Well, there's a Simon-based one where you have to click on the characters that appear onscreen in a pattern that mimmicks the example. What's bad about it is that the sound bites from the characters repeat so often that it's just....I don't know..do you want to hear \"Oh, no-Oh, no-Awesome!-Awesome!-Aw, man\"?

I find the gameplay draining and annoying sometimes though.  I have probably 200 game titles, have played them all many times through.  This one is quite good, but some errors were made in how you play and use weapons that makes it extremely difficult to play sometimes.The story is pretty cool, as is the overall feel of the game.  Very art deco, very 1940s-1950s, to post WW2 era.  From the script (terrific voice acting) to the music, to the scenery, to general artwork.  It is convincingly a period piece set in another time.  Even the weapons have a Rube Goldberg feel to the.The characters are interesting for sure.  There are megalomaniacs, actor/musician wannabees, crazy industrialists, lots of \"guys and dolls\", with the clothing, music, and themes to go along.  Very Tracy and Hepburn in many areas.  The story is well documented so I won't go into it here.The basic scene is of a metropolis under ocean, with all the things that make up a great city.  Subways, gardens, doctors offices, apartments, etc.  Really really cool.  Look out the windows of these places and see other \"skyscrapers\" and fish swimming by.  Amazing scenery in many parts of the  game.So on storyline, acting, artwork, imagery, graphics, etc, its 5/5.But now lets get down the gameplay.  Ugh... the Gameplay.I've only went through the game once, but here is my opinion for what its worth.  The game designers and programmers tried to give us flexible weapons, with numerous different types of ammo, as well as super powers to go along with them.  So between all the weapons, different ammo types, and super powers you need to keep track of some 20 different combinations PLUS 32 super power combos at any given time.  PLUS, there are a zillion different \"upgrades\", and changes, plus lots of super powers you keep in a bank.  So keeping track, and getting to the right thing at the right time is excruciatingly painful and frustrating.  Half the time when you die, its cuz you can't get to the right combo.  Even with practice, its mind numbing to keep track.  And ALL of these is controlled by the 3 mouse buttons (or however you map it).  So keeping track of what is in the current slots when you get into a gunfight is basically impossible, unless you have superpowers as well !  Too much to control with 3 buttons for me at least.I understand that the plan was to have lots of ways to deal with all the enemies, and situations.  But there are simply TOO many options.  And keeping your own selections simple means that you run out of resources constantly, and keep dying and having to replay the same things over and over again.Now replaying to progress is part of all shooters, but this one makes it ad nauseum.  Over and over again.  And when you die, you come back in a \"vita chamber\" and it could me miles from where you died, so you have to meander your way back to where you were.I don't want to give the impression that this is a bad game.  On the contrary.  Its terrific in vision and execution, but some of the basic design assumptions were flawed, even though the intent was a good one.  Not the first time and won't be the last time its happened in a great game.  (STALKER comes to mind, as a brilliant game, with many gameplay snafus that have been solved by patches and mods)In conclusion, this is clearly a milestone in design and programming, but be prepared to be baffled and frustrated with zillions of weapons and ammo options, as well as super powers that make little differences or are confusing.  Other than that, highly recommended","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00000JRSB","reviewerName":"Jonathan","summary":"Thoughts from a non-diehard fan to those considering a classic","reviewText":"Let me get this out of the way: I came late to Final Fantasy VII. I played Final Fantasy Adventure on the original Game Boy as a kid, and now that I've grown up into a gamer I figured I'd better go back and play some of the \"classics,\" and FF-VII was near the top of every list I could think of. So this review will be free of nostalgia, since I didn't ever play the game before two months ago.If you're reading this I assume you know the basics (this is an RPG, the first 3D Final Fantasy, et cetera). I'm also going to take for granted that you realize that is game is over a decade old, and as such it's a liitle unfair to compare it to today's games (though it has aged remarkably well).This is an original Playstation title, so it will play on your PS3 (where it's also available as a download from the PSN) and your PS2. You will only be able to save it on the PS2 if you have a PS1 memory card. I don't own a PS3, so I can't vouch for its saving capability.You're tossed into the action from the moment you start the game (this becomes a plot device later, actually). That made me wonder about if the game would be lacking in any kind of non-character-model cutscenes, but I was soon proven wrong: the cutscenes are beautiful, even by today's standards.The combat system uses what's called the Active Time Battle (ATB) system, a decent blend of turn-based and real-time. Each character has a time bar, and when it fills you input a command. Commands are executed one at a time, in the order they were chosen. Bars fill up during selection and sometimes during the execution (depending on the action), giving an element of real-time. I had a gripe with this system as the game went on, as trying to locate one of the hundred or so items on my list was getting my characters hurt, but the feature can be turned off without penalty in the menu.The story is pleasingly deep, both in the main storyline as well as individual storylines for each character. The list of items and equipment is extensive. There is also an extremely high replay value for a single-player game, as the world is so vast, the items so plentiful, and the rewards for sidequesting high, including Yuffie and Vincent (two party characters) and a wealth of exclusive items, usually materia (used to cast magic, add a buff, or add extra abilities) or Limit items, which give characters a sort of ultra attack.Though few and minor, the game does have its flaws. Perhaps the most glaring is the lack of save points (you only get one) in the final level, which is pretty bad considering how devastating a lot of the enemies are. The game usually is portrayed as 3D character running around on what appears to be a 2D matte painting; it looks beautiful, but occasionally is hard to figure out what's a path or exit and what isn't.All told, though, the gripes are far outweighed by the quality of the game. Yes, this game is a classic for a reason. If you have ever played an RPG and liked it, give FF-VII a try. I did, and now I'm a believer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000P297EI","reviewerName":"Jared Burdick \"JBurd\"","summary":"More of the same","reviewText":"I just finished DMC4 and can't say I loved it. The graphics are great, but that is tarnished with so many screens being displayed with a fixed camera. The controls are solid and intuitive with all of the various combos being simple to pull off. Also, the difficulty settings are great. You can go masochisitc like DMC2 or you can make it a one button masher and play all the way through.The main issues with DMC4 are story and reptitiveness. You've played these games and they have changed very little, regardless of the character you are controlling. When I booted up DMC on PS2 for the first time, I was blown away. The second stage after the tutorial starts out and there is immediate sense of Deja Vu, not awe and excitement. I also have a problem with the story. Unlike Drakes Fortune or Heavenly Sword, the story didn't compel me to finish, and since the game played identical to previous installments in the series, I only finished just to justify the money I spent on it. Not a good reason to play through a game.DMC4 has some positives, just not enough to make it worth more than a rental.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00BGA9YZK","description":"","reviewerName":"ceLeon","summary":"First game in the series I've ever played","reviewText":"Summary: After the Day1 update and we were able to play some multiplayer I have to say that if you're a fan of the multiplayer of previous Killzone games, definitely get this. If you're in more for the campaing and single player thing, maybe stick with what we all know and get some of the third party games out there likeCall of Duty: Ghosts - PlayStation 4orAssassin's Creed IV Black Flag Limited Edition - PlayStation 4I'm probably not the best person to review this game if you're looking for a comparison between previous games in the series and this one since I've already played a couple of hours ofKillzone 3 - Playstation 3, the prequel to this. I'll keep updating the review as I play more of the campaign.Graphics 10/10: Some of the levels are incredibly big and really detailed. Character models have improved, even though they looked good on the PS3 you could still see some jagged borders, especially in facial animations. Particles and explosions look a lot better too. As a game that will probably help define the launch of a new generation of consoles, it is probably a good baseline to what we can expect this year and I can't wait for the games that come out in the following years.EDIT: I give it 10/10 after I've seen the entire campaign. Man oh man how this game looks cool!Sound 10/10: I feel like sound design/music get forgotten in videogames most of the time. If it's bad people will notice but if it's as good as this, people take it for granted. Before playing Killzone I thought that for FPS, one of the best sound designs I've heard wasBattlefield 3 - Playstation 3orBattlefield 4 - PlayStation 3and this game's is probably up there too. If you can play this with a big surround sound system, you MUST do it (I still can't use my PS3 virtual surround sound headset)Controls 8/10: The main complaint I've had with this series is the way they handle movement as opposed to how CoD and BF do it. Maybe I'm just used to the other ones a lot more but it takes me a while to get the feel of it. Maybe \"heavier movements\" would be the correct way to describe it. Sniping on this game is fantastic, just way until you do it.Plot 7/10: (In progress). From what I've seen so far, it started setting plot lines in a good way, you can tell it's building the tension for a big ending (I hope), good voice acting helps a lot because it makes it more believable.EDIT: What I said that it's building tension for a big ending/climax... nope... didn't happen. Just finished the campaign and besides admiring how beautiful every level is the story leaves a lot to be desired. It does not reach the level of action and excitement we've come to expect from a big AAA shooter like thisHaving playedKnack (PlayStation 4)(you can check out my review of that one too!) and this, I think I'm going to spend most of my time on this one for the first couple of weeks.Next week:Need for Speed Rivals - PlayStation 4","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2013"}

I've played Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga (SS) as well as Partners in Time (PIT). So far I would rank this new game right up there with SS which was my favorite previously. I'm not sure at this point I would rate it higher but it certainly has as much fun as SS.The gameplay is much the same--I play with D-pad. It does seem like this game can be more stylus driven since there are more directions that have to do with the stylus but I generally prefer Dpad for my RPG's so I haven't tried stylus control. I notice that the response is better in this game than in PIT. In PIT I felt like everything was just a little bit off--I had a harder time getting the Green Shell Bros. attacks to work for a sustained time as well as finding some of the jumping and more platforming elements more difficult amongst other things. I did not find the same thing here. Everything so far has excellent timing and it seems very tight and precise. I am also playing it on the Dsi which may be assisting as the new button and Dpad structure has less \"squish\" than the DS Lite. In PIT it sometimes seemed that the Dpad would cause the characters to take a step beyond where you wanted. That has not happened in BIS.There are some fun mini-games as well to break up the pace a bit but your main game here is still turn based RPG that is more action oriented. Fighitng with the Bros. can get a little repetitive but not so much as to detract. Those who played SS and PIT will not need the tutorials here--it remains essentially unchanged as far as which buttons do what. There are still 2 save slot's so those of you who want to have more than 2 people share are out of luck. Otherwise the new tutorials, while seemingly kind of excessive at first, do offer plenty of instruction for the new player.In this game you control both the Bros. and Bowser (so far not at the same time) and Bowser is on the top screen. Switching between the two is seamless and really mixes it up a lot! I must admit to really enjoying the Bowser pieces--there is something so satisfying about using Bowser's brute strength to punch through rocks or breath fire through a bunch of trees.The story is quite fun and the dialogue, as always, is quite witty. Those of you who thought PIT was a little bit re-hashed with dialogue from SS will not find the same thing here--it is new, fresh, and very funny!Overall: Another great Nintendo Mario title. I would highly recommend it to any gamer who likes RPG's (whether action or turn based) or who just likes Mario and Luigi. Those who are looking for the next great sequel to Super Mario Bros may need to look elsewhere as this is not a platformer game like that one. On the other hand I'd hate to have you miss an excellent game like this so it is still worth getting to check it out. So far nothing objectionable for the kidlet's either. The level of challenge for me as an adult seems a bit light but I'm not through the game completely yet and this is likely to change. Highly and enthusiastically recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2009"}

I was able to play Sonic the Hedgehog 1 and i loved it. I got Sonic the Hedgehog 2 about a year later and it was far greater than one esecially with Sonic's new ability to transform into Super Sonic. Unfortunately that was my last Sonic game and the Sega Genesis was my first and last Sega console. Since i got this game in 2003, i never played a single new Sonic game in 11 years since 1993. In an attempt to clean out my house i sold my Sega Genesis and brought Sonic Mega Collection to make up for my loss. Here's my review for the games on Sonic Mega Collection.SONIC THE HEDGEHOG I: Sonic's first game. The graphics are exactly the same as the Sega Genesis. Still love it despite the fact that it is an old game and technologically less advanced compared to today's games. Robotnik makes his first appearance and begins the Sonic Vs. Robotnik rivalry.  5 starsSONIC THE HEDGEHOG II: Tails makes his debut and Sonic acquires two new features. One, he now can use the spin dash and second, Super Sonic (once you collect all the chaos emeralds). Again still the same as the original. New way to obtain chaos emeralds.  5 starsSONIC THE HEDGEHOG III: Knuckles makes his debut. Everything else is bacially the same except for new levels. new way to obtain chaos Emeralds which i find to be confusing and stupid.5 starsSONIC AND KNUCKLES: The worst game in the entire collection. Too long with no save feature making it annoying an tedious.  0 starsSONIC SPINBALL: I hate pinball games. tried it but fell short several times.  0 starsSONIC 3D BLAST: A great game. Graphics are awesome. Loved it.5 stars.ROBOTNIKS MEAN BEAN MACHINE: A good game. Similar to Dr. Mario. like it.  4 starsOverall: 3 stars.

So this review I will update as I get further in and will only review my experience so far.* Graphics are nice, looks clean and reminds me of Uncharted: Golden Abyss. No frame rate issues during fights like other people have had. Limited pop up.* Sound is as mediocre as everyone has reviewed. I was playing with headphones on and it sounded like I was listening to some one play in the room next to me.* Controls are fluid and easy. Killing people comes as easy as it ever has in AC and is just as fun.* Voice acting is great even though the lackluster sound quality sounds like it was recorded into a tin can circa 1930.So far I haven't had any glitches or game breakers. Granted I downloaded and installed the patch before playing. I don't doubt that people have had the problems they say they have, I just haven't had any problems so far, granted I've only played an hour. I saw one lady on the street walk through a fence in an alley way, but that kind of stuff happens in every game. So it's too soon to say it's the best PS Vita game. I still think Rayman Origins and Uncharted: Golden Abyss are the best handheld games for this system. But being only an hour into Assassins Creed III: Liberation, It is definitely a contender as long as I don't have any problems other people have, i.e. save data corruption and game break glitches.

{"product_name":"B004J6I0YO","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Cooper","summary":"How Did This Make it Past Quality Assurance? Abysmal Sound Makes it Unplayable","reviewText":"As one of the few gamers that never played the original Prince of Persia releases, I eagerly anticipated this HD Trilogy and purchased it yesterday after a significant price cut.Even with the price cut, this collection is a blatant slap in the face to gamers.  The sound quality in all three games is atrocious, to the point of making the games completely unplayable.The sound fxs are WAY too loud: scampering bugs and cries drill into your skull with a series of repetitive onslaughts.  The music is WAY too soft: unless the other tracks are turned completely down it is inaudible.  Lastly, the volume of speech differs between in-game cinematics and cut-scenes.  Therefore, it is either blaring or completely underwhelming.I've encountered less than perfect sound mixes in the Tomb Raider Trilogy (HD collection) and Call of Duty: Black Ops; however, I was able to adjust the sound levels within those games and find an acceptable balance.  The mixing in the Prince of Persia Trilogy is not the worst issue.  The REAL PROBLEM is the quality of the audio.EVERYTHING sounds like it is being broadcast through a tin can and then transmitted with reverb set to +11.  Effects are also frequently absent or out of place: explosions and rock slides may have no audio whatsoever, while a water fountain at the end of a hallway booms with the verocity of Niagra Falls. Between the abhorrent tonal qualities and discontinuous sounds the audio is beyond mere mediocrity. Not only that, dolby digital doesn't work properly and the sound needs to be set to 2 channels.I have many HD collections: Metal Gear Solid, God of War, God of War: Origins, Jak & Daxter, Tomb Raider Trilogy, and Ico & Shadow of the Colossus.  When I purchase an HD collection, I EXPECT the same sort of HD treatment.Graphically the HD 16:9 looks on par with other collections.  The menu system is terrible though, and will not let you choose from other games without quitting to the PS3 home menu.  They also forgot to add sound effects for choosing between the 3 games or options.All in all, this is a LAZY, AWFUL port that should NOT have made it through Quality Assurance.  As a big fan of the Assassin's Creed series, I expected more from Ubisoft.  I've eagerly anticipated playing these games for a long time, but playing through them with this sound quality is absolute torture.The Prince of Persia Trilogy is the worst port, or \"upgrade\" release I have ever purchased.  If Ubisoft had any respect for its fans it would patch the issues or recall the original versions.  If this was a film release of a classic, people would be in an uproar!For newcomers, the sound is an immediate disconnect from the series.  For longtime fans, this release is the equivalent of gaming blasphemy.  So let me ask you, WHY have people allowed this to happen to a classic trilogy without more negative feedback?","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00008Z0HX","reviewerName":"Dmg","summary":"Terrible copy protection and game","reviewText":"Ubisoft incorporated the copy protection software knows as Tages into XIII. This is singlehandedly the worst copy protection known to man. It's so bad that if you have a CD-RW or DVD-RW drive in your computer, the installation of the game will most likely purposely defect itself towhere the game won't run. If you have CD or DVD burning software, or anything even related, or any virtual drives, the same will most likely happen; defective installation. The game's &quot;Minimum Requirements&quot; are a lie since they're so low, and you need brand-new, up-to-date drivers for all your hardware. Not only all that, but the game straight out doesn't like some CD/DVD-ROM drives and thus won't install properly, or even at all. Ubisoft support does nothing.After all this, you'd think they were protecting a really nice game. But, no. The game is riddled with bugs and crashes. Major bugs are commonplace, and the official forum is thriving with hundreds of user requests for bug/crash help. The game also spans 4 CDs (for no apparent reason - the game is very short) that seemingly randomly need to be changed (more copy protection). This leads to scratched discs you can't duplicate, thus you must buy the entire game again.The game is beautiful and mildly entertaining, albeit short, buggy, and contains terrible voice acting and a horrid saving scheme. That's if you can even get it to install! What a waste of money.Beware!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2004"}

{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube. For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"nafysmiley","summary":"Hurray for Zombies!","reviewText":"Resident Evil is awesome.  It is one of the coolest games ever, one of my new all-time favorites, and for quite awhile to come will be the reason to own a Gamecube.  Resident Evil is a lot of fun.  And it has zombies.I guess I've got to mention the graphics first.  They are, in my humble opinion, the absolute best graphics in a console game to date.  It's the only game to even attempt to have people actually take steps and walk on the actual stairs.  The characters, the monsters, the walls, everything is great.  The lighting and shadow effects are excellent, creating some fun situations in which you can't see a monster, but you can see a massive zombie silhouette on the wall.  The graphics really help to set the creepy mood and atmosphere of the game.  The music also adds much to the atmosphere, and is very well done.  The sound is very good, and the eerie moans of distant zombies is a constant reminder of where you are.The story is solid, and very cool.  Most of the plot is just atmosphere, but that's fine.  The basic premise is that the STARs, a special police force, is sent in to investigate some gruesome murders around Raccoon city.  They are forced into a mansion by a pack of ravenous zombie dogs.  The mysterious mansion is full of zombies.  You can be either Chris or Jill, who have separate plots, but they are fairly similar simply because they are both in the same mansion.  Jill's is also easier.  Zombies are cool enough, but there are also several other very cool types of monsters, especially at the end.  The boss monsters are no exception.The controls aren't nearly as terrible as everyone says, even if they aren't good.  As a Resident Evil veteran, I've become very used to them, and you will to, if you play for awhile.  Auto-aim and 180 degree turns compensate quite a bit for the clunky controls.  It also helps to use the D-pad, rather than the analog stick.Resident Evil isn't exactly easy, but it also isn't as difficult as many say.  For one part, the puzzles in the game are very simple, and easy to solve.  For another, the actual gameplay itself isn't too hard once you get used to the controls.  The main difficulty is that if you aren't careful, it is easy to run out of healing items and ammunition, especially at the beginning.  By the end, I had plenty of bullets.  You could play through on easy, but then there are hardly any zombies at all, and then the game becomes kind of boring, as well as being less scary.  And it  is all about the scariness and the atmosphere, after all.If you played the original Resident Evil, like I have, it is definitely worth playing through the remake.  It is a much better game.  I'm not going to throw out numbers like \"70% new content\", but it is much different.  The main layout is still the same, with parts added on, but many room's contents and design are completely changed, and most of the puzzles are different, to some degree.  With both playable characters, and several unlockable features (like invisible zombies, hard mode, and infinite magnum) Resident Evil does have a lot of replay value anyway.Resident Evil takes about 8-9 hours of in-game time to beat the first time through, with either character.  Everything considered, if you haven't enjoyed other survival horror games, you probably won't like this, although the graphics will still impress most anyone.  If you've liked other survival horror games, specifically the Resident Evil series, they you should definitely pick this up, as it is the best straight survival horror game yet.  If you haven't played the genre, Resident Evil is a great one to try.  If it sounds cool, try it out.  You'll probably like it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2002"}

It featured next-generation gameplay, coupled with that a deep storyline, unforgettable characters and some of the best audio/visual presentations ever conceived. Now that classic has been revamped for Nintendo's GameCube. While Metal Gear veterans shouldn't expect anything drastically new in this version, it's still nonetheless a cinematic masterpiece that both seasoned fans and newcomers alike will both enjoy.You are Solid Snake, the legendary hero sent in to a secret Alaskan base to discover the whereabouts of Metal Gear Rex and whether the terrorists have the ability to create a nuclear strike. The gameplay elements from Sons of Liberty can be found here such as first-person shooting, hanging from ledges, and hiding in lockers. While they're not required to play through Twin Snakes' levels, it's still a welcome change even though its more of an option.Visually, Twin Snakes is one of the better-looking GameCube titles. It's slightly more detailed than Sons of Liberty. The game does tend to suffer from slowdown and the framerate is almost never constant. The level designs haven't gone through any significant change but the newly enhanced real-time cutscenes will surely draw players in. Sound-wise, the sound effects from the original are still intact. One disappointment is that some of the memorable songs from the original soundtrack have been altered. MGS vets will also recognize that a couple character voices have been dubbed differently as well.Twin Snakes isn't in the same veins of a remake like what Capcom did with Resident Evil. It may be basically the same game that was released back in 1998, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Players can finally be able to play Metal Gear Solid in its best version yet, and although this reimagination of that classic hasn't broken any new territory, the fun still remains.

I liked the ideas behind assassins creed but never could get into the game-something about having to sneak around the entire time and not go to fast really killed the fun for me. Infamous I enjoyed throughly more, loving the open feeling of Empire City and even the simple task of climbing buildings and beating the crap out of gang baddies made it an enjoyable experience but it did get repetitive fast-recycling the same old missions over and over again.Needless to say, I finally broke down and bought this game for $30 and I have not regretted it for one minute. The controls off the bat take a bit to get used to and the missions seem more like chores but are effective to get you used to the concepts of the game and how it works. Once you become acclimated to what's going on the game begins to become tons of fun.Like any good open world sandbox game, there are plenty of both main and side missions along with plenty of other things to do. The way in which this game just really shines is the sheer simple realness of the world that is created. You're really in the wild west. Every detail from the buzzing of insects, the rattles of snakes, the barking of dogs, the dust blowing, the plants, everything looks and sounds amazing. That's where this game really becomes special too. Every detail of every rock, every bush you can pick, every animal you hunt, every horse you ride really helps make you feel like a gun slinging rough rider in the prime of the west.The storyline is interesting and on the surface is quite enjoyable, notably, you end up running errands for everyone and their mother and if that's how you see every mission, you might not enjoy this game much at all. But if you're willing to go along with the game and as you delve deeper into the characters and discover Marstin's character more and delve even deeper into the side challenges, mini-games, hunting, conquering gang hide-outs and all that the world of Red Dead Redemption you'll find plenty to do and enjoy and the storyline becomes more interesting the more you become involved with the characters.I'm not sure after reading the reviews what your hesitation is in picking up this game. Whether you're looking for a fun western game or are a fan of open world sandbox games this is one of the best games you'll play and is easily at a price that you can't miss. This game is a masterpiece in almost every respect and ultimately succeeds because it recreates a beautiful world that is believable and more importantly tons of fun to play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2011"}

Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission. Train and equip your team to survive insurmountable odds.Explore the Galaxy- Scan planets to uncover unique secret missions in theMass Effectuniverse.Integration with OriginalMass Effect- Players of the firstMass Effectcan import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. New players will find a thrilling stand-alone adventure awaits them, a polished and action packed journey that surpasses the first game in nearly every possible way.Intense Third-Person Combat- Increased intensity with precision shooter controls to let you control the action and overcome insurmountable odds.New Damage System- New location based damage system allows for targeting of key weak points, blasting off limbs, igniting enemies, or cripple and disable enemy troops.Character Customization- Choose a player class, customize your appearance, and tailor your own abilities and strengths. As you progress, so do Shepard&rsquo;s abilities.Improved Dialogue Mechanic- Improved NPC conversation system where Commander Shepard can take matters into your own hands &ndash; interrupting or using force to get the answer required.","reviewerName":"Greg","summary":"The Saga Continues...","reviewText":"Yes, this is the best, most satisfying game of the three.  So there.Mass Effect 2 is probably the best the Xbox has to offer when it comes to blending story into gameplay.  It's not the best shooter you'll ever play, it's not the most robust RPG (not even close), but somehow all elements come together in what is one of the most compelling, most satisfying experiences you can get from a console game.  Much like its predecessor, the biggest payoffs come in the third act, and the more time and effort you've put into team members and side missions up until then, the more compelling and satisfying an experience it is.  It's also one of the few sequels I've ever seen (and this is a hallmark of the series) that's BETTER if you've played the original.That's something, isn't it?  I mean, is Gears 2 better or worse if you've played Gears 1?  Marginally, maybe.  But Mass Effect 2 is an exponentially more satisfying game if you've taken the time to dig through the first one.  In effect, the sequel adds replay value to the original, which feeds replay value back to the sequel again.  If that isn't a masterful stroke of artistry and brilliant way to get the most out of an interactive medium, I don't know what is.But that's all high concept stuff.  Let's strip some nuts and bolts.Visually, the game's a treat.  Colors are richer, but still in the same palette, so the world still feels like the Mass Effect world (which is nice).  Locations are busier, with a great deal of added detail and the NPC's are more dynamic and mobile, which is a nice touch.  The locations that are supposed to be crowded now feel it and your inundated with things like advertisements and news reels when you're on the Citadel or in any major population hub; it's  really smart design all the way across.  Wealthy areas feel posh and poor areas feel shady and dangerous.  The wilds are wild and ruins are ruined - I can't think of a location or character that doesn't employ some sort of successful design element.  The world we knew has been bumped up, polished off, enhanced and yet is still the world we knew.  That's no small feat.Combat has been GREATLY improved.  For better or worse, we now have a dedicated cover button, which works well enough (some will like it, some won't).  Enemies are where we see the greatest improvements and they now employ a variety of strategies and you'll have to adjust your survival tactics based on the type of character you're playing.  The baddies have also been given a series of different skills and protections, like armor or biotic barriers, which forces you to readjust the types of weapons or ammo or skills you chuck at them.  It's a much richer and more immersive experience overall.  The redesign is most effective when it comes time to square off against a Krogan.  A huge chunk of the games mythology is dedicated to just how powerful and dangerous the Krogan are.  And yet, in the last game, fighting them was just like fighting anything else.  But now, watching a Krogan charge down the aisle, shields up and shotgun out, will just about ruin your day!  It's a nice touch and another layer of rich gameplay.So, the action's been bumped, is what I'm saying.I do lament the loss of some RPG elements, I must say.  Instead of the dozen or more skill sets you could balance in the last one, we now just level up about six or so different 'powers'(even less for team members).  An infiltrator is no longer different from a soldier because of how you choose to develop it, but simply by virtue of having completely different 'powers'.  It's a narrower approach that's going to bother a lot of people (myself included).  It's not BAD, or BROKEN in any way, it's just an unnecessary step to the side.  I don't really understand it, myself, but there it is.Other things have changed, but it's not all that important: the Mako's gone, as is the barren planet exploration.  Take that for what it is.  The hacking mini-games have been replaced with some different ones.  Whatever.  Inventory's gone and replaced by a few armor upgrades and a few different weapons.  Eh, it is what it is.And, wait, what's this 'thermal clips' crap?  One of my favorite little Sci-Fi touches to the previous game was the idea that guns had advance so much that they didn't even need bullets anymore.  They literally ripped chunks of metal from a block you put in them, so they could essentially carry thousands of rounds at a time and all you had to do was keep it from overheating.  Now I'm back to bullet hunting and ammo hording?  Boo, I say, boo.All that aside, what the game is really about is character and character development.  You've got a team of about 11 distinct individuals this time around, a big jump from the last game.  And that's because building your team and gaining their loyalty is almost the ENTIRE focus.  Yes, there's a main enemy - the Collectors, a group of creepy-ass bug-alien-things that are abducting humans by the tens of thousands from around the galaxy.  They're a worthy addition to the series and their mythology just adds to the tapestry... but you only encounter them three or four times throughout.  The rest of the time is wholly focused on building (or ruining) relationships with the people around you.  You come to know them, come to care about them and, by extension, the piece of the galactic stage they represent.  We have avatars of Turian stubborness and frustration, Quarian desperation, Salarian genius and guilt, Krogan ferocity and hopelessness - it's all woven so well and we get a ton of information in really efficient ways.  Add onto that some seriously effective voice acting and when the endgame comes, when the lives are in your hands for the first time... Well, the way the final mission plays out is VASTLY variable and immensely satisfying.  It all depends on how much effort you've put into your crew and how successful you were at building them up.  The many branches you can take and their spread of outcomes adds a great deal of tension to the final scenes and lends itself to multiple play-throughs.Again, as I said before, it's a masterful blend of story and gameplay.  To the point where any problems it may have are almost completely dismissible.  It's a must play, as simple as that, awkward sex scenes and all...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2012"}

Well, I have been playing Oblivion since its release (about 7 characters that got around level 47, with about 300 hours each), and now, finally, last night (midnight launch, yay). I was able to start playing Skyrim. This IS one of the very few games that \"lives up to the hype.\" I know I don't have to go into detail, those of you who are also playing it, especially if you have been along for the Elder Scrolls evolution journey, know EXACTLY what I am talking about. Those few of you trolls, that like to post poor reviews on games like this, just to get all of us riled up, guess what, I just ignore you.Anyway, this will be sort of brief, because, first, I only have a few hours in (dang it I fell asleep at about 0400), and, more importantly, after this I'm getting right back to it. Without being too \"spoilery,\" as they say at Bethesda, you start out (as usual), as a prisoner. You get asked a question that throws you into \"character creation.\" Something happens (like last time) that will facilitate your escape. This first \"quest\" is basically a tutorial for you; like last time, once you exit this area and come out into the world, you are free to either continue the main story quest, or do whatever you like. Also as before, you have picked up quite a bit of gear relative to your beginning encumbrance (I started at 300). So, first thing I did of course, was look for a shop, and sold most of that stuff off, and made me some gold. Right now, I'm just exploring on my own; I already have the next stops in the main quest, and about 5 other side or miscellaneous quests, acquired by just talking to folks, in my journal.On the difference in \"skills\" and \"leveling:\" I like it. The way it works now, instead of simply getting to 50 in a skill, and becoming a \"journeyman,\" when you level up (I'm level 2 now), you go to a menu that looks like constellations in the skey, and you pick whether to increase your Health, Magicka, or Stamina. Then, comes the cool part...you receive a \"perk;\" you can either spend the perk you receive then, or save it for later. You can use a perk when you meet the skill level it requires, and have the pre-requisite perk already (i.e. you can't use one perk to jump from novice to master...you have to move up the 'skill tree' in order). What all this means is, YOU can select what you become expert at; you can be a warrior character and rise quickly to master of illusion etc. I like this MUCH better than Oblivion's \"rest and meditate on what you have learned,\" etc.The main reason the Elder Scrolls games are my favorites is, they are that rare \"open world\" \"open choice\" game. You can do the main quest, and nothing else. You  can spend hundreds of hours wandering on your own, clearing out caves, fighting bandits, etc, and never touch any quests at all. You can do a faction quest, and nothing else. You can be a good knight (if you don't do the theives guild/dark brotherhood quests), or go around killing everyone you see. It's ALL up to you.Well I can't stand it, I'm going to save this review, and go play Skyrim for the rest of the day. If you have the game, you know what I'm talking about. if you don't, get it. The words highly recommended don't do it justice. As far as how I would rate it: 5 out of 5 10 out of 10, you get the idea.Ok really, I'm going now. GET THIS GAME.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2011"}

The day the Sega Dreamcast was launched with a few dozen titles available at launch. One of them was Sonic Adventure. I have played every Genesis Sonic game for hours and hours and have been a huge fan of Sonic ever since. I was very excited when I got this game with my Dreamcast.I started to play with Sonic. The game was awesome. Then I realized you could play with five other characters. Tails, Knuckles, Big, the robot, and Amy. Each character has 3 or so levels for each of them and are also very different for each character. Each character is very fun to play as especially Sonic, Knuckles and Tails. Surprisingly Big and the robot are very fun to play with. But Sega should never have created such a dumb character as Amy. She is very annoying, hard to play with and is very hard to control as well.This game has a few flaws though, like falling through the floor for no reason at all. Also, the camera angles are not the way you want them to be very often and this game is too easy on all levels for almost all of the characters. Sonic Adventure is also kind of short.Even with these few flaws, Sonic Adventure is a great game, that will keep you playing for hours on end having a ton of fun. If you're a real Sonic fan do yourself a favor and go buy this game and Sonic Adventure 2 right now!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2002"}

The game simply wouldn't be as fun without it. Things like firing a cannon is a lot more intuitive using the Wii Remote, but the most obvious utilisation of the controller is the cursor, which you can dart around the screen at all times to collect Starbits (used to unlock several 'mini-game' galaxies) and them fire them back at the screen using the B trigger.The main means of interaction in Galaxy is through shaking the Remote, which executes Mario's new spin attack. Punch and kick moves have been axed for this new means of interaction, which makes sense, as it's incorporated in the gameplay for tasks like activating cannon-like launch stars and swinging up vines. Thankfully it's not just another example of dodgy Wii 'waggle'.Grapple stars are perhaps the most brilliant example of Galaxy's Wii Remote use. Using the remote cursor you simply aim and press A to home Mario in on the stars, allowing you to 'grab' and hop between lines of them like grapple points, all the while dodging space mines and projectiles. It's incredibly satisfying and is the set-up for some fantastic racing sequences later on.Galaxy also plays around with gravity and physics like no Mario game before it. You'll flip gravity to navigate giant block mazes, use a planet's gravity to propel yourself to a new platform and shoot into the stars. It's not as revolutionary as Mario 64, but it certainly re-defines what we expect from a 3D platformer.The concept of running around giant spheres can be daunting at first; if there's no pulsating black hole underneath your planet, falling off the edge just doesn't come into the equation. Without the pulling power of the black holes, no matter where you run or jump gravity will twist and pull you towards the planet, allowing you to run all the way around it and even jump to other planets by hopping into their gravitational pull. It's awesome.If you're on a flat, orbiting platform you can run right underneath it, which opens up all kinds of gameplay that would be impossible under Mario 64's laws of gravity - and allows the scale of Mario's playgrounds to grow to genuinely draw-dropping proportions.Shooting off into the stratosphere in one of Galaxy's many willy-waving cinematic moments, there were actual gasps at the beauty and scale of the starry world around us. The void-ish nature of Galaxy's world means Nintendo has been able to spend polygons liberally on the environment and it's easily the most draw-dropping game on Wii. And yes, we do mean draw-dropping.Just like Mario 64 the game takes place in a hub world, this time around a starship headed up by space-age princess Rosalina and her race of Lumas (they're the little star blokes). Predictably, the Lumas need you to get collect stars to get their ship up and running again so you can chase down the star-bound Bowser. There are 120 to collect - many hidden - and it'll take you about as long as '64 to collect them all (and that's a good few hours).After the disappointingly similar environments of Sunshine there's thankfully a much larger variety of worlds this time around too. Amazingly, despite the fact there are now only three \"story\" stars to collect per world, Galaxy's playgrounds aren't all pint-sized either (although there are one-off \"platforming\" worlds - which are rock hard and bloody brilliant).I was delighted to find that the majority are as big - if not larger - than the locales of Mario 64, and unlike Sunshine many will make you smile like the time you first dived into the pirate cove in Mario 64.It's a consistently surprising experience and I wouldn't dare spoil it for you, but Galaxy will take you places that will remind you why you play videogames","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2007"}

I enjoy the campaigns across all 3 of the games but this one seems to be the best of the bunch. Gears 1 being a very close second (as is the case with most trilogies). The Horde mode is back and WAY better than before. New Tower Defense like additions make it much more playable and they jacked the difficulty up a great amount as well. They've also turned the tables and added a Beast mode with is horde in reverse- you play the Locusts. It's fun, it's very, very fun.Then there's the online vs. I hate Gears online. I hate it. I hated it before and on some nights, I hate it even more on this release. BUT- I can at least play this one. All the glitches that make Gears so horrible are still there. Shotgun rolling deaths, Weapon charge/hoarding, spawn camping... Elite players dominating a game by 10x as many kills as anyone else. It's always been horribly balanced and this one is no exception. It's playable this go around, but you'll very quickly see the old issues creep right back in and ruin the game.Graphically, Gears has always been a high water mark for the 360 and it is once again. Simply gorgeous in every respect. Sound is also amazing, from the FX to the Voice work.So it's Gears of War 3. If you're realistic about what to expect, it's everything you'd hope for. If you love Gears online, you'll be happy. If you love the campaigns, you'll be VERY happy. I give it a 4 star because I'm very much a \"play with buddies only\" guy and the Campaign as well as the co-op modes are a blast.

I didn't like it all that much at first, but after picking it up I really got to like it.  This game is very precise and fairly realistic, which makes it hard to learn, but also a lot of fun to play once you have.The animation and sound in this game are spectacular.  You build all sorts of amusement park attractions for your guests, and then you watch them walk around your park like little ants.  All of the sounds of a theme park are there.  The clickety-clack of the roller coaster chains, the screams of the riders as the coaster plunges down the hill, and the laughs of the children and yes.  The programmers even included the cheesy music that they play for the bumper cars.Anything that moves can be clicked on and examined.  The level of precision and the amount of choices that you have in this game are fantastic, and sometimes overwhelming.  The game consists of twenty-some scenarios that gradually get harder.  Each time that you finish one, you get a new challenge, which keeps the game from getting too easy as you become more proficient.The roller coasters have realistic physics.  This is both good and bad.  The good part -- if you are a roller coaster enthusiast, then you will love being able to design a working coaster.  You control everything, from the height of the first drop to the colors of the trains.  The bad part - designing even a mediocre coaster can get very tedious and expensive.  One big coaster will chew up all of your cash, and if you are playing a short scenario, you probably won't be able to build another one.  In addition, coasters take up a lot of space, and because of this, your park usually runs out of it.  I have played almost all of the scenarios, and I have never really gotten to build the \"ultimate\" mega-coaster.The one aspect of this game that I found to be annoying was the tendency of kids to get sick from your rides.  This aspect of the game was BADLY overdone (maybe the writers thought it was supposed to be cute).  Even if they don't get sick, a lot of them will be afraid to ride it.  The park customers are total wimps.  You can build a 120-foot tall standup roller coaster with 3 inversions and nobody will ride it, because it is too \"intense\" (whatever that means).  The roller-coaster physics might be realistic, but the customer behavior definitely is not.  This is one of a few examples of questionable AI in this game.

{"product_name":"B00002CF9M","description":"InDiablo II, players return to a world of dark fantasy. As one of five distinct character types, players explore the world ofDiablo II, journey across distant lands, fight new villains, discover new treasures, and uncover ancient mysteries. Since the beginning of time, the forces of order and chaos have been engaged in an eternal struggle to decide the fate of all creation. That struggle has now come to the mortal realm, and neither man, demon, nor angel will be left unscathed. Diablo, lord of terror and youngest of the three prime evils, awakes from his long sleep beneath the dark earth. Setting in motion a grand scheme to free his exiled brothers, Mephisto and Baal, Diablo takes control of the small western kingdom of Khanduras. Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo grips the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia. Ultimately, as even Khanduras's good King Leoric falls under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arises to challenge the darkness that engulfs the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronts the lord of terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit can never be truly destroyed, the hero makes the noblest sacrifice of all--casting his soul and his very sanity aside, he takes the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will can contain the demon within. The hero doesn't realize that his selfless act will not only ensure Diablo's victory, but will also irrevocably damn his soul for all time.","reviewerName":"TigerPomme \"tigerpomme\"","summary":"Again?","reviewText":"It's funny how game developers strike on a theme or concept and consider it a gold mine. And like your average gold mine, it's used for a while, some times for years, but before anyone realizes it, it starts to run out. And so like many crazy miners, the game developers keep mining hoping to strike that gigantic hidden vein. Well, Blizzard hit the gold mine with original Diablo. I myself admit, that I stayed up for all hours of the night playing Diablo by myself, on my LAN, and on Blizzard.net. Shame to admit it, I played the game until I reached Hell, then replayed with different characters (Big whoop) and played again using the &quot;evil&quot; hackers tools (GASP!). So when Diablo II was announced, I eagerly awaited the release of the sequel. I announced my retirement from Diablo, ordered and got the Limited Edition of Diablo II and . . . was disappointed.Really disappointed. My first mistake was accessing Battle.Net the day of release, nay the month of release. Blizzard stress tested the new network for Diablo II due to a fundamental change in how network play is handled. Well,. . . They stress tested for 10,000 people. Well, 70,000 Limited Edition Diablo II's were printed on top of who knows how many of the regular edition and the server was crippled for several months. What did Blizzard think? That we would graciously limit ourselves 10,000 people at a time? (10,000 world wide if I understand the news wheel correctly.) Granted the change was for the best. I myself was getting annoyed by the vast number of Cheating Player Killers (CPK) using special software to &quot;survive&quot; anything. Many honest players were forced to use the very same hackers tools just to enjoy the game. The network was changed for Diablo II to prevent this type of cheat in an &quot;honest&quot; game. At least Blizzard didn't lose all of their brain cells. Blizzard did work hard to improve the AT&amp;T servers for game play and now thanks to their hard work server down time is somewhat minimized (albeit hardly perfected. We game players are an impatient bunch.)And now on to the graphics. Well,. . . The graphics are nothing new. Still problems with the Voodoo 2 series of the cards (under certain circumstances it appears that you are looking through a sheet of water.) Monsters are still ho hum, areas are um . . the same random maps. Not much difference except the &quot;bowled&quot; effect. Not sure why blizzard implemented this, perhaps to give the player a better &quot;perspective&quot;? Things kind of do look more &quot;distant&quot; as the object reach the edge of the screen. Whatever.Controls are the same. The game now makes better use of the keyboard however the entire game can still be played without ever touching the keyboard. Both points are good. I like the fact that belt items are a variable (4 for the first belt, 8 for the next belt, 12 for the next belt and so on and so on.) however, many may not like the newer compact look of the screen. They may not realize that this is by design to allow the player more visible gaming area. Item finding is vastly improved (how many times did we squint at the screen to find a stupid ring.) pressing a chosen key highlights the items for easy finding.Also, managing and using your character has never changed from the original. It's still easy to look at the farious stats and items that you have. However, I've never liked how much screen real estate this process has to take.I find that the characters are somewhat unbalanced for game play. I can't really decide if this is good or bad. It is clear that one character will certainly stand out as the best for player to player combat, not good. As well as another character will become the best for single player games and another will be the best for &quot;grouping.&quot; I do like the &quot;unique&quot; spells and abilities of each character. But is all this better than the &quot;vanilla&quot; characters of Diablo I? It certainly is, but by how much I'm not too certain.There really isn't much to say about this game. Giving or not giving a star for each quality, I rated the game like thus. One star for the solid, but very stock, graphics. One star for the extremely refined controls. However I have to force a loss of one star for the quirkiness of the battle.net servers. &quot;Is that fair?&quot; you may ask. Well, yes, You see, playing Diablo II by yourself is only 50% of the game. Playing online or on a LAN is the other 50%. Online play is such an integral part of the experience of this game that I feel that Blizzard's service should be included in the rating. Sorry guys and gals. I can't decide whether to give or take one star for the characters. I would rather give half a star but amazon doesn't allow that, therefor I'll be nice and round up. One star for the character selection and development. The final star goes towards overall addiction. This game is indeed addictive, however care should be exercised that boredom won't creep in. All in all, three and a half stars rounded up to four. This game needs to be viewed as an extension of the original instead of the a whole new version and your enjoyment will increase. The price is a bit high as of this writing but I feel it is worth the hard earned cash (or credit in our modern world).On a final note, (yes, I'm positive, no more paragraphs.) some of you may wonder why I don't always include music and sound in my reviews. It is because I am a part of the deaf community (although, I myself am not deaf.) I am keenly aware that deaf people often really don't care about music in a game so therfor I tend to leave those out. In case you are wondering, the music in Diablo II is far better than that found in Diablo I. Much more moody and awe inspiring, it certainly sets the pace of the game.Thanks for reading!TigerPomme","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2000"}

{"product_name":"B00004TSXC","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"It's a Niche Game, Not Everyone Will Enjoy It Like I Did","reviewText":"If I could think of a way to best describe Neverwinter Nights, it would be Diablo meets Baldur's Gate. The game is made by the same people that designed Baldur's Gate but it's more of a mainstream \"hack and slash\" adventure than an epic RPG. Don't get me wrong, the in-game story is great but it just doesn't feel like a classic RPG. One reason for this might be because of the easy-to-use Aurora Toolset. If you've ever messed around with PC game editors, this one will probably be the easiest custom content maker you'll ever use. It was designed that way so that D&D fans everywhere could quickly create their own adventures. (The game even allows you to act as a Dungeon Master with your spiffy new adventures.) Unfortunately, the official adventure included with Neverwinter Nights also uses the same toolset that was designed for \"Joe Schmoe\" and something probably gets lost in the process because each map uses the same same grid design and 3-D structures. Frankly, most maps just feel the same and after all is said and done, the offical campaign in NWN comes across as an average gaming experience. Keep in mind too that while it's very easy to place items and creatures with the toolset, you'll need a basic knowledge of programming to script actions in your module. If you're convinced that this game is for you, check out the newer Neverwinter Nights Gold which comes with the original game as well as the first expansion (Shadows of Undrentide). You may even want to wait a little longer because the second and last expansion (Hordes of the Underdark) just came out and undoubtedly, it will soon be packaged in a newer \"platinum\" edition. Make sure you check the official Bioware website so that you can download one of the many custom adventures designed by gamers. There is also a fairly large online community and many gamers have set up their own servers that are up and running 24/7 for online D&D fun. I had a good time with Neverwinter Nights, but not everyone may find the game as enjoyable, especially if they don't like online play or the easy-to-use toolset. If you enjoy the feel and gameplay of NWN, it has an extremely long lifespan because of the online community, but many gamers don't find the game that appealing to begin with.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2004"}

Meeting up with hammer brothers is no longer a thrill, because they are just so much less of a threat than they were in SMB and SMB3. Strangely, I haven't found a single SMB2 enemy in the game yet.I am surprised that Princess Toadstool, erm, Peach would kill so many things, and I am surprised that she would team up with someone who eats living creatures just to steal their emotions.

If you decide that the game designers made a bad choice and shouldn't have placed Enemy X in such and such place, just get mad, start a fire, and chances are the enemy is dead.The game isn't perfect, some segments are not that interesting or just too easy, but if Nintendo makes a spinoff this interesting, just maybe the new Mario Bros. game will stand up to the high standard the old games in the series set.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2006"}

It also doesn't officially live up to the name of its title, as there are run-n-gun assault missions and chances to swap your sniper rifle for a machine gun when playing as the sniper.  Nevertheless, this is still a pretty good game that is ultimately a unique breath of fresh air in the cookie-cutter world of seventh-gen FPSs.SGW attempts to offer a realistic sniping experience, and it mostly succeeds on that front.  You can't just put the crosshair over the target and automatically kill them.  You have to adjust your aim to account for target distance, wind direction, bullet drop, and heart-rate intensity.  Additionally, you have a special ability to slow down time when you're aiming through a scope, making it easier to take out multiple enemies before they have a chance to react.  For the icing on the cake, whenever you score a solid headshot, you're treated to a special bullet-cam that tracks the bullet in slow motion from the barrel of your gun to the enemy's head, which explodes in a big shower of blood.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2014"}

Blizzard has taken care to make the game accessible and fun both for hard-core 60-hour-a-week players and for more casual adventurers.","reviewerName":"Ethan D Van Vorst","summary":"World of Warcraft Withdrawal","reviewText":"I have played all of Blizzard's previous Warcraft games, starting way back when with Warcraft I: Orcs and Humans in the early 90's. With each new game the series got deeper and by the end of Warcraft III it was clear that Blizzard was getting too deep storywise for another RTS game to adequately handle. I'm going to *greatly* miss playing Warcraft RTS games, because I've a sinking suspicion that they're not going to ever make another. World of Warcraft, for better or worse, is the wave of the future. More like a tidal wave of pure gaming heroin. This game builds upon the lore already laid down in the previous games in the franchise and immerses the player into one of the most well-thought out online games I've ever seen.I should mention that while it's not necessary to have played the game's forebears it definitely adds to the overall enjoyment. You can visit famous battle sites and view some of the leftover relics of said battles in Loch Modan and Hillsbrad, be it destroyed Alliance ballistas or Horde watch towers . Swim around the sunken wrecks of Elvish Destroyers. Follow Arthas' path to insanity from Strahnbrad all the way to Stratholme, and see the aftermath of his actions in the ruins of the capital city of Lordaeron. Great pains have obviously been taken to provide previous Warcraft players with lots of detailed eye candy of historical battle sites that the players themselves commanded in the previous game installments.The game itself allows you to play in one of two factions; Horde or Alliance. Horde faction allows the player to choose from several races; Orc, Tauren, Troll, Undead, or Blood Elf (if you have the Burning Crusade expansion). Alliance allows you to play a Human, Gnome, Dwarf, Night Elf, or Dranei, the latter if you, again, have the expansion. Each race has it's own starting city. Each major city has an adjacent \"Newbie zone\" which allows new players to gradually advance in level in phases, without dumping the uninformed player right in the middle of things, much like Ever Quest did. In addition to the race selection players can choose your standard class types, from Paladin, Warrior, Shaman, Mage, Priest, and the usual assortment of types.As the player advances from the earliest levels they'll have the opportunity to engage in certain tradeskills. With this set of alternate \"jobs\" players can craft new swords, make rifles, brew potions and tinctures, manufacture leather goods, and the like. This is not shoved down the players throats and is completely optional.At it's root this game, like many before it, is a game about favors. You, as the player, are constantly doing \"favors\" for various NPC's. \"I need you to kill X number of X for me\", or \"Gather X number of this raw material for me\" style quests. The quests themselves are not *nearly* as complex as they were with Ever Quest, where making a simple Soulfire paladin sword involved something near 20 individual steps and 5 or 6 unique actions. The quests in WoW are overly formulaic and one is nearly identical to the next, and that may eventually drive some people to boredom. Personally I am a big fan of solo play and don't like to be bothered with grouping unless there's no other way around a quest. WoW caters to my type almost perfectly, but also rewards those that like to group. In fact you'll find that the best weapons, armor, and items drop during group excursions, prompting even soloers like me to engage in group quests when the need arises.World of Warcraft does provide ample rewards for the player that make up for any weaknesses on the quest side. At level 40 players can acquire their first \"mount\"; horses for Humans, Kodo beasts for Tauren, etc. Players can ride these mounts at a faster speed than they would normally traverse on foot and it saves for a lot of travel time. At level 60 one can get an upgraded mount for substantially more money, but a greatly increased travel speed. And if you get your mitts on the Burning Crusade expansion you'll have access to flying mounts and gyrocopters, although they're only usable in Outland.The game, graphically, is very easy on the eyes and will run on the majority of PC's without any major issues, provided you're not in one of the major cities during peak hours (Ironforge is bad with lag, but Shat'rath is almost unbearable until 4am). The major cities each have their own unique feel about them, from the industrial motif of Dwarven Ironforge, to the shamanistic Tauren dwellings of Thunder Bluff, to the overly nature-themed Darnassus, home of the Night Elves. Music is also very well done with zone specific themes that play. And much of it is pretty catchy stuff, truth be told.If Blizzard has one glaring weakness with this series it's that it doesn't release expansion packs in any manner that resembles timeliness. Expansions are made about once every other year, and given that there is a point where players will hit a \"wall\" where they can no longer advance in any substantial way, that's not at all a good thing. The next expansion is due for release sometime this summer, and it's already feeling long overdue. If Ever Quest I had any one advantage it was it's constant release of new material on a regular basis, almost like an \"Expansion of the Month\" kind of feel.This game is a great value though and will provide you with many, many countless hours of enjoyment. It is addictive to a fault and will have you ever craving for more. Blizzard will even give you the first two weeks on a free trial basis to try out. There's nothing wrong with that.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2008"}

The previous reviews really sum it up nicely. I've been a Metal Gear fan since I first played a demo for MGS and a PS demo disc that my local Pizza Hut was giving away. And I could not even tell you how many times I played through that very brief demo.\"Tactical Espionage Action\" is the basis of all MGS games and people looking for a rootin tootin shoot em up game had best look elsewhere, I urge you to consider this is a stealth game, a bit more action oriented than Splinter Cell games but never the less mostly the point is to sneak by unnoticed as opposed to killing everything in sight, in fact in all MGS games you have the option of going through the game with no kills and will be rewarded for it in someway. Although there is one of the most amazing arrays of weaponry I've ever seen, featured in this game you really don't want to use them too much. Most of these weapons are customizable as well, lazer sights, fore grips, grenade launchers, scopes etc... But I doubt you'll really need much of them. I'm well used to MGS games and the re release of MGS3 (subsistance) had me pretty well prepared for the camera controls.Since we're on the subject of stealth, I would really like to touch on the subject of OCTO CAMO which is Snakes sneaking suit that blends in with whatever wall you may be leaning against or floor you may be laying down on. Also, if you see a statue with an empty space beside it you can actually pose and blend with the statue while enemies mosey on by unaware. Which is just neato.This game was the reason I finally broke down and got a PS3 because I just couldn't stand not having played this game yet and I was a very latecomer to it. I've only had it for, as of the time of this writing, less than a month and I've played through it a half dozen times and really the game play doesn't get old and there's lots of different difficulty settings to try and over all it's just got a great replay value.The story, the story unfolds not really in any cinematic way, mainly because we don't have 15 hour movies, but it more or less unfolds like a really good Stephen King mini series. It still has the rotten MOCAP that makes characters in the cutscenes look all floaty and silly but that's nothing unique since most games use MOCAP (Motion Capture, in case you didn't know) these days, I don't know, I imagine they use this to cut down on spending time animating every individual cutscene, but I'm not really an expert on the whole behind the scenes of video games stuff. The way the characters move around, aside, the cutscenes are every bit as entertaining as a Tony Scott film and as visual as a Ridley Scott film. Of course it's very self referential but if it is to be the final chapter then they did well to have so many characters from the previous games in it.The real meat of this title, and any other game worth playing is the gameplay. Which has the perfect balance of familiarity with the controls while not just being a reiteration of MGS3:S. Every thing is streamlined and refined to make figuring out the controls really easy both for vets and newbs to the series. It's really fun sneaking through a massive battle unnoticed while snipers take out guys just feet away from you and mortar shells are landing all around you. The stamina gauge established in MGS2 has been reworked into a psyche gauge and there's also a combat stress system ie. Snake gets stressed out when he's laying prone in the middle of a battlefield and there some guy firing a mounted machine gun in his direction which leads to his psyche gauge dropping and which causes his aiming to become sloppy or his camo index to drop. Relieve the stress, smoke some cigarettes (smoking's, bad kids), read a playboy (no nudity in this game, just scantily clad women), listen to your iPod (yes, Snake has an iPod... IDK WTF), hide in a box or just go find some nice quiet corner out of the sun and hide there for a while. It's really not as complicated as it sounds.I mentioned the massive amount of firepower this game is packing and if you chose to you can use it all quite easily. I mainly go with a silenced sniper rifle to pick off foes at a distance, if need be. But, amongst other things Solid Snake, or Old Snake as he's referred to in this game now has the CQC system that was set up in MGS3, this too has been streamlined into optimum efficiency and ease of use (controls).Graphically, I've never seen a better video game, some of the visuals in this game really did strike me with a bit of awe. The cut scenes are detailed and in some cases interactive.Overall, this is an amazing accomplishment in video games, anyone who likes the MGS series; this is a must have for you. For people new to or wholly unfamiliar with it I would really recommend playing the previous gamesMetal Gear Solid: The Essential Collectionfirst. I bought a PS3 for the express purpose of playing this game and I couldn't have been more satisfied about my purchases, both this game and the PS3. I missed out on the MGS4 edition PS3 so I just bought a new 80gig and this game to go with it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2009"}

{"product_name":"B003IE9V28","description":"","reviewerName":"trashcanman","summary":"Happiness is a 3 character aerial combo with a hyper finisher.","reviewText":"Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is a fan-favorite offshoot of the long-running Street Fighter series that branched out with the well-received X-Men vs. Street Fighter back in the competitive glory days of the 2D fighter.  Over the series' evolution the character rosters would eventually expand over time to include all Marvel comics heroes and villains as well as Capcom's entire legacy of classic video game characters.  The result was, of course, insanity.  MvC is one of the flagship competitive fighting series known for it's complex game mechanics that reward player creativity, extremely hectic action, and deluges of winking fan service towards comic geeks and gamers alike.  It's been a decade since the last MvC title, but with Street Fighter 4 having brought 2D fighters back into the spotlight, the time has never been better to revisit the eternal question once again: could Ryu whup Spider-Man?So how does this crossover extravaganza match up against previous titles in the series?  Very, very well.  While a lot of fans are decrying the relatively smaller 36 playable character roster (down from a mind-shattering 56 in MvC2), the fact is that it's better this way.  The old MvC games pretty much cut-and-pasted the characters from the slew of other versus games out there and threw everyone in the mix which led to mismatched and useless characters.  Competitive play pretty much boiled down to a handful of characters that were clearly much better than the rest.  MvC3 may have trimmed the roster, but it is a phenomenally fun, deep, and balanced roster with each character being useful in their own way and full of nuance.  Both companies also have a lot of new faces representing them, with some of the more obscure characters being surprisingly interesting.  Plus, they all look marvelous.  Even with the fan complaints this is probably the best thing about MvC3.  Yes, in high-level play, there are certain characters that are overpowered, but that list is small and most of us playing this game to have fun and not to win at all costs as a pathetic attempt to boost misguided egos (which probably shouldn't be built around being \"good\" at video games) are not going to spam Sentinel beams (\"neutralizeneutralizeneutralize\"...ugh) and Dark Phoenix every match.  That would just be pathetic.  So yeah, MvC3 features one of the coolest and most balanced rosters in a 2D fighter that I`ve ever played and after a few of weeks of play, I have yet to find my favorite character and have settled mainly into a 9 character rotation.  This is the highest praise.As before, this MvC title features single 3-on-3 tag matches instead of the classic 1-on-1/best-of-3 format favored by most fighting games.  This is really what sets the series apart from other hardcore 2D fighters.  While you can only control 1 character at a time, you are able to change at will and to call in \"assists\" from your offscreen characters to supplement your offensive and defensive endeavors.  For example, if you are trapped in the corner by Wolverine while using a character with poor melee capabilities like Arthur (of Ghosts and Goblins fame), you can call in Haggar (from Final Fight) to come out swinging and knock Wolvie back so you have room to breathe.  This feature adds exponentially to the strategy and complexity of the game and makes forming an effective team combination both vital and fun with so many possibilities.  This brings me to the point that needs to be hammered home the most since I am about to drop some complaints: this gameplay is AMAZING.  It's fun, fast-paced (I have been sweating in the dead of winter), complex, yet very easy to pick up and play assuming you understand the basics of fighting games. The controls have also been streamlined for console play, much to the chagrin of those who spend way too much money on specialized arcade-style stick setups.  While beginners may want to polish their skills in training and arcade modes before tackling veterans online, they shouldn't be too overwhelmed.  This is the definition of easy to learn, difficult to master.  There is also a \"simple mode\" to the controls to level the playing field between friends with skill discrepancies in multiplayer  that allows some more complex moves to be pulled off with the push of a button at the expense of variety.  It's an alright idea, I guess, but it's not for me.  Mission Mode allows for players to challenge themselves to duplicate combos dictated by the game, which is a cool challenge, but the fact that some of the combos are so long the commands can't even fit onscreen makes it feel like you are practicing for a piano recital and not playing a game.  Not fun, but a good way for beginners to learn the art of comboing, nevertheless.Okay, folks, it's whiny time.  While I have nothing but praise for the gameplay and graphics, I have to take MvC3 to task for a stunning lack of features.  First off, as I write this there is no lobby spectator mode in multiplayer.  That is to say that when you join an online lobby, you don't get to watch the other players' matches while you wait your turn.  You pretty much get to sit and stare at a loading screen.  That is not why I play these games, and it`s unacceptable.  The fun and learning experience of watching and commentating on ongoing fights is a huge part of any fighting community and while Capcom has claimed they will patch this in later, I cannot think of a good reason to not have it there in the first place.  This STANDARD.  Frankly, I'm tempted to drop a full star off of the rating, but assuming they make good on the promise of a patch, I'll hold off on that.  Now, in one of Deadpool's 4th wall-breaking antics (a staple of the character in the comics) he occasionally addresses the player personally at the end of the match during his victory rant with \"WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU WEREN'T RECORDING THAT?!\".  Good question, Wade.  Why couldn't we record that?  It's becoming pretty handy to post videos and study recordings of matches to show off to friends and learn different gameplay techniques.  Again, this should be standard.  In addition to the massive multiplayer gripes, the single player lacks a lot to see and do.  No in-game cut scenes aside from the canned match openings really hurts the production value of the arcade mode.  The endings are cool and all and usually filled with crazy crossover goodness featuring characters that we wish had made the roster but didn't, but the static comic images pale in comparison to the fully animated and voiced finales and story sections of games like Dead or Alive 4.  It's ridiculously easy to unlock the very few characters that aren't immediately available and the other unlockables are mostly things like art and character profiles.  Not super-rewarding, but better than nothing, I suppose.  Worst of all, word has it that a lot of the alternate costumes (and possibly even full characters) are already present on the disc, but are being sold as DLC.  This is not good, Capcom.  Making us pay to unlock something on the disc we already paid for is no way to do business and I WILL NOT DO IT.  The price for upcoming downloadable characters is about $5 apiece. A bit steep, if you ask me.  Also, your non-ranked online stats aren't displayed and are lumped with Arcade Mode victories instead.  Not cool.  This should have been an all-time great fighter, but as it stands, it feels half-@$zed and unfinished in a lot of areas and having Capcom charge us for things like alternate costumes after leaving so much out of the game does not help.So in conclusion, Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is a deliriously entertaining fighting game.  It's full of surprises, little obscure touches for fans, funny verbal interplay between characters, and most of all good times.  You really can't beat it for awesome gameplay.  However, I'm going a bit easy on the rating in anticipation of the patch for spectator mode and I need to point out that companies need to stop putting out unfinished games and then charging us for extra content.  It feels like Capcom held back features from this game intentionally (possibly anticipating a \"Super\" edition in a year or so?) and that stops this from getting a perfect score.  However, since the game itself is so damn fun I've still got to give it very high marks since that`s always the final word with me.  Comprehensive features or not, this is still an awesome game and I'm having a ball with it online and off.4  stars rounded up because I can't stay mad at you, Capcom.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00004YRQ9","description":"The layout of PlayStation2's Dual Shock 2 controller is nearly identical to that of the original PlayStation's Dual Shock controller, which is good news for most gamers. The main new feature is that, when the buttons are pushed, the controller can register how much pressure is being exerted. This adds a completely new dimension to sports, racing, fighting, and more games. Aside from the Start and Select buttons, all of the functions are analog for greater control, a wider variety of operations, and a more compelling interactive experience. Two convex analog thumb pads and two force-feedback solenoid rumblers round out the features. This controller is also compatible with all software that supports the original Dual Shock controller.","reviewerName":"Daniel V.","summary":"Definitely a must-have for PS2 owners!","reviewText":"This PS2 Dual Schock 2 is definitely worth it. I've owned it for about 4 years and it still works perfectly. I've even dropped it many of times, but somehow it still survived.This controller has alltogether 17 buttons. That may seem like alot but you really don't realize it. It is so simple to use and is perfect for anyone with big or small hands. The controller is very comfortable (to me) and your hands won't get soar after a few hours of gameplay.This controller is an improvement over the PS1 controller. The surface is much more smoother and with different colors, you can look inside the controller. When it vibrates you can see it spinning inside (don't know what it's called). This controller is also Pressure Sensitive. For example when you're driving a car, just push the button with a little pressure and you won't take off so quick. As for the cord, it's long enough. But it can get tangled up easily, so be careful.Overall, I find this controller to be the best one out (for now). It's simple, light and perfect.

Basicly, it's HUGE.  And yet, as large as it is compared to PS2 and Gamecube, it may turn out to be the best.  Here's why:1. It's comfortable, solid, and just feels good in your hand.  Those of you coming from a PlayStation to an Xbox, it's a bit of a change at first.  Within a few hours of gameplay, though, it begins to grow on you.  It's solid, spreads out your fingers.  Sick and tired of having to quit after an hour's gameplay because of finger cramps?  Not a problem on Xbox controller.  It spreads out your fingers, making specific buttons easier to find (without pushing the wrong one).  You could play for 6 hours straight, and though your eyes might be tired, your hands will feel great.  The controller feels great in your hands, and with a slight adjust; you might actually prefer it to other controllers.2.  It's solid and reliable.  Mine has been dropped dozens of times, been thrown to the floor, spilt on, and played for hundreds of hours.  Still works like it's brand new.  I don't know if Sony and Nintendo thing we're made of money, but I would rather by games yearly then replace controllers.  Wouldn't you?3.  It grows on you.  After getting my Xbox, and using the Xbox controllers, I felt almost uncomfertable holding the PS2 controller.  I couldn't find the bottons, just couldn't get used to four triggers.  As scary as it may seem now (take a deep breath), Xbox controller will win you over.  You'll prefer it over others.  You'll play for hours at a time without any discomfort.  Quite frankly, you'll learn to love it.Finally, it belongs to a great system.  Counsidering getting an Xbox, yet afraid to buy one because of what friends have said.  &quot;It's huge&quot;, &quot;Too big&quot;, &quot;Piece of junk!&quot;.  Don't listen.  Their just ignorant.  So remember when you play a demo with this wondeful controller at the store.  It won't feel right at first.  But play it for longer than 5 minutes, and you'll get used to it.  A few days, prefer it.  A few months, love it.  A few years, charish it.  Don't miss out, and get the better controller.  And besides, their's always the Controller S for those who just don't like it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2002"}

{"product_name":"B003O6G5TW","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher J. Martin","summary":"Half of a Great Game","reviewText":"I'll state the main point of my review up front, if you like multiplayer and don't care about single player in my opinion you will like Battlefield 3. If single player and the single player story is your main focus and you don't play multiplayer, I wouldn't pay very much for this game. It comes on two discs which is kind of annoying but I don't fault the developers for that. Developers are pushing the limits of the XBox 360 and it's become harder and harder to pack all of the things they can do on to one DVD.Single PlayerThe developers of this game, Dice, seem either unable or unwilling to create a great single player Battlefield experience. For all of its problems, Modern Warfare 3 beats Battlefield in terms of a single player experience hands down. The story is told in flashbacks, a blatant ripoff of Black Ops. Otherwise it's the standard anti-terrorist/anti-Russian FPS fare we've all come to expect since almost every FPS abandoned WW II for a modern setting. The story also has some seemingly implausible elements, like being ordered to dismount from a (working) tank to complete a mission as a foot soldier.If you intend to play the Single Player missions before multiplayer DO NOT install the HD content it asks you to install when you put in the single player disc. If you install the HD content the first single player mission has a glitch during the first minute that isn't fixable without uninstalling the HD content. My squad met up with a guy who was supposed to brief us on the first mission but nothing happened. After doing some research on the 'net to see if anybody else had this glitch happen to them I learned that if I uninstalled the HD content and everything would be fine.Another thing I didn't like about the single player is that there are a lot of unskippable cut scenes. I always watch the cut scene the first time through but if I die and have to watch it over again it gets annoying. There are also a lot of QuickTime Events where you're in basically a cut scene but have to press the appropriate button when it's displayed on the screen or you die. This kind of a \"mission\" in a FPS is a joke, it doesn't feel like I actually accomplished anything.The enemy and friendly AI are both pretty stupid (just like most FPS). If you have to re-do a mission the enemy AI do not change their positions which makes going through the mission a second time a lot easier. The friendly AI would get in my way, shoot at the ground and often not start shooting at all until I killed a certain number of enemies first. The friendly AI getting in my way got pretty annoying on occasion because in this game accidentally shooting the friendly AI can cause the mission to end.One of the things I do like about the Battlefield 3 single player is that while the single player mission maps aren't overly large there is usually an opportunity to flank the enemy AI and use some actual tactics. Playing this game Rambo style on any level higher than easy I think would be an exercise in frustration.MultiplayerBattlefield multiplayer is a lot of fun. There are five modes, Team Deathmatch, Squad Deathmatch, Rush, Squad Rush and Conquest, my favorite being Conquest. This is a large scale battle with vehicles. It requires a lot of team communication to win (and stay alive) which I like. Did I mention VEHICLES? This is where BF3 really sets itself apart from Modern Warfare. I cannot comment on the graphics because I have not installed the HD content yet.One downside to both single player and multiplayer, particularly if you're a fan of the destructibility present in Battlefield: Bad Company 2, is that it's really not present in this game. That I didn't like.Overall, as the title of the review says, this is half of a very good/great game. The multiplayer aspect of the game is definitely worth playing. Unfortunately, unless you've gotten bored with Modern Warfare 3's campaign and are really jonesing for a FPS to play, I can't say the same about the single player. It's up to you to decide if a superior multiplayer game with a rather subpar single player aspect is worth full price or not, thankfully I had gift cards and didn't pay too much for this game or I'd have been disappointed in it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2012"}

Originally released in the states as Final Fantasy III, it is still one of the most popular RPGs of all time, and has garnered a cult following that describe it as the best Final Fantasy in the series.  Now the finest fantasy has gone portable.The storyline in Final Fantasy VI is fairly simple.  1000 years ago the war of Magi happened, and after that war the power of magic simply ceased to exist.  Now the Magitek Empire has found a way to revive the dreaded power known as magic, and they tend to use this power to enslave the world.  A small resistance group has come forth to stop this empire, and magic may very well be the key to stopping the Empire.  But is it really such a good idea to rely on the power of magic once more?

In fact, Final Fantasy VI excels in character development more so than any other game in the series, and easily has the best ensemble cast.  Each character is distinct and has a personality of his or her own, and join up with your group to fight the empire for their own reasons.  Even so, however, these characters manage to come off as completely different from one another.  Final Fantasy VI also has the luxury of having the largest cast of playable characters in the series.  There are twelve standard characters and two hidden characters.The battle system is the basic ATB that was introduced in Final Fantasy IV.  Your characters line up on the left side of the screen while your enemies populate the right side of the screen.  As the battle progresses, everyone's ATB gauge fills up.  When a character's gauge is full you can select commands for them to do.  To keep Final Fantasy VI from being a bore fest in battle, however, each character has a distinct skill that only he or she can perform.  Locke, for example, can steal while Edgar has a set of tools he can use.  This not only gives some battles variety, but also let's you set up a strategy.  There are moments in the game where your characters will be split up, and you'll have to decide who should go with who, and you'll be forced to switch between parties.To add to the experience, Final Fantasy VI never forces you to run around with a full party.  You can have up to four characters in one party, but you don't have to use four at a time.  You could simply run around with just three characters in... or even just one if you're looking for a challenge.  Even better, there is no central leader in Final Fantasy VI.  This means that there is never anyone character you have to have in, and the game rarely forces you to use any specific characters.  This gives the player a lot more freedom.A Final Fantasy game would not be complete without some sort of complex system.  Here, you're given a complex way to make your characters learn magic.  As you progress through your adventure you'll find espers, which are the summons found throughout the game.  You must equip an esper in order to use it.  Each esper has a set of spells they can teach your characters at a certain rate.  As you battle through the game, you'll gain experience points as well as magic points from your enemies.  Magic points go toward learning a certain spell.  It's no where near as complex as Final Fantasy V's job system, Final Fantasy VII's materia system or Final Fantasy X's sphere grid, but it's simple to pick up on.  The only problem with it is that the later espers offer spells that you'll have to spend a lot of time battling around to learn.In addition to spells, having a certain esper equipped can also give you stat bonuses at level up.  For example, some espers will allow your character to gain 30 percent more HP at level up than he or she normally would.  Others may increase speed, MP, etc.  So just because you learned every spell from an esper doesn't mean they don't have other uses.Graphic wise, Final Fantasy VI doesn't really look all that different than it did back on the Super Nintendo.  There are a few changes to the translation, but nothing major, and some characters now have a portrait when they speak.  The font is also easier to read.  There were a couple of moments of slow down in battle, however, mostly when casting spells, but it's not really too much of a burden.  The overall visual look however is really not all that different.  Most fans probably won't too many differences here.Final Fantasy VI is probably best known for its amazing soundtrack.  Even today there are fans who label it Nobuo Uematsu's greatest accomplishment.  Unfortunately, the game just doesn't sound nearly as good coming from your GBA as it did when it came from your Super Nintendo.  Some tunes its hardly noticeable, but for the most part, the game doesn't sound nearly as good as it used to, especially if you played the SNES original over and over again.  Those who fell in love with the soundtrack years ago probably won't take too kindly to the GBA port.  That doesn't mean it sounds bad.  It just means it isn't the original music some fans know and love.What's new in Final Fantasy VI Advance?  About the same thing that was new in the previous re-releases.  There's a new dungeon and more bosses.  As the game's treat, there are also four new espers and some new spells to go along with it.  Much like Final Fantasy IV and V, the extras are not much to write home about, and they don't really increase the length of the game by very much.  That's not so bad in Final Fantasy VI's case because it can easily keep you busy for over 50 hours.If you are a Final Fantasy fan, then you owe it to yourself to play Final Fantasy VI.  It is one of the most compelling games in the series.  It's absorbing storyline, fantastic characters and dedication to fun gameplay make this worth a buy.  Final Fantasy VI was, at one point in time, a text book example of how to make an RPG, and even years later, it has aged very well and still holds up well today.  Play it, remember it, and you'll understand why Final Fantasy VI is one of the greatest RPGs ever made.The Good+Simple, yet absorbing storyline+Very well developed characters+There's a lot of freedom to the battle system+Tons of secrets to unearth+There are some extras here+Lots of playable characters+Thirteen years later, and it's still one of the most memorable RPGs ever madeThe Bad-The music doesn't sound nearly as good as the SNES original-If you still own your original SNES copy (released as Final Fantasy III), or even Final Fantasy Anthology, it's hard to say you'll be sold on the GBA version for the extras alone","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2007"}

There are elements dealing with racism, religion, uprising and rebellion, but it isn't about these things. They just help to define the world of \"Columbia,\" the floating city in the sky, as a specific time and place. What it is about is two people's journey to discover the truth of what's really happening. If there's a downside to the game, it's that the combat never feels as interesting as the original \"Bioshock,\" lacking memorable characters like the Big Daddies, the Splicers, or the Little Sisters that brought about a moral choice. The A.I. of Elizabeth can also be a tad distracting when exploring the environments. Even so, \"Bioshock Infinite\" creates one of the truly original places in gaming, right along side \"Rapture\" of the first game, with a story that's so intricate and fascinating that you'll want to immediately play it again just to try and put all the pieces together.--- 5 STARS ---","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2013"}

I don't even consider this game an all-time great after beating it. It seems to do most things well, but almost nothing exceptionally well. This game is still a very enjoyable experience with a few minor and major setbacks depending on your taste and what you are expecting out of this.Characters/Story/UniverseThe story itself is pretty good. It's very creative and makes you think about the future of technology, which is a big plus. From the onset you are wondering what will happen next because conspiracies are all over the place, but some story choices are quite odd, and even stupid. I won't go into detail, but I felt that some things happened to fast and/or needed further development in order to have the lasting effect we all crave from an engaging story. One aspect where this REALLY sticks out is the character development.....there is none. I liked Jensen but it would have been nice to know the supporting characters on a more personal level. The story is NOT driven by the characters at all. I also thought the Hengsha city hub (Not Thai Yung Medical in the upper city, that was awesome) was simply awful. It was the low point of the game story and character wise. Sprawled throughout the game are scientific journals called \"e-books\" which contain info on where the world will supposedly go (China as the world power) as well as HIGHLY detailed info on the technology used in augmentations. The reading can become tedious after a while if you aren't REALLY interested in the tech and the events between now and 2027 that led the world to where it will be in 2027. There are A GAZILLION computer terminals to hack where email conversations that are meant to suck you into the universe, but ultimately become tiresome to read. I got sick of reading employee protocols and mostly uninteresting conversations. The game makes you wonder who Jensen really is and it has you wondering, but ultimately it didn't satisfy me like I wanted so the buildup seemed dumb. Overall the story is very interesting, but besides Jensen I didn't care for any of the characters. Pritchard and Malik had so much potential as strong characters! The bosses we've seen in all the trailers are not characterized. The Rihanna-looking one only says one sentence!GameplayThis is a stealth game that tries to accommodate to gunfights and succeeds....mostly. If you play it as a stealth game and have a hiccup every so often and get into a gunfight, then the gameplay will be great to you. You have to appreciate stealth and have fun not setting of alarms and taking all enemies down silently in order to enjoy it. If that doesn't sound like you, I'd suggest skipping this one. The shooting aspect is good, but not strong enough to play the whole game as such. If you're into stealth like me, then you will have tons of fun. Let me first mention the problems: 1) NOT ENOUGH ANIMATIONS. As cool as the KO and death animations are, there just aren't enough of them. I never killed anyone needlessly, so I used KO's mostly and I swear there are 4 animations. 2) WEAPONS The weapons are your standard fare: pistol, machine gun, assault rifle, sniper rifle yawn. I'm not saying they're bad, but I would have expected the variety and creativity of the augments to carry on into the weapons. Only one weapon can be customized into a super cool weapon-the revolver. It can have explosive rounds like the one in Resistance. Speaking of Resistance, I expected some cool futuristic (but not as over the top) weapons or weapon augments that made it more than simply a normal assault rifle in futuristic clothing. I want to vaporize people. I want to have crazy ammo that lets me control their minds to walk to their allies and let me detonate a small bomb. You know, creative stuff. The weapons can be upgraded in terms of damage and reload speed, but never customized, which sucks. 3) CITY HUBS. Some of the side missions offer a nice little side story to investigate, sending you throughout the small city, but sadly the 2 city hubs don't have much purpose beyond that. I already mentioned that I hated Hengsha, so in my opinion, the city hub thing was poorly executed. The side missions actually became worse as the game went on. The game was at its absolute strongest when you were placed in huge mission-specific facilities, shipyards, etc.  with tons of multiple floors and paths for you to choose. The cities bored me and I came close to trading this in when I was forced to walk back and forth in the big, boring yellow cities.GraphicsThere's a point in the game where you go to Montreal and there is no yellow. Now before I say what I have to say, I have no beef with the color yellow, but it sure as hell doesn't remind me of the technological future; blue is for that. As I was saying, you get to Montreal and the yellow is gone. I saw how beautiful the game looked with natural colors! Actually each location had a different color that stood out and set the mood, but oddly enough, they decided to make the 2 city hubs VERY yellow. This made the two city hubs extremely boring to look at because the yellow at first may seem kinda cool, but it's overpowering and makes everything look the same. If you're extremely picky about lip sync then prepare to look at some of THE WORST facial animation and lip syncing on a current gen game. The character's bodies are fine, but the heads at times can be downright scary bad. On the bright side, all of the weapons are beautiful (except for the fugly heavy rifle). Jensen's character model and voice could not have been more perfect IMO. Some complain about the gruffness of his voice, but if you were OK with Infamous 1 Cole, then you'll be fine.Exploration/VarietyThere are flashes of greatness in the variety and choice that the game lets you have. A VERY high point is where you must convince someone to give you, tell you, or do something you want. The dialog sequences are excellent but only happen a handful of times. Regarding the exploration, the reading can become extremely tedious. The e-books and or emails should have been voiced like the audio logs in Bioshock. The different pathways during a mission (Thai Young, Montreal, Singapore, derelict row) are amazing and let you choose how and where you want to approach the enemies. You CANNOT max every augment so everyone has a different experience and can even access different areas depending on what augment is chosen. Mission variety is the strong point.VerdictLike I said, this is NOT the GOTY in my opinion, even though I thought it would be. The end is very satisfying and although I liked Jensen a lot (SERIOUSLY JENSEN IS AWESOME), I didn't care for any of the other characters, even thought they aren't bad. Deus Ex tells you its version of a futuristic conspiracy where man is trying to fight the forces of nature with augments. Not everyone feels like it should be done and the end of the game, while satisfying, never really brings a solid conclusion to the main anti-augment spokesperson. There are multiple outcomes and endings so I cannot say that firmly. This game is a good combination of a lot of things, but none great on its own besides the cool story and stealth gameplay. I CAN SAY FOR SURE that this is one of those games where a second playthrough makes the experience better. I'll update after I have a crack at it on a no-alarm-no kill-hard difficulty run.Feel free ask me anything if you're on the fence about Deus Ex or just simply want to know something.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2011"}

The graphics seem to start to show the power of the next gen systems, unlike COD Ghosts which I've been more or less disappointed in.- The unlock/weapons/equipment menus are still busy and complex, but I found the whole system easier to deal with an understand than in BF3. I was comfortable with the menus a lot faster and that makes a big difference when you enter into a massive multiplayer game like Battlefield.- Game play is challenging, as it always has been. it will take a while to get the feel of the game and start scoring significant points and earning ranks/unlocks etc. I wouldn't expect to get online and in 15 minutes feel like you've &#34;got it&#34;. Give it a couple hours and take the time to look through the customization screens and to get a feel for the background setup of the game.- The major issue is the SERVERS. I tried to log into Conquest mode all day and haven't gotten in. I only seem to be able to join 2-3 of the 6 game modes I tried ( I also dont have the downloadable content that comes with premium membership for another 49.99), so I couldn't join those modes anyway. This is also frustrating after spending 59.99 for the game, and then finding they want another 49.99 for the premium package which opens up all kinds of downloadable maps and other perks. Personally I think it's WAY too early to start asking for extra money when the xbox one version came out last week. I know its been out for a month on previous gen, but in my opinion offering new map packs this early for that kinda fee ( I realize you get future packs as far as I can tell?).Server and Premium issue aside, its a solid game for next gen. Its not easy, and will take an investment of your time to get into and earn your way up the battlefield rank system, but its a cool game. I'm actually pleased with it. EA will fix the server issues once the initial rush calms down, or at least they should.* I'd also watch for black friday and cyber monday deals/holiday deals. These games sometimes drop a bit around holiday sales time!Good luck!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000K8YAKI","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"Halo 3:  A+","reviewText":"After loving the original Halo, and being somewhat disappointed with Halo 2, I did not know what to expect with Halo 3.  I still, being a fan of the series decided that this game would be on my must have list regardless.  I wasn't \"dying\" for the game to come out and in fact I actually missed the release date and ended up picking it up the day afterwards.  After playing the game for a while I must say that I am very impressed with the game overall.First things first, if you get the Limited Edition, then know that you run a HIGH chance of having damaged game CD's due to the poor case design.  Luckily in my case, the only CD that was damaged was the \"Essentials CD\", but still with me paying $70 for a game I would have liked to have both CD's in new condition.  In any case Microsoft realized the issue and decided to replace all damaged Halo 3 CD's free of charge for the next few months.With that out of the way let's get to the actual game.When I first started playing the game, I thought it was going to be another disappointment like Halo 2 was, and ended up finding another great game, Bio Shock more fun to play.  However after progressing further in the game, I am finding Halo 3 to be nearly as fun as the original.  One reason of this is because of the new weapons, and vehicles.  In addition you, Master Chief, no longer have to be driving a vehicle (with the exception of the scorpion).  So if you want to man the turret on the warthog, while your computer controlled teammates drive, you can do it, same hold true for most every vehicle in the game.  This makes things very interesting and fun.  One of my favorite new vehicles in the game is the Hornet.  My first air battle with this machine was an absolute blast.  I enjoyed flying over beautiful scenery shooting down banshees while two of my squad mates sit outside on jump seats supporting me with fire of their own. I was having such a good time just admiring the scenery, I decided to fly the hornet high in the air and jump out mid flight into the sparkling ocean below.  It was a looooong way down and needless to say I died, but boy it sure was fun.Flying the Hornet allowed me to appreciate the incredible detail of the graphics on this game.  In HD, the graphics are stunning.  Whether it's walking through the jungles, flying through the air or scaling snow covered mountains, everything looks amazingly real.  Aside from the detailed scenery, the characters themselves are also done very well.  Characters move, attack and even die realistically.  Its things like this that separate the average FPS's from the great ones.I also am very pleased with the audio. This game boasts true surround sound and if you already haven't then I highly suggest getting an optical sound cable to experience the movie like experience from you're A/V receiver.  Many gun sounds have that \"punch\" that I was missing in Halo 2.  The grunts usually are the first ones to die, and for a little comic relief, many times you'll hear them saying things like \"He killed my friend\", or \"How will I go on with him?\"  In addition to the exceptional in game sound, the soundtrack itself is very well done.  Very often, after I finish playing for the night, I often leave the game on the main screen just so I can hear the music on the title screen.The controls in Halo 3 are still quite intuitive with only a small complaint; in many other FPS games, the reload button is often the X button, but not in Halo 3.  In Halo 3, the X button is the \"Equipment\" button.  So whenever you pick up items like auto turrets, bubble shields or radar jammers, if you are not careful you may accidentally use them instead of doing what you really wanted to do.  In Halo 3, LB and RB reload the weapon, and I suppose this was done to accommodate dual wielding, which is back in this game.  In addition to the two standard grenades from the previous installments, Halo 3 has a couple of more grenades types; one is called the Spike Grenade, and the other...well I'll leave that up to you to find out; it wasn't in the manual so I was quite surprised when I picked one up during campaign mode.  In addition to the equipment I already mentioned, there are lots of others.As good as the single player is I must say that I am quite impressed with the multiplayer mode.  If you know me I am not a big fan of playing online, but one night I decided to try my luck at Halo 3 on XBOX Live....and let's just say, I didn't get to bed until 5 in the morning.  First off this game runs very smoothly online with no noticeable degradation in the graphics or performance and I haven't once encountered a laggy game.  Best of all the game is very playable online, and not the chaotic mindless shoot fest that I experienced with Unreal Tournament.  This was my first time playing online in a long time and I even ended up winning a Slayer match.  One thing that makes this game playable online is that nearly every weapon either has a weakness or a counter thanks to the additional of the new equipment items.  Sure the insanely good players will mop up the floor with people like me, but its still very fun playing just because it just seems fair.  Games like Capture the Flag which proves to be nothing but a disaster in Unreal Tournament, is a true pleasure to play in Halo 3.  And hey, if this game is good enough to allow ME to enjoy online games, then it must be pretty darn good.In my opinion Halo 3 does not disappoint one bit.  It was a slow starter, but now that I am finally somewhat deep into the game, I must say that I am enjoying this game VERY much.  It's a blast to play both in campaign mode and in addition the online play will be sure to keep me playing this game long after I have beaten campaign mode multiple times.  Other than the small issue with the controls, I can't find anything else really wrong with this game.  On a 10 point scale, I'll give this a 9.7.  While Bio Shock (another 5 star game IMO) is definitely more original and just as fun, Halo 3 is the best of the breed when it comes to your \"typical\" shooter, and the added fun one can have playing it online make it 5 stars in the fun category.  This is a great game across the board.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2007"}

New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"It's...OK","reviewText":"Well I have finally played the first Resident Evil game for the PS3. I was expecting it to struggle to top the outstanding RE4, and the truth is that although it looks and feels fantastic, it is not as good as that game.In this chapter, Chris Redfield returns in a new mission set in Africa. Together with a female partner named Sheva, he has to fight his way through hordes of infected enemies in his search for...well, something or other. The truth is that there is very little story to this game. Things start of in a decrepit African shanty town, and moves through several locations, each one presenting a battle against maurauding zombies, which are in the style of the Ganados from RE4, ie, very fast and very deadly, and not averse to using weapons.Now initially the game wowed me with it's sheer beauty. From the start you'll find that you are in lavishly detailed, almost photo-realistic locations. The main shanty town that appears in the early stages is very impressive in it's decay and ruin. Everywhere you turn there are rotting buildings, burned out cars, debris and chaos. Trouble is that the fantastic locations are merely window dressing to some very repetitive gameplay. Almost from the start of the game, Chris and Sheva are plunged into a fight with an angry mob of infected villagers. The atmosphere is electric...crazed zombies run at you from all directions, brandishing weapons and not stopping until you shoot or chop the (re-animated) life out of them. The onslaught is a charged up version of the memorable village attack from RE5 when Leon faced a similar angry mob, including one huge bruiser with a chainsaw. Well it seems like that idea was a winner, because after playing a few chapters it began to dawn on me that this was all that Resident Evil 5 has to offer. All that happens is that after demolishing a horde of undead in one chapter, Chris and Sheva move to a new area and another onslaught starts all over again. Each time there is very little to do but survive long enough to kill all the enemies rushing at you, and when they are all dead, head for the next location and to it all over again.What also disappointed me was the lack of any sense of suspense. RE5 is really just a search and destroy mission. There's no sense of mystery, no air of menace or unease, it's just action. The tumbledown shanty town and subsequent locations look great but none of them have any real atmosphere. And some, like the tribal village in the swamp, just look pretty. RE5 should provoke a sense of \"ugh, I really don't want to go in there!\" rather than \"ooh that looks nice, let's have a stroll around!\". And then it hit me...when I reached the level set in an underground ancient city, I suddenly said to myself: \"Hang on - I'm playing Tomb Raider\"!There are some new features, the biggest of which is that your partner Sheva is no trailing damsel in distress like  Ashley, but a fully fledged fighting comrade. She has her own inventory and will attack the enemies as well as you do - sometimes better! I really enjoyed this aspect. Sheva seldom got in the way, although she did waste good ammo a bit too freely. She can also help carry your stuff and supply you with more ammo if she picks it up. She was also pretty clever, and much better at aiming and dodging than I was! And there are some good points where Chris can get somewhere by himself but Sheva can't follow (think \"ICO\") - in fact I would have liked more gameplay built around working out ways that the pair of you interact to get through some levels. Another new development is that the menu now only works in real time - so choosing from your inventory does not pause the action anymore. I found this terrifying! For quite a while, opening the menu to select or load a weapon left me wide open to zombie attack. It took a while to become adept at swapping items around whilst in the middle of a busy fight - but it eventually got easier.I'm still not sure that RE5 is a great achievement. Sure it looks great, but where's the innovation? RE4 made a huge leap for the series...RE5  actually loses some of the good stuff. Of course it's next generation: the visual are amazing and the character models are outstanding - except, oddly enough for Chris himself, who has a ridiculously massive pumped body. He looks like a shaved gorilla stuffed into a uniform...at least Leon was realistically buff. Sheva, on the other hand looks like a real woman, and is very well animated. But Chris just looks like a cartoon hulk of 8 feet tall and with no facial expressions. And the pair of them make a massive amount of noise just by running around!There are also far fewer bonus levels a the end of the game than in RE4. And the climactic boss fight was rather a let down - it was not on a very large scale and there was (spoiler alert)....no countdown to destruction! I really missed that staple of the RE series. So, apart from the next generation wow factor, I think this game adds little to the RE series. I look forward to seeing if things get back to a spookier feel in number 6.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2009"}

Period.  Although it has been compared to Diablo and Diablo II, that is not a bad thing.  I think that the only reason it gets compared to those two great games is because it shares some of the same elments and mechanics.  You are given a choice of three character classes, get info from the townspeople and embark on various quests to rid them of their troubles.  The story is a good one, if a bit predictable.  The graphics are sharp and well done.The area in which this game shines is the gameplay.  The controls are smooth and the response time is lightning fast, no lag or anything of the like.  I also like the fact the the controls are user friendly and the in-game tutorial is great at getting you familiar with the controls without being overly preachy or condescenting.The overall story is very linear, and as you progress through the levels, the enemies can be quite tough and sometimes downright difficult to deal with.  The boss battles are cool, and take quite a bit of strategy and evasion to ensure your survival.  These above facts are cool and fit well into the game, but they are also its downfall.  Although the toughness and tenacity of the enemies increases steadily, your character is a bit slower to catch up.  Once you kill all the enemies on a level, they dont respawn, so you cannnot stick around and kill them again to gain more experience and level up faster.Other than the fact that the difficulty level gets a little frustrating, you have to deal with a little bit of boredom and a lull in the storyline towards the end of the game.  The set-up is nice, but the ending leaves a little to be desired.Dont let those two little pitfalls disuade you from your quest, this game is still a ton of fun and easy to master, the only thing that counts against it are the two minor problems that could use a little bit of tweaking...minor flaws, but nothing to weigh too heavily.  I highly suggest that fans of the Diablo series and fans of Dungeons and Dragons buy this game.  I also suggest that you purchase this game if you just want to spend a few hours chopping monsters to bits and blasting away at the minions of darkness with some well placed arrows or magical spells.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2002"}

Select from dozens of fighting styles, including (for example) martial-arts styles (Legendary Strike, Leaping Tiger), magic styles (Tempest, Dire Flame), transformation styles, and weapon styles (Twin Axes, Staff, and improvised weapons like chairs). Each style has its own tactical role and attacks that range from punches and kicks to weapon strikes, mystical powers, and even transformations into supernatural monsters! You can focus on a narrow channel of styles and become dominant in these forms or broaden your area of study to include a wide variety of styles adaptable to many combat situations. Combat is fast-paced martial-arts action, and it is exciting and tactical as you rapidly switch fighting styles to meet diverse challenges.","reviewerName":"Ryan \"yahweh_jireh\"","summary":"Rent this game before you buy it","reviewText":"I was rather disappointed with this game.

{"product_name":"B007CSF3GO","description":"","reviewerName":"SuperGamecube64","summary":"Proof that good things can be done on the Wii","reviewText":"Japan gets a lot of games that the rest of the gaming world does not. Honestly, it's just not fair, but as gamers we have grown used to the fact that Japan is our spoiled brother that gets all the good stuff. Image our surprise, however, when I game has been fully translated and voiced in the English tongue, and is then released in PAL territories but not in the US. That's just cold. That's like having three kids, giving 2 of those kids a bar of chocolate and then sending the third to his room. This is what happened with The Last Story, as well as two other games - Xenoblade Chronicles and Pandora's Tower. So, what is going to happen to that third kid in our previous scenario? He's pissed. IT makes no sense. He is going to whine, and cry, and hate you until you drive back to the store, and get him his chocolate bar - and that's exactly what American gamers did in a sense. These three Wii exclusives spawned \"Operation Rainfall\" - a petition to get all of these games released in America. Lo and behold, our temper tantrum was mostly a success (2 of 3 were released), and here I am reviewing a game I thought I'd never get to play.The Last Story is the most recent game from Mistwalker Studios, which was created by famed Final Fantasy creator Hironobu sakaguchi. He claimed to have gone into this project with the same mindset as when eh created the original Final Fantasy, and it certainly shows. even the logo and name are very close to Final Fantasy! To top it off, the games music was composed by Nobuo Uematsu, who also composed the music of Final Fantasy. In short, the art style, music, and story will all remind you quite directly of Final Fantasy - but it has more than enough strength to stand on its own.The Last Story just kind of throws you right into the action when you start - you fight your first battle within the first 5 minutes. Throughout this segment, the characters are having flashbacks and bantering about things and just confusing you in general. It wasn't until about an hour in that I finally understood everything that went on in those first few moments. The gameplay, however, was too engrossing for me to care.the battle system in The Last Story takes place in real time, and there are no \"battle screens\", just a seamless environment. You control the main character, Zael, most of the time and the rest of your party is autonomous. Eventually, you can give them orders. The game is best played with a classic controller of some type, but I will get to that later - for now, I am going to use a classic controller to explain the controls. The R button guards. Likewise, if you are holding R and run toward an obstacle (or an ally), you will jump, or propel yourself over it. The L button activates an ability you get early on called \"Gathering\" which draws all enemy attention to Zael .this allows your spell casters you charge without being interrupted by enemies, or can also just take the heat off of your allies if they're taking a beating. If while moving the Y or a button is pressed, Zael will somersault in that direction. You may have gathered by now that, though an RPG, this game is full of action. In order to attack, you simply run to and enemy, and press the control stick in their direction - much like how Link jumps in a Zelda game if you run towards and edge. You can also adjust the controls via the options menu if you would rather press b to attack. Using this method will allow for a couple of minor advantages, but since your attacks are slowed down a small bit as well, and will also do a little less damage, I found it best to just stick to the \"automatic\" method.You should not assume that because you have attacking set to automatic that the game is uninvolved. You must still guard properly, examine enemy strategies and issue commands accordingly by pressing up on the directional pad. Later in the game, Zael get an ability called \"Perfect Guard\". If you tap guard at just the right moment, you will not only parry your enemies strike, but deliver a brutal counter attack. zael also has an ability known as \"Gale\". Whenever a mage in your party casts a spell, it creates a magic circle on the ground. By holding b, you initiate Gale, which allows you to diffuse these circles for effects such as silence, armor break, and health distribution depending on the spell. Likewise, you can diffuse enemy spell circles to get rid of them. Furthermore, walking through spell circles adds that spell's attributes to your weapon for a limited time. There are also moments where you will have to strategically use your crossbow.Your crossbow is used by holding the ZL button. You can cycle through various arrows suited to different enemy types with the directional pad. Using the crossbow, you can find environmental weaknesses, such as broken rocks, or enemies on far off platforms and then choose to either use your crossbow to solve the problem, or order a magic caster to deal with it. Beyond this, if enemies haven't notice you are there, you can press against cover wit the a button. From here, you can use your crossbow to grab an enemies attention and lure them in for a stealth kill. The crossbow is the reason I recommend playing with a Classic Controller Pro. On a regular Classic Controller, the ZL and ZR buttons are located beside the L and R buttons, as opposed to the Classic Controller Pro which has a more tradition Playstation styled setup that makes using the crossbow a little easier. That is not to say the game cannot be played comfortably with the Classic controller - I, in fact, played the majority of this game with the Classic Controller due to not owning a Pro until the later chapters. The Wiimore and Nunchuk controls look comfortable and easy enough to use if yiu have to, but I'd have to recommend a classic controller of some kind. As for gameplay issues, they mostly come from your partner's lack of intelligence. Your allies will often get themselves killed doing something silly.Considering the limitations of the Wii's hardware, this game looks amazing. There are a few blurry textures here and there, but overall the game just looks great. Characters are well animated, and environments are relatively believable. Another parallel to the Final Fantasy games of old are the cutscenes. Cutscenes in The Last Story are pre-rendered, much like those in Final Fantasy 7, 8 and 9. They of course, looks far better than those cutscenes, and have voice acting as well. It is strange to see this in a modern RPG, but it is not a problem at all. Even when the game is not pre-rendered there is a lot of attention to detail. every piece of equipment or weapon you put on a character changes their appearance. If you decide you don't like the color of their equipment, you can change the color scheme in the menu.The characters are all colorful and interesting, and each of them has their own little quirks. the cast babbles near constantly, and their banter is pretty comical from time to time, especially when Syrenne and Lowell get into it. I'd love to delve into the characters and how their stories intertwine, but to do so would ruin the whole game - I can't even explain very much of the beginnings without spoiling something. all I can reveal is that Zael is unhappy with his life as a mercenary, and wishes to become a knight. That may sound simple, and shallow, but there are a lot of things I'm not telling you here, and there is plenty of drama involved. At times the story is predictable, but not to the point that it is uninteresting.If you live in America, and you are thinking of purchasing this game, do so as soon as you possibly can because we only got a single shipment of the product. On the bright side, the packaging goes well beyond what most games offer for $50, giving you a book-like enclosure as well as a 44 page art booklet. Unfortunately, the sound track was only available for pre-order copies. The Last Story is an interesting, outstanding, beautiful, and above all else, fun addition to your Wii library. I can only think of so many bad things to say about this game, and those few things pale greatly in comparison to all the praise I didn't even give it in this review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2012"}

It isn't overly difficult or complex, allowing the strategy-rookie to get into the game easily. This is the kind of game where you can play a few missions and then come back a month later and pick up where you left of, without having to re-play the tutorial.I would have even given this game 5 stars, if it wasn't for a few details that I didn't care for too much. The interface leaves a bit to be desired. I found myself wishing for easier ways to select and group units. Sometimes, I also wished for the game to give me a bit more feedback about what's going on. For instance, when the GLA attacks my base with a SCUD-storm, why not show where it hit on the mini map? Games like Pretorians show how to do this (at least a little) better.The other problem with this game is that it lets you get away with too much. The game doesn't force you to use advanced strategy. Often, it is enough to just build up a very large number of troups and send them into battle all at once. In those scenarios, I often wish the game would make me find out a bit more about all the great upgrades and special units that are available. Of course, this is a problem the player could solve :-)Overall, this is a very good game. Personally, I had a lot of fun with this game. Probably even 5 stars worth. But compared to some other 5-star games, it just didn't seem fair to give this one 5 stars as well. It just isn't quite among the very best.

{"product_name":"B00005ML10","description":"One of the most anticipated titles in PlayStation2 history absolutely  lives up to the hype.Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Libertyis the  follow-up to one of the most captivating and intelligent adventures on the original  PlayStation. Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M. PadillaPros:One of the best and most complex stories in gamingOutstanding graphics with many interactive elementsExcellent soundtrack and voice actingCons:Long periods of watching instead of playingSome extraneous dialogueSolid Snake may inspire gamers to grow mullets","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"Hyper-realism marred by too many cut scenes...","reviewText":"MGS2 is one of the best selling games in existence because of the type of game that is it. This is a counter-espionage game that relies more on your ability to conceal yourself than running around the place blasting the hell out of anything that moves (which you can do too if you want). For this reason the game becomes very realistic and the graphics and sound are all too genuine and do not make you feel anything less than actually being there doing what the character is up to at that point in time. The world that you are immersed in has rain, sun and smoke and bad guys patrolling the area. You have both hyper-realistic 1st person views and a third person overhead view as you run around the place. The amount of moves and their combinations are staggering and the actual movement of the character is unparalleled by any game of it type. Watch as you throw your character over a railing and move along the pipe with your hands while dangling over a huge ocean. Let go and watch in horror as you fall to your death. Amazing! The plot is coherent and there is plenty of story to boot but.......... the game design itself is terrible, terrible, terrible.MGS2 is by no means a disaster but unfortunately tries too hard to be a movie and less a game. The truth is that the vast majority, over 85%, of the game is spent watching video clips instead of gaming which is really what we want to do and is the reason why we bought MGS2 in the first place. There are so many video sequences in this game that all of the above suddenly crashes back down to the reality of holding a controller and watching the television screen as some video plays itself out. Sure you can skip it, but then two minutes later you find yourself back holding the controller and watching yet another video.... argghhh.... The other two major disappointments is that the game only takes place in ONE LOCATION - an oil rig, but it is huge! The other is that there are far too many calls and dialogues to go through on your communicator. Fans of the series may also not like the fact that the main protagonist in the first game has been replaced - however this is acceptable and does not detract from the experience.In short this is one of the most hyper-real games that you will ever play - the graphics are nothing short of stunning and the character moves are out of this world - but it is all marred by the terrible amount of video clips that you have to sit through. In short this detracts from the overall gaming experience and you will soon get bored with it. Play MGS2 -- ONLY --  if you have the time and the patients to sit through a three minute video every other minute of game play.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2003"}

I'm impressed with every part of the game. the Single player was long/short enough so you dont get bored of the same thing (shot,run, shut, hide, run, shot, etc), the story surrounding the characters is pretty confusing but understandable enough for you to enjoy it. What I loved the most is the variety in the SP, you dont get bored at all in my opinion it is great. The graphics are amazing, nothing to complain about there. And god the MP is mind blowing. Really addicting, rewarding and contains tons of features!!This game is my introduction to the Battlefield series and it didn't disapoint me at all. Im not the type of guy who is bashing on developers or people just because they believe they are the GOD of Videogames that they master everygame in the world. For me they are all low life idiots.Enjoy videogames for what they are. Don't listen to critics, at the end of the day they are gamers like us and each everyone of us have a different opinion. And in my opinion, people are complaining about this game because1)You don't understand that all the trailers released between the game is announced to the date the game is released are RENDERED!!! No real graphics, no in-game trailers!!! until you guys stop being so close-minded and start understating BUSINESS, you will keep complaining which makes you look kinda ignorant.2)Most of reviews come from COD fanboys, pretty immature, close-minded ignorant people who like to play \"tough guy\" behind their screens believing and thinking that they are the only normal people and others who don't play COD are idiots -.-... grow up please, you are a shame to the industry and gamers who been playing video games for 18 years like me who enjoy playing and that's it, its a freaking GAME!!Graphics: 10Story:9Multiplayer: 10Features: 10Presentation:10Take my opinion/point of view in the game from someone who has never ever played COD, but Killzone series.

{"product_name":"B00012BSJ4","description":"When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing:Metroid. Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better. Buy it immediately.Rated:9.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"J. Sherman \"The Critic\"","summary":"Secret Origins","reviewText":"A revamp of the classic 8-bit game, Zero Mission is my first exposure to the franchise (though other GBA titles with similar concepts gave me an idea of what to expect).  The comic-book-style graphics and the dramatic music combine to make a presentation no one thought portable games could ever achieve at the time.  As for the gameplay, the controls are responsive and the growing abilities of the player against the loads of random enemies and gigantic bosses keep you hooked long after the school bus rides and doctor's appointments.  Non-linear exploration is starting to grow on me, but the in-game map helps in exploring new areas and finding power-ups.  And yet all that effort seems to be for nought when the \"Zero Mission\" leaves an unarmored, ill-equipped Samus Aran to infiltrate a space pirate ship, forcing the player to rely on stealth and evasion to get from A to B.  If that's not enough, they even throw in the original Metroid as a bonus, which is more than I can say for Nintendo trying to sell that title by itself.

{"product_name":"B001B1W3GG","description":"BioShock is an innovative role-playing shooter from Irrational Games who was named IGN&#8217;s 2005 Developer of the Year. BioShock immerses players into a war-torn underwater utopia, where mankind has abandoned their humanity in their quest for perfection.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Immersive and utterly addicting","reviewText":"For awhile, Bioshock was the clincher when it came down to next-gen consoles. With only money and room for one, I had to choose which system to get so when it was announced the highly acclaimed game was being released to the Playstation 3, well I was sold. Not only being able to play multiplatform games but also some solid exclusives, the important thing was that I had to play this. A game that gets this much praise has got to end up disappointing considering the hype, not only from press and critics but my own anticipation, right? Well wrong as this is one of the most captivating games I've played recently and whether you got an Xbox 360 or a PS3 (keyword being \"or\"), Bioshock's a must-play.Story: In the mid 1940's, an ambitious man named Andrew Ryan got fed up with the bureaucrats, politicians and religious leaders trying to see who can control the populace with the most restrictions from medical experiments to freedom of speech. So he secretly created the world of Rapture, a vast city found underwater. In 1960, an unnamed man travelling on a plane finds himself the sole survivor when the plane crashes in the middle of the ocean. Swimming to a nearby lighthouse, he accesses a bathysphere which takes him to Rapture only instead of finding a thriving city, it's in disarray and strange folk genetically modified roam the halls. You have to work your way through the city and discover why the idyllic city has failed.Graphics: There's certain games that really make you feel a part of the world as opposed to just controlling someone on the screen and like games such as Dead Space, Resident Evil 4 or more serene landscapes such as Shadow of the Colossus, Bioshock is another game that, without fear of sounding cheesy, really transports you to another time and place. The art design, attention to detail and a genuine realism really get you thinking you're in this city under the sea. Fantastic water effects and a feel recreating the old 1940's complete with neon graphics, old-school advertisements not to mention the views outside the windows, this is definately one to HDTV.Sound/Music: Another important part of the game's immersion is the sound design which has all the requisite noises of a place that's been decimated: groans, distant rumblins and things busting out of nowhere, the sound helps create an unnerving atmosphere. It's not necessarily scary but it certainly keeps you on your toes. Also welcome is the voice acting though the 2 main speakers seems to be Andrew Ryan (portrayed by Armin Shimerman, Quark from \"Star Trek\" and the first Principal on \"Buffy\") and Atlas, your CODEC so to speak. The Splicers, the genetically modified residents of Rapture, also have strange ramblings and makes them be set apart from just the screeching of other enemies.Gameplay: Essentially this is a FPS though don't think that's all it is. The key with Bioshock is variety and it's surprising how much combat strategies you can develop on the fly. Basically, your fighting is separated into 2 methods: typical gun stuff like pistols, shotguns, grenade launchers etc while the other is the \"Plasmids\", a medical breakthrough involving genetic experimentation, which allows you different abilities. Use Incinerate to light your foes on fire or find an oil spot on the floor and burn that when they're standing on it for even more burnage. Also, say you light him/her on fire and you think they're going to want to find a water source right? Well thanks to Rapture getting the occasional leak, they're not too far so if they've gone for a bit of a swim, just use your electricity and shock the water. There's others as well such as using your telekinesis to grab grenades and bombs in mid-air and toss em back or reposition traps to your advantage. There's more to be found and approaching combat as never been so...fun.Don't think that's the end of it though as occasionally you'll be seen by a camera, sending in flying armed drones. Sure it's easy to just blow them up but why not hack them using a pipe-based minigame (tedious but works well enough) to make your own personal bodyguards? Or hack a turret and you can even hack health stations in case enemies want to cure themselves only to find because you've hacked it that it makes things worse for them. Hacking ammo, item and inventing \"jukeboxes\" will also decrease the amount of money you have to pay which is a definate plus. Only thing is the pipe minigame where you have to make water flow from one part to the other using different panel forms grows kind of tiresome and there's even some where I ran out of pieces or room to move thanks to dead-ends.All of this will come into use when you hear a roar nearby and you know one thing: a Big Daddy is near. Walking around the hallways is a big dude in diving gear (dude on the cover) protecting a girl called the Little Sister who has in her body ADAM, the genetic material vital to Rapture. In order to get it you have to kill the protector and this bugger is as tough as he sounds. Thankfully with the turrets and bodyguard drones (which admittedly don't last long) to using Enrage on nearby enemies which will actually attack him instead of you, eventually you'll defeat him. Only thing is that you have to do it in stages since you'll frequently die though thankfully nearby Vita-Chambers spawn you back in with his health where you last left off thereby not negating all that hard work. Makes the game easy sure but on the other hand, it never becomes frustrating and you can just play and play and not worrying about hitting dead ends.That's one thing to be aware of with this game as well: it's rather addicting and it's one of those games where you might look at the clock and go \"well I can afford to play a bit more, it's only a simple objective anyway\" only to find out it's 4 AM and needing to get to bed. I was that hooked and despite its hefty 5 Gig install - which is strangely shorter than Devil May Cry 4's 20 minute one - which lasts 10 minutes or so, Bioshock is definately a game to get for your Playstation 3. As for people who already have the 360 version, well unless you're that into the game, you don't really have to bother but for non-360 owners like myself or people who never played it than definately go for it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2008"}

The series has always been a blast, but there have always been a few compliants, awekward static camera angles, polygon characters don't look good on prerendered backgrounds, and the pivoting control style was always irritating. Until Code Veronica RE 2 was my favorite of the series, but Code Veronica took what was working with Resident Evil and improved on most of the aspects of it. Mostly, this games's Dreamcast incarnation was revolutionary for it's time. RE: CV on the DC was the first game of the current generation to blow me away graphically and started a new trend in game cinemas, relying on realt time cut scenes rather than pre rendered ones. The only thing that prevents me from giving this game the perfect score it couls have gotten was the blasted control scheme which has got to go! CV has a moving camera, the characters move along real time polygonla backgrounds that still look amazing, even though the characters look outdated now compared to Final Fantasy X, Metal Gear Solid 2, and just about any GameCube title.The PS 2 version adds about ten minutes of footage to the game, including a spectacular \"final battle\" between Chris and Wesker that was just great. The graphics actually look a little worse in some spots than the Dreamcast version as the PS 2 Aliasing problem rears it's ugly head on occasion, but it's nothing that's really unbearable, and the extras this game has makes it worthwhile IF, and only IF you don't already own the DC version of the game. The sound on the PS 2 version is enhanced, however, and the game is a bit darker, which is a good thing, but aside form that... well, let me put it this way, the DC guide book will get you through CVX. Item placement is the same, sectret codes are the same, etc. If you don't already have the Dreamcast version do yourself a favor and pick this one up, as it's the last Resident Evil (excluding the RE Online game which will not be a part of the time line) that will appear on a non-Nintendo system.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00002STGL","description":"A first-person shooter that mixes spy and sci-fi,Perfect  Darkis both a thoroughly engrossing one-player experience and a  riotously fun multiplayer romp. Easily one of the best games of its  genre on any video game console, this long-awaited follow-up toGoldenEye 007is a must-have for Nintendo 64 owners--and a damn  good reason to be one if you're not.The futuristicPerfect Darkcasts players as Joanna Dark, a  secret agent who becomes embroiled in a sinister conspiracy involving  aliens and an evil corporation. Gameplay is broken down into missions,  each with objectives that must be unerringly completed before  progressing to the next mission. This is not your typical kill-anything-that-moves  game: putting a bullet in the wrong person, not keeping the  right one alive, or perforating a seemingly unimportant inanimate object  can often result in mission failure.WhilePerfect Dark's solo missions play out much like those inGoldenEye 007, the game's fantastic multiplayer options are  another matter entirely. Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy. However, the real fun here is in  the highly customizable Combat Simulator, a one-to-four-player  simultaneous-play mode that features both free-for-alls and team-based  challenges and can include up to eight Simulants, computer-controlled  combatants of varying behavior.Although Simulants make for decent adversaries or teammates, you'll want  to grab a friend--and an Expansion Pak, as only 35 percent of the game  is available without one--to fully enjoyPerfect Dark.--Joe  HonPros:One of the best first-person shooters on any video game consoleOutstanding multiplayer game with huge replay valueBevy of game options, cheats, and secret featuresExcellent training mode with challenges all of its ownCons:Graphics get ugly when playing with more than two players","reviewerName":"JakFrost \"thegreatui\"","summary":"Best Shooter","reviewText":"When Perfect Dark came out it was by far the best shooter, not one matched it.

{"product_name":"B000QY9C90","reviewerName":"Deimos \".\"","summary":"Love zombie movies, games, but this sucks.","reviewText":"This game is somewhat fun at times except for the special infected.  The tank, hunter, boomer and esspessially the smoker.  One hit is all it takes, it doesn't matter if you have full health, health packs, full ammo, super guns etc....one grab and your toast.  Your character (who can be lit on fire, survive explosions, fall from heights if you can without grabbing a ledge mid flight and be shot insane amounts of times with buckshot before dying) just lies there like a 10 year old girl and gets owned by the special infected.....it's pathetic and makes the game needlessly frustrating.  Your whole group could be knocked down, not dead just knocked down and if you get grabbed by any special infected the games over....that is amazingly stupid.  Why the hell can't your character fight back against these lame enemies?.  The temp. invincibility the zombies have is kind of lame, it's a glitch maybe but you shoot the bastards and they keep hitting you like your bullet magically passed threw them.  The tank teleports threw walls, not busts threw them just teleports as if one shotting you to death isn't enough.  Computer controlled Smokers tounges can defy logic by going around corners in perpendicular shapes or threw pinholes, doors, and walls.  Hunters can miss you with a pounce or pounce backwards in different directions and you still teleport under them and get owned.  Skill is not required or achieveable in this game, they will get you every single time.  When you get once shot you die due to the moronic AI players that stand there and watch you get lamed, it's maddening. The bots are cleptomanical retards that bust through windows, teleport through doors or walls, and teleport past you to steal every first aid pack and pills in the level.  They also walk in front of your crosshair most anytime you shoot, they open any door you close and end up just being total useless idiots.  I usually just gun them down and take their health packs when I need one, or they steal them using means beyond physics.  The harder the difficulty the more useless they are.  This game also has hovering molotov cocktails. If a horde is running at you and you throw one into it, the molotov will hover for a few seconds before exploding, ensuring any special infected are safly away from it and that your surrounded by \"zombies\" taking damaged before the fire kills anything.  I put zombies in quotes because these zombies don't eat people they simply pummel you to death with punches and kicks.  Left 4 Dead also has bloodthursty fire, yes anytime you blow up a gas can or throw a molotov the fire chases you, even sometimes when it's invisible it still damages you, maybe it's infected too?  The DLC was a total joke and made Valve look tired and lazy.  Survival mode sucks, you get a tiny blocked off part of a level already in the game, a crappy tiny lighthouse level all of which have an instant finale with endless ownage with baddies raining from the sky until you die.  Millions of Zombies, multiple hunters, multiple smokers, multiple tanks raining down on you until your dead.....wow so much fun to die in 1-3 mins in a tiny locked area when every special infected can one shot you.  The PC version actually has new campagins made by fans since Valve is too lazy to make them.  L4D II still has no dlc with valve again saying on the games release that they would support the games with dlc. L4D ii was a major step down from l4d which is flawed and glitched beyond logic itself.  If you want a real zombie game Killing Floor is the way to go its eons better and tripwire fully supports their games with new dlc regularly unlike valve which give you one extra short map and that's it.  Also no monster or zombie can rape you simply by touching you in KF when you have full health you can go down fighting. In l4d you sit there crying for useless clepto AI players to save you while they watching you die while gorging on health packs and pills.  This is a pathetic, retardedly glitched, broken, frustrating piece of garbage....trust be get Killing Floor.  L4D 2 builds on the same problems but just adds more special infected that only need to touch you once coupled with endless larger hordes....it's virtually unplayable.  L4D 2 is simply a 60 dollar update that should have been part of L4D 1 but valve say fit to abandon L4D after 1 half assed tiny DLC patch.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2009"}

I admit that I was very interested in this game after hearing all the hype but have never watched the show except for one episode and the film.Until now.To prepare myself for the game, I started watching the show from the very beginning. I love it! After a few seasons I finally started to honker down and play the game.I wasn't expecting a deep RPG game like Final Fantasy (of which I am a huge fan) or any other JRPG, but I still was pleasantly surprised by how fun this game is and its combination of exploration and fantasy and RPG. It reminded me more of the Mario RPGs: a little of the RPG element, but not as deep with just the right amount of fun.There's tons of customization too, and my character has gone through a few wardrobes. Because I'm only through a few seasons in the show, there are some things that have gone over my head, but a few still that I understood and have actually laughed out loud about. There's much more depth and resolution in the game than what I'm watching now, and I heard it's pretty exact to how the show appears nowadays.The game has extreme amounts of quality and polish considering, from what I've heard, its development background. There's much love in the game from Parker & Stone as there is in the show. They've seemed to get a firm grasp on Western society and pop culture, not to mention the mechanics of plot and gameplay, and the result is a fun experience that will keep you laughing--something comedic video games *should* be.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2014"}

Final Bout was okay, but this game is much better. The character selection is mostly everyone from the saiyan saga to the end of the cell saga. They even have the same voices from the tv show. Now im not just giving this game 4 stars because I like DBZ, it earned them.There are quite a few modes of play. There is story mode, where you follow basically the same story as the tv show. Then you can go back and play it again to get more characters. There is duel mode, which is just 1 on 1. There is also tournament mode, where you compete for money. With the money, you can buy capsules to customize the fighter's moves. Also you can unlock harder level tourneys, so you will not get too bored. Last but not least, legend of hercule mode. This mode is unlocked once you beat the adept tournament, and buy the capsule from mr.popo. It is probably the most fun mode, because you compete in the cell games and there are handicaps. Hercule always has something funny to say that just cracks me up. If you are a fan of Hercule or hate him, you will like this mode. Truly this makes the game the best. Playing with Hercule is the most rewarding expeirience ever. His moves make him look so weak, yet they are funny and do alot of damage in the end. But you are probably wondering about the fighting. The fighting is pretty basic. You can move forward and backward, or sidestep to move left and right. But you cannot jump or crouch. The only way to fly is to get knocked into the air. Still the moves look beautiful and are easy to master. When you transform into a super saiyan or power up, you do more damage, and your icon by your health changes. But theres one thing that you have to learn, its how exactly to pull off moves. The move may say to do 4 kicks in a row, but hitting the kick button 3 times will probably be sufficient. This is because hitting kick once may result in the character kicking 2 times. Once you understand it, and play duel a couple times, you will start to love it, and it will feel natural. The graphics are beautiful. Everyone looks just like the cartoon, but in 3d. Also everyone moves so fluently, and dont jerk around. So the fighting is top-notch.The only big flaw in this game is that it may get old. Fighting over and over can get boring. And after doing story mode, it is pointless to do it again. Also, no girl fighters are available, so the females may feel left out. One more thing, there are not enough tutorials to teach you how to do things. There are some in the story, but not enough. I still do not know how to charge my ki, and it took me forever to learn how to side step. Otherwise, feel free to buy this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2002"}

{"product_name":"B001CWXAP2","description":"","reviewerName":"Gargus","summary":"Same old, same old.","reviewText":"The issue with this game is it's just more of the same thing on the market now. Yes it has a few new trappings and cool ideas thrown in but the core mechanic that makes up 90% of the game is still the same thing as all of the other mmo games. The novelty factor wore off after a couple weeks of playing and I found myself doing dailies, doing the same routine every time I logged in and I quickly fell into a sense of familiarity with this game. That's when it hit me; I was bored before my free 30 day subscription was even up.All the good things in it I liked are the same things I liked about rift, world of warcraft, everquest and so on so I'll just cut to what I didn't like about SW:TOR.1) The engine and game isn't optimized at all. Even my computer (which is way way above reccomended specs and will run any game on the market with headroom to spare) never ran it smoothly, especially at any higher end settings. It always felt like it was running just a little too sluggish. Bioware said the massive complaints about performance were due to so many people running inferior computers but that isn't the case really. The games engine simply isnt optimized well enough. The graphics are subpar as well. I am never one to think that good graphics will equal good game but given a game where you're basically repeating the same actions day in and day out it should atleast look pretty while doing it. WOW looks better to me and it's a dated engine, but it's wonderful use of color and art direction makes it stand out while TOR has this underlying feel of looking like a dozen other games.2) It requires you to use EA's origin service. This is ultimately why I canceled my subscription and won't play this anymore. Origin was the last straw for me in my list of complaints. Origin IS spyware, it tells you it is in the EULA you agree to when you agree to the terms and conditions to install it. It also was recently changed to say you can't sue EA. There is a reason why germany (yes the whole country) took action against Origin because it invades privacy. I detest origin and again was the last straw in my choosing not to play battlefield 3 anymore. And as someone tried to point out in the comments section that origin isnt required, yes it is and the gams official FAQ says so. [...]3) The game is a theme park much like WOW. Once you start playing you're constantly guided through the game via quests and so on. It never felt like I got to explore anything on my own or discover anything because the game was always holding my hand and telling me where to go. There was no sense of awe, no sense of exploration, no sense of discovery because you're constantly having the game tell you what and where to go next as you progress through the game. It's like there is a invisible path of quests you have to follow through from level 1 to 50.4) The game is too easy and that makes most people you meet insufferable to be around. Much like everyother mmo out now the game is geared toward allowing in anyone who wants to play to get maximum subscriptions. In order to do that you need to appeal to the lowest common denominator by making your game as easy as you can get away with. Much like wow it takes little effort to level up and do things aside from the occasional time you need a party to do something (which makes it feel inconvient). You never get this feeling of accomplishing anything by overcoming a challenge because the game has no real challenges or penalties. The problem with a MMO like this and it being easy is that when it becomes easy then players get bored easily and bored players become obnoxious players and obnoxious players are players I don't want to play with. There is a reason why the majority of the player base for like WOW are petty, obnoxious and sarcastic brats and why the majority of the everquest player base are friendlier, kinder and more helpful and that reason is because WOW makes players lazy and bored by being way to easy to play and everquest requires work and teamwork. Even death has virtually no penalty, there is no real reason to be careful or thrill of being almost taken down. In this if you die it is just sort of a ho-hum experince and you go on not really caring, thus there is no element of danger.5) Everything feels like one big corridor. It always feels like you're being funneled through this corridor from one objective to the next. There is no sense of a large scale and all the areas feel so small and cramped. Once you have checked out a area it feels even smaller. At first everything was fine but it didn't take long before all the area, dungeons and so on all just start feeling like little compartments in a rat maze.6) It doesnt take long before everything starts to run together. Much like every other mmo once you start playing everything is cool but after a few weeks all the players and areas start to look the same, have the same feel to them and nothing becomes interesting to check out anymore, even new areas to you are more of the same.7) The quests are still fetch me this, go kill 20 of that, take this to that person and so on. Its essentially just like WOW where the quests drive the game and just like WOW and every other mmo the quests are boring and trite. The story was cool for a bit in here though till I found myself not paying attention to it anymore because I was bored of them. So basically the questing system is tired and boring. I miss everquest in the sense quests were few and far between, the game was more about exploring, playing with others, crafting and killing stuff. TOR relies heavily on doing repetitive and snooze worthy quests just like every other mmo. I am tired of having to go kill X amount of something or picking up something off the ground to bring back.8) It feels more like a massively single player game instead of a massively multiplayer game. It feels more like a giant single player game where you occasionally have to work with a tiny group of others, rest of the time other players are just there to make the game feel more alive by running around and talking to each other. There is no sense of teamwork, no sense of community and no sense of comradery at all. It's essentially a single player game set in a giant chat room. Essentially it all feels like a me me me me single player game with co-op thrown in for when you need something but can't get it yourself.9) Space combat is on rails. While I was'nt expecting a flight simulator here it just felt so un-needed and thrown together at the last minute. It feels more like a game they should have added to play to pass time while waiting for a friend to log in instead of trying to claim its a feature.10) Once again crafting is pointless and just in there as a time sink and to keep people from complaining that other mmo game's have crafting of some sort. Aside from just a few things crafting on the whole is a waste of time and does'nt benefit the player or the games economy at all. There is no sense of bartering for crafted goods either, basically you make stuff to vendor off or hope some low level guy might buy it when in reality they wont because quests provide what they need. The fact you can also have your crew harvest for you and such is ez-mode laziness.Basically I could go on and on but I won't bother because in the end this is just yet another mmo that is trying to be WOW and trying to be the WOW killer. I honestly wish they would have just re-created the entire star wars galaxies game for the modern age with a healthy helping of new content because SWG (before the big easy mode patch) was what a real star wars mmo should have been and was. I would play TOR if it had a 5 dollar fee, but I'm not paying 60 bucks for a game and 15 bucks a month to play something that bores me and is just like every other mmo in creation.So my advice is skipping over this and just wait for guild wars 2 or secret world. Or if you're itching to scratch your mmo itch then try one of the many free ones like shin megami tenesi online, dc universe online, everquest 2 free, dungeons and dragons online, runes of magic, lord of the ring online, or even world of tanks. But I can not reccomend paying to play this game.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2012"}

Portal is. You awaken in a white chamber, all alone save for the robotic autotune voice of GLaDOS, and your trusty Portal gun. This device allows you to open two portals (one blue, one orange) on almost any surface imaginable, and travel between them. Sounds simple, but it's one of the most clever and intensely addicting games in ages. Not only is there so much lurking underneath the story itself (seemingly cute but deceptive), it's also such a dizzying and brilliant (and different!) use of the regular FPS videogame, that is sure to challenge anyone's logic, reflexes and tickle their senses. The soundtrack is brief but has just the right feeling (a soothing electronic ambient lull), and the game is full of cute and nerdy specifics sure to please almost anyone. I'd recommend Portal to gamers in particular, but anyone looking for a new kind of puzzle to sweep them up for hours. There is hardly any violence to speak of (save some nasty little turret droids), and it's all perfectly possible to complete with enough patience. It definitely helps if you're at least a little bit familiar with first person videogames though, but chances are you might be after this.

But once I started playing, it was nothing like the fun of playing Thousand Year Door. It is okay, nice graphics, fun twist with the '3D' flip but it just wasn't enough to keep it interesting throughout the game.It just wasn't as much fun in battles, hidden items, skills acquired, and storyline as past Paper Mario games.I've since playedNintendo, Paper Mario Sticker Star 3DSand really enjoyed that version although Thousand Year Door is still my favorite.For the price, it just wasn't enough of a game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2012"}

Every Need for Speed is different and some are obviously better than others. I loved the realism of Need for Speed Shift. I thought that it really delivered as a true driving simulation. It had full steering wheel / pedal support and the force feedback makes you feel like you are really racing while using myLogitech G27 Racing Wheel.Need for Speed Hot Pursuit doesn't deliver at the same level at all when compared side by side. First of all it doesn't have manual transmission which was very disappointing to me. I got over it in time but I don't understand why they wouldn't have included this as an option. It's much more exciting to race with manual transmission instead of automatic.  It also doesn't fully support my steering wheel which is another huge drawback. That being said, I still love this game.The graphics are incredible and second to none in my opinion. The cars are very realistic and the tracks are very detailed and brilliant.The offline races are exciting because not only do you compete to complete your objective and finish the race in time. You also compete to finish the race faster than your friends. As you start each race it will give you the times for each of the friends in your friends list that have completed the race. You can challenge their time and beat it and then the Autolog feature will post that information online for them to see and they will receive a message saying that you have beat their time. You have a wall on Autolog that is like facebook. As people beat your time it will post to your wall for you to see. If you beat their time it will post to their wall as well. It basically enables you to play against your friends even while they are offline.There are 60+ cars that you can unlock by racing either online or offline. Many of the cars can be used as both cops and racers. Most all of the cars are exciting and there are so many exotic cars to choose from. There are several different classes of cars so you can choose what level of performance you want.  If you purchase the limited edition version of the game then you will get a couple extra cars.The online mode is the best part of this game. There are three different modes to play with between 2-8 players. There is normal race mode with between 2-8 players. There is interceptor mode which is only 2 players and where one person is the racer and the other is the cop and the cop must bust the racer. Then there is my favorite which is Hot Pursuit which is between 2-8 players where there is two teams. For example 4 cops and 4 racers and at least one of the racers must finish the race to win. If the cops bust all racers then they win. This is a blast to play online with your friends. As a racer you have spike strips, turbo, EMP and Jam as additional resources to use. As a cop you have spike strips, helicopter, road blocks and EMP to use. All things considered it makes for an incredible chase experience that I could play all night long.As I mentioned previously there are a few things that they could have done to make the game better but I still love playing the game and I am so glad that I got it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2011"}

{"product_name":"B004ML7WOK","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Visceral Multi-Tasking!","reviewText":"Ever wish you had another pair of arms?  How about a pair of superhuman bloodthirsty demon arms that can rip a door off of a car or throw a metal pipe through a goon and stick him to the wall?  That would leave your hands free to dual wield machine guns!  With Darkness II, this is what you get.Story:  7/10This game picks up after the traumatic events of Darkness.  Jackie, a mob boss with demonic powers deals with the loss of his true love.  The game begins with a rival hit squad trying to take Jackie out.  Critically injured, he must summon the Darkness to survive.  As Jackie seeks revenge, he discovers that this is more than just a simple mob hit and it involves supernatural forces.  Unfortunately, the story is told very deliberately and slowly.  There are cut scenes within the missions, but there are also long segments of the game where Jackie is in his mansion and has to walk from 'family member' to `family member' and ask one question.  This can get a bit tedious.  Mansion aside, the story is fairly complex and moves well as you progress through the game.Gameplay:  9/10Jackie's attacks are pretty amazing.  While he is in the dark, he's got enough supernatural powers to fill up 4 skill trees.  His demonic arms can rip enemies in half, while giving you a boost to your (health, powers, shield, or ammo) and interact with the environment.  The arms can throw fan blades, poles, heavy objects, or use car doors as riot shields.Jackie also has two other types of magic attacks.  He can summon a swarm of insects that distract and harm enemies.  He can also infuse his bullets with dark energy allowing them to seek targets and shoot through walls.  Both of these powers work on a cool-down timer.  Occasionally, Jackie can throw a black hole at his enemies which sucks them into oblivion.Jackie replenishes his health by eating the hearts of his victims.  So, the dead bodies are a commodity.  But if you insta-kill them with a black hole or darkness enhanced bullets, the bodies are completely destroyed.  So, you need to use your powers strategically.Unfortunately for Jackie, the enemies figure out his weakness and start carrying lights and placing generators all over the place which negate his powers.  Jackie can shoot out the lights or destroy the generators with an arsenal of weapons.  He is armed with two small weapons (pistols, submachine guns) and one large weapon (assault rifle or shotgun).  With a gun equipped, the Left Trigger looks down the sights and the right trigger fires.  At any time, he can dual wield the small arms.  With two guns equipped, the triggers fire the weapon in the corresponding hand.  This is less accurate, but sprays bullets all over the place.The enemies consist of armed goons with firearms, melee weapons, magic attacks, or supernatural creatures.For the most part, Jackie runs and guns while trying to make the levels as dark as possible.  It sounds simple, but the death animations are really satisfying.Levels:  7/10There are three types of levels:  Kill Enemies, Fight a Boss, Diet Stealth.  Unfortunately, these are repetitive.  In the basic levels, Jackie battles his way through linear levels and fights enemies.  There really isn't much variety in the enemies.  Most have guns, some have lights (negate your powers), some have shields, some have a whip which knocks the guns out of your hands.  That's about it.The Boss fights usually consist of a boss who shoots at you and summons goons while teleporting from platform to platform.  Unfortunately, almost all of the boss fights in the game are identical to each other.There is a bit of stealth in the game where Jackie possesses one of his demonic pals.  His pal dies in light, and takes damage from bullets, but heals rapidly.  In this form, the player can sneak up on guards and insta-kill them.  If you get killed, you just respawn and all of the enemies that you have already eviscerated stay dead.  Even if you are terrible at stealth, this is really forgiving.Graphics:  8/10The game looks like an Image Comic come to life.  There's good variety to the levels.  The visual effects are well done and compliment the art style.  The characters look and animate well, even though they're stylized.Sound:  8/10The voice acting is good and the sound effects bring the action to life.  You'll hear lots of gunfire, screams of the dying, and explosions.  Oh, and mob humor, too.Replay Value:  5/10The game is ONLY 5-6 HOURS!  If you finish the campaign, you can play again with all of your powers on a different difficulty level.  Your second time through will take about 4 hours.  The game is very linear and full of skippable cutscenes.  But when you skip them, you only skip one line of dialogue at a time, so it feels tedious.There is also an assassination game where you play as one of four supernatural (racial stereotype) hitmen and fight in arena style battles against mob bosses with henchmen.  These characters aren't as cool as Jackie and you can only play the first mission solo.  After that, you need to play Cooperatively Online.  This seems extremely limited and forced.  Each hitman has their own skill tree, but their powers are just subsets of what Jackie has.Maturity:  ADULTGore, violence, torture, sex, demons, language, drug use...  This game is rated M for every reason that a game could be rated M.  It's like they had a checklist.  \"Oh, no!!!  There's no cocaine reference!  We need to get that in there ASAP!\"This game also has one of the most realistically depressing brothel / strip club scenes ever.  The girls look less like models and more like drug addicts as they offer to please you without any emotion or enthusiasm in their voices.  It's funny... and sad.  Mostly sad.Overall:  8/10This is a very fun, but very short game.  You can finish it between lunch and dinner.  Even though the levels are repetitive, Jackie's arsenal of demonic attacks saves the game.  They're wickedly brutal and fun to use.  You'll have to play through twice (9-10 hours) to unlock all of his powers.Buy it cheap if you can.Buy it if you're OK with a short, but good game.Buy it if you'll take advantage of the online arena battles.RENT IT if you have 5-6 hours to blow through the campaign.Avoid it if you don't like M rated games, mob stories, short games...Avoid it if you like open ended games and complex gameplay.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000IONGVI","description":"THE LAND OF MYSTERY MEETS THE LEGEND OF SPEED. Sonic races through the exotic world of the Arabian Nights to harness the awesome power of the secret rings before they fall into the hands of the evil genie, Erazor! The blue dude is unstoppable with the new ability to slow time and boost forward faster than ever, but he's never gone up against a genie before!","reviewerName":"Cale E. Reneau \"Mound of Wires\"","summary":"How Sonic got most of his groove back.","reviewText":"Call me crazy, call me a fan of deep gameplay, but I've just never understood this whole Sonic the Hedgehog hullaballoo. Back when Sonic made his console debut in the early 90s he immediately separated himself from his biggest competitor, a chubby plumber, and in doing so, set himself apart as the \"cool\" console mascot. And cool he was. While Mario was busy breaking bricks and lollygagging his way through pipes, Sonic was flying through worlds with ease, doing all sorts of cool tricks in the process. However, what Mario lacked in \"coolness\" he always made up for with deep, addictive gameplay. Sonic was cool, yeah, but when it came down to the quality of the gaming experience, he just never could gain ground on that chubby guy.This flaw of Sonic followed him into the 3D era as well. The arrival of the Sega Dreamcast brought Sonic fans the Sonic Adventure series, which often slowed down the speedy hedgehog in favor of more traditional 3D platforming. In a way, it worked. But this was Sonic, and you can't very well have Sonic and not have speed! So Sonic the Hedgehog has been in sort of a drought over the better part of a decade, trying his best to keep up in his old age. Often plagued by poor camera control and even poorer character control, Sega's mascot is no longer the poster child for \"cool\" gaming, but the perfect example of what a video game shouldn't be.The light at the end of the tunnel for Sonic was supposed to be his latest adventure, Sonic and the Secret Rings, and at first look, it seems like a pretty solid idea. Bring Sonic back to his roots, make him fast, recreate the 2D Sonic experience in 3D. So the folks over at Sega have Sonic constantly moving in this game along a set path, the player steers him left and right by tilting the Wii remote accordingly. To jump, simply hit the 2 button. Shove the remote forward mid-air to perform a homing attack (a gesture that really feels quite solid).So far so good. Sonic is once again running through worlds, collecting rings and other valuables while blasting into enemies. But then the core flaw of Sonic the Hedgehog once again becomes apparant. The gameplay is still pretty shallow. Sega has tried to paint over this problem by allowing Sonic to gain experience points throughout his adventure, making him faster, stronger, and more cocky. Still, this is 2007. Running fast and collecting rings may have been compelling, or jaw dropping in 1991, but we've come to expect more from our games nowadays, especially when they're platformers. Sadly, Sonic and the Secret Rings does not recreate the excitement and experience of the traditional Sonic game, nor does it create a new experience to get excited about. It's simply disappointing.However, from a visual standpoint, Sonic and the Secret Rings does not disappoint. You won't find the benefits of high definition gaming as you would Sonic's other current-generation endeavors. But what Sonic and the Secret Rings lacks in polish and shine, it makes up for in beauty and detail. The worlds that Sonic speeds through are beautifully and meticulously created, often giving players something to gawk at when the game slows its pace occasionally. Having played Sonic the Hedgehog on Xbox 360, I can safely say that Sonic and the Secret Rings is a much more satisfying game where both visuals and gameplay are concerned.In the end, the gamers will decide if Sonic and the Secret Rings is a hit or a miss. Sonic fans of old may enjoy the new twist on the old gameplay, but fans who never really latched on to the series will most likely be disappointed again. Is it the best 3D Sonic game? It really depends on what you're looking for. As a traditional 3D platformer it fails, but in recreating the 2D world of Sonic in 3D it at least comes close. Sonic may not be as cool as he used to be, but at least he's trying.6.0  PresentationMenus and cutscenes are artistically created, and work in setting the environment of the world of the Arabian Nights.  But the story is a little silly, and largely unnecessary.8.9  GraphicsSome of the best graphics available on the Wii, and the level design is often meticulously crafted to enhance the experience.4.9  SoundThe music in the game is worse than Excite Truck, but unfortunately the game does not offer the custom sountrack option. As always, Sonic is better when he's not talking, but he still won't shut up.4.5  GameplayGoing fast is fun for a while, but then it wears off. The game suffers from the same follies of the original Sonic games, with the added problem of going backwards which is neither intuitive nor fun.6.0  Lasting AppealRPG fans may find some saving grace in the experience points, but the tacked-on party games are just lame and poorly presented.6.2  OVERALL(out of 10 / not an average)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2007"}

Much of the setting, action, and controls have survived the  translation. The difference here is that there's just more of a good thing in  the PS2'sDark Legacy. You play as one of eight characters--four from theGauntlet Legends, plus a sorceress, knight, dwarf, and jester.Dark  Legacyalso features a larger selection of threads for each fighter.

It's you versus crowds of enemies with bosses every now and again. There are more \"minibosses\" in this version with generals and chimera, but they end up being more annoying than challenging.Story: 3/10Even for a cheap franchise re-release, the graphics are pretty poor, especially on the new characters. If you've played the arcade you'll find nothing new. If you haven't, then try to be forgiving because there's not much to see.Graphics: 3/10The sounds are generally corny, but there are some good aura effects like hearing people pounding on the nailed-shut coffins in the Desecrated Temple. Voicing is pretty lame, but it faithfully reproduces (in other words regurgitates) Gauntlet Legends on the arcade and N64. Lack of independent volume leveling brings the score down to mediocre.Sound: 4/10While the music is surprisingly decent, that's probably more because it's catchy when it's there and so many of the other standards are so low. More for nostalgia than any merits of its own.Music: 6/10This game might seem a chore when going single-player, but add friends and it gets exponentially more fun - up to four players. The levels change subtly depending on how many players are there, and while there's little real depth it's still good arcadey hack-and-slash fun. Best with 2+ players. There are plenty of items and power-ups, but for some reason this version disables the ability to turn them off for better timing, or selling them, so everything ends up being almost completely useless and this seriously degrades the score.Gameplay: 6/10You can replay any level you've unlocked at will, including boss battles, but unlike the N64 version you don't get any cool abilities like permanent Anti-Death Halo for beating the final boss. While it's enjoyable spending time with friends, you'll probably only want to run through a few levels before you'll want to take a break or put in something different. It might have been better if item management had remained, but special abilities are almost useless and the long time it takes to level-up and upgrade makes this game get tedious at higher levels, with no real rewards.Replayability: 4/10There's little about this game that shines, but it is undeniable fun when played with friends. I wouldn't recommend a rent (characters are too weak at the start and options are limited), but it's not a game you should get for yourself (when I say it's best with friends, I mean it's good only with friends). Admittedly, it is good for nostalgia or if you and a few friends want an arcade fix, but it's not going to surprise you with any quality.Overall: 6.0/10","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2010"}

Catherine's core themes-those of free will, of the delicate nature of relationships and the choices we make within them, marry perfectly with the intense, terror-filled gameplay that serves to accurately reflect Vincent's growing sense of anxiety. It is an experience wholly unlike any to come before it, and is certain to leave gamers talking and thinking about Vincent's tribulations long after the credits have rolled.","reviewerName":"Adrian Cooper \"That Guy from Venus. :D\"","summary":"Luciously different.","reviewText":"I'm not even a straight guy but this game was awesome. Gorgeous visuals, interesting characters and gameplay that is pretty addicting. You play as the attractive main character, Vincent who is confused about his life and where his relationship is headed with his girlfriend, Katherine. He often goes to the bar to meet up with his friends to talk about guy things and catch up on what is happening around town. I felt that the male characters' bond was one of the most intriguing aspects of the game. The main gameplay however is puzzle-related and happens in Vincent's dreams. You find yourself in a nightmare and having to tower and maneuver yourself around these different blocks. At first it is pretty easy and straightforward to manage your way to the top. But after a few stages it gets increasingly difficult. Now I haven't played this game since like April but I'm a bit more than halfway through the game and think it's worth it. The controls take some getting used to but can be mastered within a half hour or so.I think it'd be weird to make a review of this game and forget the main attraction though: The other Catherine. She is the sexy blond girl who is alluring yet has a short temper. She knows how to get her way too! Catherine is the girl who helps Vincent cheat on his girlfriend Katherine and Vincent eventually starts feeling really bad about it. Another one of the cool things about this game though happens after you climb the mountain of blocks in a level and get to the end. You wander around a large, floating rock where there are sheep men and eventually you have to go into the confession booth. The booth presents you with a question of morality and such and you have to give your opinion on what you think is right for you or what you believe. Then after that's over it goes to a screen that shows the percentage of what men and women said online. It's really neat.There are more things about this game that are pleasing and I could go on and on but I'm gonna end the review here. It's definitely different from any puzzle game I've ever played and I really like the story and characters that go along with it. I think most people who like video games and are 17 or older should try this game at least once.4.25 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2012"}

A game that can do this gives you the exceptional gaming experience that you want in a game.

Shooting , climbing , jumping , scaling walls ,etc , etc. I am not trying to down play the uncharted games but this game seems leagues better. I think its the dark gripping gritty game play and story that sets it apart.I don't know what this game looks like on the Xbox 360 but it looks absolutely amazing on the Xbox One. The game really looks like it was made for the next gen system and not just a port of the 360 game.

Even though I paid the premium price of 59.99 for this game , I have no regrets , its just that good. If you have already played this game on the 360 or ps3 I'm not sure you would want to spend an additional 59.99 just to have the Next gen version , but if you have not , I highly recommend this game even at the premium price tag..

Red Faction II features a revamped Geo-Mod engine to provide dynamically destructive environments, an elite squad of soldiers and 14 weapons of destruction to aid your overthrow of the tyrant governor!","reviewerName":"-- \"--\"","summary":"Join the Faction","reviewText":"\"Red Faction II\" is a good first-person shooter, period. It rivals the likes of \"Unreal II,\" and for all its similarities it is infinitely superior to \"Devastation.\" The icing on the cake, of course, is the fact that this is a budget title, and costs considerably less than what you would usually pay for a game of this type. It's a sweet deal, indeed.The plot is typical for a game of this sort, but still a decent backdrop for the action, and it even supplies a few twists. What is more noteworthy than the storyline and its characters, though, is the cast that was assembled to voice the game. Jason Statham (\"The Transporter,\" \"Snatch\") and Lance Henriksen (\"Aliens,\" \"The Terminator\") are the real highlights. Celebrity voice talent doesn't make a good game, of course, but it certainly seems to imply that this is not a budget title at all, since you generally expect the production quality to suffer if you dish out less dough.So how about the action? It's furious, and pretty relentless. There are few lulls - which is good, since the campaign runs a little short. The scripting is nicely done, and your arsenal of weapons is in a constant state of expansion. What's more, the weapons, while not particularly original (it's the usual variety of railguns, shotguns, and rocket launchers), pack a satisfying kick, and violently dispose of your foes. When going guns akimbo, it's worth noting that each weapon fires individually - fire your left-hand gun by clicking the right mouse button, and vice versa. Why more shooters fail to use this device is beyond me. It helps as well that your enemies don't rush you and throw themselves in front of your bullets. They behave with a little more sophistication, and will often take cover behind pillars, leap out of range, or attempt to flank your position.If you are familiar with the original \"Red Faction,\" then you know that one of that game's most hyped features was its deformable terrain. Your rockets can shatter walls, topple pillars, and wreak havoc on the landscape. This is a carry-over feature of the sequel, needless to say, and goes so far as to improve the technology. Granted, you are still limited to what you can destroy by the game's developers, but the wanton mayhem is good fun, and gives \"Red Faction II\" a style of its own.Unfortunately, the game's graphics are certainly behind the times. They aren't bad per se, but textures suffer from minimal detail and everything has a brownish \"Quake\" look about it. Fortunately, enemy and friendly models are decently animated and don't look quite as dull as the scenery that surrounds them. Other detriments to the overall experience: limited save system that speaks volumes about the game's multiplatform release, and, if you're a multiplayer addict, don't bother applying here. And yes, the single player campaign is somewhat brief, but it's very good while it lasts.In the end, \"Red Faction II\" is a budget title that doesn't feel like a budget title. The graphics may be dated and the game may be a little short, but given the price tag it's all very, very worthwhile.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2003"}

The grips snap on simply and easily. Takes two seconds. Once on, they feel like an extension of the unit. Only once or twice, during rough handling on my part, have they risked coming off.They make holding the Vita FAR more comfortable, somewhat similar to holding a standard controller. Gone are the hand and wrist cramps I used to get from extended usage. They make the unit a little bulkier, yes, but the tradeoff is TOTALLY worth it.No jacks, buttons, or other features are obscured by the grips.The grips also turn the shoulder buttons into triggers. I prefer this and find that action games control much better this way. The triggers are responsive and fast; I've see no difference in performance using them.Finally, one unadvertised feature is that these grips double as a protector/case when it comes to side impacts. They won't protect the front and back screens, but they do protect the outer edges of the unit.Bottom line is, for just $11, no Vita user should be without these.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2014"}

Dragon Age II is perhaps my most favorite of the Dragon Age franchise and for good reason, proper saving and difficulty scaling as well as a cast of new and interesting characters, what more could you ask for? To make it all that much better, they don't shove the same tired old &#34;fight the uber enemy&#34; like they do with Mass Effect, as the tone changes from &#34;fight the darkspawn&#34; to &#34;deal with the mage/templar situation&#34;.  But you know, every game has a big weakness of some sort and Dragon Age 2 isn't any different. What they make up in everything else, they lack in proper inventory handling. Rather then distribute equipment to your party memebers, you are stuck with the protagonist (Hawke) being the only one to use the various armor pieces that drop, with everyone else only being able to equip the weapons and jewelry. Bioware was even wise in how they handle importing the events of Dragon Age: Origins, allowing you to choose your own saved game or use one of three pre-established backgrounds and unlike a certain space opera that we all know, each background varies in some ways. So you aren't getting stuck with substandard genesis comic (hated that thing).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2014"}

I actually enjoyed playing this game except every quest was either in Kirkwall or on the wounded coast.  I liked all the characters especially Isabella and Varric.  This game was definitely fun.Story: The story takes place during the blight at first.  Your character is running from the blight trying to escape it with his/her family.  After that is done you reach Kirkwall and you must gain access to the city and become a citizen.  This game is definitely political and adventure at the same time.  You meet a bunch of new characters and see and hear about some from DA: Origins as well.  You're constantly picking between the mages and templars in this game.  That is the main plot of this game, but it's entertaining.  Their is no really strong bosses in this game I guess maybe the dragon in ACT 3, but that was still easy. 4/4Character development: This game focuses a lot on character development.  You're either friends or rivals with your companions.  If you make an decision regarding the political problems of the mages and templars you might piss off one companion and make another happy.  You can romance characters in this game and some of them can even move in with you lol.  This was definitely the bread and butter of the game for me. 3/3.Artwork/graphics/character design:  This is where the game blew it.  Character designs were great especially the female characters :).  The artwork and graphics just wasn't a focus for Bioware I guess.  Everything look the same and the game froze on me 10 times during my whole duration of playing this game.  If the game didn't have every quest in 3 areas and kept using the same design I believe this would have been better.  1/3.Overall,  I liked the game it just didn't feel perfect to me.

{"product_name":"B0050SYY5E","description":"","reviewerName":"RJ","summary":"A classic remastered for the 10th birthday","reviewText":"So odds are if you're reading reviews you want to know how the game holds up to the original and if it's worth your 40 bucks. I won't beat around the bush. The game on a technical level is good but it does have some issues and perplexing changes. Among the technical issues the game has is that unless you install it on your 360 you will have some framerate stutter. At the same time you will have texture pop in even if you do install it. Although installing it reduces how harsh it is and how long it lasts if you install it. Navigating the menus can be an exercise too due to how jittery it is when selecting things. It's a lot like trying to select options using a controller in the PC version of the original. You can choose to play in original graphics or new by hitting the back button even during menus. The one exception is the cutscenes. Once they start playing they are locked to your graphics mode you were in before it started. This is due to it having to load all cutscenes. This produces a small pause before each cutscene which can be jarring. You can also choose to play with the original soundtrack via the start menu. This can't be switched on the fly the way the graphics can however. Speaking of the graphics there are minor things that the original did that are missing in the new graphics mode like ice cracking when driving over it in a tank or a Warthog, the sun shafts when looking at the sun, trail effects when driving over the light bridge, etc. It's sad to see these small details missing when playing with the new graphics on. The original graphics only have one thing that is messed up and that is that when monitors on the final level hit you it turns your screen green. It did not do this in the originalSpeaking of the new cutscenes when playing in the new graphics mode. They have some odd changes to them that minus one really are sub par compared to the way the original cutscenes were done. The one exception to this is the 343 Guilty Spark cutscene midway through the level when Master chief finds the marines body. The new take on that cutscene really was better and made sense.Of course the gameplay is the Halo you loved. This is due to running the new graphics engine on top of the original Halo engine. Hence the gameplay is entirely intact. Online co-op was a nice inclusion although the lack of saves for it kind of suck. It also supports achievements and comes with the Halo Anniversary map pack for Halo Reach. At the same time you can play these maps on the disc if you want to. It is Reach's multiplayer however it only has the 6 multiplayer maps and the one firefight map if you play that way. The map pack though allows you to download these maps to your Halo Reach save so that you can play them in Reach along with all of the maps included already with Reach. So that's a very nice bonus.Overall if you are a Halo fan then I think you'll get your value out of this game. The online co-op the terminals and skulls added to single player in the new graphics mode and other features really do add some great value to it. The terminals really are amazing btw. If you're a fan of Halo those are worth finding and watching. So all this said. Buy it and enjoy it if you're a Halo fan. You'll probably get your money's worth.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2011"}

This merges an adventure game, a thrilling crime drama and reflex action together. Unfortunately, the results are a bit sporatic.First, the basics. You are an innocent man - but somehow you wake up standing over a dead body, knife in hand. Obviously you killed him - but why? You're not the only person asking this question. You can switch between three other characters in order to solve this crime.The game is a \"movie\". The tutorial takes place in a green room situation where you learn how to move and interact. There are flashbacks, thought-overs, foreshadowing and many other movie gimmicks. If you love movies, this is great. It helps to immerse you in the feeling that you are interacting in an epic situation.There is a lot of dialogue here, and you lead it along. You have a series of options you can choose from, and depending on what direction you choose to go in, the storyline follows you. In that sense, the game is really quite open and you can have a great impact on what happens.All of these situations are great in theory. The practice is a bit different.For starters, the game's graphics are really not that wonderful. I realize that in many games it doesn't matter - but this is supposed to be a gritty crime drama. With all the amazing XBox games out there, to then go \"backwards\" to this one is quite noticeable. It detracts from gameplay to have pixellated objects to interact with when you're talking about human lives on the line.The game, for all of its freedom of choice, is very linear. It starts right from the beginning. You're in your apartment, evading the cops. You want to hide a bloody item of clothing and do up the bed. But wait - you can't pull out your blankets if you're holding something in your hand! You can't put that item down either. So you have to run across the room to the washing machine - put it in - then run back to the bed and pull that across. They have a set order they expect you to do things in. If you don't, you keep failing and restarting until you get it right.The movement makes this doubly difficult. You enter a room and forward is up. Go into another room and forward is left. The cameras don't follow with you naturally. It adds extra frustration to the constant restart cycle.The game design is very innovative. Again, I praise them for thinking outside the box and creating this rich, dramatic environment. However, they should have spent a few more months in testing and design, so that the rest of the game was brought up to those same standards.Don't get me started on the left-left-right-up-right sequences required in order to do certain tasks ...Note: this does play on the XBox 360.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2007"}

The game is pretty hard so it will take you awhile to find all the secrets.The CONS: By now, some people may feel the \"been there, done that\" feeling as you'll be doing the same thing (beating enemies, collecting items, finding secrets.) This game doesn't bring anything new so you better be okay with that. Otherwise, you'll get bored pretty fast.And so the DKC trilogy ended with this underrated gem as it was the least liked of the three. Rare would go on to make bigger and better games on the Nintendo 64 and they will always be remembered for the contributions they made during the SNES era. If you've played through Donkey Kong Country 1 and 2, then you already played this game. If you haven't done so, track down a used copy or get yourself a Wii and download it from the Virtual Console service for 800 points ($8.00.) Long live, DKC trilogy!!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0056WJA76","description":"","reviewerName":"W. freeman","summary":"Hard and fun, fun and hard.","reviewText":"Finally a great game from Codemasters, i do believe other than Clive Barkers Jericho this is one of the first FPS they have really released. In this style anyways. I was waiting for this to come out on PC, but it's TBA, so i went ahead and picked it up for 360, which i rarely do. I didn't like Deus X at all, and really just thought it was completely overrated. And a bit on the boring side. Graphically this game is great as most Codemaster games tend to be. The gameplay reminds you more of a violent arcade style shooter that could have existed back in the old days, if they had the technology. I wouldn't say it plays like a rail shooter, if so it's a very good one. Shooting through walls, blowing guys up, and collecting kill points gives this game more of a fun nature, than a serious involved gameplay, storyline one. Which to me is great, much like Bulletstorm.Mentioning hard in the title is because, well its a pretty tough game, and you can die fairly easily, even on easy. But don't let that deter you from it, going back really isn't all that annoying because you actually get to repeat and learn from your prior mistakes. So i'm actually gonna grab this for PC i think, whenever it hits the net, just so i can crank up the graphics even more, and see it how it was meant to be seen. Although the console version is no slouch at all. So if your looking for good, violent, old school point getting, shootem up action, Bodycount is the game for you. On that note, i'm really surprised at the poor reviews it's received from both fans and critics alike. Guess they are waiting for Call of doodoo 3, and Battlefield and Stream 3, but we all know what to expect from those titles. This one came under the radar, and kicked some A%%. :) Enjoy!Story based games are just fine, but i'm 36 and growing up with Atari, Nintendo, Sega etc. Mario and Sonice never really had storylines. So to me it's not important. ha :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002MED6EO","description":"Midnight Club: Hits PS3","reviewerName":"Rodrigo Toledo","summary":"Excelent edition, racing fans must buy","reviewText":"I am a huge fan of Gran Turismo, and recently Burnout, saying that its obvious that I like arcade racing games and simulation games. Though I prefer by far Gran Turismo than any other racing game. I had Midnight club 2 for ps2 many years ago, and I loved it, its true its an arcade style game (This game I am reviewing), but with all that realistic content at your disposal its a dream, also not to worry for breaking bad. Los Angeles is great, though I've only been there twice I cant relate with some place specifically. cars and customization is by far better than need for speed, it gives you more freedom in every sense.At any price, lower than $[...] its a must by if you have money, if you havent tried Burnout paradise, well buy both, but if you can only afford one, buy burnout, and after that this one. Both have so many differences and pro's on each that its worth having both.And of course Gran Turismo 5by the way this game remembers me a lot to Grand Theft Auto 4, if you like that style, you'll love this one.
