{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Daniel V.","summary":"Still love it!","reviewText":"I have owned this system for a couple of years (I lost count) and it still works. I haven't had any problems yet and I still play it every now and then. Even though the PS2 is my favorite, N64 is still a classic.The games are very creative and alot of fun, especially Zelda (those were the days). You won't need a multitap or a memory card since it's in the game (I suppose) and there are no loading times. The controller is the only problem I have. After a couple hours of gameplay my hands get soar and hurt. Maybe it's because my hands are big.

However, it has such a delicious, addicting quality to it that you just can't help but be drawn in.  What it definitely lacks in substance, it more than makes up for with its wicked stylistic flourishes and nonstop, over-the-top combat.Probably the coolest aspect of WWOF is its cover system, which is quite literally one of the best ever made.  You're able to roll, slide, vault, and dash between any piece of cover, whether its horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.  This way, you can safely traverse entire areas without taking any damage at all.

I guess you could get more indepth with the game and have more of a story line, I personaly beat the game in 4 hours max. You can just hack and slash your way through it the designers left alot of bugs in it so you can get past doing alot of stuff by simply killing quest people, which takes alot out of the game.Above all its a 2/5 for me.

Well, I got this game and WOW.  They do have a single player mode. You get to pick from the Humans, Aliens, or Predator.  I choose the Humans first, just to get the mood going, and let's say I haven't jumped up and screamed like this since the first Resident Evil.  I can't stop playing it.  The only reason I stopped was I need sleep.  I can't comment on the Aliens or Predator section, since I haven't played it, but I know from the quality of this section, the others will be awesome.

Then, I heard nothing else about the game. Several months ago, I saw some vids on this game called \"Sleeping Dogs\". Found out that Square Enix took over publishing rights to original True Crime game, renamed it and tweaked it. I must say, I am glad that Square Enix decided to take what was supposed to be the next True Crime game, and make it similar, but better. This game is probably the most fun and underrated games of 2012.In the game, you play as undercover police officer, Wei Shen. He is a Chinese-American detective from San Francisco, who has been called to his native Hong Kong to help infiltrate a Triad gang, called \"Sun On Yee\". The game takes place in the streets of Hong Kong.GAMEPLAY: The game is an open-world game alaGrand Theft Auto IVandSaint's Row: The Third, but it seems a little more immersive because of the fighting, interactions, and the cinematic essence in the game. The player can roam free and outside of car-jacking, the player can bet on cockfights and street races, join fight clubs, and do karaoke. Of course, the player can buy various things, such as vehicles, apartments, clothes, and upgrades.By playing the role as an undercover cop, primary missions will be done on the police side and the Triad side. Also, there are side missions on both, such as drug bust for the police side and \"helping\" or doing \"favors\" for residences on the Triad side. \"Helping\" or doing \"favors\" can be interesting, but I'm not going to spoil many of the task you are asked to do.Fighting is a LARGE part of the game. In fact, the fighting would be similar to what is in the Batman Arkham series. It is very addictive and immersive. Sometimes, I don't even feel like I am playing an open-world game. The hits are very hard and brutal. In addition, blocking and making counter attacks will make the player feel like a real kung-fu master. I never felt like such a bad-a** on a fighting game. I must say, it is no easy task, when fighting, especially when fighting seven or more opponents at the same time.While fighting, a finishing move can be performed. When this happens, the game goes into slo-mo. At that time, seeing the character landing finishing punches or kicks in the opponent's face shows a nice amount of blood coming. It's quite satisfying. What's even better is many other attacks can be learned by finding statues around the city and going to the Do-jo to practice newly acquired attacks on the students.The coolest part about fighting is using environmental attacks to take out opponents. The player can grapple opponents and throw them at walls, through boxes, phone booths, and electric panels. There are some other parts of the environment that can be used to take out opponents, but won't spoil those.Driving has similarities to GTAIV, but is a little different. I would say that the driving is not as responsive and the camera angles takes getting used to, especially when going into reverse. Still, it is not much to complain about. It is cool to hear the Hong Kong-based radio stations. I get the feel that I'm actually there.Shooting on this game is similar to that ofStranglehold, which means it is very animated. Not to mention, the game goes in slo-mo, when the player vaults, while shooting.GRAPHICS: The graphics in this game are vivid, but not outstanding. I would say that the graphics are sort of dated, but the gameplay outshines that shortcoming, if you want to call it that.VERDICT: Many people might not want to give this game a chance because they believe it is a knock-off of GTAIV. However, it is its own kind of game. Not to mention, what it lacks in graphics, it is a lot more fun, in my opinion. This game is definitely worth buying, especially since it has gone down in price.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2012"}
{"product_name":"B001E8VB6O","reviewerName":"Siege","summary":"Holy Good Games, Batman!","reviewText":"In the past, any game featuring Batman has been something of a joke.  The games focused on the bright and colorfully campy world of the 1970s Batman.  Batman: Arkham Asylum happily blows that notion completely out of the water.  Batman: AA is firmly set in the gritty world of the more adult Batman comics.The first thing you will notice about Batman: AA is the graphics are mind blowing.  The world is richly detailed and the characters are amazing to behold.  It is easy to wander around just staring at the details.  The voice work includes Mark Hamill as the Joker and Kevin Conroy as Batman.  (They performed their respective voices in the Batman: The Animated Series.)Fortunately, the story is equally incredible.  The developers have made a game for serious Batman fans.  They found a way to work in a multitude of Batman villains without feeling forced.  You play as an overly muscle bound Batman who has just captured the Joker and brings him to Arkham.  Seriously, Batman needs to lay off the \"performance enhancing drugs.\" The entire game takes place on Arkham Island.  Everything quickly to pots when you find out the Joker let you capture him so he can turn the asylum into his own personal playground.The game throws you right into the thick of combat as soon as the Joker escapes.  Combat is great.  Batman fights like every fan dreams he would.  He effortlessly moves from enemy to enemy stringing combos as he goes.  Combat is more about timing.  Sometimes combat feels more like a quick time event than button mashing.  Unfortunately, boss battles feel a little flat since there is little difference between fighting a boss and lower level grunts.Of course, Batman has other ways of disposing of baddies.  You can use stealth and your environment to take out enemies one at a time.I enjoyed the Scarecrow levels where he messes with Batman's mind.  They are creative and spooky.  And, yes, Scarecrow even messes with you the player at one point.The game allows you to explore at your own pace while guiding you to the next objective.  The pacing and atmosphere reminds me heavily of the old Thief series.  Some areas are off limits until you find the correct gadget to use.And then, there are the \"wonderful toys.\"  First of all there is detective vision.  You can switch this vision mode on to reveal hidden items and see enemies through walls.  It definitely gives Batman the edge in sneaking around.  Batman's utility beat is loaded with an endless supply of batarangs, explosive gel, the bat claw and other goodies.You do not start out with all of Batman's toys.  The developers give you them one at a time as the story progresses and allows you to access to areas that were previously off limits.There are numerous distractions along the way in the form of challenges from the Riddler.  You can find countless trophies tucked away in hidden places.  Some puzzles involve aligning the top half of a question mark with the bottom (the period). And others are mildly clever riddles.  This definitely extends the replay value.  Completing the Riddler's challenges unlocks various bonus goodies for your enjoyment.Batman fans get even more replay-ability in the form of challenge mode.  This is the online part of the game.  This mode throws you into combat or stealth missions and \"challenges\" you to rack up enough points to get on the leader boards.  Being able to play as the Joker is a nice touch.The only true downside is that the game eventually ends.  Serious Batman fans should not hesitate to buy this game.  Arkham Asylum delivers.I give it a 9.5 out of 10!PS - Batman: Arkham Asylum is completely boy wonder free!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2009"}

You will work for hours to the end of a mission only to be killed and your respawn be in front of an enemy tank or with too little time to complete the mission.4.  Driving vehicles is too hard.  It is like trying to steer a Carnival Cruise Line ship (and I am talking about the Hummers).5.  Sometimes when you lay behind a rock you will inch forward and you will be laying vertically looking at the sky. Major bug.This is a good realistic game.  I think it is a little too realistic and needs to be more fun.Somethings I would like to see changed:Weapons customizationPayload customizationLet me pick my team (and tell Avery to stay behind me)Do not allow me to fail a mission at the very end (not fun).I can deal with the random head shot but let me see who shot me so I can extract some revenge later.The Voice Acting/Writing is HORRIBLE!  Needs to be more gritier.  Sometimes it sound like a bunch of Marine Recruiters.If you can find this for $10 then pick it up.

Combining the trademark Vanillaware aesthetic with the role-play brawler aspect of those games, Dragon's Crown delivers a fantastic experience and a first on the Vita. Beyond Vanillaware's involvement, though, there were members of the Guardian Heroes and Code of Princess teams that worked on Dragon's Crown, and a lot of their art's available in the free art book that accompanied launch copies of the game.As for the game, it has all the elements you'd want out of a role-playing game, so you have tons of loot, leveling up, tons of characters to play as, tons of quests to take on, and hours of hours of content to keep you busy. As for the gameplay, it mostly feels like a beat 'em up, but it all plays very smoothly. I loved Guardian Heroes and Code of Princess, so Dragon's Crown was definitely in my wheelhouse. I'd love to see more games like this.In terms of graphics, Dragon's Crown is a winner. Combining Vanillaware's beautiful visual approach with the talents of Kinu Nishimura and Gouda Cheese brings the best out of the 2D art, making this one stunning game to see in action.Overall, Dragon's Crown is one of the Vita's best games. Not only does it play well, but it offers depth in the form of RPG elements beyond merely being a beat 'em up, and it'll keep you playing for a very long time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2013"}

Footprints will be left in mud, for example, but only until it rains and then they will wash away. Lara's shirt will also get wet, and she's more likely to lose her grip if she is standing on a slippery, rain-soaked ledge. When the sun comes out, her shirt will dry and the slippery surfaces regain their friction.In Underworld, Lara also has a lot more flexibility in how she makes her way through a level, as there is often more than one way to get from here to there. She can now climb walls with texture and rocky outcroppings to reach areas she previously wouldn't have been able to access.All of these additions have been made to give the game a non-linear, open feel. Players can interactive with the environment by doing things they find to be intuitive, and the game will respond in an appropriate way. When Lara interacts with trees, for example, she will push aside leaves using either one or two hands depending on whether or not she's holding something. These details give a lifelike, immersive sensation to the game.New Melee Combat SystemUnderworld introduces a new melee combat system that requires players to strategically strike with offensive, defensive, and evasive maneuvers. Lara can now attack enemies with different punches, kicks, knees, and other acrobatic onslaughts. Items lying on the ground, such as poles that were previously walked on, can be picked up and swung at enemies. Players can also perform a greater variety of actions with weapons; for example, Lara can now hold onto a ledge with one hand and fire a gun with the other.Realistic Enemy and Animal AIThe AI in Tomb Raider: Underworld has also taken a big step forward--both enemies and animals now make independent decisions based on their surroundings, employ ambush and squad tactics when fighting, and will retreat if deemed necessary.With updated graphics and a more immersive and realistic gameplay, Tomb Raider: Underworld will have both fans and newcomers excited about the newest installment in this popular video game-pinup franchise.Tomb Raider: Underworld is loaded with a new melee combat system, various weapons, and smarter AI for both enemies and animals.","reviewerName":"The Mandrew \"Coop\"","summary":"A better payoff","reviewText":"Having played most Tomb Raiders since the original on PS1, I'll admit upfront I've always understood what the developers were trying to do, I just never fully enjoyed the execution.  For one, I found the puzzles to be too arbitrary, like I was supposed to know that blindly leaping from some stone pillar would land me in a position to hang from a rock face and swing to my destination.  I often couldnt understand the logic of the challenges, and the payoff of a gorgeous cut-scene was rarely enough justification to play along.Also, I found the solitary nature of Tomb Raider games to be somehow kind of lonely.  Moving Lara Croft around some ancient ruin or cavern might've appealed to a horndog fanboy, but I got bored of it quickly, and the storyline was rarely strong enough to keep me hooked.I think this is the best Tomb Raider thus far, and while TR purists might disagree, I think it is overall my favorite (and the only one, honestly, since the first that I've played through to completion).  Its visually superior than the others, and it should be, its a 3rd-Gen high-def console.  That said, the characters and the cutscenes are still a bit cartoony, and with what we've seen in other games, there's really no excuse.  However, the environments are rendered well and the scenery is immersive.The storyline is a little thrown together, but I appreciated the Mayan/Norse links in some laugh-in-the-face-of-history kind of way.  Tomb Raider has always leaned towards the metaphysical, so there's no surprises there.  The huge Viking statues gave an ominous atomosphere to the play experience, as did the \"bosses\" like the Kraken, which was very, very cool.Other have complained about the camera jumping, and yeah, thats sucked at times, but my real complaint was the massive amounts of game changing bugs throughout.  Play-test developers, then test it again...there's no excuse to make me not once, but twice go back to the previous level (or earlier!) because my motorcycle has \"disappeared\".  If you are going to have auto-save, eliminate the bugs.I personally thought it was easier to get around as Lara this game than others, and while not perfect, absolute precision was not always needed to land that backward jump from a moving hammer.  This game was a bit more forgiving than other TR's.To own or not to own...that is a question.  At the low \"new\" price currently offered, its hard not to buy it, especially if you have a history with the series.  Would I play through again though, to find each and every treasure or artifact?  No way, once was all they will get out of me, so weigh that when you are making your decision.  Its a fine game, and very enjoyable, but the incentive to revisit the Underworld is not strong.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2009"}

There's even action.Compared to the Mac, there are more PC players so finding a resolution to a problem is more likely. This wouldn't be a plus if this game wasn't so buggy given how simple it is compared to other games or TellTale's not so great support.[Bad]Lack of Real Choice: One of the big marketing items is that \"Your Choices Affect the Game\". Aside from a single major choice of deciding which character to save in the first episode, there aren't any player choices that actually affects the game beyond variations in dialog, even in the third episode. Your actions have no effect on the world. This is really disappointing. I would pay twice as much to get real choices that affect the game's world, that branches into a really different game, as opposed to yet another TV episode where you get a lot of fake choices that do nothing; either that or TellTale should stop marketing a feature that doesn't exist. My guess is that your choices will only have an effect on the ending, specifically it determines what kind of person a character grows up into.Not repayable: Since your choices have no effect on the game aside from the ending, I don't feel that this game has a lot of replayability. You can simply watch different endings on Youtube. The difference in dialog doesn't really amount to much from the player's point of view.UPDATE: All five episodes have been released, the negative points below are no longer relevant.Episodic Release: Unless you wait for all 5 episodes to be released, you are paying for a game that isn't fully finished yet. I would wait. This leads to another issue. Right now there are 4 out of 5 episodes released.Buggy: There are some really bad bugs related to save games since (at this moment) the full 5 episodes haven't been released yet. With every new episode  release it's apparent that either TellTale didn't fix anything, or that they like introducing new variations of the same problem. Do you like having to replay all the past episodes you've already played, over and over again after every new episode release? If not, I would wait until all 5 episodes have been released before either buying or playing this game. This really detracts from enjoying the game. This problem is what led me to discover the next two problems.[Verdict]This is a good game that has a few annoying bugs. It's a good start, but I would pay more for a game with a world with real branching storylines based on my decisions. Right now this is just a game that pretends your decisions actually matter.You should wait until all 5 episodes are released before playing the game, so you won't experience the major bugs.UPDATE: All five episodes have been released, you should buy this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2012"}

So I was really excited when I heard they were making a video game...especially with an original storyline and set of characters with appearances from people (Glenn, Herschell, etc) and places (Hershell's farm, etc) from the comic/tv show. Of I course like many of you were skeptic of its point and click gameplay but thats what made the game fun. It wasnt a typical zombie game where you go around shooting zombies to get from point a to point b. Yeah that is in the game but its the not the main gameplay. This game is all about choices. In it, the player is faced with hard choices on who lives, who dies, what do you do, what do you say, or even who do you side with. In most games like this, the choices mean very little. But in this game a choice you make in ep 1 can easily affect episode 5. Now all in all the final scene in the game is the same for everyone no matter what choices you made which makes the ending a little disapointing.Now the true star of the game is the gore. I mean this isnt a game for kids or anyone with a weak stomach. There were scenes that even made me cringe and look away which actually made the game even more entertaining. Now the story is really good and so are most of the characters. But there is one character nicknamed \"Duck\" who is possibly the most annoying character ever in the walking dead (both show and comic wise) and you will find yourself hoping he will die. Even making choices hoping he will.There are 5 episodes each around 2-3 hours long depending on how long it takes you to solve a certain puzzle or beat a hard part of the game. So all in all you are looking at a 10-15 hour game.  So it wouldve been nice to see it a little longer. Now it has already been confirmed that there will be a season 2.But because there are so many choices to make. With experiencs different, the replay value is high.If you are looking for a long, gun crazy zombie game...this isnt the game for you. But if you are a huge fan of the comics and/or comic, or just love zombie games or point and click games this is the perfect game for you. It may be short and the ending not as good as you would hope. I enjoyed it and because of the so many choices, its worth playing at least for a second playthrough making different choices.Pros:-The choices are tough ones to make and affect your gameplay-Some of the gore-Season 2 has been confirmed-Story-Has a high replay valueCon:-Wish the episodes were longer-Ending couldve been better-One word....Duck","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00000J9J9","description":"One of the best things about the Game Boy Color is that it's  basically an original Nintendo Entertainment System that can fit in  your pocket. What this means for gamers is that many of the great games  for the classic system are being ported to the Game Boy Color, giving  us a chance to re-play (or in some cases discover) the best game titles  from the '80s.Nintendo's ownSuper Mario Bros. Deluxeis among the first of  these conversions, and it certainly remains one of the best. Actually,  calling this game a conversion really doesn't do it justice. This  version actually contains more levels than the original game, including  the entire Japanese version and a slew of extras (such as a two-player  mode).The controls in this game are easy to grasp--even for novice gamers.  All Mario can do is jump (and shoot fireballs with the right power- ups), but it is amazing to see how much gameplay can be squeezed from  these simple actions when the controls work in direct harmony with a  player's thoughts. The only element of this game that could have been  better is that the Game Boy Color's screen isn't quite large enough to  show the entire layout of the original game screen, so players may  occasionally need to press up and down on the control pad to see some  offscreen action. While this can be distracting, it ultimately has  minimal impact on gameplay. If you are looking for the quintessential  side-scrolling platform game, you can't do much better thanSuper  Mario Bros.

Not so much a DX than an updated version of the Sonic Adventure, from the now obsolete Dreamcast, with better graphics, new missions and loads of extras.You play the game as seven different characters: Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Big the Cat, The Robot Dude and (much later) Super Sonic. The Sonic, Tails and Knuckles levels are the best. The Big the Cat levels are really boring and slow. Each character has their own story and their own power-ups, all happening at the same time. The result is almost an RPG-like game. If this were taken a few steps further who knows how great the game could have been. Though it's still brilliant as it is.The structure is also genius and easy to get to grips with. As whatever character, you run around massive levels like Station Square and The Mystic Ruins which leads to many different action stages. The action stages can range between casinos, snowboarding, racing through sky-high circuits, go-carting, flying around in Tails' red bi-plane, flying through wind tunnels, chases across the city rooftops and racing across sandy beaches. As always the Sonic world (curiously earthlike and nothing like the planet Mobius from before) is absolutely gorgeous with an exotic feel, eternal sunshine and the bluest of skies.What I like best about the game are the Chao. The cute little creatures you hatch and raise between levels. They are so great they became my reason for getting through the game. And as a bonus all Sonic games from the old Sega Game Gear are included. Each one is unlocked after every 20 emblems collected (1 awarded after each mission complete and others scattered about levels).Some parts of the game can be awfully repetitive. Certain FMV sequences were used more than once and there was no point in that. And intros to certain parts of the game took too long and became quite annoying when losing a life and starting again.The self-controlled camera was cool and useful. Though in cramped quarters it seemed to get stuck and being unable to see the character due to the spasming camera sometimes resulted in the loss of a life. That was quite annoying.The music is great and I strongly suggest you get all the soundtrack CDs (I did). There are brilliant, fun-loving themes that totally carry the action along. The voices however, were a bit off from the original Japanese lip movements.A totally brilliant game that you simply must get. Sonic Adventure DX will keep you entertained for ages.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"Angela Streiff","summary":"PS4: Online game play, headsets, new controllers and more","reviewText":"I've been fortunate and haven't run into any of the problems some of the other reviewers have posted about. My PlayStation 4 started up fine, and after going through the initial set up, I started checking out some of the new features to see what's new and changed.Controller:The new PS4 controller doesn't deviate too much from the original design, thankfully. The analog sticks are a little taller, and rather than being rounded on the top, they are concave. I've found this nice for some games/application, but my thumbs are still trying to get use to the design when pressing on them during FPS games like Ghosts. I tend to press on the edge of the stick more than the top, so the concave shape presses into my thumbs when sprinting and such in games. However in general, the new controller is easier on the hands during long gaming sessions than the previous versions.The \"start\" button is no longer there, and has been replaced by a very large touch-pad that also presses down like a large clickable button. On either side of the touch-pad there is a \"share\" button and an \"options\" button. The PS button is still on the controller, and when pressing it while in a game, you can access the systems menus much easier than you could on the PS3. You don't need to close out of your game to make changes to certain settings (such as the audio) like you had to with the PS3.Menus:The PS4 menus are much simpler than those on the PS3. Several of the audio and video settings have been consolidated, and a few look to have even been removed. I've been working on setting up my headsets with the PS4, and in going through the audio menus, I've yet to find options like the voice changer or a way you can test to see the volume settings on your mic, like you could on the PS3. I could see Sony deciding to add these back in future system updates.The PlayStation 4 Store is minimal right now since there are only a handful of titles out for the PS4 on launch day. However the $10 Upgrade offer for certain games, converting from the PS3 version to the PS4, is a simple process done through the store. I did this with my COD: Ghosts game, using the included one-time use code that came inside the case. You simply enter your upgrade code into the codes box in the PlayStation 4 Store and then you can buy the game for $10 and download it to the PS4.Like on the PS3, there is an apps menu with programs like Netflix and Amazon Prime Movies that are available for download. I've watched movies on both without any problems.Plying games:I've played quite a bit of COD online-multiplayer with my PS4 and haven't run into any problems so far. The graphics are great and everything has been working perfectly. There are only a small number of games out right now for the system, so I'm looking forward to seeing what new titles come in the future. Even if you don't have a game on hand when you get your system, once you've connected your system to your home network (either through wi-fi or wired) you can check out the PlayStation Store and find free game downloads to play, or purchase a game and download it to your systems internal storage.There's an audio jack in the bottom of the PS4 controller that lets you plug in any headset/headphones that use a 3.5mm cable into it, so you can hear your games audio through the headphones. If your headset has a mic, you can use it to chat with others during online games. The PS4 comes with a cheap little headphone set, but the mic on it is pretty rough. In online games, you can always tell who's using the included PS4 headset, because it produces a scratchy/static sound. I've been using a Turtle Beach headset I had originally been using with my PS3, and it's been working nicely with the PS4. Also I've heard the little headsets/earphones that come with iPhones work very well with the PS4 for online chat. Even if the pair of headphones you have doesn't have a built in mic, you can still use them with the controller to hear the in-game/movie audio, just without the ability to chat.Conclusion:So far, I'm really enjoying using the PS4. The graphics are great and the new controllers and simplified system menus are a nice change. With a headphone jack right in the controller, now anyone with a simple headset with a mic can chat online. There are a few small things I'd love to see updated in the future, like some additional options added to the sound/audio menu for headsets. But all things considered, I'm really enjoying the new design and features of the PlayStation 4, and I'm really looking forward to seeing what new games and updates will be forthcoming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2013"}

I was really happy that I didn't get this when it first came out.SSF4 is really what you get and all AE is just 4 more characters. I played with the new characters and I thought they would be better a lot better. I find myself using the other characters way more. People that have SSF4 can also download AE for $15, but I do not feel that it really worth that. I think they should wait for it to be cheaper because the extra 4 characters are just okay. If they were amazing to use, than I would feel that it be worth it.All I really liked about this game is that I saved money buying it.

{"product_name":"B003O6HLOK","description":"","reviewerName":"Peter Faden \"robilar5500\"","summary":"Fast paced, very very easy game to play.","reviewText":"I actually liked this game alright, and if I could control the ratings a little better for review, I would have given this 3.5 stars. However, without that, I dropped it a half star.The graphics are by far the best part of this game. It really feels like you are watching an anime flick. The sound is also top notch. It really is a vibrant, in your face type of game from that standpoint.The story itself...well, I found it to be a bit lacking. You play mostly as Asura, the demi god of rage and wrath, but towards the end, you also take on the mantle of Yashe, demigod of justice (best I can tell anyway).SPOILERS BEGIN HERE!: The most basic synopsis of this story is that the Earth is evil and trying to kill everybody, and the only thing that can save them is the combination of technology and spirituality provided by the seven demigods (Asura would make eight, but they betrayed him because his daughter was chosen to be a priestess, which means she channels all the spiritual energy the demigods collect). Speaking of collecting spirituality to wield as a weapon against the Earth in an attempt to save the world, guess where they get all that energy? From the souls of the people they are trying to save....by killing them, lol. Overall, I found the entire storyline to be interesting, but laughably convoluted as well. Which is a problem, since this game is 100% story driven. The actual gameplay is represented by fighting off small hordes of corrupted animals, soldiers of the demigods, the demigods themselves, their ships, and eventually mother Earth. This is accomplished by a lot of button mashing mixed in with timed attack cues which trigger scripted events. The battles are in my opinion incredibly easy, even on the hardest difficulty setting. You know how sometimes while you're playing a game, you might multi task by doing things like taking a sip from your drink, answering a question from somebody in the room, etc? Dont do that with this game. At any moment, there might be a cue which triggers events that, if you miss, will mostly still happen anyway, but will affect your overall score and ranking (and achievements as well). So...you are forced to pay 100% attention to the game and nothing else. For some, this isnt an issue, but for me, it was somewhat cumbersome. On a positive note, this game is broken down into three chapters, each with 6 episodes, much like a cartoon series. So, if you miss a chance to maximize your gameplay, it really isnt an issue to replay an episode. For the most part, each episode can be finished in under ten minutes.SPOILERS END HERE.Overall, I felt the game was somewhat engaging, the gameplay was simple and intuitive, and for the most part, if you view this as a cartoon series you are playing through rather than an actual video game, I think you will enjoy it just fine. My playthrough took about four and a half hours total, so you can easily finish this game in one sitting. If you are seeking achievements, you might triple this time to get a plat or 1000/1000. Not a bad game, not a great game, but very much a silly one in my opinion. For less than $20, this is a decent title, and if you can find it for under $15, I would definitely recommend picking it up. For good or bad, you probably wont play another game exactly like this one.One further note: this game is loud...like 11 out of 10 loud, and Asura pretty much yells and roars throughout the entire game, so there is an annoyance factor with this game, lol. Wear a headset if you own one and arent alone in your apartment, house, whatever. It will be a distraction for everybody else otherwise.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S. BubPros:Compelling, well-told storyGood action and combatFantastic sound and graphicsCons:Plot is familiar to fans of kung fu action filmsTask-and-exploration gameplay might seem slow to action gamers","reviewerName":"Trevor Cotton","summary":"The main reason I will never sell my Dreamcast","reviewText":"Yes that's right, I will always hold on to my Dreamcast, there are a number of classic games I own for it but Shenmue perhaps tops them all.  Now I hear a lot of people saying that Shenmue is boring, and you spend a lot of time doing nothing, but I couldn't disagree more.  I'm the kind of person who loves to explore in games, i play a lot of RPG's and I like to make sure I find all the secrets in a game (if it's any good).  That is the beauty of Shenmue, as well as advanvcing the plot (which is great) I can also spend free time down at the arcade, or play pool etc... it is as close as you will get to real life in a game.Both this and Shenmue II are classics, but I can never forgive Sega for not releasing the rest of the series.  I know it was an expensive game to make, but i'm sure there is a huge demand for Shenmue III, I only hope they get their act together and get Yu Suzuki back to working on it again.  Back to Shenmue itslelf, the plot is superb, I even enjoyed working at the docks as a forklift driver, while trying to get info on the mad angels.  The fighting is superb, both regular battles and the QTE fights (which you see in all sorts of games now), in fact the moves are taken straight out of Virtua Fighter.  It also had a great replay value, I completed it numerous times, trying to collect capsule toys and better my scores at the mini games like darts.  The best mini game of all though was right at the end, The 70 man free battle time attack.The 70 man battle involved fighting your way through 70 Mad Angels members, including 3 bosses along the way, and was the highlight of the game.  Once you had completed the game you could do it again and try to set a best time for it, as with all the mini games you could then enter it on the world rankings.  I can't remember my time, but it was at one stage in the top 50 in the world, and I must of tried to beat it at least 100 times.  I haven't even mentioned the classic Sega Games you could play at the arcade, Space Harrier (which is impossible), Super Hang On etc.. were all available to set top scores on, there is just so much to see and do.If you still own a Dreamcast and not this, then you are mad, pick it up now, before it vanishes off the face of the earth, classic.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2005"}

I usually don't finish games because they take too long and I'm busy enough. This game must be very short because even I beat it very quickly. I tried doing side missions but there are only like 10 side mission to do. Unlike ES: Oblivion, where you can go to a enemy hideouts anytime you want and fight bad guys, in this game you go once and kill everybody, but if you go a second time, without it being a story mission, everybody will still be dead (at least that's what it seems like to me).In the game you travel to a few cities, and you can upgrade your armor and other stuff. Well, I debated whether I should upgrade my armor or not, but I'm glad I did because the game ended after the next mission anyways. The ending just tells you what the \"good guys\" plan on doing to the \"bad guys\" but it doesn't let you do that. I thought for sure I was going to get to follow with the plan, but then I saw the credits rolling down the screen. I think they should make a DLC expansion pack or a sequel.The story-line wasn't too deep, and it's not really \"open world\" enough for me. Mostly it has a wasteland theme, without too much futuristic weapons or scenery, but it features some advanced technologies, especial with the \"bad guys\". Can't believe its 3 disc. 2 for single player, and that's too short, and 1 for multiplayer, which there isn't any fun modes really.Some of the side missions are dumb because it cost money to buy ammo and other supplies, so sometimes it's not worth it to destroy vehicles, or do some missions. But I always forgot to sell my random junk. Unlike oblivion too, there isn't really any side mission where anybody askes you to bring them random stuff. All the characters have the same personalty sort of, and it's not really a complex city. It's not like you really have a choice to join the Resistance or not, and everybody seems to root for them anyways.Driving in your vehicle in this game may be a bigger feature than some might think. You usually don't travel around by foot when exploring. Usually I hate when shooting games have missions where you have to race, but in this game you don't have to do the races, you can get the prizes from races by destroying vehicles in other modes instead. But the races are easy enough and you don't have to come in 1st place, you get prizes for 3rd place even.The graphics and controls are good.  Sometimes if you move left or right real fast, the scenery will load slower than you expect and add detail. But first of all, it looks good enough without the details, second, it doesn't slow down the game, and third, you can just pretend your eyes are focusing. Another thing is that I don't really like how the mutants run at you and try to hit you from the sides. But there are other enemies to fight that actually shoot at you.The multiplayer isn't really designed to be played very much, I don't think. It's more like a bonus, mini arcade game. There are no modes where you run around shooting people in a death match. There is just a vehicle death match, and some co-op survival stuff where you can walk and use a gun (only tried this once, but it seemed to mess up a bit). This game isn't worth the money I paid, but it's certainly worth the price I see now, about $20.Oh, and it recommends that you install all the disks to your hard drive (xbox), but I didn't do that and it worked fine. Disk 1 is the wast-land city and disk 2 is the subway city, even though other game developers can fit like 10 of those cities on just one disc and have a decent multiplayer mode (I really do like ID, though). I mostly just mentioned what I didn't like, but I really do like this game enough, it's just that they didn't add enough stuff to it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2011"}

In fact I had been playing atleast a year and a half by the time Lord of Destruction emerges.  And in that time I had had the greatest experience in my life.At first I was just a lowely Barbarian, who wore a loin-cloth and hit monsters with my crappy axe.  But countless hours of online and offline play later, I was a badass looking barbarian with a thirst for blood.  And the online gaming is really where this game shines.  For one thing, Battle.net is free.  And another thing is that people don't just play this game online, they live it.  If my computer hadn't been total crap and stopped working, and I hadn't had to do other things, like go to work and try to maintain a relationship with actual people that I could touch and smell, then I would be going on my fourth year of playing this game.  But now that I have recently gotten back online and into the new wave of gamers, I am now, once again, completely addicted.And when I say new wave of gamers, that's exactly what I mean.  Recently I was down at my local EB Games to pick up some games when I got into a conversation with the clerk there about Diablo II.  And for the first once, somebody actually knew where I was coming from.  You see, he had also played back in the old days before the expansion came out, and also noticed a difference in today's gamers.For one thing, people nowadays want something from you, even if you have nothing.  For example, I was playing with my level 64 sorceress and I was searching all over the active channels looking for an item called a Lum Rune.  Finally, I came across a room with a lvl. 83 amazon who, when asked, told me she had three Lum Runes.  After seeing that I had nothing she wanted, she told me off and left the room.  I mean, come on!  Be nice, she had three and I had none.  She was like close to 30 levels ahead of me and couldn't spare to drop one of them.  Back in the day, people would make rooms just to drop things for free.  Of course back then almost everybody who was cool was a hacked character.  And things like elixers and the Jamella editor still existed.  Nowadays, people think being hacked means to have your stuff stolen.  No kids, that is getting screwed.  Getting hacked means you have acquired items from the games mainframe and are using them even though you aren't really supposed to for another 50 levels.  Being hacked meant you had everything you wanted and nobody was the wiser.But anyway, about the expansion.  It introduces two new character classes, the Druid and the Assassin.  Making the total amount of playable characters seven (including the last game's Barbarian, Paladin, Necromancer, Sorceress, and Amazon).  Both of which are pretty cool characters.  Anyway, the game's praphics got touched up a bit, they are still sprites, but they fit the game perfectly.I guess the one good thing about not having hacked cheater characters in the new version is you don't have to worry about anyone being invincible when you're dueling them (hacked characters tended to have something like 10 million hit points while the average player had less than a thousand).  So if you like your social life, steer clear of this drug, because once you're in, there's no telling when anybody will see you again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000ZKA0J6","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"An excellent, complete and long single-player experience bolted onto superb multiplayer","reviewText":"StarCraft II is a game of three parts. The multiplayer is fast, furious and satisfying, but does not develop far beyond what was achieved with StarCraft. There are some new units and a more flexible interface, but broadly it's a 3D make-over of the old game.On the single-player front, almost the entire game is devoted to the Terran faction (save a side-story where you control the Protoss). You play Jim Raynor, continuing on his quest to destroy the Dominion whilst being haunted by guilt over his failure to save Kerrigan from the Zerg. Rather than following a list of missions, the single-player game is much more oriented around choice. The game has a between-mission, RPG-like section set in one of three different locations (in a bar on Mar Sara for the opening, then on the battlecruiser Hyperion for most of the rest of the game, and then 'somewhere else' for the last few missions). In this section you can catch up on news reports, talk to crewmembers, research new upgrades for your units, purchase new abilities and hire mercenaries. You can also play a mini-game called Lost Viking (a vertically-scrolling shoot 'em-up), listen to the jukebox or indeed just chill out in the bar.When it comes time for the next battle, you are given a list of several different missions you can tackle. You can approach the missions in any order, but you get different research points (unlocking new abilities) and new units depending on which you take. A player wanting to get his hands on Siege Tanks will take a different route through the game than someone wanting to research Tech Reactors, for example. You can also steam straight through to get to the finale and simply choose not to do a whole bunch of missions, but I heavily recommend against this.As a bonus, you also have access to a Protoss 'memory crystal' which allows you to relive Zeratul's investigations into the revelations of Brood War, giving you control of Protoss forces for several missions. This section is also optional, but does set-up storyline points that I suspect will become much more important in the two planned expansions.The gameplay itself does not stray too far from the original but there's a ton of improvements, such as the ability to build infantry and have them report immediately to a bunker, or train new SCVs and have them sent straight into mining without the need for micro-management. The 'guard' mode from the original game is now improved and allows you to send SCVs and medics with your attack force. They'll stay out of the enemy's line of fire but remain close enough to heal on the fly. Individual mission design is varied, ranging from a Firefly-influenced mission where you have to hijack a bunch of trains to a Pitch Black-inspired level where you have to retire behind fortifications at night when you are swamped by light-sensitive enemy forces. In fact, every mission has at least one little difference to set it apart from others, resulting in a constantly varied experience.The game builds over the course of its length to an apocalyptic finale. However, the game unexpectedly ends in a somewhat conclusive manner. Sure, there's clearly more stuff to come, but it's a pause rather than a cliffhanger, which given the indeterminate amount of time before Heart of the Swarm is released, is a good thing.On the downside, there are moments when you do have to acknowledge that the game isn't innovative. Several RTS developments from the past decade are ignored. However, most of the time you are too busy playing to really notice. The other issue is that the charming, slightly cartoony style of the cut-scenes in the original have been replaced by more of a 'realistic' look, which drops Jim Raynor and his buddies squarely into the uncanny valley, which is disconcerting.In addition, the game requires a one-time Internet activation (you need to stay online to get the game's achievements) and the original game's more approachable multiplayer aspects have been removed, most notably LAN play and the ability to spawn a lightweight version of the game on a friend's computer without having to buy additional copies. These are irritations rather than anything particularly deal-breaking, but others clearly feel otherwise.However, a very common complaint, that this is only a 'third of a game', is more puzzling. StarCraft II is longer, more varied and more epic than the original game, and certainly moreso than any other real-time strategy game released in the past dozen years. It will take most players between 10 and 20 hours to complete, which is a very healthy amount of time for a modern game, and of course the game editor, mods and multiplayer modes extend the game's lifespan exponentially. If there was ever a time when a 'complete' strategy game consisted of 90 single-player missions taking 60+ hours to finish, one of the most powerful game editors ever shipped, hours of cut scenes and extensive multiplayer, it must have passed me by. Most of the criticism stems from the decision not to have a Zerg single-player campaign in this first release, which is indeed regrettable. However, this is the price that has been paid for adding depth to the campaigns. In the original StarCraft you were just warming up and getting used to a faction when it was time to switch to the next one. In StarCraft II you stick with the Terrans for 26 missions, allowing for more story developments and better characterisation rather than the broad strokes of the original game. Some have said that they would sacrifice this for three 10-mission campaigns dedicated to the original sides, but that would be difficult given the sheer size of the story being told here. StarCraft II is definitely The Lord of the Rings to the original game's The Hobbit, and telling this story in fewer missions would definitely be underselling it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0012N5MIO","reviewerName":"CallMeZoidberg","summary":"Right Quarter Circle + Punch = ?","reviewText":"Street Fighter fans have been waiting for a new iteration in the series for quite sometime, and with a little apprehension regarding how Capcom would handle their esteemed franchise in 3D, after less than memorable sequels to the spite-based Street Fighter II. Anyone that falls into the aforementioned category can let out a sigh of relief, because Capcom handled the franchise marvelously, producing one of the most enjoyable fighters in ages, recapturing the glory and nostalgia that is Street Fighter II while adding enough new content and visual flair to give the game a fresh and modernized feel.Part of the beauty of Street Fighter IV is the balance it strikes between pick-up-and-play gameplay and being a fighter with incredible depth. The game makes sure it's easy for the average fighter fan to pick up Ryu, start throwing some old school hadokens, and hold is own. At the same time, new mechanics such as Focus Attacks, Super Combos, and Ultra Combos add to the depth and strategy that the hardcore fans crave in their fighters. Focus Attacks, which are executed with the Medium Punch and Medium Kick held simultaneously, are powerful attacks that can knock enemies down. Super and Ultra Combos are executed when their respective meters fill up, giving you the opportunity to execute one of these very powerful moves. Whether you're building up your special meter to perform Ex versions of your special moves and focus canceling, or merely kicking in some faces and tossing some hadokens, Street Fighter IV's gameplay delivers frantic, tense, and even epic 1-on-1 combat.For the inexperienced fighter fans that want to master Street Fighter IV, Capcom delivers all the tools necessary to do so. There is an extensive Training mode, as well as a bevy of Challenge modes. The Challenge modes contain a few different options, including a Time Attack mode, Survival mode, and Trial mode. Time Attack and Survival give you a time limit for dispatching your foes and a number of foes to be dispatched, respectively, while the Trial mode gives you commands and combos to execute - which can get incredibly complex. Along with these new additions, there are several new characters introduced, while the expected cast has all returned. The new characters mesh well with the universe, while the returning cast all handle exactly as they should.While these fresh elements all add extensive replay value, there are also a ridiculous amount of unlockables, whether they come in the form of new taunts and colors or titles and icons for online play. Online play is another element that adds to the game's replay value, attempting to bring the smash-mouth, quarter pumping feel of the arcades into your living room. Online connections, as a whole, have seemed relatively strong, though the hardcore players may be a little weary as to whether or not they and their opponents are experiencing the exact same fight - for which the solution is local multiplayer, which is perhaps even more visceral, with your opponent sitting directly beside you. Thankfully, online play also features a \"Same Skill\" search criteria, so the inexperienced users won't continuously be destroyed by some of the absurd talent online, while subsequently building their own skill by fighting players that are close to their equal.The Arcade mode also presents interesting 2D anime cutscenes at the start and conclusion of each run through, in an effort to touch on various story elements. However, they're incredibly short and surprisingly light on plot elements while referencing plot elements the gamer is expected to know. They don't add all that much to the game, but may leave some players scratching their heads.Fortunately, the gameplay itself uses very stylized 3D models, but on a 2D plane. The visuals are gorgeous and the animations are even more impressive, with a remarkable fluidity to them. The art style gives the game an incredibly unique, as well as visually appealing aesthetic feel. The camera also sweeps in at impressive angles, temporarily pausing the action at the execution of Ultra moves. The angle itself adds to the impressive feel of the game, but even better - and incredibly memorable - are the facial expressions of the frightened and surprised chumps about to receive the Ultra move. The art design gives the game its own distinct, memorable style, and looks absolutely beautiful in motion.Street Fighter IV is a great achievement as well as a great game. It caters to the casual and hardcore fans, has a distinct style, blends nostalgia with new mechanics, and has loads of replayability. If you like Street Fighter IV - which you probably will, unless you dislike the genre in general - you're going to be hard pressed to find a reason to stop playing it. There were a lot of high expectations tied to Street Fighter IV, and Capcom responded to any and all apprehension with a resounding, powerful \"HADOKEN\"!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2010"}

Pure disappointment. The graphics are beautiful! But the gameplay is awful. Same moveset, Even worse, the ps one street fighters had more special attacks, moves, and characters. I played the game for 3 hours and just got frustated. I am pretty good at street fighter but Zangief is a cheat on this game he endures attacks and then grabs you repeatedly and its hard to stop. And for the \"new moves they said the characters had\" all capcom did was add a cinematics.I repeat this game is a rip-off and you are better off getting TEKKEN, marvel vs capcom 2 or any other street fighter from the ps one series, any tekken will do excluding 1 and 4. The graphics are phenominal. The controls are the same as sega genesis controls. Meaning if you know how to do a hadoken with Ryu on sega, then you will know how to do one on ps3. Street Fighter IV lacks character selection. This game has horrible combination selection, because it's so basic for a next gen console. You cant even side step, everything is up, down, left or right. I will get my refund tommorow. In conclusion this game gets a two rating just because the game was created with so much hype and the graphics, everything else is just below average!,Ps you will never go wrong with Tekken.

I think that is just stupid. Theres only like 10 weapons and 4 things you can ride in in the game.  In the game the warthog and earth cars can never break or explode but the alien stuff can. Another stupid thing is the missions are way too long. It takes abouut 1 hour to finish a mission. And once you die you come back to life. So anyone can beat the game. Some aleins have invisible shields on them and you have to waste a lot of ammo on them. All you can carry is two guns and grenades. And since theres only like 10 weapons you allways pick up the same gun. Theres only about 8 differnent kinds of aliens and they are all stupid. Hunters are big alien things that are almost impossible to kill, little stupid aliens that speak english and run away from you, little aliens with shields, big aliens that have invisible shields around them and they chase you, Floods that when you kill them little ball thing with no guns come out and jump and pop on you, theres more but they are mainly the same as the ones I just wrote but they are different colors or are bigger or smaller.

The water ripples. The drop ships fly overhead - complete with shadow rippling over the landscape - and when they set down, you can watch as they open and the aliens inside come out. And start shooting you immediatley :)The whole interplay of plot and characters is great. One alien type is a little creature that runs around laughing, unless it feels threatened, in which case it waves its arms over its head and runs away yelling &quot;help! help!&quot;. When a marine shoots one, sometimes he'll call out &quot;Who's laughing now?&quot; or other such jibes. Very little is &quot;contrived&quot; in this game. You really get a sense that you're moving forward with a purpose, and that your team is THERE with you.And, even better, you can multiplay in a way which is REALLY fun! With two players you still get a lot of screen space, and you can easily work as a team - flanking an enemy, coordinating attacks. Your marines will see this and help out. If one person jumps into the driver seat of a vehicle, the other can hop in back and man the machine gun. There is a rainbow of colors for your suit, too. When they get Broadband set up for this next summer, a whole new addiction will be spawned.Definitely a MUST HAVE!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2001"}

The variety of characters and their wide array of battle moves are impressive.  Each of the characters possess weapons that have their own peculiarities and specialties.  As a result, even though the settings are recycled over and over, you will still be able to fight repeatedly without getting bored.  You can use different characters each time you play the game.  My advise here is to become competent using one character before moving on to using another.  The number of possible attack moves per character ensures that you will always have something to learn. To me, the best feature of this game is that you can also create your own characters and dress them up the way you would like to.  The attacks available to your created characters will be determined by the type of weapon they carry.The one aspect of the game that kept me from giving it a higher score is the fact that the battle program is inconsistent.  I agree with some of the comments stating that this is a challenging game.  However, there is nothing wrong with that.  A challenging game is fun and you get a feeling of accomplishment when you finally make progress.  But you do want the game to be consistent.  You do want the game to challenge you and force you to master moves.  However, the problem with this game is that this idea is applied inconsistently throughout the battles.  To use a particular example, let's talk about Talim.  I first used Siegfried to fight Talim.  I was landing heavy blows, they were connecting, and my button presses were timed properly.  Siegfried was executing his moves properly.  I was \"chaining\" attack after attack.  Talim was stunned and was taking a lot of punishment.  Yet, she would not go down.  And then Talim lands one kick and one swipe and the next thing you know, Siegfried was knocked out! I have beaten Talim numerous times, in different modes, using Siegfried, Raphael, Ivy, and my own character.  During those many battles, I noticed the inconsistency.  It seemed to me like the game responds slowly during some battles, like there was a built-in lag in the battle system.  I noticed this when fighting against Talim and Sheong-Mina.  My characters were moving and behaving like they were in slow-motion against them.  However, they respond and react normally when playing other enemies.  It's almost like the game developers chose them to be the favored characters and added a built-in disadvantage to your player.  It really isn't the fact that the game is indeed challenging, it's the fact that you are automatically at an unfair disadvantage against these two characters.I wanted to make sure that I have the right moves and that there was nothing that I was doing to handicap myself.  I consulted an online guide.  I also bought the Strategy Guide.  Following the advice from those sources, I used the suggested moves to keep Talim from getting close.  Again, the fact that my character became sluggish against Talim made this difficult.  The strategy is sound.  Keep a short range enemy at a distance, and use your superior \"reach\" to do damage.  The lag between my commands and the system's response kept me from accomplishing my strategy.This is a fun game.  However, heed what some of the reviewers are saying about the battle system, or AI as one reviewer mentioned.  There is that inconsistency, which is almost like a system \"cheat\".  I have a feeling that this is what the other reviewers meant when they said that there is something wrong with the battle system.  As much as I like the game, I find that one aspect to be a big negative.The game allows you to create your own custom fighter.  You can actually create a fighter that looks exactly like KOS-MOS (the main character from the Xenosaga RPG series) by using the Type X armor.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2006"}

The fighting is very realistic, and the characters are surprisingly detailed--no stiff-moving polygons here.  There are many short clips from the movies.  Overall, the appearance is very nice.The gameplay is also great.  Yes, 95% of this game is just punching the buttons and killing stuff.  But it's fun.  And there are many different combos your characters can learn which are actually kind of difficult to execute.  You are rated with each kill based on your style and use of parries, thrusts, blocks, and combinations.  It's easy to kill stuff, but very hard to do it elegantly and get the perfect score.The downside to this game is that it's very short--you can beat it in one night.  Still, though, even once you've passed the game you can go back with different characters and, when that's done, you can always try to improve your rating on each level.

One of the major twists definitely took me by surprise and increased my enjoyment of the story.The controls are fairly easy to get used to, and I had no frustration in that arena. I do have to say that even the Easy level was rather difficult. However, I enjoyed the game so much that it could be one of those rare times when I attempt a replay at a higher level. I'm also curious to find out what the highest difficulty level is like. I'm assuming you can only choose to play if you finish the game on Hard.

Even if you are very careful not to turn off the machine while it's saving and even if you exit to the main menu before turning the machine off, the game will occasionally report your save is corrupted the next time you try to play.  I've personally had this happen to me after playing just three times.  Thankfully I only lost a couple hours of time replaying it, but then it happened again at nearly the exact same spot.  This is a horrible glitch to allow in a released game and they should have issued a recall.Support is speedy and courteous, but ineffective.  I had to find a work around online.  The glitch seems to be with the autosave feature instead of the save file.  If you get the error, try turning off the PS2 and taking the memory card out of the machine.  Now start back up, but don't put the card back in until after you get to the main menu.  After it's back in, then press start and choose to load the game and it should work.  It worked for me and after I finished another level and saved the game doesn't think it's corrupted anymore.  I can't guarantee it'll always work, but it's worth a try.  I'd really suggest not getting the game so you don't have to deal with this annoyance, but maybe it doesn't happen on all PS2 models.  I don't know.  I have the latest slim model with a laptop style power chord, no brick at the end where it plugs in.  Anyway, I hope it makes it playable to anybody who cannot return the game.I've only been able to play the first full mission of the game due to the save glitch, but I have a feel for the game and while it's not very deep it is still fun.  You have several different suits you can change into and each has a special power.  You use these to solve puzzles, which are complex enough at times they should keep even an adult interested.  Battles are pretty fun, even if you basically just have one attack button.  If the other levels are as long as the first, then the length seems decent.  I'm looking forward to playing the flip side of things where you get to be one of the bad guys.  Also you can unlock a ton of characters from the show to play as, but you'll have to hunt down lots of Lego studs to unlock them all.There are a few problems.  The AI of your teammate varies between harmless and atrocious.  At least you can hit them so I took great pleasure in beating Robin senseless after he failed to help me or just got in the way.  The camera is mostly fixed and can be painful at times.  I died more to failed jumps because I couldn't tell where a platform actually was in relation to me, than I did to enemies.  Gathering the little Lego studs can also be tedious at times.  You pretty much have to destroy everything, which sounds fun at first, but ends up just being a chore after a while.If you're willing to risk the bug or can get by with the work around, then you'll get at least a few good hours of fun out of the game not even including the free play mode unlocked after you finish a level.  If you don't want to risk it, just get Lego Star Wars.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2010"}

You rarely find a game with ugly or awesome graphics, and so it's to Ubi Soft's credit that in Splinter Cell they have created some of the best graphics on the Xbox generation consoles. The character models and animations, the textures, the small details, the different filters to view the environments through, and the lighting. The beautiful lighting. No other game has been able to reproduce these lighting effects: the different shades of lighting, realistic shadows that wrap around other objects in the game. The lighting helps make every little object look that much more real. Lighting has never looked so good, though it can be your worst enemy, so you might have to shoot that darn bulb out every once in a while. Ubi Soft also revolutionized \"soft physics,\" which refers to objects such as curtains, webs, and the like. Other games use soft physics to some extent today, but not with quite the detail and realism Ubi Soft used them. Playing around with a curtain can be so much fun you might forget you have 30 seconds to defuse that bomb.Of course, graphics alone don't make a game, but Splinter Cell does magnificently in all categories. The soundtrack is excellent and adds to the mood of the game. Nothing makes your heartbeat faster than when the bass \"dun!\" sounds to signal you've been noticed. Staying with the attention to detail theme, Ubi Soft also worked hard on the sound effects department. The number of different textures you can walk on and the different sounds each one produces is brilliant, and it demonstrates what kind of hard work went into the game. To fully enjoy and appreciate this game requires not only your eyes, but your ears.So far I have only touched on the technical aspects of the game. For a game to be fun, however, requires great gameplay, and on that count Splinter Cell delivers. The game keeps you on your toes, with sweaty palms and cheers beckoning from your throat the moment a checkpoint arrives. There many ways to get past a given part of the game. Want to gun down every terrorist you see? Sure go ahead, but it's not easy with the excellent AI. You need to carefully plan all of your shots and your placement of Sam Fisher. Want to sneak around without killing anyone? Go for it, but again it's not easy with the excellent AI. Sure the guards run their pre-scripted routes, but mess up and your toast. You need to use the environment to your advantage, and the levels are so well designed that you might need to play through the game again to notice all of the different ways you can complete a level.What I love about this game is the AI. The enemies sometimes notice things a little too easily, but they are never dumb. They might hear a sound that causes them to search around, but if you hide well enough they eventually go back on their route. The only other stealth game that has AI this good is the Metal Gear Solid series. What most stealth games do wrong is punish you for making the tiniest mistake. Sometimes enemies will know you are there before anybody sees you. Not so for these two games. The difference between them, however, is that Splinter Cell relies on hiding in the shadows, where Metal Gear Solid relies on hiding behind physical objects.The game does have its moments where it can be unforgiving. There is a lot of trial and error. Sam Fisher is not a human tank, so fire fights can very quickly lead to your death. Oftentimes your death is due to your own error, but there are times when the AI does seem to spot you a little too easily. There will be many times when alarms go off and you have no idea why. Also, the game doesn't do a very good job of briefing you on who you can't kill, and sometimes the only way you learn is by killing said person. Despite all of this, the game was my favorite of the year when it came out back in 2002, and it deserves the highest praise.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2013"}

To get to these objectives is the tricky parts as they are heavily guarded by soldiers, body gaurds or even policemen. The artificial intelligence is rather good; they respond if you make a sound or if they see your shadow, but the fun part of the game is playing with their responses. You can throw a bottle to distract them then run in another direction. You could let them see you for a second, then hide in the darkness- they get confused. Being unseen however is your best defense. The game is all about stealth. You use shadows and darkness to hide, you can also perform many acrobatic moves to help you hide. You can crouch, roll, lean on walls, peak around corners, you can split jump (inspired by actor Jean Claude Van Damme). You have many gadgets to spy on your enemies and you'll also be equipped with a silencer pistol. My only complaints about the game is that it is 100% linear, allowing no flexibilty or freeform gameplay. You just have to do things the way the level is scripted (or get a mission fail).

The story line is detailed and easy to follow with a lot of thought and effort put into also. Now the game play it self, not so much. You basically use mostly 4 control buttons for the whole game except for a few parts where you may use more which makes the controlling the character easy and simply. Here's the problem, the game is suppose to be designed for free will play but it's really not. You play Jodie(human character) and Aiden(the entity or ghost that stays and interacts with Jodie whole life). You are pretty much allowed to switch between the two and play with both of them the entire game or play with two players and one be Aiden and the other Jodie. Aiden has many abilities. He can choke, move things, break things, pass through walls, let Jodie see what he sees, possess people, etc. But the game limits when and what abilities he can use. It dictates how far at certain times he is allowed to move away from Jodie, what people he is allowed to possess, what people he is allowed to choke/kill, what wall he can pass through, etc. So this limits the free will concept of the game. Jodie is pretty much cut and dry. She just moves and interacts with Aiden and her surroundings the only problem I had with her is her slow motion scenes. There is one part of the game where they teach how to interact with fighting with Jodie. So when I started seeing this slow motion scenes I always thought it was a fight scene and that you where suppose to move toward the motion(when you have the game this will make better sense) but in fact some of the scenes are dodging scenes where you need to move away from the action. It is a little hard to tell which way they want you to move because so scenes you have to perform both actions and if you mess up it can cost you. Like for instance, a certain amount of hits or dodges can earn you a trophy. Don't get me wrong though, there is some free will involved in the game and certain things you do will effect later events, for instances the game has 24 different endings so that definitely a time killer if really looking for something to do, but I feel its a CONTROLLED FREE WILL game. A little longer than what I wanted to write but I wanted to make sure you understand what you are buying. Some other people wrote a more in def detail description of the game and characters so if you wanted to know more about it, you should probably read theirs. I just tried to give a quick short version and hope it helps.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2014"}

Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"Excellent, despite Bethesda's standard poor writing.","reviewText":"Skyrim is the fifth game in The Elder Scrolls series, following on from Arena, Daggerfall, Morrowind and Oblivion. As usual with this series, the game contains only minor continuity references to the previous titles and can be enjoyed on its own. As normal, you get to create a character, choosing their stats, background, gender and race, before being unleashed into the wilds of the Imperial Province of Skyrim. You can follow the main storyline, pursue side-quests or simply strike off into the wilderness to kill some wolves. If you're really into role-playing you can even go off and split some logs or pursue a career as a blacksmith. The game is an immense toybox and it's up to you how you play it.Those who've played Bethesda RPGs before, particularly the recent era beginning with Oblivion and continuing through the SF Fallout 3 and New Vegas games, will find much here that is familiar. The ageing Gamebryo Engine has been given an overhaul and renamed the Creation Engine, but it's the same old technology propelling the title along (particularly noticeable with the still-clunky movement and jumping). The upgrades are impressive, with much-improved graphics (particularly in the departments of wind and snow effects) and character animation. The stiff, robotic figures of the previous Bethesda games are thankfully gone and people are now less off-putting to interact with. Bethesda have also provided a full voice cast for the game, which is a relief after Oblivion's tiny pool of voice actors resulted in some serious immersion-breaking moments. In Skyrim this is limited to a few of the various city guards, who have the same voice and even the same dialogue (the oft-repeated, \"Arrow to the knee,\" complaint) no matter where they are, which is more amusing than problematic.The game has also had a major overhaul to its rules system. Oblivion's level-scaling mechanic (where the whole world levels up with you) has been chucked, thankfully, and the skill system has now been made sane (in Oblivion it was a valid tactic to choose a mage class and then increase your opposing sword skills, so you wouldn't level up and make the entire world tougher). Bethesda have chucked out the class system altogether, so now you can tailor your character precisely. If you want to play a magic-fuelled archer of death, you can do that, as well as a rapid-casting pyromaniac or a sword-slinging barbarian who's also handy with a lockpick. The result is a 'streamlined' system which is actually just that, streamlined and made more logical without sacrificing depth or complexity. The perk system, where you gain impressive skills and powers in return for levelling up skills, also works well in the game.Combat is mostly unchanged from Oblivion, particularly in the sword-swinging side of things. Whilst combat remains chunky and satisfyingly physical, it's still a button-mashing affair, disappointing in an RPG. Some sort of fantasy implementation of the VATS system from the Fallout games could have been a really good idea, but Bethesda chose not to do that. However, Skyrim permits dual-wielding, or dual-spellcasting, or using one hand to cast a spell and another to use a sword, which adds a greater tactical nuance to the game. There are also now animated sequences for impressive creature deaths, which is nice but only of cosmetic value. More interesting are Shouts, super-powered spells that you have access to as a Dragonborn. These can blow people off the side of mountains, fill a subterranean corridor with fire or carry you through the air in a mini-whirlwind. They're pretty cool and tie in directly with the game's other big change: dragons!At first glance the dragons of Skyrim merely replace the Oblivion Gates of Oblivion: a hazard that can show up at any time in the wilderness and cause mayhem, often when you're simply trying to get from Point A to Point B hassle-free. However, the dragons are (normally) visible from miles away, so it's much easier to avoid them. Dealing with the Gates was also a major pain, as you had to fight your way through a mini-dungeon and steal an orb for each Gate to shut them down. With the dragons you just have to kill them, which is surprisingly straightforward (dragons can be dealt with relatively easily from about Level 8 or 9 onwards, maybe even lower if you trick the dragon into attacking a settlement or bunch of tough monsters, like giants). Every time you kill a dragon you open a slot for a new Shout power, which is filled by visiting major dungeons and searching them for magical symbols. It's an elegant process which ties the game's primary enemies, the myriad tons of dungeons in the game and a cool new magic system together into an impressive whole.The game has the standard Bethesda set-up of having a major storyline quest, a number of important subquests and a bajillion side-quests. The major storyline is relatively entertaining (Skyrim's dragons are pretty cool and getting to talk to them and then kill them is enjoyable), certainly moreso than Oblivion's, but Bethesda's biggest problem of poor writing remains in place. Dialogue is po-faced and characterisation of the major NPCs is limited at best. Some of the major subquests, such as the Guild storylines, are also a lot of fun. The side-quests are variable, running from straightforward fetch quests to quite major episodes in themselves taking hours to complete. Many of the quests involve dungeons, and compared to Oblivion's small caves the dungeons in Skyrim are stunning, often spanning multiple levels and varying art styles (Skyrim contains lots of fortresses belonging to the long-vanished but technologically advanced Dwemer, so there's a brilliant genre cross-slide into steampunk in the game as well). They're impressive but also disappointingly linear with the game often holding you by the hand as you make your way through them lest you get lost, despite the fact that getting lost is half the fun of a good dungeon-delve.The game scores big on atmosphere, as well. Trekking through an alpine forest with the snow streaming down and something growling nearby in the fog is suitably disconcerting, especially when the cloud breaks, revealing the northern lights in all their glory (and an ice troll charging at you). The environment is depicted superbly throughout, aided by an excellent musical soundtrack.Where Skyrim falls down is the typical Bethesda problem of providing an immense world packed with things to do, but no real emotional reason to do them. The world is stunning, but populated by thinly-drawn characters who lack motivation or depth (though this is still better than Oblivion's world of disconcerting mannequins), and provide you with no real reason to help them beyond financial rewards or greater power. You can spend almost the whole game with a companion, but beyond swapping items with them, you can't talk to them about anything of interest, leaving them as little more than an an extra inventory and sword-arm. The 'civilised' parts of the game are among the most disappointing due to the lack of good writing and the resulting lack of emotional investment in the people you meet. The game even fails to have major NPCs recognise changes in the game's storyline: after completing the main quest with all its world-altering conclusion, it's astonishing how few people take notice of the fact.However, the game is at its best when you are stuck on the side of a mountain exchanging spells with a dragon, or exploring a vast subterranean city whilst battling ancient steam-powered robots from before the dawn of recorded time. Or to put it another way, it's at its best when it puts you in charge of it and deciding what you want to do with it rather than following the developers' choices. On that level, Bethesda succeed more completely than with any of their previous games to date.Skyrim (****) is rich in atmosphere and represents a significant improvement over Oblivion on almost every level. However, Bethesda's poor writing, dialogue and characterisation continues to hold The Elder Scrolls series back from fulfilling its true potential. The game is engrossing and interesting whilst it's you against the wilderness, but becomes flat and dull when you enter more civilised area. Still, it's a stunning technical achievement with some fabulous artwork and design. The game is available now on the PC (UK, USA), X-Box 360 (UK, USA) and PlayStation 3 (UK, USA). The PC version has some highly impressive mods for it, not to mention comprehensive content-creation tools, to the point where the PC version of the game gets an extra half star from me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2012"}

Arkham City a city inside a city. Think of it a big Prison for criminals but have their own city. As Batman is inside he most fight his into finding the real reason why he is inside. As you will fight popular batman foes like Two face, the penguin, bein, etc. As the story goes on Batman find out the joker is alive and has to stop him from killing everyone and Batman. After After that he most stop the person behind Arkham City.Presentation:The presentation of Batman is beautiful. The Graphics are top of the notch. With some pop in textures on some cut scenes but that wont stop nothing. Arkham city looks beautiful and will want to see every part of it as you travel across the city. THe voice over are perfect and the actors voices are perfect for the characters.Gameplay:Batman Arkham City plays just like Batman Arkham Asylum. With the same gadgets plus new onces. Batman most use them to find his way across the city, fighting , finding secrets. If you havent played the first the controls will be easy to learn. THe closes game when it comes to the fighting style is Assassin creed games. As i played this game I had no problem controlling Batman. With so much to do in Arkham City with many side missions and Riddlers trophies to find. When buying a new copy I got a Catwoman DLC. The DLC is a side story in the point of view of Catwoman in the story.Overall:Batman Arkham City does everything right for Batman fans.

During one of the boss battles, Mario and Yoshi are fighting a giant frog's Uvala while trapped in the frog's stomach (it's a weird battle, to say the least); after defeating the frog, the frog then literally expels Yoshi and Mario out through its rectum.  Without a doubt this is the strangest scene in the entire Mario series, even with the \"Peach is Bowser Jr's mother\" scene in \"Super Mario Sunshine.If you go in expecting a conventional Mario title, you will be disappointed.  \"Yoshi's Island\" makes \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" look like a straight up, traditional Mario title in comparison, it's that different.Over the years, I've played every Mario game in the main series either at or near launch, from the 1985 \"Super Mario Bros.\" to the 2012 \"New Super Mario Bros. 2\" and all the games in between, missing only two: the 1989 \"Super Mario Land\", the most insubstantial Mario game in existence, and the 2002 \"Super Mario Sunshine\" [from 2002] for the Gamecube.My personal history with \"Yoshi's Island\" is I first played the first few levels at a lake house with my scuba instructor's grandson in 1999.  In 2002, I bought an SNES cart second hand on eBay and again played it briefly.  At that point in my life, I had bought \"Super Mario All-stars\" and \"Yoshi's Island\" to play with my college friends, and several of them hated the visual style of \"Yoshi's Island\" so we really didn't play it very frequently.  Fast forward to 2012, and I began playing through \"Yoshi's Island\" in earnest.But wait, you may say.  What about \"Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island\"?  Although the title may confuse things, \"Super Mario World 2\" is no more a Mario game than \"Super Mario Land 3: Wario Land\".  Both use pre-existing Mario brands to jumpstart sales, and neither one star Mario. Both games launched their own perspective sub-series in the Mario universe, completely separate from the main series.  And both are jaw-dropping titles.Perhaps the most revealing evidence that \"Yoshi's Island\" is not a Mario game is its original Japanese title: \"Super Mario: Yoshi's Island\".  Only when Nintendo brought the game to the States did the title \"Super Mario World 2\" become associated with this release.  Most revealing, however, is the 2002 Gameboy Advance port in the \"Super Mario Advance\" series, where Nintendo reverted back to its original Japanese title of \"Super Mario: Yoshi's Island\".  Likewise, although called \"Super Mario World 2\", this game is not a sequel to the original Mario world in the conventional series, but appears first chronologicay.  Nintendo released the loose sequel, the 1998 \"Yoshi's Island\" for the N64, and the 2006 \"Yoshi's Island DS\" for the DS.All that being said, what does this dispute between \"Is it a Mario game or not?\" the game, besides my own personal justification for not playing the game for so many years?  What does this distinction have to do with the actual gameplay itself?  Well, quite a lot actually.  Just like \"Super Mario Land 3: Wario Land\" where you play as Wario, you do not control Mario.  Instead, (with only very brief exceptions) you control Yoshi. Exclusively.Another big change?  The art style.  Due to the game taking place while Mario is a baby, the art style reflects a story-book, hand drawn visual appearance and also features what can only be considered crayon coloured backgrounds and sprites.  By 1995, Nintendo had mastered the graphically prowess of the SNES, and with the advent of the \"Super FX 2\" chip, they accomplished visual feats which you would think was far beyond the power of the SNES.  That same year, Nintendo released \"Donkey Kong Country\", another amazing title visually.  \"Yoshi's Island\" features sprite scaling and rotation (advertised as \"Morphmation\" technology), basic polygonal rendering for limited 3D effects, and advanced parallax scrolling.While daring, this visual style gives \"Yoshi's Island\" the appearance of being marketed for small children.  While Mario has always been whimsical and colourful, \"Yoshi's Island\" takes this tendency to even a more extreme place, and as a result has the potential to turn off a lot of players (my college buddies from back in the day, for instance).  Appearances are ultimately deceiving however; not only is \"Yoshi's Island\" one of the best platformers out there, with deep, engrossing gameplay, but to fully complete the game and 100% each level is QUITE challenging.Chronologically, \"Yoshi's Island\" takes place very early on in Mario's history.  Given how each Zelda title keeps going further and further back, one is hesitant to call \"Yoshi's Island\" the first Mario game in-series, though how much further back can you go than when Mario and Luigi are babies?  This game also famously introduces Kamek, a Magi-Koopa, who would later become a major character in his own right as Bowser's premier councilor, the Consigliere (to borrow a term from \"The Godfather\") of the Koopa Clan.  Kamek kidnaps Baby Luigi, and it is up to a number of different Yoshis to reunite Baby Mario and Baby Yoshi.The gamplay is simple.  Navigate through each level with Yoshi to the end.  There is no health or hit points - rather, if Yoshi gets damaged, Baby Mario, with an earscreeching cry, floats off in a bubble and you have approximately ten seconds to regain Mario.  If you do not, several Magikoopas come and take Mario away and the player loses a life.  If you collect starmen, enter Middle-Rings (which function as halfway markers for the level, much like the mid-level flags in later Mario titles) or use 10-Point Stars and 20-Point Stars, you can increase this timer to a maximum of thirty secons.There are no power ups; instead, Yoshi swallows enemies, converts them into eggs (rather curiously, in a biological process nowhere elaborate upon by Nintendo) and then can shoot the eggs at various angles.  Also at various points Yoshi can turn into different vehicles (such as a helicopter or a drilling machine) by touching a vehicle transforming icon.  If Yoshi touches a star, Mario jumps off his back and becomes invincible.  Invincible Mario is the only time you actually play as Mario.  Once his invinicibility wears off, Mario is transported back to the original location of where he left Yoshi.Each level sports five flowers, twenty red coins, and thirty starmen.  To 100% the levels (and unlock the bonus level found at the end of each of the six worlds), you must find all items.  Also, the levels are LONG, and have no time limit.The music is also a strongpoint in the game, with Miyamoto praising Koji Kondo's work in one of the Iwata Asks interviews.  Kondo then told Miyamoto that was the first time he ever praised his work.  Having played \"Super Mario 64\" countless times over since 1996, imagine my shock to find out Wing/Vanish Mario's theme is lifted directly from the Invincibility Theme in this title!If you go in expecting a conventional Mario title, you will be disappointed. But for those looking for an excellent, engrossing platformer starring everyone's favorite Mario dinosaur, you will not be disappointed.Unfortunately, \"Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island\", as of November 2012, has not been released on the Wii's Virtual Console due to difficulties emulating the Super FX 2 chip.  The only way to play this fantastic game is a working SNES or if you pick up the Gameboy Advance port from 2002.

{"product_name":"B003H0CBYS","description":"","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"Quite Surprised","reviewText":"Looking trailers and hearing its reviews, I had little to no expectations for this game. But then I liked Gears of War and Shadow Complex games and since this was also being released by Epic, I thought why not give it a shot. After finishing the campaign mode and trying Ecos and Anarchy modes, I have to say I am quite surprised.***********PROS.***************-AWESOME COMBAT SYSTEM: This is the best aspect of this game. You can slide, leash to pull enemies, kick them and use variety of weapons with primary and second fire and pull a huge variety of combination off of them. At first you may feel like it may get redundant, but thanks to variety in levels, there are a huge variety of things you can do. Thanks to that you won't get bored till the end of the campaign.-VARIETY IN LEVELS: Other than awesome combat, there is plenty of variety in levels. Throughout the campaign you experience a variety of environments including the space, woody greenery filled areas, abandoned factories, building high in the sky that is about to fall apart and list goes on.-SURPRISES: There parts during the campaign where you will be surprised by certain events and the gameplay that will follow it. I really don't want to spoil it for you, but trust me you will like it.-GREAT GRAPHICS AND DECENT ART WORK: The first time I saw the trailer for this game, it really looked unpolished to me. But now that I have finished the campaign, I can say that since then they seem to have refined it quite a bit. Certain levels just look gorgeous. I guess never doubt the power of unreal engine.-VARIETY IN WEAPONS: There are 8 different types of weapons and that is not including the leash. Each weapons (including leash) has devastating alternate fire mode. There is just plethora of combos you can do if you mix and match these weapons. I personally enjoyed each and every one of them. Also, while some weapons may look and sound familiar from other games, they will play very differently in this game. For example with sniper rifle in this game you can change the direction of bullet after you fire it. I personally have enjoyed the variety very much.-UPGRADABLES: To top of each weapon is upgradeable with the skill point you earn by killing enemies in creative ways. This rpg element will truly encourage you to creatively kill enemies and get as many skill points as possible. While this rpg element is not as well thought of as other games, it still adds incentive to do your best.-ONLINE PLAY AND ECOS MODE: While not my favorites (see cons.), after you finish the game, you can stay busy by playing online multiplayer (anarchy mode) or Ecos mode which has the same levels as campaign but gives you stars on your performance.************CONS************-RELATIVELY SHORT CAMPAIGN: Hate how games these days have such short single player campaigns. Unfortunately bulletstorm is one of them. While I enjoyed each and every moment of the campaign I found it to be very short (~7-8 h max and that is because I explore a lot).-MINOR GLITCHES: I had my character stuck while jumping over objects at least 3-4 times. Unacceptable. All the games have glitches, but under no circumstances your character should be stuck like this. I mean you can't even kill yourself. Restarting the level is the only option.-MEH MULTIPLAYER AND ECOS MODE: Compare to some other games these days, I didn't enjoy the multiplayer so much. I got tired of it rather quickly. Also the Ecos mode felt the exact same as the campaign. I wish they had added more varieties.-LACK OF NEW GAME+ MODE: This is a game that can really use a new game+ mode (i.e. start with all the weapons you collected etc.). Unfortunately, it doesn't have it. So there are some really cool weapons and upgrades you get towards the end of the game. Unfortunately, if you want to use them again, you will have to play the game again and you will only get to use them for last few levels. Just very unfortunate.**********CONCLUSION****************Simply speaking I am looking forward to Bulletstorm 2. Partly because I enjoyed this game and partly I have faith in the developers that they will improve the weak aspects of this game. All and all I enjoyed pulling off crazy combos in beautiful, but destructible environments, but I wish they had longer campaign and had fixed some of the things described in the con section. I give this game 8.5/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2011"}

In his black suit, he'll show off incredible agility, amazing durability and awe-inspiring Web powers. But be warned - as you explore these new feelings and powers, you'll struggle against the darkness that might tear his world apart.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"A Twisted Web","reviewText":"With the huge success of the first two Spider-Man movie tie-in games, it was pretty obvious that there was going to be a third one thrown in there for good measure.  Much like a lot of movie tie-in games, however, Spider-Man 3 feels a bit incomplete in some areas, and just all around lacks in others.  That's not to say there's nothing good about the game because it certainly has its perks.  The problem is that there's not a whole lot here to warrant the game a buy.As with the first two Spider-Man games before it, Spider-Man 3 doesn't really follow the movie all that well.  It's loosely based on the movie.  You've got the Sandman, Venom and the new Goblin to worry about, but the game also throws in other villains like the Lizard, Scorpion and Kingpin.  Villains that weren't featured in the movie and here they come across as space-filling just to make the game longer.  That doesn't really matter anyway as the game tries to follow the plot of the film AND work in these new villains.  It makes the games storyline come off as quite a sloppy mess.  The game's story is also carried by some rather likeluster and lifeless voice acting too, which is sad because they used the cast of the movie (save for Kirsten Dunst).  I guess voice acting is far different from acting because a lot of the time you just don't get the sense that any of the cast really cared about the game.The gameplay is pretty similar to Spider-Man 2.  You roam around the city by webswinging and looking for things to do.  No matter what anyone says, webswinging in Spider-Man 2 was fun.  In Spider-Man 3 it's still fun because it doesn't come off too different from its predecessor.  So you can swing and zip around New York all you want.  It's actually quite fun to explore the city itself as it's given some great detail along the way.  And as you explore you'll also find little random crimes that you can stop.  There's really nothing rewarding from them, and some of them are just not all that thrilling, but the fact that it's there is kind of neat.As you roam around New York you'll find icons that allow you to initiate missions and sidequests throughout the game.  Most of the missions aren't anything too surprisingly difficult.  Most of these missions are run-of-the-mill Super Hero business like saving people from burning buildings or stopping robbers.  Things like that.  The story based missions alone can keep you busy for a while, but the game itself really isn't all that long to begin with.Some of the missions and sidequests can be grueling, though, because combat feels a little off.  It's the same button mashing experience as the last couple of games, so if you've played them, you'll feel quite at home here.  The problem is some of the games adversaries you come up against use some unreasonably cheap methods to taking you down, and they can drop your health fast.  This forces you yourself to use some unreasonably cheap methods as well and unfortunately it makes the game less fun to fight in because of it.  You can build up combat abilities, but a lot of the time you're reduced to using cheap tricks to deal with your foes that the combat abilities really just don't matter because you won't find yourself using them.  Bosses especially can be unforgiving, especially because some of them ensure that before you can start dropping their health, you've got to accomplish something else first.There are also some mini-games that take place during some missions, that usually require you to do a series of button presses or analog movements.  These sequences aren't really bad, but they're not good either.  Especially because a lot of the time they explain what you have to be doing WHILE you're supposed to be doing it.  You'll often fail the first time just because you had to read the directions before proceeding.  But when you start... you've already lost.  It would've been nice if the game paused or something first.  Luckily, if you do manage to fail one of these sequences you're not penalized.  When you begin again you're usually right there where it took place.The camera is probably the biggest problem of all facing this game.  It's too jerky and all over the place and often shifts inappropriately.  Especially during a lot of the action.  You'll spend a lot of time fighting with the camera and readjusting it.Graphically, Spider-Man 3 is almost state-of-the-art for a movie tie in.  That is to say there are bugs and glitches found within the game.  The overall presentation isn't bad in terms of what you see.  But the technical stuff is definitely annoying sometimes.  Enemies being trapped inside walls or having invisible objects in their way.  It's another case of a game rushed out to meet the release date of the film.  It's nice that New York looks beautiful at least and even Spider Man looks good, but a lot of the other character models don't.  The games cutscenes are also drab looking as well.  After giving New York so much detail, one has to wonder why they didn't give the rest of the game some detail.  Again, one may assume it was because it was rushed to meet the release of the film.Spider-Man 3 isn't a bad game, really.  It just feels rushed and underdeveloped.  It's the curse of movie tie-in games.  I'm sure some hardcore Spider-Man fans will have some fun with this, but most other gamers probably won't stick around too long for this one.Pros:+New York City Looks Great!+Webswinging is still a lot of fun+A wide variety of missions and optional things to doCons:-Combat could use some work-New York looks great... but why doesn't the rest of the game?-A few technical glitches-Awful camera-The voice work is just dull-As with the other games, the story doesn't really follow the film all that well, and with the new stuff thrown in it just feels like a mess sometimes","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2007"}

Look for the regular X box to go out of business because it's obsolete and for 360 bit systems, etc. to be the main video gaming of the next several years before they come out with a 730 bit system, etc. This is quite an update and improvement on Atari and the 8 bit Nintendo, even 16 bit Sege Genesis as those systems, while revolutionary for the time, are obsolete even only 20 years into the future with the advent of more influential gaming systems like Nintendo 64 that for once had 3d play allowing for better quality gaming sessions. Towards the end of its popularity, 8 bit Nintendo did come out with plenty of better quality games so it's a shame they stopped making them just when they were getting good. Nintendo 64, while a vast improvement over Atari, had too many \"babyosh,\" family oriented Mario brothers type games making it undesirable for supposedly more mature video gaming audiences, who went with Sony Playstation and Microsoft X Box. Playstation 2 is already obsolete as is the regular 120 bit X box and there is now Playstation 3. At an intitial retail price of $600, it was too costly an investment for a lot who were stuck with the previous now obsolete version some of whom were already moved out of mom and ad's and living on their own.

One annoyance that will strike anyone picky at visuals is texturing. You'll quickly notice objects closer to you being textured at high detail and objects farther away getting blurred. This can be a bit distracting for someone like me.Game play wise this feels like another Fallout mixed with Red Faction Guerrilla game (not Borderlands which is very cartoon-ish), set in an post apocalyptic world run by mutants and raiders, with massive outdoors to explore and quests to take.The visuals are good on the PS3 but nothing to get too excited about although I'm sure it rocks on a high end PC graphics card. The AI is also good and will take you by surprise.All in all I like this game and I give id credit for it - it's hard to surpass a masterpiece like Fallout 3 because anything newer would feel like a clone but you'll realize this is a rather good looking clone that deserves at least being sampled.LE: 10 hours of game play is not worth $60, I really wished this was a free roam game like Fallout but felt short of it.

{"product_name":"B0002CHJAA","reviewerName":"John. N","summary":"Namco's got guts releasing a mediocre game after the hype","reviewText":"In all honestly, how could a game series take this big of a step backward? I mean even the best or most average of game series' take a while and a few bad sequels to degrade to such a point (example Mega Man X5~X7). How could one even work on the development team with a straight consciousnesses knowing you were developing and planned to release such a inferior product? These are the questions about Xenosaga II that keep me up at night...But seriously (no I don't say up at odd hours of the night pondering about what Xenosaga II could have, should have been), for as great as the original was and the amount of hype this game received, Xenosaga II is a perfect example of a 'almost' complete bust.First off, the game is way to short. I was really surprised I was on disc 2 after 7 hours of gameplay. I'm not quite sure, but does Xenosaga II use dual layer DVD's like the first Xenosaga, cause if it does and that's all they put on the first disc, that's pretty sad. It's almost seems they put it on two normal DVD's instead of a dual layer disc just to give the player the illusion that because it's two discs it must be a  long game. Nice marketing tactic guys, gamers aren't as dumb as you think...Xenosaga II's battle system is absolutely horrendous; it's up there with Legend of Dragoon's battle system in my book (I love to bash that game to no end). Expect to die a few times and spend a few hours taking a severe beating (especially if your battle party is surrounded by enemies ~ that's the definition of fun!) until you get the hang of it. Add to the fact the longer you take to enter a command, the more likely the enemy is going to boost and slap you around in the next turn. To add to this atrocity, add the fun of constantly stocking and boosting attacks in conjunction with airing and downing a opponent to cause any kind of reasonable damage. Then add to that fact not all characters can damage airborne opponents. Combat in Xenosaga I may have been a little basic and simplistic, but at least it was easy to pickup and learn, you almost need a degree (or a really good guide) to get anywhere in Xenoaga II. Oh, and don't get me started on the Mech or E.S. combat. While character combat is confusing to no end, E.S. combat is so pathetically simple it makes the gear combat in Xenogears look good in comparison.As for side quests, add another point to the lame column. 35 sub quests helping complete strangers out of their stupid, insignificant daily problems they won't remember a week from now while the fate of the universe swings in the balance of your quest's success. Yeah sure, that sounds like fun as well. If I don't like to help complete strangers within the real world with their problems, what makes game developers think I want to do it in a video game? Come on!Graphically, Xenosaga II is pretty much the same as the original, which makes me wonder why they hyped up that part of the game so much? Do they think gamers are so fixated on that lone aspect of a game, they are willing to forgive flaws in execution and gameplay? I mean, you can take the most graphically gorgeous game, and if the gameplay stinks, the game as whole suffers. Xenosaga II, as a game, proves this theory without a doubt.As for sound or music, you actually better off turning the volume off, unless you're viewing a cut scene. Most of the music is pretty bad (a slim few interesting tracks do exist), and the voice acting is decent, outside battle that is. In battle, the voices make you cringe, where talking \"Star Ocean: The 2nd Story\" sound bite territory here. MOMO has to be the worst, the first time you hear her say \"I'll lend support\" you just want reach though the TV screen, or hope she reaches puberty before the series is over.On the plus side (yes, their is a plus side ~ surprisingly) Xenosaga II's story continues on the rich tale from the first game, even if it seems a little touch and go, and they seem to focus too long on certain characters (the first disc is basically Jr. and MOMO centered); the second disc plays like \"hey, we forgot about the core of the story, let's go find the Zohar\".The bottom line, if you like the story, you should play Xenosaga II, despite all it shortcomings. Actually, I'd recommend renting the game instead of buying it, it's short enough, and it'll teach the developers a very meaningful lesson. If this game becomes a greatest hit, like the original, I'd be very suprised (but it probably will just because I said that).","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2005"}

AWWW YEAH!!!! From there, it's a depressing decent into a territory of poor writing, a weak story, characters void of any personality, and absolutely worst of all, no horror.Remember how cool the necromorphs were in the first game? How messed up they looked with those blades for arms, or those fetuses with tentacles? Or how awesome those velociraptor-esque enemies were in the sequel? This time around, we get such innovative enemies like the..... jawa-guy wearing a black coat or..... the guys in military gear....Remember how awesome the first time you set foot in the Ishimura? Or the space station in midst of an outbreak in 2? This time we get big, open spaces of pure whiteout, dulling any sense of atmosphere by literally having none there. Giant white snow storms that clear to reveal giant white snow peaks. You may think that it's ok because you get to go back in space, right? Well that's short lived because you land on the surface of a moon, another completely white landmass.The old weapon system has been overhauled to account for micro transactions and 11 pieces of day one DLC, with the promise of more incoming within a few short weeks priced at $10. The puzzle element for upgrades has also been removed.Coop is handled very strangely. Isaac literally goes through the exact same singleplayer animations he would as if carver was not there. You can tell the game was made for 2 however because of the level design. The entire game consists of running through a \"scenic\" area to get to a big open map where dozens of necromorphs attack you. The fights take way too long without a partner but when you're done killing, it's go push a button, run through more white spaces, kill dozens in a big room, repeat. For 9 hours.Save your money. This title will drop in price VERY fast once consumers opinions begin to outweigh the always-gentle-on-reviewing-anything-with-a-big-budget video game media.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0002CHIWO","reviewerName":"citan-uzuki \"citan-uzuki\"","summary":"Pretty Good RPG","reviewText":"I'm an avid player of video games.  It's not uncommon for me to play close to thirty hours per week.  Sometimes more, depending on other things.  Generally, I prefer RPGs and fighting games.  These two types of games are my favorite.I had high expectations for Baten Kaitos.  After all, it was co-developed by Monolith Soft.  This is the same company that developed the Xenosaga series for the PS2.  Monolith and Tri-Crescendo developed Baten Kaitos for the Gamecube.  Namco published the game.This game is nothing at all like the Xenosaga series.  Baten Kaitos does not have an epic story.  There are very, very few cinematics in the entire game.  The soundtrack works rather nicely with the mood of the game though.  And if you have played Xenosaga, you may recognize some of the same voice actors and actresses.  However, the dialogue (the lines) in Baten Kaitos is not nearly as good.  And yes, even if the voice actors are the same, the acting is not as good.All of that aside, what really bothered me about this game is the battle system.  Please, don't get me wrong.  I enjoy variety.  Sometimes, the most unusual things are also the most interesting.  Evidently, enough people liked this battle system to give it a good review.  It is a very unique and unusual system, to be sure.  Basically, what you have is a stack of cards, called Magnus.  These cards contain weapons, defensive shields, healing items, stat boosters, and magic.  Depending on your level, you may have a total of fifty cards on hand.  During battle, the AI will \"randomly\" deal five cards to you.  They can be any five cards from your stack.  The cards will then be shown to you.  The only actions you can take during battle are the ones depicted on the cards that you select.  You can pick one or more cards from the five.There are many types of Magnus.  Battle Magnus are used during battles.  There are also Blank Magnus, which you can use to carry items around.  There are also Camp Magnus, which are items that you can use and consume whenever you are not in battle.During battle, you are either attacking or defending.  You have to pick from the cards that have been dealt to you.  The object of the battle is to \"play the hand that you were dealt\".  This is similar to a card game.  Basically, luck is a very huge factor.  Whatever fortune, or misfortune, you get, you have to make the best of it and play it well.  There will be times when it is your turn to attack, but you don't have an attack card on hand.  Each card has a number, or numbers.  Playing the cards in numeric sequence (straight) will earn you a bonus.  This system is not as cumbersome as you might think.  You will learn how to use the system rather quickly.  However, this makes even normal battles long and tedious.  Thankfully, there are no random battles here.  However, due to this unique system, battles end up being a chore.  Yes, there is a lot of gameplay here, but it is not necessarily entertaining.  The normal battles are actually very easy.  There is little danger of your entire battle party getting killed.  Most normal enemies do very little damage.  Even so, some of these normal battle can easily last ten minutes.  You're basically waiting for a good \"hand\" of cards that will allow you to damage the enemy.  But, if you do not have a good hand, you cannot hurt the enemy.  Elementals (Fire, Wind, etc.) play a part here.  If the enemy is resistant to Fire, and all your cards are Fire attacks, well, you get the point.  So you see how this can make a simple battle drag on forever.  There is one battle that lasts almost an hour and a half!  Yes, that's correct.  There will be a long conversation at the end of the battle, and then the bad guys get back up and you have to start all over again.  Now, I like gameplay, but this is just busy work.  It's not at all fun or entertaining.  The enemies attack with one combo after another, sometimes eash attack lasting close to thirty seconds.  Now, after watching the same attack over and over again it gets tiresome.A good portion of the game is devoted to sidequests.  Basically, most of them involve a lot of backtracking.  You will revisit many of the previous areas over and over.  Basically, you will be going around in circles.  You will be scavenging for numerous items.  Unfortunately, you can only carry a few at a time.  The idea here is to trap the item's \"essence\" into a Magnus card.This game reminds me of Sony's PS2 classic rpg, The Legend of Dragoon.  It has the same atmosphere.  And the story is almost the same.  And yes, you will also hunt down star fragments (stardust) in this game.  Baten Kaitos plays almost like a classic Playstation game.  It does not have the grand cinematics of the typical modern rpg.Play this game if you like those classic Playstation RPGs, like The Legend of Dragoon.  However, I recommend that you use some sort of Walkthrough or Strategy Guide.  Not only will the battle system try your patience, but the numerous quests will also.By the way, KOS-MOS appears in the game.  In the form of an unplayable Magnus card titled \"Rare Action Figure\".Update (April 23, 2009)I have changed my mind about this game.  This is my second time playing the game.  And you know what?  I am actually enjoying it.  I was a bit harsh in my original rating of this game.  Perhaps because I was not accustomed to a battle system that uses \"cards\".  In any case, for those who still own a Gamecube or those who own a Wii and would like to play a classic RPG, this is an excellent choice.My adjusted ratings for this game is 4 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2007"}

So now that you know the ending, you might as well completely bypass this game.  KIDDING!  You might as well play through the entire game to see how the bang happens, IF there's a bang at all, that is.  The Walking Dead is quite an amazing game, full of crafty storytelling and edge-of-your-seat decision making.  It's like a hybrid of PS3's Heavy Rain when it comes to story and Mass Effect with its decision making all rolled into one.  The combination works wonders, especially when the whole premise involves zombies.  Great stuff!I don't know why other reviewers complained about glitches in the Xbox version of the game.  The only one I encountered (and I have a 4 GB system) was a slight freeze during the loading of Episode 2.  After about a minute or two, the episode started normally.  Besides that, this game is a perfect 5 stars and definite must-own.  I played through the entire game with Lee playing the moral good guy.  I can't wait to play him as a bad-a** and make all the decisions that I never made on my first play-through.  It will be an entirely new experience, which enhances the replay value of the game.There will definitely be a Season 2 of The Walking Dead, so be sure to never delete your original save!  I bet you that they will import it into the future release with Clementine playing the lead role this time instead of Lee.

Players will discover expansive environments and deep character customization options as they delve into an epic conflict between the Homs (humans) and Mechons (robots) and uncover the secret of the ancient Monado blade. With richly detailed role-playing elements, Xenoblade Chronicles offers an extraordinary experience for veteran gamers and genre newcomers alike.","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"A JRPG for the ages","reviewText":"One of the main reasons that I love gaming as much as I do is because of JRPGs (Japanese Role Playing Games).  The first RPG I ever played, the NES JRPG Dragon Warrior, got me hopelessly hooked on the genre as a whole.  My favorite game of all time, Final Fantasy IV, is another JRPG, and was the first game that showed me that video games could reach a level of emotion and compelling storytelling that was as deep and as powerful as any great novel or film.  And since then, many of my favorite games throughout my gaming lifetime have been JRPGs.  However, during this console generation, the balance of power in creating great RPGs has shifted westward.  While Western developers have been releasing masterpieces such as Fallout 3, the Mass Effect series, the Witcher series, and Deus Ex: Human Revolution, JRPGs have fallen behind the curve.  The great Final Fantasy series has released games that have polarized gamers, and the few innovative JRPGs that have been released have been seemingly relegated to handheld devices while Western RPG hybrids have dominated the console landscape.  However, the North American release of Xenoblade Chronicles demonstrates that not only are JRPGs still vibrant and brilliant, but that they can still be innovative and forward-thinking, and that the future for this genre is bright.There is really nothing bad that I can say about Xenoblade Chronicles.  This is a huge, epic, sweeping game that brings a sense of adventure to the gamer that few other games can match.  Starting with the basics, the combat system is close to perfect.  If you've played Final Fantasy XII, that is the closest comparison I can make, except that Xenoblade's combat feels more alive and interactive, and much less automated than Final Fantasy XII's.  While your AI party members control themselves, your placement on the battleground and the abilities you choose to bring into battle for both yourself, and those you equip for your party, will have a huge impact on your effectiveness in battle.  While it may appear daunting at first, you'll find, like with all of Xenoblade's interfaces and systems, that the combat is actually very easy to use and master.  Your characters can be strengthened by a deep set of game mechanics involving traditional leveling up via XP (experience points), the leveling up of Arts (abilities in battle), skills (passive abilities) and the crafting of gems (enhancements).  The way everything ties together is absolutely wonderful and seemingly limitless in the ways you can customize your party.  New weapons and equipment can be obtained though defeating enemies, completing side quests, and by purchasing them at shops.  And with every piece of armor and every weapon containing a distinct appearance, you'll love the way your character and party members' looks change throughout the game.Another thing that really impressed me about Xenoblade is the way it bucks so many of the negative stereotypes that plague many JRPGs.  While the story may appear to be somewhat conventional in the beginning, you'll quickly realize that this is not only one of the best stories ever told in a JRPG, but it is written in a mature, emotive and concise way (huge kudos to the team that did the English translation) that is delivered by a wonderful group of British voice actors.  The characters for the most part are really great, and hold none of the \"emo\" stereotypes so many Western gamers associate with games in this genre.  This is an absolutely amazing tale that anyone will be able to get into, and although it takes a few slight turns into the convoluted near the end, it concludes on a powerful note that will leave a lasting impression.This is a huge game that can take you well over 100 hours if you're a completionist.  I personally spent about 85 hours with the game, and completed about half of the more than 500 side quests.  While the side quests are a great way to earn money, items, and sometimes XP, with them being MMO-ish in nature, they can become somewhat repetitive after a certain amount of time spent doing them.  But the good thing is that they are absolutely non-essential to progressing through the game, and the developers have graciously made it so that you can complete side quests without always having to return to the person who gave them to you (a HUGE time saver that was definitely appreciated by this gamer).  As you get to the later areas in the game, you'll find that the side quests will open up new areas of the map, and expose you to enemies that are even tougher than the final boss.  However, you'll most likely find that you'll end up completing a good amount of these side quests without even purposely doing so, as Xenoblade presents a world that is so incredible, compelling and mysterious, that you'll want to explore every inch of it.The world of Xenoblade exists on the bodies of two primordial titans, who were frozen in time while battling each other to the death.  This creates a fantastical game world that is a feast for the eyes.  Some of the best art design of any game you'll ever see is to be found here, pushing the Wii's hardware to the absolute limit of its capabilities.  This is all supplemented by a masterful musical score created by some of the most brilliant, long-standing composers in the business, including Yoko Shimomura and Yasunori Mitsuda.  You will remember this beautiful music for a very, very long time after you finish the game.Xenoblade Chronicles is the complete package.  It is one of the grandest adventures ever to appear in the medium of a video game.  It is one of this generation's greatest games.  It's easily the best JRPG of this generation, the JRPG I've enjoyed the most since the wonderful Dragon Quest VIII on the PS2, and a genuine surprise for the aging Nintendo Wii, a console that many gamers have written off as of this writing in mid 2012.  In short, it is a genuine masterpiece.  But most importantly, it will hopefully be a strong example for game developers in Japan who are developing JRPGs.  Xenoblade shows that not only is the Japanese role playing game still extremely relevant and vibrant, but that it also can have a very bright future.  Xenoblade contains everything that has made this genre so great for the last 25 years while still looking forward and blazing new trails in the road ahead.  If you were like me, and were starting to get a bit pessimistic about the genre, this game will rejuvenate and excite you.  If you've never played a JRPG before and are wondering what it's all about, there is no better place to start than here.  A huge thanks to Monolift Soft for making this wonderful, important game, to Operation Rainfall and the many others who pushed for its release here, and to Nintendo of America for finally bringing it to our shores.  Don't miss out on this one!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXLQC","description":"","reviewerName":"Jeffrey Lasalle \"Jeff LaSalle\"","summary":"WTF??","reviewText":"Ok, i never give one star reviews, but a message must be sent to Capcom. This once proud survival horror franchise has really fallen from grace. I grew up with this series, and it's sad to sit back and watch Capcom wipe their rear ends with the Resident Evil brand. If you came into this game expecting tension, scares, and difficult resource management.... you might as well replay an older RE title, because you won't find any of those classic RE qualities in RE6. What you will find is dumbed down, third person shooter action, with over the top set peices, and stupid quick time events. It plays out like Gears of War, only ten times worse than that. And yes, RE6 comes packed with content, providing about 20-25 hours of gameplay. So, this must be one of the few things RE6 does right, huh? Not at all. Instead of a bad game that ends in 8 hours, you have one that drags on and on over four mind numbing campaigns, for 25 hours or so. Does that sound like fun to you? Playing through this game is like being tortured. So what should Capcom do to set things right? The focus should return to horror, and they should stop trying to mimic other franchises. RE has really lost it's identity over the last few years. And i would love to see Capcom restore it, and return this franchise to greatness.Why has survival horror become taboo within the industry anyway?? The fact that so many developers are distancing themselves from this genre is very frustrating to me. Survival horror has provided some of the most enjoyable gaming experiences of my life. And to observe these established horror franchises lose their identity, in an attempt to pander to the Call of Duty crowd is borderline nauseating. I am beyond thrilled that this strategy has blown up in the face of Capcom. RE6 sold well below company expectations, and alienated many of their core followers. Nice going Capcom! If people want Call of Duty, then they will play Call of Duty!! People play Resident Evil for an entirely different experience! One that you have been failing to provide for years.PROS:+ The cover art is very cool.+ Increased character mobility is a welcomed addition.+ There is a lot of content for your money (though much of it sucks)+ Features many popular characters throughout the series history.CONS:- This is not a horror game. Though Leon's campaign was promoted as such, it only delivers on fleeting atmosphere and lazy jump scares, until it dissolves into another mind numbing action fest.- Resource management and tactical thinking has been removed. Now, you have ammo and guns in generous amounts. Turning what was once tense and strategic enemy encounters in past games, into a boring shooting gallery.- Story is convoluted and scatter brained, with plot holes littered throughout all four campaigns. It feels as if this story is held together with duct tape and spit.- Do you enjoy quick time events? Well, neither do I. Unfortunately, RE6 supplies them in great abundance. This is a lazy mechanic, that always feels like a copout. I will feel engaged if I am an active participant in the action, and not some guy pushing timed button sequences in order to advance.- Who is this game for anyway?? Call of Duty fans will play Call of Duty instead of this. And Resident Evil fans will feel alienated by this shallow game. WTF Capcom??VERDICT:Listen, judging this purely as a video game, you could do a lot worse. However, this isn't just any video game. This is Resident Evil, and must be held to a higher standard. The fact that Capcom compromised the integrity of the series, by removing all of the popular survival horror components, and replacing them with generic action/shooter gameplay, in the interest of reaching a broader fanbase, is reprehensible. Capcom sold out, and should have more respect for their own intellectual property. Shameful.4/10","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2013"}

Sme\"","summary":"Are we playing the same game?","reviewText":"I was a little surprised at how low the ratings are for Black Ops, I've actually liked it better that Modern Warfare 2, and wonder where the venom is coming from.  Last time time it was the multiplayer, this time it seems to be something else.Yes, the game is geared more towards console players, that's the way things are today, but it's still enjoyable on the PC. The single player was much better, while the graphics are still notching up rather than making revolutionary changes.  The story is more like COD4; longer with a convoluted plot but now with a 60's Cold War setting.  As with World at War there's a couple of vehicle levels that are in some way unique from what you've done before, and as with Modern Warfare 2 lots of cool weapons to play with.  In what may be a unique twist for the series two of the characters from World at War appear; one is a major player, the other is in a bit part.  Overall the single player was killer.The Zombies mode is.....different.  If you've ever wondered what it would be like to play JFK in an abandoned Pentagon fighting off hordes of Zombies, this is your chance.And now the multiplayer...Modern Warfare 2 selected the servers for you, and the wailing and gnashing was heard round the world.  How could people form clans? How could they gather together on their favorite servers and cheat, er, play competitively?  How could people make arbitrary nonsense rules about not using rockets or using only sniper rifles?  How can admins who never say they're an admin just decide this round is a knife fight only and the next will just be pistols, and wield the almighty ban stick for logging in and not knowing what's going on?  Or just ban anyone who plays better than them or they decide they don't like?  Well, all that's back.  I actually liked the Modern Warfare 2 system better, just log in and play, only a problem if you cheat; but this is more popular for obvious reasons.While Modern Warfare 2 felt and looked a little cartoon like, Black Ops is pretty much an amped up COD4.  The maps in general have more corridors and alleys, so you have to keep your head on a swivel and watch out for enemies.  There's more variety in weapons (someday they'll run out of cool guns), and the upgrade system to me is more fun.  You still rise through levels too fast, but you earn money to buy upgrades, and there are plenty.  Some perks you gain more skill as you use them, and now you can at last (With the Warlord perk) use two attachments on the same gun.  I really don't understand the hatred about the multiplayer, but have noted most of the negative reviews were from when the game was first released and *duh* lots of people were signing up at once. I haven't had any problems with lag or slow response.My only complaints about the multiplayer is the same I've had on any COD multiplayer: the made up server rules and cheating.  I'll admit I'm just an average player; but when you play enough you know what works, that enemies normally drop with 2-3 hits from an assault rifle.  When someone comes along who is almost untouchable; they always run and never seem to slow down, knife everyone all over the map, get you at ease with endless head shots, and the only way you can drop them is several point blank hits with a light machine gun, something's up.  Heaven forbid you ever try to call one of them on their unlikely prowess, you'll never hear the end of it....It's also one thing to cheat, but if you don't like something the game allows why be so difficult about it?  I've argued for a long time they ought to allow the multiplayer server features to be customized.  You log into a server then whatever they don't like is disabled and no more headaches about so-n-so doesn't want you using Last Stand so you have to create a class without it just to please them.  Really, I play for fun, not to deal with someone's control freak obsession.  The latest thing going around is servers trying to ban people from running.  Yes running.  People are shooting at you and it's supposed to just be a fun action game but don't dare run because then the 25 year old admin living in his mother's basement will ban you for life.  Actually I ask them to do that so I won't have to worry about logging into their server again; at least there's plenty of good servers still out there.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2010"}

Just play the PS1 version from the store (cheaper, too)","reviewText":"A lot of people seem to disagree with me here but I find this version to be a big downgrade from the original. Here are the differences, broken into pros and cons:Pros:-New classes (but they're really not very good anyway and reuse animations/skills from the old game)-Two new characters (again, they're not really that good and not worth it)-&#34;Improved&#34; dialogue, which I actually hated more than the old dialogue-Some tweaks and balancing fixes, which are actually a good thing-New cinematicsThe only two pros that are actually a good thing, IMO, are the tweaks/balance fixes and the cinematics. However, there was still something charming about the old cinematics, so I don't mind going without them.Cons:-Obnoxious slowdown that will drive you insane if you've played the original-IMO, the new writing is awful. I was excited to hear that they'd rewritten the dialogue to make it less confusing and better than the old, poorly translated version. However, to me, it's even worse. It attempts to use some Old English language that is very confusing and cheesy, with terrible grammar. They should have hired better writers for this.-The audio quality is DOWNGRADED. In a game with such an amazing soundtrack, this is a huge issue for me. If you don't believe me, get both versions on the Vita and listen to them side by side, with or without headphones. The music reverberates beautifully in the original game but sounds flat and dull in the new version.-LOWER resolution, at least on the Vita. Buy the original PS1 version and it actually looks better (sharper)-For some reason it seems they want you to have to click a lot more in this version to confirm movements and actions. It gets annoying quickly, even after turning part of it off in the options-They also added some annoying confirmation sound for every piece of dialogue. I was never able to figure out how to turn it off and it wasn't in the original (original had some nice page-turning sounds)Overall, this port is insulting to such an amazing game. If you have a Vita and don't mind the lack of fullscreen, just get the original game from the store. It's cheaper, anyway. I have played both on the Vita and I was saddened to see how much better the original was than the new one after switching back.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2014"}

Conard \"ExtremeAvalanche\"","summary":"The Best FPS EVER!!!","reviewText":"Let's start at the beginning. A few months ago, I passed by Timesplitters 2 on the shelves, simply because I was not interested in it. But I read the reviews, the TERRIFIC reviews of TS2. I knew that I had to get the game. Within about a day, I was hooked, and I was determined to get every character, level, and game mode. By now, I still have 25 characters to unlock, and several game modes. I have gotten every level. But note that TS2 is NOT an easy game. The story mode is a cinch, but in the later arcade missions, the game becomes damn near impossible! And the best characters come in the later arcade missions. But what is even tougher than later arcade missions are the later challenge missions. The name says it all. The challenge missions will challenge you and sometimes take a good day to beat, all for an extra character or level. The multiplayer game is great all in all, but let's not throw away the story missions, which are very fun as well. Similar to Eternal Darkness, a great Gamecube title, you will play through various levels set in differnt time periods. Some are 1932 Chicago, Notre Dame in the late 1800s, and even a fun shootout in the Wild West. I don't mean to insult, but the futuristic missions are tough and boring. My favorites are Chicago, whee you play as a detective trying to bust a greedy mob. The level is excellent, and it really feels like a gangster-ridden, seedy 1932 Chicago. Notre Dame is fun as well, where you play as a gypsy-like lady sent out to help a hunchback(of course!)free some maidens, and destroy an evil Jack the Ripper-like guy. The sound is great, and the music in each level is superb, along with good voice acting. The graphics' greatest weakness are also their greatest strength. The game looks semi-cartoony, but after a while the game looks pretty good, but definitely cannot compete with UT2003 or Resident Evil. Overall, Timesplitters 2 is the best game in my collection aside from GTA Vice City, and I love it! You will too if you loved Goldeneye, because the developers of Goldeneye designed this game. Remember Dr. Doak, any Goldeneye fans? The best FPS to come to come out for the PS2! My Rating:9.8!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2003"}

{"product_name":"B004DI5H26","description":"","reviewerName":"Robert T.","summary":"Few MAJOR changes make this the best one yet","reviewText":"Here's a really quick review. MLBTS11 uses the same formula as MLBTS10, with a just a few (but MAJOR) updates. Of course, we have purely analog options for hitting, pitching, and fielding. My personal preference is to use analog control for hitting (which makes hitting infinitely more possible but also more fun and intuitive/engaging) and pitching (which is more fun, but also more challenging than simple button pitching) while leaving the fielding option as button control only. To me, this makes the game 100% stronger than its immediate predecessor. They also modified some of the in-game physics so a baseball hitting the outfield wall doesn't go bouncing away like its made of rubber. There are still frustratingly slow field-to-throw transitions for fielders, but this is minor really. Some of the Cooperstown and Minor League options are no longer available (very limited selection of Minor League fields to play at), but again these are minor. My biggest complaint is that, like previous iterations, almost every game has this inexplicable feeling of predetermination to it...like the outcome is already set and the computer adjusts its own play to achieve said outcome. Whether this means the computer giving you too many opportunities to win or breaking out of a scoreless rut to hit 4 HRs in the 9th, I'm often left wondering whether (like pro wrestling) each match is fixed. Who knows. All in all, this is the game I'd hoped MLBTS10 would have been.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00007F8PB","reviewerName":"JD","summary":"Suprisingly good, one of the best of its genre","reviewText":"I picked up a copy of Baldur's Gate:  Dark Alliance not too long ago (yah, I know it has been out for a while).  Anyway, found the game surprisingly good and much better than expected.In case you haven't read any of the other reviews or are completely confused, this game is typical hack-and-slash.  You guide your charachter from an overhead perspective and control their attacks, blocks and magics.  There is little in the way of skill needed here, which is refreshing in its own right.  You have only three charachters to select from (Elven Sorceress, Human Archer and Dwarven Rogue), which was my first complaint.  Each plays roughly the same, though they have slightly different starting stats and their list of spells/feats (which can be purchased when you level up) are different.The game uses the Dungeons and Dragons roleplaying game ruleset, but takes a lot of liberties with it.  But for fans of DnD you will see spells, feats and classes you recognize.  The use of the DnD rules is not without its flaws though, and of most note is the flaw in the way armor works in this game (or doesn't work).  As you improve your armor don't expect to take any less damage when you get hit, it doesn't work that way and armor doesn't absorb any damage.  What the armor does is make it harder (supposedly) for enemies to hit you in the first place (yah, you will see them swing at you and have it deal no damage, or  you swing at them and see your weapon slice them but don't deal any damage).  While this sounds good, the problem is that the enemies you are going up against in the early stages of the game can hit you 99% of the time even with the best armor you could find at that point.  In the later stages, the enemies will hit you no matter what, you simply can't get your armor high enough to cause them any concern - the developers of the game actually released a statement acknowledging this.  Oh well, you do have a manual block (provided you are using melee weapons) and it works pretty well against most attacks except those of bosses.  All armor does is make you look cool and take up a huge chunk of your limited carrying capacity.Graphically the game looks really good, the colors are clear and vibrant and your charachter model looks good and usually stands out nicely from the surroundings.  As you change your equipment you will notice that it reflects on your charachter.  Magical weapons also have a nice blue shine and as enemies near some will burst into flame or something similar.  The enemies as well look really, really well done, and again, if you are familiar with DnD you will recognize them.  The visual representation of your spells is also very well done with bright colors, dancing flames and showers of magical energy - nice! When you strike an opponents you will be rewarded with blood spatter, and smaller enemies like rats can be cut clean in half.  Spiders also goo nicely (and can be pretty creepy to anyone who happens to not like spiders).The gameplay is smooth, no glitches, and the controls are easy.  Spell management is a little cumbersome as you have to use the direction pad to scroll through your list of spells/feats to find the one you want to use for the current situation, but simply pressing the B button uses the selected spell, and A delivers your attack.  Switching between close and ranged weapons is very simple (press a direction on the D-pad) and pressing the other direction turns the automap on and off.  As far as the map is concerned you don't really need it because the game pretty much uses invisible barriers, stones, walls, green foilage, ravines and what have you to keep your from exploring out of the desired area.  In all respects the game is extrememly linear, but as you are basically playing for the hack-and-slash aspect, that is not too bad.  And you can also have a friend control a second charachter on the screen, which adds to the fun.As far as sound, that is never too much of a big deal for me, but the voice acting in this game is fine, the spells, blows and weapon effects sound great for the most part, and I didn't really notice the background music, so obviously it isn't a probem either.I did give the game 5 stars, but it does have some flaws.  The graphics are nice and the levels are laid out ok, but not great.  And they re-use a lot of the texture tiles and what have you, so in that respect some of the areas have similiar appearance to what you would expect to see on the super nintendo with the same brick tile pattern repated every so many inches (most annoying when you are outdoors and they reuse trees and rock formations).  Also, as I mentioned, there are only 3 classes to play as, and each one is somewhat limited in their spells and feats.  For example, as the Sorceress I found only a few of the spells to be worth investing in and none of them did more damage than a fine sword and a lot of them take a pretty good amount of magical energy to cast for only a limited effect.  Using ranged weapons and spells can also be aggravating as it is not always easy to tell exactly where your character is facing, so they will miss a few times while you try and line them up.  This gets harder when you are farther away from your target, or trying to fire diagnally.Overall I really enjoyed this game.

I liked the things that were added...a dog for your companion and other features.  Minus the occasional freezing of the game or so I thought.  That is until it happened again a hour or two later.  At first I thought it was my 360 but all my other games play fine on it.  So i popped it back in and started \"trying\" to play again.  This time is just loaded and froze...tried one more time and the same deal.  It loads and the game just freezes and that's all that I can seriously take with Fable 2.  I truly enjoyed the first game and was looking forward to this one so much I bought the Limited Edition for it despite the warnings otherwise.I've never just stopped playing a game and given up because of glitches/bugs.  Shoddy gameplay or a weak story perhaps.  But i've never had issues like I have with this game and after I waited this long to finally get around and play Fable 2.  It makes me even more frustrated and upset over the company for releasing a game that wasn't ready to be put out.  It's cool about putting out a patch and what not.  But that would not be necessary if they simply put the game out like it should've been minus the sorry and game ending glitches.As it stands I enjoyed what i played of the game but not after the issues I've experienced.  Fable 2 will go right back on the shelf of gams I don't touch anymore.  I'll find something else worth my time because this one isn't it.Not recommending Fable 2 at all.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2009"}
{"product_name":"B007FTE2VW","description":"","reviewerName":"Marvin Powell","summary":"A Review and a Rant: SimCity 2013","reviewText":"SimCity had SO much great potential to be everything we all wanted and more. Unfortunately, EA had to decide to give us players absolutely nothing that we wanted and make us \"rent\" their game at the cost of sixty dollars minimum in order to actually use it, rather than own it.THE PROS:* Really nice graphics.* Building add-ons and upgrades.* The simulation aspects of the city itself are very good.* The gameplay is easier and more user-friendly.* The ability to individually follow a Sim or a vehicle, though you won't be able to label them or \"create Sims\" to keep track of.* Great Works, massive city-sized projects, being a new introduction into the series, gives you something major to work towards.THE CONS:* Always have to play online. Perhaps the BIGGEST flaw of all. You CANNOT PLAY WITHOUT A REALLY HIGH-SPEED INTERNET CONNECTION. It is REQUIRED! If you have a slow internet connection, you're screwed. If you don't have home internet access, you're screwed. You have to log into Origin, and then play the game off of EA's servers. As you may or may not be well aware of now, the EA servers are atrociously bad. And what will happen ten years from now if anyone wanted to play this game? I still play Sim City 4 and that was released ten years ago.* Server issues, of course. They suck and their terrible-ness isn't going away anytime soon. This is a separate issue by EA, unrelated to the Always Online issue. During the first two weeks, most players couldn't even get INTO the servers. These problems will likely be fixed over time, but the Always Online requirement likely won't ever away.* Can't save your own city (its auto-save) and can't reload anything. You cannot test or experiment anything in your city to see how it works, because of this. Also, because of the server issues, you very well could lose everything due to the auto save feature. Or, if you can't get back onto your local server and have to use another one.* Limited city size. Most people's OTHER glaring, giant flaw in the overall game. This really should be called \"SimTown (2013)\". The size is only about a 2 square kilometer area. Or 400 square city blocks, at its maximum peak. This is much smaller than it sounds, and a full entire city can be made in about an hour. You'll get about another hour or two out of it upgrading and trying to maximize everything to peak efficiency, so... up to three hours, on average, is what you're looking at for a fully complete city, here.* You cannot, for the most part, build a fully functioning city, by yourself. While with some, it is possible, the game is really set up so that you more-or-less have to trade resources with other cities in order to properly function. This was their vision when they made the game. They wanted it to be an interactive social experience. Otherwise, the multiplayer would merely optional for those who want it, not so heavily encouraged to the point where they try to force you to use it in order to get a fully functional city. As for trading resources... you can either do this with other players online if your region is publicly open, or if you're like me, you'll prefer a private region that only you control. However, if you do a private one, you'll constantly be hopping between cities once you hit a peak or barrier for resources. If you do an open region, you'll have to rely on strangers to help you build your city and assuming the server DOESN'T shut down on them, they lose their cities, they don't troll, or they don't just forever abandon their city that your town is forced to rely on, they still more than likely will mess you up more than help you. Problems in other cities affect yours, and how many people would really care or be considerate enough to not cause problems to your own city, especially in cases where it won't affect theirs?To put it in other words, Forced Multiplayer and cooperation kills any single-player fun to be had. Unless you play with personal friends and they all think like you do and you can all work towards a common goal, this will surely be more of a hindrance than if you could just play fully alone. This is beyond forced and unnecessary. You can build a great city entirely on your own, but you have to be an true expert player in order to do so. Its very hard.* Speaking of which... Specialized cities are more-or-less mandatory instead of merely optional. Because every city on the region needs to support each other, SOMEone's going to have to build an industrial city. And someone's going to have to be a mining city, garbage city, cheap commercial city, etc. Sucks all the fun and imagination out of it all, just like modern-day Lego kits.* Also... the interface is pretty much the same way. Much more user-friendly and simple, but offers FAR less creativity, as well. Every single possible thing in the city has to be linked by roads. Can't build a park or anything out in the middle of nowhere. Can't build a cabin up in the woods. Can't build a mountain retreat to have an isolated Mayor's Mansion at. And so on. Also, the zoning for neighborhoods also offers less freedom. You have to zone by road size, now. The ONLY upside to this is that roads also now take care of any power and water requirements, so having to build power lines and pipes are no longer necessary. Though some people won't like this newly added shortcut (I am one of them) because pipelines weren't that big of a major hindrance in past games, to begin with. The road system causes more problems than solutions, especially in a designated space smaller than most major city's downtown districts.* No terraforming or creating your own custom regions. It is absolutely impossible to affect the natural resources of the land, like creating rivers, digging lakes, or forming mountains. Oh, and the pre-made choices aren't really that great, either. This also leads to monotomy and the same boring terrains every time.* No option to skip tutorials. They are long, boring, lame, and there every time you start a new region/city. Apparently, you can exit out of the city to avoid having to fully go through them, though.* Many things missing from previous SimCity installments, like subways or well, ANYthing underground. These will likely be sold as exorbitantly high DLC's.* The Sims are glitched/flawed. The way the Sim Agents work is: A sim will go from a house and work a job. Then, go home at the end of the day. Only problem is, no sim \"owns\" their own home, and they just go to empty houses/jobs by proximity and occupancy, so they really don't \"own\" individual jobs, either. This will result in whatever businesses that are furthest away from your residental Sims to fail, because the Sims will never travel that far until all the other occupancies/jobs are filled up, first. So, you could have several over-crowded businesses near your residental homes, and several abandonded/empty jobs further away from your houses that they fail to reach because they're 'too far away.' This is also why traffic jams occur frequently despite how man bus stops you put down and why businesses seemingly fail for 'no reason.' In order for it to work functionally, you'll have to plan to put your top businesses or factories near the entrance of the city and your residental areas somewhere in the middle of town, or close to one designated spot where jobs are. Spread anything out or place jobs in different parts of the city besides one spot, and chaos will ensue.Overall, this SimCity game could've been SO close to perfect had EA not deliberately chose to ruin it with their horrible and likely greed-inspired choices. Merely not forcing players to have to always be online with a high-speed internet connection, not forcing them to have to rely on their laggy and buggy servers, not forcing multiplayer on one of the only truly Single-Player Gaming franchises out there, and NOT giving us such small city-size limitations could've and probably would've made this game a perfect SimCity/city managing simulator (even with minor bugs, aside).But as it is in reality right now, it is a forced Massive Multiplayer Online experience (not even true multiplayer, but rather a 'multiple single-player community') that has you building tiny two-by-two square kilometer towns where resources are always limited and there's always a very good chance you'll lose your entire city and everything in it.Again, allowing us the FREEDOM to play this game by ourselves, offline, with actual city-building space would've likely made this game near perfection. But as it stands now (especially at sixty dollars), it is not worth your time, money, or attention.Remember Mass Effect 3's ending (if you've ever played that before)? What is it with EA and upsetting their fans every March? It doesn't take a genius to figure out all they need to do. Its mind-numbingly simple; so dumb, anyone can figure it out. Give the fans what they want and they'll give you their money! Win/Win. THQ - an extremely horrible gaming company that cut corners and ripped customers off in the most extreme ways - learned this lesson the hard way. They are now bankrupt and deservedly so. EA has screwed up time and time again in the past, and their customs of restricting players' freedom and greedily high-pricing them and ripping them off with DLC/expansion packs will not go unpunished. Fans can be very vocal about this and I know most companies likely won't care about fan complaints, especially over the internet. However, when customers speak with their wallets, shareholders and investors also become very unhappy and companies fail and die off. You simply CANNOT be successful while cutting corners, taking away freedoms, and upsetting all your loyal customers. Game companies aren't like McDonalds or Comcast cable.Again: It's simple! Give us what we want and we'll give you all our money! Up until their ending, Mass Effect, developed by BioWare and published by EA, got this 100% right. But then, they didn't and boy, did that hurt them. But it seems EA refuses to learn from their mistakes. Funny thing is, EA's quality isn't even as bad as THQ's was. THQ made terrible games, and made terrible game decisions on purpose, AND ripped off their customers with pure greed as their intentions. EA at least, has quality games, yet they still manage to p!ss off their fanbase just as badly.As we stand, we have a SimCity game that was developed wonderfully by Maxis and ruined, at least in part, by EA and their \"Always Online\", \"Always co-dependent on other players\" bone-headed executive mistakes to maximize profits and minimize quality or player freedom. By the way, the game could've been fully functional offline, and one of the main reasons they did this is to prevent \"piracy,\" which is ALWAYS a greed-based decision. (5% of players pirate the game, so 95% have to suffer for it?)SimCity is a game that could've been, but never was. And its painful to see what a fun game this could've been, but ended up turning into, due to technical crap. Because of the possibilities for a great game, I can't in all honesty, give this 1 out of 5 Stars. And the game WOULD'VE been awesome, had it not been so restrictive and buggy. But it is, and they ruin any possibilities for the true great gaming experience this could've been. While there may always be hope for the future, such as a console-ported version that addresses and fixes all of the current mistakes of this release, as it stands now, SimCity 2013 is not worth your time, not worth your hard-earned money, and not worth your attention, at all. It pains me to have to say this, but when companies mess up this big and royally, they have to be held accountable. Someone deserves to get fired immediately over this. SimCity is THAT bad.\"EPIC FAILURE: Complete and total failure when success should have been reasonably easy to attain.\" - Urban Dictionary.

As the samurai Samanosuke,  players volunteer to rescue the kidnapped princess Yuki. No surprise  that the ultimate goal (and the entire story line, for that matter)  falls by the wayside as hordes of demons converge on the player hour  after hour. The weapons system benefits from the flashy graphics--as  players discover and add gems to a gauntlet, weapon upgrades increase  firepower with increasingly dramatic effects.Graphically, the game is stunning. Carving through the levels--forests,  tunnels, and the requisite dark, dank castle environment--isn't  anything less than a spectacular experience, thanks much in part to the  game's unusually high production values. Character models are built  from up to 10,000 polygons each--high detail, even for a PS2 game.  Subtle environmental effects--the wind flowing through the trees, for  instance, ripples the fabric in characters' clothes--furthers the  game's realism. The game's backgrounds are painstakingly detailed and  nicely enhanced by dynamic lighting effects.The talent behind the aural effects is just as impressive.

{"product_name":"B002I0JAVK","description":"","reviewerName":"Thomas A. Zulli \"Tazz\"","summary":"Possibly the best super hero game EVER!!!!","reviewText":"The first game was in deed epic, however it did have its flaws. But Arkham City, it does have its flaw or 2 but its still as perfect of a game you will ever find. The story is longer (somewhat around 25 hours long) Plus there is about 15 hours of side missions. Also 10% of the game follows Catwoman as a playable character...only if you buy the game new. If used you have to pay to play as her. In the last game, the rogues gallery wasnt that impressive, as there were maybe 2 or 3 people have heard of. And the rest were easter Eggs. But in this game, a lot...I mean a lot of villians appear physically . Whether its a part of the main story (Joker, Mr. Freeze, Penguin, etc), a side mission (Deadshot, Zsaz, etc) or an easter Egg (Calender Man, Killer Croc, etc) and Im not talking about a cell or an item. They appear physically.Now the story is very intriguing. I was wondering why on earth Batman is stuck in Arkham City but we learn why right off the spot. Also one of the problems with the first game was Challenge maps, since no one cared. But in this game, they are back but we get 36 + dlc ones where we can play, set a score and brag about it and compare to others in a leader board. One other problem is no, co-op. Yeah there is one opportunity but thats it. Maybe in the next game.A big plus is they turned the simple, one somewhat big area with buildings to enter found in the first game into a huge open world. Kind of like how GTA is. Actually X-Play compared it to the Zelda games, with one big world with dungeons. Either way I see it as Grand Theft Auto: Arkham City...minus the car stealing. But there are always thugs to beat up. Which is another thing I like. To upgrade your armor, attacks and weapons. You need to beat up thugs. Luckily there are always a thug or 2...or 3..or whatever. You can simply find them by turning on detective mode or listening in on them.One thing, I loved about the last game was the Riddler hiding riddles all around the place. For you to find. Although we never see the Riddler we did hear his voice. In this game, he does the same thing but makes them way tougher. Some are as easy as finding the trophies or scanning an object like in the last game. But this time he has added puzzles to find trophies. Collect enough and you are giving a riddle to the location of someone the Riddler is holding hostage. Speaking of side missions, there is one more quip I have. Some missions are hard to find. Riddler I can expect, but the one with Deadshot can be hard. But still fun.Overall the cons are few but not important. Like I said this game is as perfect as you are going to get. Buy IT!!Pros:-25 or so hours of story mode + 15 hours of side missions= 40 hours of gameplay-There are actually villains we care about-We play as Catwoman...if we buy the game new-The story is intriguing-Better challenge maps-Open world like feel-There are always thugs to beat up-Riddler challenges are back and better then everCons:-Camera can be a bit of a pain-If you buy the game used you have to pay to play as Catwoman-Would have like to see co-op-Some side missions are hard to find","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2011"}

Thus, I eagerly awaited the sequel, Oblivion. In most ways, this game either met or exceeded my expectations. The developers took the reviews and fan feedback about Morrowind seriously and have made a game that will likely be regarded as a classic many years from now. Oblivion is by no means a perfect game, but it packs in so much gaming goodness that it's hard to find much fault.Gameplay: Like Morrowind, the concept here is free-form, openended exploration. The gaming world is absolutely huge with tons of stuff to do. Want to explore caves, dungeons, and ruins? Go ahead, there are dozens. Like questing? Join the Fighters Guild, Mages Guild, Thieves Guild, Arena, and/or Dark Brotherhood. Or, just talk to the locales who'll have plenty for you to do. The main quest centers around finding the heir to the throne of Cyrodiil, which will require you to visit the hellish realm of Oblivion and close various gates. It's a decent storyline altogether, but nothing as epic or absorbing as Baldur's Gate 2 or even Morrowind. Overall, the various quests in this game are much improved over Morrowind's, and many have multiple parts and interesting background stories. Unless you blast through the main quest (about 30 hours) without doing any other tasks, it would easily take 200 hours to see and do everything this game has to offer.The controls for the game are typical for first-person shooters, although the game can be played a bit awkwardly from a third-person perspective. There are several hotkeys for weapons and spells. Combat is very engaging and will require some practice to get used to. Opponents will block, dodge, use power attacks, and generally fight in an effective way. Stealth is improved a bit over Morrowind, with a lighting/awareness system much like that of the game Thief. Also, being a mage in this game is a viable option, and the alchemical system should even appeal to non-mages. And like Morrowind, you can create your own custom classes, and the face generation system is very detailed. The user interface is easy to read and organizes items, spells, skills, and so forth in a logical way. It can't be scaled by resolution, so when it's open it covers the whole screen.Thankfully, there are many improvements over Morrowind (and most any other computer RPG out there). Dungeons and caves are creepier and have traps, multiple areas, and lots of loot. One complaint about Morrowind was that it got too easy too quickly. Few people will have that complaint about Oblivion. Most creatures are leveled, meaning that they get stronger as the player character advances in level. This keeps the game challenging throughout, though it still seems a bit weird to have a 25-level warrior with the best weapons and armor having trouble with a goblin warlord or dread zombie. Anyhow, NPCs in this game are rather lively, living their own lives, having somewhat dynamic conversations, all-spoken dialogue, and many animations (eating, sleeping, horse riding, etc.). And then there are the nice little touches, such as houses to buy, display cabinets for your loot (or to be looted), a solid bartering system, the lockpicking minigame, and the exhilarating arena matches (you can fight or just bet). Also, the journal is great and sorts your quests well.Given all of its strengths, the problems with the game are mostly minor and annoying, nothing major. I would have liked to have seen a bit more variety in the Oblivion plane. Once you've closed one gate, it's wash, rinse, and repeat for the others (you'll have to close at least 10). It gets old quick. This also goes for the dungeons, caves, and other adventuring areas. The best way to keep things interesting is to do various tasks at the same time--some guild questing, dungeon crawling, and miscellaneous quests. Otherwise, any single activity can get a bit monotonous. Sadly, the horses are not as fun as they could have been. There are different breeds with different characteristics, but in the end they are largely a cosmetic addition. You cannot fight while mounted, they cannot carry items for you, and they are somewhat expensive. Also, opponents have a knack for targeting your mount, even once you've dismounted. In about 100 hours of gameplay, I purchased over a dozen horses due to the fact that they died so frequently. Ultimately, since there are other fast travel options and since a character with a high Speed skill can outrun some horses, a steed is a questionable purchase.Graphics: State-of-the-art. Period. This is a beautiful game by any standard. Be ready to take a lot of screenshots. It's all there: lush forests, snow-capped mountains, torrential rains, reflective water, breathtaking sunsets, quaint towns, eerie dungeons, and much more. Every item in the game looks realistic, including character faces and animations. The Havok physics engine nicely enhances the experience. All of this, of course, means that you'll have to have a pretty good computer to enjoy the game at max settings. On a 3.0ghz Pentium IV with 1GB of RAM and Geforce 6600GT video card, I managed 1024x768 resolution with most settings on medium (Bloom on, along with grass and water reflections). Unlike Morrowind, this game is very scalable, so people with a wide range of computers should be able to make the game playable. The developers really went the extra mile on the visuals, and I certainly appreciate it.Sounds: Well done for the most part. Many of the voices from Morrowind are back, but in much greater quantity since all dialogue is spoken. There are many creature sounds and environmental effects, all of which are appropriate. While I loved Jeremy Soule's music for Morrowind, his efforts here are lackluster. The game's soundtrack is very understated and fails to adequately set the tone in many situations. Actually, I had to purposely listen for the music a lot of the time, which shouldn't be the case.Technical Issues: Fortunately, this game goes against the grain for this particular developer. Up until now, Bethesda had a well-deserved reputation for releasing buggy games. However, Oblivion was remarkably stable on my computer and very well-polished. Admittedly, it did crash about 10 times, resulting in a few corrupted saved games. However, most of the crashes took place as I tried to reload saved games, which is not a big problem since I save very often. There were none of the Morrowind-style crashes where you're just walking along and... BAM!!!--desktop. Ten crashes in 100 hours of gameplay is a ratio that I can definitely tolerate.The game comes with a good manual and a map of the gaming area. The opening sequence serves as a tutorial and is well done. Also, it is much quicker to get into the game than Morrowind, which required you to listen to the opening theme music as the game loaded.Replayability/Value/: If you buy into the premise of the game (openended exploration and questing), this is a great value. I've played a lot of games, and nothing quite touches the bang-for-the-buck that Elder Scrolls games have. There is a construction set for the PC version that can be downloaded for free at [...] Also, like Morrowind, modders are going to have a field day with this game, which should lead to some quality third-party mods for downloading. Overall, if you liked Morrowind, you should really like Oblivion. If you have never played an Elder Scrolls game, this is a fine one to start with.Overall rating: 4.5 stars","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2006"}

{"product_name":"B0001NBNGG","description":"The creepy tale of a possessed Japanese village (Hanuda) told through the eyes of ten playable characters in combination with some impressively innovative gameplay&nbsp;features should totally make my day&nbsp;&#8211; but playing Siren turns out to be sadly different than I was expecting.The game's two big features: sightjacking (where you see through the eyes of other characters) and the Link Navigator (which manages the plot's order of events) sadly don't add to the player's experience enough to justify their problematic existence.Sightjacking is more fun to mess around with than it is helpful to the player. Watching the paths of roaming enemies can offer useful information, but the stealth mechanic is so simplistic that the data is rarely necessary. In many situations, being seen by enemies is something that you can't avoid or recover from &#8211; they will find you, and they will kill you. This is fine by me, but when the only stealth-orientated skill that is offered is a painfully slow crawl (and a distracting yell, which had little to no effect that I could perceive), it doesn't make me want to be all that sneaky. There isn't a sound meter, no real way to know if enemies can see you or not (like a vision cone or shadow meter), and very little chance of distracting them with diversions. It is more fun and more efficient to just run through levels and see what happens than to use the sightjacking feature to suss out a plan of attack.Which leads to discussion of the game's other big feature, the Link Navigator. Siren's storytelling plan sounds like a survival horror Real World season: Pick 10 characters to escape the apocalypse and find out what happens over 3 days through 78 missions &#8211; you could call it Siren: Hanuda. The complication is that the order of events is jumbled and the Link Navigator is supposed to help you keep track. What this means, from a player's point of view, is that the game's story doesn't really get its hook into you &#8211; not even in the first few hours. The tales are too disjointed, the characters too many, and the plot too slow in getting going.The more conventional aspects of this game like sound design and graphics are also something that people will have mixed feelings about. The creatures' insane, maniacal laughs are honestly unnerving, and therefore good for this game. The graphics look to be actual pictures of the characters' faces and lend a realistic, but still skewed version of each person &#8211; they're detailed, but strangely flat. I think that this is a nice subtle touch, but others may disagree.I really, really wanted to like Siren, but in the end, I just didn't have much fun or feel like the innovative parts of the game were used to their advantage. It has good ideas, and I'm glad to see experimentation in survival horror, but this should be chalked up as a failed test in the genre.Concept:Navigate a horrific village as ten different charactersGraphics:Muddy and jerky&#xC2;&#xA0;&#8211; but it fits with the disjointed feel of the gameplaySound:The best part of this game, the sound effects are creepy and (for lack of a better word) ickyPlayability:The context-sensitive menu system is&#xC2;&#xA0;counter-intuitive and the stealth mechanics are pretty archaic and basicEntertainment:I really need a reason to care in a game this cerebral and slow-paced, and Siren doesn't give it to meReplay:ModerateRated:6.25 out of 10Editor:Lisa MasonIssue:May 20042nd Opinion:From a conceptual standpoint, Siren is chock-full of ingenuity, and is a soaring success when it comes to the delivery of unusual ideas. Forming a mental bond with your attackers so that you see the surroundings from their perspective is a great idea that leads to some unnerving situations. This gimmick only goes so far, however. I found its functionality, and the entire gameplay package for that matter, to be clunky, and above all, frustrating. I grew so disenchanted with trying to pick up enemy sight that I avoided using this technique whenever I could. I love the episodic approach to storytelling &#8211; but the execution of gameplay bothered me to no end.Rated:5.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"John","summary":"Could of Been a Lot Better","reviewText":"The game sounded fun and looked scary from videos.

I now have a PS3 console and was interested in experiencing the game with enhanced features and additional content (Lost Missions and the original classic, Doom).Pros: The graphics of the BFG edition are much improved from the already-stunning XBox presentation, it's smooth, bright and very well-done.  I emphasize, gameplay just buttery smooth, everything flows so well and the controls respond perfectly.  Everything else is as it was, the game is very atmospheric and scary, great for a stormy night with the lights off --  if you can handle it!!!  Bwwaaaaaaha ha ha!Cons: the controller configurations.  ACK!  What have they done?  The XBox had left trigger as sprint and it worked well, now it's the L3 (click the stick) button.  This is horrible!  Even the Doom classics in this BFG edition have the L2 (shoulder/trigger) button as sprint.  And, the flashlight is L1 trigger?  Really?  And, the crouch (R3 click the stick) cannot be toggled, it must be held down as long as you want to remain crouched -- this is very bad considering the right stick is used to look around.  Also, why can't the controller layout be fully customized?  This forced configuration takes away some of the game for me.  Any game for current-generation consoles *really should* allow players to customize the controls however they want, instead of picking from a handful of pre-set configs.  This is a tragic oversight in a surprising number of games nowadays, and I just don't understand it.  It's as if the developers believe there's no way any player could want the controls to be any different from the limited number of setups they might prefer for themselves.I still recommend this game with 4/5 stars... it is fun and very pretty and will keep you entertained (if not scared) for many hours, just be aware of the limited contoller options.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet.

You can use your wii mote as a light gun just point at the screen and shoot by pressing the B button as a trigger and reload after every 6 shots by lifting your wii mote up (kinda makes your wrist sore), They also had the 3rd HOTD on xbox but I think this ones better, 2 for the price of 1. But my only complaint's is that why wasn't the first HOTD released especially 4 which I heard was awesome, we just get a half a** 2 & 3? Well anyway Sega manages to keep these games very challenging By throwing more zombies at you giving you only 5 continues and no saving points. I heard some complaints about no saving points in this game but thats actually a very good thing because if there were save points then this game would get very boring because it's probably a very short game and this is a game to see how far you can get with out getting killed which shows a map after you get game over.

This is an AWESOME game.  The plot is amazingly creative, the character's moves and spells are cool, and the addition of powerful allies known as guardian forces that you can use in battle are a nice touch.  however, the magic system is a little confusing and impractical.  You can drastically increase your stats and build up immunities to bad status effects by \"junctioning\" the spells in your inventory to that statistic or immunity.  The problem is this.  In order for it to have an effect of any kind you need a TREMENDOUS number of spells.  Rather than learning spells, however, you have to \"draw\" them from multiple draw points along the map or steal them from enemies. Also, rather than use magic, you can summon massive beasts to kick some a** for you.  The problem with this is that you will begin to rely on these things too much as using them costs you nothing (no MP, no HP, you just get to do massive damage for free) and then when you hit points in the game when they become unusable, your other skills are horribly underdeveloped.

{"product_name":"B00178631E","description":"","reviewerName":"HitRaj 47","summary":"Not as good as the original, but still a great game","reviewText":"Before I wrote this review I had actually completed the game twice! That may not seem like a lot, but the second time took me only about six hours, this game is incredibly short. Not to mention half of the game are cut scenes! No, I'm not joking, seriously, if you were to turn this game into a movie there wouldn't be much work to do. All of the scenes are already laid out and the actual gameplay, the gun fights actually sometimes feel like an interlude for the next scene. This game feels more like an interactive movie than a game and I almost got frustrated at Rockstar for making an \"ungame\".As far as the actual game play goes though, it's really quite good. There are plenty of weapons for you to shoot in slow motion bullet time and each one is satisfying to use. If you have the cross hair set to \"white dot\" though, be prepared to squint a lot. I recommend setting that option to \"weapon specific\" because, I don't know, maybe it was because I played the game on 19201080 but a tiny white dot is really hard to see, especially on graphics this amazing. This time, bullet time is recharged over time as opposed to getting kills for it and new to Max Payne series is the ability to hide behind cover, which is incredibly useful. Beware of the slow motion dive though - if you decide to do a shoot dodge and if that means you'll end up flying over a railing and into a canal, or off the edge of a building, it'll actually make you fall off. Basically my advice is, literally look before you leap. Max can also sprint, but quite frankly I don't think it adds any speed and is probably the most useless sprint feature I've ever seen, I wouldn't bother using it.Payne is also limited in the number of weapons he can carry. He can use two one handed guns at the same time, but he'll have to drop any two handed guns he is carrying. He can also holster one of the one handed weapons and use only one, but also carry around a two handed weapon. Basically the most you can carry is two one handed weapons and one two handed weapon. This changes the game play as it makes it more realistic (because you know, the crazy stunts that Max pulls off is what someone would do in real life) and it has you searching for ammo all the time. Ammo is not exactly hard to come by, but you won't have bags of it either. In fact, before you move on to the next room it's best to search for a weapon with the most ammo and refill before moving on to the next room. Which will  most likely start off with a cut scene, where sometimes Max pulls out one of the one handed weapons you are carrying. If you previously were using a two handed weapon like an AK, and in the cut scene Max pulls out a Desert Eagle, for instance, you'll start that next section of the level with that weapon pulled out. So make sure you have ammo for it, or remember to switch back to your two handed weapon. This can sometimes be a real pain (sorry).The cut scenes themselves are incredibly long too. Luckily the game auto saves at the right moments so if you die, you won't have to watch it all over again. But to prevent yourself from dying, you take pain killers, just like in the previous games. The main reason for you dying would probably be because an enemy decides to walk up to where you are hiding behind cover and attempting to shoot you. Enemies stay behind cover a lot and take pot shots at you, but they also move around, forcing you to also move around and move from cover to cover. Enemies also throw grenades, which I didn't actually find any in the singleplayer, only the multiplayer had grenades.The multiplayer also isn't as bad as I thought it would be. It's like the third person equivalent of Modern Warfare, complete with XP, achievements and customizable loadouts, kits and appearance. All of which can be unlocked through playing the multiplayer and the singleplayer modes on higher difficulties. Bullet time is also in multiplayer as well and it actually works quite well. Completing singleplayer on harder difficulties unlocks more things, but there are other singleplayer modes, like arcade, where you try and rack up as much points as you can in each level, and New York minute returns, where you must complete every level in under one minute, gaining extra time with each kill and even more time with head shots.The multiplayer however is really secondary, especially if you're a Max Payne fan. What you really got the game for was the story. If  you haven't already, I recommend you play the first game. You don't really have to, but it's quite interesting to watch the character development. In the third game, Max finally gets the chance to grieve for all the people he lost in the previous two games, including his wife and baby girl. As a result, a lot of the cut scenes are quite dark and even depressing and he drowns his sorrows in alcohol and a mid life crisis. Payne takes the job as a bodyguard (a word of advice - don't hire a drunk for a bodyguard) for a rich family in Brazil and is recruited by a new character by the name of \"Passos\". He is actually quite a likeable character, since not only Max likes him, but they also share the same sense of humor. There are plenty of wisecracks in the game and the dialog, although painfully (okay, I'll stop) cheesy is very well written. This game is pretty much an interactive movie and I think even the scripting is very well done. The story is also no longer told through a graphic novel. Is that good or bad? Not really sure, I miss the graphic novels, I don't really know of any other game that tells the story this way, but the cut scenes, despite being incredibly long are still really good.Voice acting is really well done too, in fact everything to do with sound in this game is perfect. The soundtrack is really amazing and really sets the tone for the theme of the game. I feel that Rockstar really went above and beyond in using sound to create an authentic atmosphere. The weapons also sound beefy enough, even in slow motion and it makes them a joy to use.The graphics look amazing too. The levels have lots of variety, which you'll have a lot of fun shooting the crap out of. Environments aren't as destructive as say Battlefield, but you'll find that certain points of cover don't last long as they get shot up by your enemies. Going into slow motion lets you see bullets traveling through the air and also makes them easier to dodge.Despite how good it is, I'm not particularly interested in the multiplayer and I wish Rockstar had spent more time on making the singleplayer experience longer. Although the different modes do offer quite a bit of replayability and so in all honesty I'm not really ready to put this game away yet. If you were worried, like me, that this game wouldn't live up to the standards of the previous ones in the series, then don't worry, Max fills those concerns with bullet holes with amazingly fun gameplay, despite that only feeling like it's half of the singleplayer experience and for those who want it, the multiplayer is well worth the money too. Overall a very fun game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2012"}

Garrelts","summary":"Less than Mediocre and Slightly Better than Terrible","reviewText":"I recently finished my cooperative play-through Hunted: Demon's Forge and can safely categorize this game as completely mediocre and in many regards just outright terrible. There are a lot of things to dislike and a relatively small number of pluses. It's safe to say that Bethesda has delivered yet another below average game which seems to be their M.O. outside of The Elder Scrolls and Fallout titles.Hunted stars two cookie cutter characters named Caddoc and Elara lifted directly from the pages of \"Video game Clich&eacute;s 101\" (if such a book existed). Caddoc is your typical grunt; he's crude, rude, and one tough mudder . Elara is his barely covered, flirtatious, tough-as-nails, Elven counterpart. Guess which character specializes in melee attacks and which one is the ranged specialist?The story is typical far for an action/fantasy title. Humanity is on the verge of disaster because some unknown entity is driving the Wargar (orc-like creatures) to kill villagers and take the rest prisoner. Caddoc has a nightmare involving the Wargar on the search for a magical item and the duo become involved in the plight of humanity. The story unfolds over a prologue and six chapters. This isn't award winning writing or anything that most gamers haven't seen a dozen times before. Additional tidbits of story (if you're so inclined) are told through encounters with dead humans along your path. Since your duo will be in possession of a `death stone' that allows communication with the dead.Gameplay is from a 3rd person perspective and typical hack-n'-slash mixed with some ranged abilities for both characters. Caddoc is the tank of the duo, able to carry and equip heavy weapons; Elara specializes in her bow and ranged attacks. Problems are evident almost immediately. First, hit detection in this game is miserable. With Elara, you can send arrows fling directly through enemies at point-blank range. One of Elara's most handy abilities is an explosive arrow. Problem is a good 50% of said arrows will fly directly through your target, exploding on some innocent foliage in the background. The wily gamer will soon adjust to shooting the ground at the enemies feet but it's a telling tactical adjustment.The graphics are merely passable. This title uses the Unreal Engine 3 so you're likely to be familiar with its distinctive look. The environments rely heavily on dark colors and a color washed gray & brown scale.There are moments that the developer probably intended to be the \"epic\" or \"cool\" moments that fall absolutely flat. Story-boarded the ideas were probably great - a boss battle versus a giant, marauding spider enemy whilst your characters run for their lives? Or how about a battle against a snarling, projectile hurtling dragon? Sounds awesome! Except it's not in Hunted. Both battles turn into pedestrian and utterly boring affairs using mounted weapons to decimate barely there enemies.The game features the most basic upgrade system I've seen in a game this side of the SNES era. In fact many SNES games had better character upgrade systems. Your character in Hunted has six abilities. Three relate to physical damage and the other three to magic abilities. Each ability can be upgraded here and there and caps out at three tiers. By the end of my first run I had all physical abilities and two magic abilities maxed out. Weapons are found randomly at weapon racks you can loot and rarer magically infused weapons. This isn't a Diablo-style loot fest either. Most items look identical and most weapon racks feature the most basic of weapons.So the few positives I mentioned at the beginning? Well the game does feature online co-op and it's mostly stable. So it can be fun to poke fun at this game while playing along with the right friend. There are some Easter Eggs hidden in the game linking certain item names to The Elder Scrolls series. That's about it.I should mention too that the typical Bethesda-quality beta testing is fully evident in Hunted: Demon's Forge. Meaning that there was none and the game is riddled with bugs, glitches and the like. Besides the typical game freezing and online drops the game features a pretty prominent trophy glitch that will likely prevent most trophy hunters from achieving that shiny Platinum trophy that is so desired. Given the age and fact that the title is published by Bethesda do not expect any type of future patching or bug fixes.Pass on this unless you absolutely have no other online multiplayer options at your disposal.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2012"}

I would pay anything for it, even 900 dollars (but I bought my copy for 20!). Why is it so amazing? Well when it is cut on it plays a the original arcade Donkey Kong theme, but then Donkey Kong swoops in with his boom box and dances to a remixed version of that. Now how many 16-bit consoles were able to produce dancing 3D monkeys? Then the game starts. Donkey Kong burst out of his house. The game itself did not have any kind of plotline, but it was pretty obvious after a while. Donkey Kong walks into a cave with a sign that reads \"DK's banana hoard\". The music gets sad and Donkey Kong starts shaking his head. I got the message pretty well. Somebody stole Donkey Kong's bananas and he wants them back. This was all shown through 3D animations. Soon the big monkey is running through beautifully rendered levels. Controlling a giant rampaging monkey seems really hard, but it is not. He moves about as well as Mario. The level design is beautiful. My favorite was Stop and Go Station, which had me flipping a switch to freeze an enemy. Every time the enemy was frozen the lamps in the level would shine red. When the effects of the switch wore off the lights shined green. It was a very interesting puzzle. The soundtrack is as good as the graphic effects. I don't know how, but I have never heard as good of a score as this, and this came off of a cartridge. I have played Sonic CD (with some of the catchiest tunes), Super Mario Galaxy (fully orchestrated), and A Link to the Past, but none of those sound as good as this. Each tune went along with the theme. A dreary and quieter tune if it is raining, a flute tune for a forest theme, and a nice quiet tune for the nighttime Tree Top Town level. Believe me, once you buy this you will want to smash your uncreative and overhauled Xbox 360 to bits.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2012"}

Hooker \"bulmabriefs144\"","summary":"What a stupid game","reviewText":"I played this game at an online convention.  The food limit was 100, and I had thought this would be reasonable anyway, it wasn't, as I spent about 10 or so workers trying to build up resources, as normally, gold is gathered at +10 per few seconds, and +5 wood per.  Come on! Then most major processes seemed to be a one-at-a-time deal making it take forever to build new buildings, learn new skills, and even just making troops leaving me open to attack.  What really bugged me though was two things: first, you can't gather without your base creating a catch 22 where if it is destroyed you need a base to gain materials to build a new base.  The second is the way food is gathered and done.  It's counterintuitive.  Rather than hunting down critters and expending resources, making food decrease when you breed critters(thereby allowing more troops) you have to operate within a very artificial limit.  And it doesn't seem any way you can dismiss your characters, nor does there seem to be a way to convert (*cough* useless *cough*) workers into fighters, so you have 10 workers hanging about which should be 3-5 fighters. It is an overhyped, overrated game as most of the major problems are addressed in Age of Empires/Myth games (the food, the workers could at least fight, and if your base is destroyed, you just die rather than be humiliated by not having the resources) or the Heroes of Might and Magic games (your hero that uses magic is actually leader of troops rather than someone who just gets killed off along with the rest, and they have wider selection of spells to boot).","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2004"}

I enjoy worlds that are visually pleasing and this was the opposite, but I heard so many great things about Fallout 3 that it convinced me enough to buy it. My initial reaction was that it was an average game not worthy of the hype. My character was equipped with a pistol in the beginning of the game. Gunplay shots were highly innacurate and doled out very little damage when the shots hit their targets.When I found better weapons, in the game world, they barely had any ammunition to make them useful. Ammunition along with everything else is very scarce and hard to come by at first. I was also suffering from radiation poisening and got my leg injured after fighting off a giant rat. I had barely enough money to have my injured leg healed by a doctor and even less to buy ammunition or purchase better weapons.After a very rough start I was ready to give up on Fallout 3, but decided to keep exploring its huge open world. After Several hours of gameplay I've met some very fascinating characters, visited creepy underground tunnels, looted abandoned cafes and shops. Whenever I wanted a new weapon I just picked up the ones which dead enemies dropped. I destroyed many evil characters some worse than others and encountered many deadly creatures.I became a scavenger, mercenary for hire, and a gun-slinging hero all rolled up into one! Characters rewarded me for my good deeds or gave me information which proved useful for specific quests. Everytime my character gained enough experience points to \"level up\", I upgraded my combat ability or bartering skills; making it easier to earn money. I also picked from many of the fun PERKS which enhances combat playability and dialog interactions. I had a sword/chainsaw hybrid that tore things apart. I was able to go to a workbench and create unique weapons from junk found in the wasteland. I could solve problems by killing or being diplomatic. I choose how I want to play, I choose where to go and what to do- This is my world! This is the world of Fallout 3!A lot of people describe this game as Oblivion with guns, and they are partially right, because the gameplay and menu systems feel similar. Everything else about it is different yet enjoyable. If you like role-playing games or open world type games, you should not hesitate to buy Fallout 3.Pros:+open world+excellent PERKS+excellent controls+excellent creature designs+excellent map design+excellent voice acting+excellent story+excellent music+excellent side quests+excellent sound effects+be good or evil+lots of scavanging+lots of guns+melee weapons+blood and gore+ragdoll physics+save game anywhere, anytimeCons:-game randomly crashes-combat looks a bit stiff-technically outdated","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2008"}

We have played many of the lego games (Indiana Jones, Lego Batman I and II, Pirates of the Carribbean, Lord of the Rings) and can compare between them.  While Lego Batman will always be a favorite because of its simplicity, I can firmly say that Lego Marvel is a huge improvement over the ambitious Lego Batman II.  New York City, in Marvel, is easy to navigate, and you will not spend inordinate time reaching your next level location (as you did in Lego Batman II).  The city is bright and colorful, and full of side missions.The first mission, with Ironman and The Hulk, starts off with a bang.  Hulk is yelling \"Hulk Smash\" and throwing cars.  Ironman is flying and shooting.  It's all kinds of fun, and it only starts there. I love how Lego incorporates humor, and there's plenty of it with these characters.  Ironman and Wolverine were my two favorites, as well as the Black Widow, for their commentary.Flying characters are a bit difficult to navigate until you get the hang of it, but definitely FUN to play.  There are many characters in this game, and all have different and interesting abilities suitable to their superhero background.  As a sidenote, you can always switch to their alter-ego, like Peter Parker in the case of  Spiderman.  I am not familiar with all the superheroes, but the ones I recognized definitely acted like their comic book forebears.  Sometimes they did so in a winking, \"in the know\", kind of way.  I definitely see Lego games as something fun for kids, but also fun for the adults, much like the best Pixar cartoons appeal to both audiences.The story was uniquely lego, yet also reminded one of the Avengers movie. All the super-villains, led by Loki, are working together to get power bricks for some devious plan - which I won't reveal here.  You'll have to play and find out.  The levels are highly varied, from factories and office buildings within New York, to Asgard and a mysterious jungle island.  You'll have the opportunity to fly planes, and my favorite, skydive.If you haven't played a Lego game before, you should know a few things. First, you can play alone, or cooperatively.  Secondly, you have a main series of missions that you play through, but you can go back and infinitely replay previous levels with additional characters to unlock more secrets and collectibles.  Third, it's quite easy to play.  You should have no problem beating the game. You can't die, basically.  You may lose all your \"coins\" as a punishment for being broken up, but you don't die.  And frankly, neither does anyone else, if you're worried about violence, basically the lego figures just break up.  I find it's one of the best games to play with your kids for this reason.  It's very forgiving.  You can always restart or replay levels.  The only frustration is that you can't save except at specific checkpoints, so it's not so easy to put down.  That said, each level has 2 to 3 checkpoints so you should be able to finish before dinner gets cold on the table.  With the missions in nice succinct packages, you can easily partition the game over days, saying that you'll do a mission a day.  That said, if you play with your kids, you may also come back and play the game on your own time.  It can be that fun.  Now if you have played a LOT of Lego games, there isn't a lot new here.  Buy this game if you enjoy the Marvel universe.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2013"}

I've played nearly every Mario game. Is this game the best game ever made. Definitely not! If this is your first RPG, well, okay, then maybe I can see why it appealed to you. But stacked against Final Fantasy 6 or Chrono Trigger? No competition. Well, let's get into the nitty gritty of this review, shall we? GRAPHICS: Admittedly, the graphics in this game are REALLY good, but they are not the SNES at its absolute best. SOUND/MUSIC: Goodness! It's been so long since I've played. Let me put it this way: I don't remember ANY specific tunes from this game. I'm sure the music was fitting, though. CHARACTERS: Like many have said, the ability to have Bowser in your party was just downright awesome. But then I can't help but wonder about this? Where's Luigi? They have this Geno guy, but they don't have Luigi. However, Frogfucius was really cool because I liked his name. But the one group of characters that I DIDN'T like were those silly Mighty Morphin Power Ranger look-alikes. I guess they were low on ideas that day or something. STORYLINE: You start in the 12 o'clock position on the world map and work your way clockwise, edging ever closer to this awesome looking sword that has a face built into it. You go down pipes, find old and new friends, fight evil, go to weddings, etc. BATTLE SYSTEM: Not too different from other Squaresoft RPG's--it's turn-based. Each character has a different weapon and special abilities. OVERALL: Only Squaresoft could have made this game what it was--any other company would have botched it up. If you want a fun RPG with variety and--most of all--Mario, then this is not a bad game. Gamers who like the Final Fantasy series MIGHT feel a little let down though.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2001"}

This is a true console rpg in every way and is influenced by many other rpgs to create a unique experience. Unique? Yes, you get an airship from the start and the map is a series of floating islands with seperate cultures and architecture and music. The characters have very memorable design and the airships are spectacular. My fav part of the game is the airship battles which can be long but are way interesting to watch. The graphics are superb although not near the calibur as say Resident Evil: Code Veronica or Shenmue, this is anime meets polygons and it is very well done. The voices aren't bad at all since they are kept to a minimum to be used as battle cries and emotion indicators. The game truly is a good buy for a Christmas present if your a parent, it is good for 13+ ages I would suspect with some language and character interaction that only mature users will pick up on. The story is very good and original unlike Grandia 2. The battle system is very simple and the enemy random encounters can be a bit too often but your levels will increase quickly. I have spent 30 hours on it so far and I am on Disc 2/2. The game may be quicker to beat but I generally take my time and look around etc. to get the most out of my purchase.

In some places I felt like I was cheated being killed with one hit and that's where co-op game will help you a lot while playing it. If the second player dies, you don't have to go back to a previous checkpoint. When I was playing on my own I died so many, many times and when I found out how much I had to play again I wasn't happy because I had already used my power ups.Another thing you should do is get the mobile app (I got it for iPhone) so it can help you get some of the pieces for gadgets to use during the game, it's your typical 'Bejeweled'- style game but if it helps get those gadgets faster, sounds good to me.Yes, the story is predictable and the script is VERY cheesy, but I would not rate this game as bad, on the contrary I stand by my first review that it's a 'Great Launch title for the PS4'ORIGINAL:I wasn't really impressed when they first announced this game a few months ago. I definitely changed my mind!As it has already been showed in several presentations before, the game style is very similar to what you would expect from games like Crash Bandicoot and maybe it's just me but I got a feeling it was also similar to Banjo Kazzoie, bringing a lot of really fun memories from a while ago.My friend and I spent a couple of hours dedicated to the co-op mode only. It was fun, challenging while easy to get into it too. There are a few games that include a good co-op mode in the same screen lately. Most new titles focus more on the online experience but forget that some games were meant to be played with a friend, in the same room. I'm not sure if Knack will be considered one of the greatest Sony exclusives ever but it is definitely worth the money (especially with that deal they had \"Buy 2 get 1 free\") and time. Since Watch Dogs was delayed (I know it wasn't an exclusive but it was my go-to launch title). This and Killzone will have to make up for it for a few weeks at least.Also, it's really cool seeing the character grow from a very small one to a HUGE powerful one!I agree with one comment I read about the game somewhere that the levels are sometimes as amazing and epic as the ones you can find in God of War gamesSummary:-Graphics. The cartoonish style looks so real (You'll understand when you see it). Definitely an improvement from the previous gen but nothing crazy impressive. It will probably be outperformed by titles later in this generation. But for the time being, it looks great!-Co-op mode is a blast.

AndSonic Adventure, with its light-speed gameplay, is sure to wow even the most jaded gamer.It's amazing that such a small machine (it's about the size of your mouse pad) can deliver such incredible performance. Chalk it up to superior engineering. Dreamcast's only downside is that it comes with only one controller and a demo disc. In order to truly take advantage of Dreamcast's capabilities, we recommend outfitting the controller with a Jump Pack and a Visual Memory Unit. Getting one or more extra controllers is also a good idea, because some of the best Dreamcast games support up to four players at once.Why it's so cool:Ultramodern components:Custom-made video, audio, and processor technology blows away the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation and puts Dreamcast in the same league as PS2 and XBox.Integrated modem:In another video-game first, Dreamcast comes with a 56K modem. Use your regular Internet service provider and the separately sold keyboard to access e-mail, shopping, and the World Wide Web. Not only can you upload high scores, participate in chat discussions, and download updates and enhancements for your games, but, through a membership to the SegaNet Internet service provider, you can playQuake III Arena,NFL 2K1, and other games against Dreamcast owners over the Internet.The Visual Memory Unit (VMU):More than just a memory card, the VMU is a miniature portable game system that fits inside a controller--so its LCD screen is easily seen by you but hidden from your opponent.All-in-one entertainment:It plays games. It plays audio CDs. It connects to the Internet and lets you browse the Web or e-mail friends.

Dreamcast does it all, and does it well.--Mike Fehlauer","reviewerName":"tdl","summary":"A fusion of creativity and technology","reviewText":"Sega Dreamcast isn't state-of-the-art anymore, but this was the foundation of our modern game consoles. It introduced complex online gaming. It showed what a 3D game could really look like. And, most important of all, it was fun and creative. Although it lasted less then a year (thanks to stupid ugly Sony and their clunky uncreative Playstation 2) in North America, it got a lot of crazy games onto the market. Sonic Adventure is a great game that set the base of who Sonic would be in the modern era. Yet this time Sega didn't stop at Sonic. Crazy Taxi, Jet Grind Radio, Chu Chu Rocket, and a ton of sports games and RPGs all made the Dreamcast the place for creativity. Not only that, Dreamcast introduced the VMU, a Gameboy-style memory card with a monochrome screen that displayed game information and occasionally even let you play games on it.In conclusion, while Dreamcast was short lived (in America anyway) it introduced a lot of concepts used in todays console and has a lot of fun games. They are more durable then a Playstation 2, but not quite as durable as Gamecube, and they occasionally have a problem where they don't read discs (but I think it is fixable). Durability aside, it is a great console that Sega put their heart into making.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2013"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"Mindless fodder at its best","reviewText":"F.E.A.R 2 has done it right.

There's pretty much two kinds of them: the realistic military type (Counterstrike, Ghost Recon, Operation Flashpoint) and the sci-fi type (Unreal, Alien vs. Predator, System Shock). In all this, there's not much room for improvement and things are getting a bit repetitive- all you do is go in and kill everything that moves, and solve (or cheat) your way past the occasional puzzle that primarily exists to justify putting a longer gameplay figure on the box. Looking at most new titles, the only really interesting thing is even more detailed graphics and effects, which- by the way- mean you need a new PC.Enter No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy in HARM's Way. This excellent shooter and sequel to an excellent shooter is the type that will save the genre. Here's why:System requirements: You don't need a new PC to run this game, but this doesn't mean it looks like the original Doom. More on that later.Gameplay: There are some puzzles, but they aren't annoying or counterintuitive. It is possible to get past some levels without killing anyone. Curiosity and inventiveness pay off here, but if you can't do that, you can usually just go in with guns blazing.Something new: The game has some nice additions from the original NOLF. Most significant of these are skills. Completing primary and secondary objectives and finding intelligence items gives you points, which you can invest in 8 different skills that all have a significant impact on gameplay. Additionally, there are new and cool gadgets to play with. Many of them auto-activate when necessary, which disposes of the annoyance of having to switch over to use them. HARM also has some new hires and allies, including French mimes (no, I didn't make that up). Do you need any other reason to play?Story: This is what really makes the game fun. The voice acting and cutscenes (all done with the game engine) are superb, and really draw you into the plot. As you might guess from the title, the usual suspects are up to no good once again. It's a tossup as to whether this is more of a James Bond or Austin Powers kind of script, but whatever it is, it's a good one.AI: The NOLF AI is smart- as good as any other game I've seen. They take cover behind objects, go prone, roll out of the way of grenades, and seek you out if you make noise. The AI characters also act like real people. If you pick one of them off with a silenced weapon, they'll be confused for a second and then load their guns and start looking around. If you can see them, they can see you, and given enough time they definitely will.Replayability: Due to the detail of the levels, it's unlikely you'll find everything there is to find on one pass. Also, the AI behaves in a random enough fashion that every time you play an area the outcome could be very different (if you don't believe me, just try reloading a save). Also, you don't have enough skill points to advance to the max in every area. Playing again with a different set of skills is quite fun. For example, try going all-out stealth and health instead of firepower and attempt to sneak your way through places you blasted by earlier. It's arguably more exciting trying this!Graphics and sound: This is the first game I've seen that models expressions believably. The Jupiter engine has the look and feel of something that would require a cutting-edge machine to run, but goes smoothly on an average computer. It is, quite simply, astonishing. There's a huge amount of interaction with the environment, and things have an almost movie-like appearance. The characters are especially a pleasure to see, due to the attention to detail. Ms. Archer in particular has had a gorgeous makeover- she is arguably the hottest woman in any game to date, even including live motion actresses. Oh, and by the way, the soundtrack is killer.Multiplayer: The version of the game that shipped did not have significant multiplay support. This has been remedied. Updating to the latest version gives you deathmatch, team deathmatch, cooperative, and assault game modes. Additionally, there are plenty of maps out now. The only thing missing here is bots, which is a bit of a pity considering how good the AI is. I'm sure someone will think to add those later.If this isn't enough to convince you, the setting is just plain cool. This is the 60's, folks, complete with President Johnson, neon colored clothing, retro-tech spygear, and even a bellicose American general. The characters that populate this world have true depth and, more often than not, are good for some great laughs. Lastly, this game is probably the best deal you'll ever see at such a low price. Don't miss out- grab NOLF 2 while you can.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2003"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide.

As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents.

I am not a big fan of the old West.  I'm not even a big fan of sandbox games, though there are a few worth their salt (inFamous especially).  When I heard about Rockstar's new open world game being set in the old West, I was skeptical.  All the previous old West games seemed to get lackluster responses (Call of Juarez, Red Dead Revolver come to mind), so I didn't think much of this offering.  After numerous publications praised this title, I decided to give it a try.  From the opening cinematic, I could tell this game was going to be something special.Pretty much everything about this game is stellar.  From the graphics to the game mechanics, Red Dead Redemption excells.  It is a gorgeous game to behold.  Huge vistas abound.  Incredible detail everywhere.  Dynamic lighting, particle effects, and object interaction are done so well.  The images are crisp and clear (with occasional pop-in, but not a deal breaker).  I just love standing around and marveling at this incredible world that is practically painted on the screen.  Movement on foot or horseback seems natural and intuitive.  Driving a stagecoach is a thrill.  Aiming your weapon (with aim assist on or off) works well.  Nothing seems overly wonky.The characters are definitely what drive this game.  Unlike some other open world, sandbox games (cough..GTA IV...cough), you actually care about these characters.  I found myself constantly drawn into the conversations, eagerly awaiting the next tidbit of info.  The array of characters is vast, more than any other game I've played.  You're simply never going to get bored.  Plus, you've got a lead character who is fighting the eternal fight (good vs evil) within himself.  That is always intriguing.Other reviewers have argued that the 360 version has a slight graphical advantage over the PS3 version.  I haven't compared the two, but I'm very satisfied with the 360 version.  Other reviewers have also complained about the glitchy multiplayer component, but I haven't encountered any issues with that either.  My total gameplaying experience has been flawless.Every once in a while, a game comes along that transcends the genre.  I think this might be one of those games (and I don't say that lightly).  Even if you're not a big fan of the wild West, there is enough to do in this game that you might forget the setting.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2010"}

Reining \"Old School Zinger\"","summary":"As games get more complex, so reviewing them does too.","reviewText":"Caught in the wave of how amazing I thought the ending was in this game, it would be easy for me to give this game five stars.However, taking a couple steps back I remember the things that really had me taking breaks in between starting and finishing this game. So let's get it out of the way, the bad first: The story. Really I can't point to a game and say well there is a game that handled it really well, because games with concise storytelling are pretty short, and games with a lot of gameplay have overcomplicated plots and many useless missions. This game suffers from the latter. In my mind, a good game should blend getting into the mind of a character with cutting through the BS of pointless filler missions, so you can understand the motives behind why you're doing something without spending hours watching cutscenes (Metal Gear Solid 4).In Red Dead Redemption at least, the story is fairly clear. You are former outlaw John Marston, sent by the government to track down three criminals you used to run with, and if you don't, the \"government\" will make sure you never see your wife and son again. The first real problem I had with this scenario is that the gamer is expected to care about saving the lives of a family you don't see. Without spoiling anything, it would have been nice to see the family interaction at the BEGINNING of the game, so we know what it is we're murdering all these people for.Really the only other complaint I can make is about the NPC's in the game world. They are, most definitely, Rockstar NPC's. And by that I mean they are very quirky and eccentric. I have never really understood this, but after a while of hanging out with cocaine addicts, deputies who are dumb as a brick, and a revolutionary out to bed every woman in a thousand miles, you will yearn for some normalcy to latch on to. The writing is quite good in the game, as in the previous Grand Theft Auto IV, so I would think they can write interesting characters without resorting to making them the extreme ends of the spectrum.So what we are left with is a very good sandbox third person shooting game. Minor annoyances such as having to ride horses long distances to reach objectives or complete missions can get tedious, but this game makes it worth it. Most other games suffer from what I like to call, um, stupidness (Mass Effect 2). Where we meet characters, and witness their death and it is supposed to provide some sort of emotional attachment. And it lacks it for whatever reason. Bad writing (Avatar), bad acting (Avatar), or poor storytelling (See also: Avatar). However, this game does this very well. People whose lives you care about are put in the crosshairs, and you HOPE you are given the chance to save them, because they matter to you. That's one of the most important parts of any storytelling medium, because if the audience can't connect with something, they aren't going to like it very much (Avatar).The weapons system is also a plus for me in this game. I haven't read any other reviews, but I imagine one of the things being complained about is the ability to carry every single weapon you possess at the same time. I'm of the have your cake and eat it too school of thinking (Mass Effect 1), where you can stockpile your weapons and carry as many as you want. It is much simpler (if not realistic), and you don't have to do something annoying like going back to a safehouse just to change your weapon scheme. It was something I didn't expect and was very pleasantly surprised at. The weapons are also varied. As you progress you are given, or given the opportunity to purchase a diverse array of firepower.I could go on and on, but others have and will continue to do so. Games are and always have been overpriced, so if you want to wait for the price to drop, by all means, go for it. But if you are looking for a very good game to occupy about thirty hours of your life, then do not go without playing through this game at least once. The emotions are real, the voice acting is quite good (mostly), and even if there are some character cliches and overt messages in the game (a la western expansionism and the mistreatment of the \"savage\" Native Americans [Avatar]), Red Dead Redemption does a hell of a lot right. And unlike many other stories (Avatar), if you are looking for a happy ending, look elsewhere. Rockstar has started setting the bar high in regards to realism in their story telling and this one is no exception.Use the Mauser at the end. When you get there, you'll know why. You've never wanted to put 16 bullets into one person more.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2010"}

They made the game even more accessible, early advancement more fun and rewarding, and the general gameplay more elegant. However, customization is limited and stunted. The last leg of levels, 81-85, leave you feeling like you're putting in time and gaining levels without growing in power or versatility(-) Too much homogenization between classes, defined by role, has occurred. Class and spec combinations that once felt unique have been altered in a ham fisted way, now functioning in an essentially identical manner to others(-) Cataclysm is short on raiding content. What's present feels uninspired and rushed - many dungeon and raid bosses are copies from past expansions wrapped in new skins/assets(-) Changes to healing mechanics have rendered the role formulaic and rote(-) Despite the smorgasbord of content the \"grind\" (repetitive activities that must be performed ad naseum for reward or advancement) has been ramped up far beyond anything I ever thought I would see in a WoW expansion. This terrible design approach is pervasive, affecting everything from dungeon progression to tradeskill advancement - particularly the new Archeology skill(-) There is a gigantic gulf in difficulty between normal and \"heroic\", or advanced difficulty, dungeons. Many tedious mechanics are introduced, mistakes are far less forgiving, there are too many enemy abilities that kill instantly or nearly instantly, and the time required to complete a single dungeon has been extended from a sensible 20-30 minutes to an hour or longer. It's not uncommon to invest hours in a dungeon only to have the other players give up out of frustration - leading to no one seeing any kind of reward or advancement for their effortsA symptom of the poor heroic dungeon design is an ugly social atmosphere. Players quickly grow short tempered and irate. The sense of gregariousness and community is abandoned, replaced by single minded greed as players squabble over any perceived reward their hours upon hours of grinding might, on some off chance, grant them. It's a terrible and sudden shift that ruins the game and drives players away from a substantial chunk of content.Blizzard keeps introducing changes that exacerbate the issue, rather than alleviating it. And they apparently do so to spite their customers, as feedback has been overwhelmingly negative towards all of their recent developments. As a result the heroic and raiding community has sharply declined since the launch of Cataclysm. It has been distilled down to small, unsavory cliques of elitist and socially awkward players - the kind that, prior to WoW, could only have been found in the darkest corners of the grindiest and most unfun MMOs of 2000-2003.--- Conclusion ---Cataclysm is a lot of fun for new players and those looking to experience the rebuilt world of Azeroth. Blizzard has shown that modern game design and techniques can work in MMORPGs. It's worth the cover price for the hours of quality gaming it provides to new and old players alike.However, the wheels come off as you approach \"the end game\". The game transforms into a soul-sucking trial of banality and tediousness - seemingly designed with cold and uncaring calculation to make players unhappy and question their enjoyment of the genre as a whole.World of Warcraft came along in 2004 and dragged this genre out of relative obscurity, leading to hundred million dollar MMO budgets and prime time advertising campaigns. So it's ironic that here, in its twilight, Blizzard has abandoned the casual players that made it a success and transformed WoW into a ghoulish doppelganger of the MMOs it conquered long ago. Do they intend on courting the types of players that reigned over those archaic fossils of MMO past....and their insignificant subscription tallies? One can only wonder how Blizzard can do so much right in a game, just to turn around and essentially soil their own hard work.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2011"}

After a 10-year break, here is a game that presents the modern city builder with nearly every possible tool one could hope for to build the bustling metropolis of their dreams. It is gorgeous to look at when properly taken advantage of with the latest PC hardware, artfully designed for minimal user interface turmoil, and just exquisitely charming across the board.On the other side is a stricter game than the one franchise fans have come to know over the years, one more dedicated to a single-minded way of cooperative thinking. In this SimCity, a single city cannot survive without another nearby to pick up the slack. Multiplayer is heavily encouraged, to the point of insistence, and yet the safeguards that aim to prevent problematic behavior on the part of others are minimal, and frankly unreliable. Which is to say nothing of its overall, online-always infrastructure, one which has, at times already, hamstrung the entirety of this new SimCity's lush, yet disappointingly underutilized region.You start off with a nice patch of land, but you'll be surprised how quickly that space fills.Understand, SimCity is extremely capable of being the grand reboot of the series it aims to be, at least in spurts. The core act of city-building, which has been using most of the same basic ideas since its inception nearly 25 years ago, has rarely been more elegantly realized. The tools to build with are numerous and overwhelming. Of course you will start out your new city by laying down zones for residential, commercial, and industrial, perhaps by building a couple of city services, plopping down (to use the game's parlance) a power plant, and then a water tower, and then a garbage dump, and it just goes on. Every building option you have comes with option upon option underneathHalf the fun of SimCity is just trying to figure out the best, most efficient ways to build everything. And this SimCity often scratches that itch wonderfully. It even offers tremendous flexibility in the design of your city, both from a geographical standpoint, and in terms of economy. To the former, roads can now be curved, built in circles, perfect blocks, really whatever you like. Roads are upgradable too, so a small avenue can become a large commercial one later on.More interesting are the city specialties, special economic focuses that allow you to build, say, an oil pump or two if your land is rich in fossil fuels. Or perhaps tourism, if your interest pertains to building famous landmarks (some of which can be bought via the game's DLC store). Or, if you just like making money, there's always the gambling route. These specialties provide an extra layer of challenge, in that you kind of have to build your city around them, as opposed to just deciding on them later. Otherwise you'll spend a lot of time bulldozing and rezoning things as you try to figure out how to squeeze an ore mine into a residential neighborhood.There are graphs upon charts upon data screens to play with, all giving ample information on every aspect of how my city is running. It's beautiful stuff, though it's also occasionally bogged down by sloppy data reporting. Often times fixing problems within my city, like sewage outflow issues or power outages, would result in continued displeasure from my citizens for quite some time. This can sometimes make it difficult to judge whether you've actually solved the issue or not.Far more problematic than any of that, however, is really the other half of SimCity. It is the multiplayer, the skeletal structure in which the city building meat of the game has been somewhat awkwardly stuffed into. At the outset of every game, you are asked to pick a region. Right from the get-go, you can choose to join an already existing region, which has been started by another online player, or create your own. Once in a region, you can choose to be the mayor of as many of the city plots as you please, but there are always multiple plots, and to leave a whole region unused puts a burden on your city that the game isn't designed to alleviate through single-player play.Essentially, SimCity doesn't really want you to have one city that has all available services and resources. As with the city specialties, there is significant financial and strategic benefit to having one city that's, say, more apt to house polluting industrial factories, or garbage dumps. Such a city might not have a huge residential population, nor much potential for high land value items, but it can make money by housing jobs that citizens in other cities can commute to, and even by housing other cities' garbage.This cooperation becomes crucial, as there really isn't enough money, nor space to allow one city to bear all the major burdens at once. That last point is a particularly stinging one. Regions are broken up into squared-off city areas within a larger area of land. In between the cities are vast zones of dead space that essentially just exist to make the region look more natural. While it certainly can take a while to fill up an entire plot of land--especially in areas rife with mountains or plateaus--you will eventually fill it up. The game goes out of its way to try and help you build using the most efficient layouts possible, even offering a road guide that shows you ideal places for streets and avenues. But even following the guides stringently, you'll eventually run out of room, leaving you to try and squeeze whatever zoning density you possibly can out of every little corner you own. There is probably a very good technical reason for why you can't use any of that extra land, but it is nonetheless a terrible tease.Yes, it is entirely possible to play SimCity on your own, without any other players, but this is not really ideal. If you're managing multiple cities in a region, that turns an already intense time suck into a more stressful endeavor. I did not enjoy the act of trying to balance multiple cities in a region by myself. Don't get me wrong, I'm generally of the mindset that games like SimCity should be played in tomb-like isolation, but that isn't how this SimCity is meant to be played. It's meant to be played with friends. To try and fight against its multiplayer is to fight against the very nature of this game's design.The thing of it is, if you can get a group of enthusiastic players together, the kind you know won't do dickish things, like polluting your region to death, or harboring scads of murderers in their dilapidated hellhole of a town, SimCity works. As weird and awkward as it seems at first, the more you play it under ideal conditions, the more clear Maxis' vision for this game becomes. It's almost like a kind of social experiment in cooperation, albeit one that is perhaps a bit too open to exploitation. While you can't just go in and wreck anyone's city wholesale, there are smaller, more insidious things players can do to royally screw up someone's region, and don't think there won't be those people. Of course, you can always set your game to private, making sure that only friends and likeminded individuals can join. But if my experience has been any indication, those safeguards aren't terribly reliable right now. I had one early region set to private, and then after a bit of server wonkiness, it had become infested with unfamiliars.The biggest issue that seems to be with EA's servers, and this brings us to the biggest flaw in SimCity's design. SimCity is an always-online game, meaning if the servers are off, everybody's game is off. EA calls SimCity's multiplayer asynchronous, and that's partially correct. There's nothing that requires players to be on at the same time to play. However, we do all have to be able to connect to EA's servers to play. Yes, even if you just want to noodle around in your own city and don't care what's going on in the larger region today, you can't load up your city data if the servers are down. And the servers have been down. Several times, in fact. The underlying principle if everyone can't play, then no one shall play, is a troubling one.It is therefore difficult to completely reconcile a game like SimCity. This is a game with startling clarity of vision, but that vision often feels narrow and intractable. It knows precisely what it wants to be, and in most key ways, executes on those ideas with precision. But in setting that course, it all but dismisses the way in which many played SimCity sequel after sequel. The game feels more like a really thoughtfully designed multiplayer mode for a larger, single-player capable game that, sadly, doesn't exist.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2013"}

Without question, the newest Smackdown is far superior to the old PSX game.  From all that I have heard, this is also miles beyond Smackdown: Just Bring It (PS2).  The graphics are perhaps the most realistic wrestling graphics that I've seen.  While the characters do not look exactly like their real life counterparts, they do like remarkably alike.  The gameplay is still solid and is very easy to pick up on.The biggest drawback to the Smackdown series has been the storyline mode.  This is where you are supposed to play through a career and unlock extras.  In past games, the storyline mode has been almost non-existent, and extremely poorly thought out.  This time the storyline mode works, and is fairly interesting, and follows fairly logical paths that can be changed depending on your decisions.  The season begins with the roster split between RAW and Smackdown, and we see the fued between Vince McMahon and Ric Flair.  Steve Austin returns, the NWO invades, HHH and Shawn Michaels return (HBK twice in my season, oddly enough).  These are some of the major events that you will play through, but your own season will have plenty of smaller things affecting how the storyline goes.  While not perfect, it is a vast improvement over previous years.  Loading times have also been improved.This isn't the perfect wrestling game, but Smackdown: Shut Your Mouth has an awful lot going for it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2003"}

Players can earn up to 20 weapons (including online and offline) with up to four levels of upgrades for most weapons, plus new high-tech gadgets to help them through their journey.After word spreads of Ratchet and Clank's recent conquest inRatchet & Clank: Going Commando, Clank finds himself recognized as an interstellar robot of mystery and intrigue after starring in his own television series, Secret Agent Clank. While Ratchet is dismayed by his new sidekick status, the feelings are put aside when the twosome is called together by the Galactic President to bring peace to the universe. They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise. This includes Helga, the robotic seductress; Big Al, a techno-geek with the ability to encrypt technology systems; and Skidd McMarxx, a former hoverboarding champ and pro slacker turned spy. Together with the Q-Force, Ratchet and Clank set off on another hilarious interstellar romp to uncover the schemes of the sinister Dr. Nefarious and keep the galaxy safe for organic life.The Starship Phoenix, headquarters for the Q-Force, is the flagship in the fight against Dr. Nefarious and serves as a key information hub. The Starship is also where players can expect to receive new missions and training, and purchase armor and weapons. In addition, players will gain access to new vehicles, like the Turbo Slider or Hovership, to compete in races and combat enemies in intense battlefield missions. Refined intuitive enemy artificial intelligence means non-playable characters behave more intelligently by gathering information about their environments and forthcoming attacks, ultimately providing the player with more challenging gameplay.The multiplayer gameplay featured inRatchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenalis naturally suited for both the offline and online universe because it includes the variety of weapons, gadgets, vehicles and gameplay made famous throughout the Ratchet & Clank franchise. For those who want to experience the split screen multiplayer capabilities, up to four players can play offline, while the multiplayer online mode accommodates up to eight players over a broadband connection. In addition, six new levels are introduced for online play, featuring several elements that encourage team-based activities in modes such as capturing an enemy's base. For example, destructible environment obstacles in battlefield environments create strategic gameplay decisions and general mayhem. Commandeering multiple vehicles further encourages strategic co-op gameplay by allowing players to work together as one person navigates the vehicle while the other works its weapon's arsenal.In order to promote community gameplay, voice communication is supported online via the USB headset (for PlayStation2), allowing players to communicate with fellow team members during online games, either in-game or in the main lobby. The lobby area features an online friends list, allowing players to be matched up based on their gameplay statistics and will offer the ability to select from a variety of player skins.","reviewerName":"blackaciddevil","summary":"Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal.....","reviewText":"You know; it never ceases to amaze me how, with each Ratchet and Clank game, Developer Insomniac keeps things fresh and new while keeping the core gameplay like that of the original. I don't know how they do it but they do and that's what keeps fans coming back for more. Sadly, I'm afraid, this is the last game in the series(or so I've read). If that is, indeed, the case..then the series is going out with a 'bang'(pardon the pun but I had to do it). How?,you might ask. Well, for starters, they've tweaked the game in subtle ways (like the weapons command shortcut which lets you cycle through the last three weapons used, with no problem). You can earn up to 20 weapons, with four levels of upgrades for most weapons. There's new gadgets to tinker with, new worlds to explore, new enemies to fight. The minigames are a blast to play(especially Qwark's 2-D missions on the VG-9000 game system aboard the Phoenix). Yet, what makes this game shine the most is its' online/offline multiplayer mode.  The third installment incorporates new elements of gameplay not seen previously in the series and I more than welcome that. Ratchet and Clank set off on another hilarious interstellar romp to keep the galaxy safe from the likes of characters like Dr. Nefarious. With its' unique and oddball humor, you can't help but love this game. It's one I recommend.If I had any gripe, whatsoever; it'd be that, to series vets like me, the single player game is way too short. Yet, if you play through and get every last weapon/gadget/etc, you're looking at 20+ hours or more. That gripe, like all my gripes mostly, doesn't take away from an otherwise kickin' game.I hope this isn't the last we see of ol' Ratchet and Clank or the lovable cast of characters we've come to know and love.

When the price went down 10.00 i figured why not? I wasn't disapointed and really have no idea what these people are wining about. No it is not Fallout 3 and it is not meant to be. The way I see it it is a sort of mix between the Fear FPS games, Resident Evil and Bioshock, three of my favorite series. The atmosphere is dark and bleak, but for some reason I did not find it depressing, just atmospheric in the way Bioshock was atmospheric. This is a world hanging on the brink and the developers really captured that feeling well.Honestly I'm glad you don't have to interact with every NPC and go on fetch quests. This game is about surviving in extreme conditions and being smart with the way you use ammo and fight the enemies. The graphics are really top notch, some of the best FPS graphics I have seen thus far on 360 and right up there with Modern Warfare etc. Granted it's completely different as you are underground most of the time, but I really dug the graphical style as well as the sound. If you have 5.1 you are in for a treat, as this is one of the better uses of 5.1 I have seen on the 360, sort of like Dead Space. So all in all a great purchase and the campaign lasted me around 14 hours the first time through on normal. I will def be going back to try it again on hard, which is a sign I won't be selling this to EB anytime soon. So give it a chance if you like the genre, there really isn't anything else on the horizon and it will tide you over until some of the other big releases hit.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2010"}

The Year of the Fighter has started off with a big bang with the home release of Sega's Virtua Fighter 4.  With a new Mortal Kombat game on the horizon, not to mention Tekken 4 and Soul Calibur 2, fighting fans have a lot to look forward to in 2002.  However, the race may already be over - VF4's competitors have a gigantic mountain to climb.Graphically, VF4 is a masterpiece.  You won't see any multi-tiered environments a la DOA or flashy effects like Soul Calibur.  The Virtua Fighter series has always been grounded in reality, and the newest incarnation is the most realistic fighter yet.  The characters are modelled with compelling accuracy and astounding, lifelike animation (no fireball casting here) - clothing wraps around limbs, flaps in the wind, and flows with breathtaking movement.  The arenas are spectacular creations: Pai fights in an underwater aquarium with sea life swimming outside its glass walls, and Jacky battles on the roof of a skyscraper with several circling helicopters creating some amazing lighting effects.  You might find sand or snow underfoot, or be knee-deep in water.  You'll be in a cage surrounded by a shouting crowd.  You'll see leaves softly falling, or birds overhead.  These are perfect places in which to battle.  Most of the arenas contain incredible animation, and although they don't really affect the gameplay, they make the fights that much more involving.  Walls can be broken in some places, and ring-outs happen, but not as often as in Soul Calibur.  The dreaded PS2 &quot;jaggies&quot; are present, but they're only noticeable if you're looking for them.  The combination of realistic fighter animation and beautiful environments make VF4 the current best-looking home fighter.As amazing as it looks, however, the gameplay of VF4 is what vaults it into Soul Calibur territory.  The controls consist of three buttons: punch, kick, and guard; and the d-pad.  That's it.  The PS2 controller allows you to map button combinations to a single key (i.e. P+K+G = R2) if you so desire, which can make pulling off more complicated moves easier for beginners.  Each character has literally hundreds of individual moves at his or her disposal; throws, reversals, rising attacks, combos, etc.  There are only 13 fighters, but they are all perfectly balanced, and each is very different from the other.  Lei-Fei is a Chinese monk who features several stances; Kage is a ninja who sports airborne throws; Lion uses Mantis Fist style; Wolf is a pro wrestler.  Button mashing won't get you far against a VF master or the higher difficulty CPU settings.  You're required to explore your fighter's capabilities, using strategy for victory.  It may seem overwhelming at first, but the game's perfect control makes maneuvering your fighter second nature after a few matches.  The Virtua Fighter system is deceptively simple, and as you get used to the timing of a side-step followed by a vicious counterattack, a perfect reversal of an incoming combo, and throwing, you'll discover how much attention Sega paid to it.  Unlike past VF games, beginners can get the jist pretty quickly, but the artistry of the fighting engine becomes more apparent over time, and rewards the patient.VF4 features several modes.  Arcade mode pits you against all 13 fighters with progressing AI difficulty, and Vs. is for multiplayer.  Pretty standard stuff, although there's nothing quite like a human vs. human VF match.  Its replayability is infinite, and it works best when the two combatants are of relatively equal skill levels, making fights a match of wits as much a match of reflexes.One new addition is Kumite Mode, a tournament of sorts.  Pick a character, and fight an unending stream of CPU opponents, progressing in rank along the way.  The better you do, the harder the enemies.  Perform well, and you unlock customizable items like sunglasses, jewelry, and headgear.  It's like a souped-up Survival Mode, and is highly addicting.  You can eventually take each fighter through the entire Kumite Mode - a daunting task that will take many, many hours to complete.  The higher difficulty levels are brutal, and require mastery of your character.Training Mode is a fantastic creation.  It's split into three sections, one of which allows you to practice combos to get your timing down.  The second lets you practice against a CPU dummy, which can be set at several difficulty levels.  You can even program the dummy to perform a specific combo to practice countering or evasive tactics.  The third section contains different challenges that teach you the basics of the VF universe.  This mode is highly recommended for beginners, as it teaches the skills necessary for success.  It also gives you a glimpse at how deep and refined the VF engine is, like peeling back a layer to find many more underneath.AI Mode allows you to train a &quot;blank slate&quot; fighter yourself, and set it lose against your friends or even in Kumite Mode.  It's a novel idea, but isn't quite as compelling as the other modes.  Still fun to play around with, though.Virtua Fighter is a more involved, strategic game than, say, the Marvel vs. Capcom series.  It relies on technique rather than flash, in both gameplay and visuals.  It's been made more accessible for newcomers (after all, this is the first time a VF game has appeared on a non-Sega console), but still retains the complexity of previous installments.  VF4 is a labor of love.  In comparison to Soul Calibur, the extras and flashiness of SC are balanced out by VF's incredible fighting system and Kumite Mode.  Some may argue that DOA3 is prettier, but Tecmo's series doesn't come close to the sim aspects of Virtua Fighter.  Sega has drawn first blood in Year of the Fighter, and it currently sits beside Soul Calibur as the best fighting game available.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2002"}

This game tries to be for the ATV / Dirt crowd what the venerable (and sorely missed) SSX series was for snowboarding and skiing: an over-the-top, customizable experience which thrills with speed and combos galore.At first I really enjoyed this game.  The graphics are gorgeous, especially the landscapes.  The amount of customization you can do to your ATV is crazy deep, down to the color of bolts and part that you CAN'T ACTUALLY SEE in-game.  The problem comes from the fact that the game modes are quite repetitive, in spite of the gorgeous graphics and the ungodly amount of unlockables.  The race mechanics follow a few cliched formulas: do tricks to earn boost (*yawn*), or sprint around a really short track for 5 laps.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  There is no fighting, something seen the excellent SSX games and the dearly departed Road Rash games.  The tracks are cool, but after a while, this game really lost me.  It's not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination, and some folks will likely LOVE this.

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.PlayStation Network support including PlayStation Trophies.","reviewerName":"Frank Rodriguez","summary":"decent","reviewText":"this game was pretty decent overall.some clipping issues, no lag for me with one playthrough. 8-10 hr campaign. similiar to bioshock, but still worth a playthrough.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2014"}

I didn't really enjoy this game much either.It's huge and has a ton of quests, the vast majority being optional. However I found the majority of the quests, and I did them nearly all of them, to be boring and tedious. It's mostly fetch this or kill that. Vary few of the quests have any kind of an intriguing storyline. The monsters or foes are many but they are very repetitive and simply tougher and slightly different versions of each other.There is very little significant NPC interaction, and the graphics of people are repetitive and somewhat cartoonish. There is very little choice on how you complete quests. You can ride a steed, but you cannot fight while on one, and they wander off once you get off them. Also get your skill up and you can move as fast or faster on foot.The map is huge and there's plenty to find, but you can spend hours playing this game and accomplish nothing.You have to design your character well at the beginning, based on the skills you will use or you will never level up. This is hard, because you do not know, if you are new to the game, what skills you are going to be using.The combat is largely hack and slash with no real difference between weapons. The weapons and armor are largely repetitive and just different versions of each other.There are a number of special items to acquire. Unfortunately some of them are really difficult and not worth the trouble versus what you get. Also some of the best weapons and armor in the game can be had rather early, which makes acquiring new stuff rather pointless.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2008"}
{"product_name":"Logitech G600 MMO Gaming Mouse, White","description":"","reviewerName":"Pecos Bill","summary":"G600 vs Razer Naga","reviewText":"The question on your mind: Logitech G600 vs Razer Naga.I've used both a fair amount and have to say G600, mainly for 1 feature which will seem really awkward at first but is quite nice once you get used to it: the extra button on top.Typical hand configuration: index on left-mouse, middle finger on right-mouse, ring and pinky fingers steer the mouse.  With the G600, there's an extra button on the right side where your ring finger will rest and while it's pretty awkward at first, once you get used to it, it's a great use of a previously idle finger.  By default it acts as a special key, similar to \"shift\", which lets you get double function out of the mouse buttons -- so your thumb buttons can be F1-F12 normally or 1-0 while holding the extra mouse button.  I don't need THAT many buttons though so I mapped it to \"mouse 4\" and use that as push-to-talk in Teamspeak.So for me the extra button on the ring finger answered the age old question of \"where do I put my push to talk key?\"  You would like it to be somewhere that doesn't interfere with your normal button pushing during gameplay and the ring finger button does that nicely.  You just have to get used to steering your mouse with your pinky finger.The thumb buttons are actually really awkward -- same for the Razer Naga.  No matter how much I use these mice I find it awkward to use the more than the first few buttons there.  I dunno, maybe it would come in time if I forced myself to use them, so I'm tentatively keeping my review at 5 stars on the notion that \"It's not you, G600, it's me.\"  I do like the side buttons, I just can never figure a way to use more than a few of them in which case I could have just kept using my older Logitech mouse.Anyway, I also pick the G600 over the Razer partially because I'm apparently turning into a Logitech fanboy.  I had the Razer Nostromo keypad but switched to the Logitech G13 because it has more keys.  I also have the Logitech G35 headset.  The \"Logitech Gaming Software\" integrates all 3 devices under one roof, which is really nice (older Logitech mice had their own separate software but the G600 is incorporated into the Gaming Software app, letting you configure all of these devices in one shiny interface).As usual, the Gaming Software makes it easy to rebind all of those mouse keys to be whatever you want -- or at least, you can bind them all to a keystroke.  For whatever reason, you cannot create macros for these buttons as you can for the G13 keypad, although as far as I know no other mouse out there supports macro buttons either, and I don't have a use for it anyway since I can just use the G13 for macros.Anyway, good mouse, lotta buttons, expect to spend serious time getting used to it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000085AHJ","description":"In the open-ended space action/adventure gameFreelanceryou play a ne'er-do-well with a lucky streak, one of two survivors of a space disaster. Penniless and shipless, you venture around a space dock until you find a ship and a job. You'll encounter a heady mix of canned missions that follow one main quest, and a million opportunities to make money or aggravate the various factions that co-exist in the universe. Like an online role-playing game, or Bethesda'sMorrowind, you determine who your enemies are and who your friends are by your own actions, and, in another nod to role-playing, you can customize your ship with guns, rockets, and equipment just as you would customize a RPG character with swords, bows, and magic items. Best of all, you can play cooperatively with friends or fight it out with enemies online.The backstory posits a future where various countries, divided by both nationality and, seemingly, race, have boarded massive colony ships and ventured into a wormhole that appeared within reach of our crude space technology. They found themselves in a galaxy far, far away and they got stuck there when the wormhole collapsed. They quickly colonized new home worlds and named everything with familiar locales that make navigation a breeze. In the American sectors you'll feel at home entering the New York system and landing at a spaceport called Manhattan, for example. While contrived, this device is used beautifully and it's far better than having to memorize a bunch of sci-fi names and remembering where they are, perfect for a massive universe such as this one.ThoughFreelanceris set in space, it is technically not a space simulation. The game was designed to be accessible to casual gamers. For example,Freelancermakes you use the mouse for ship control. This is quite a shift for a game genre normally known to require joystick control. But even old-schoolWing CommanderorX-Wingfans may find that the sacrifice of verisimilitude is made up for with gains in agility. The mouse controls your guns, while you use the keyboard to maneuver around the rich universe that developer Digital Anvil has constructed. Much like a first-person shooter, you can dodge and weave while precisely blasting your enemies.Despite the game's age, its graphics are spectacular, as is the sound and voice acting, and in that way, fighting and trading with friends or alone,Freelancerproves worth the wait. Just keep in mind that it is explicitly not a hardcore space simulation, and you'll have to leave your joystick on the shelf.--Andrew S.

In his dreams, happenstance encounters with a young girl facing a terrible destiny and the boy who will fight to save her, leads to Chopin's discovery of the light that shines in each of us in this enduring tale of good and evil, love and betrayal. With gorgeous next gen visuals and style, a unique battle system, and a captivating story, Eternal Sonata promises to give Xbox 360 fans the RPG they've been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"A Masterpiece Gone Awry!","reviewText":"Eternal Sonata is a Japanese RPG set in the fantasy world of Fredrick Chopin's Last Dream before he died.  Parts of the game are amazing, and other parts seem to exist only to ruin the amazing parts.  This game will astound J-RPG'ers who can overlook the SUPER-cutsey characters, bad voice acting, and mediocre gameplay.  For others, the negatives will probably be too distracting for them to enjoy the game.Art 10+/10!!!The art style is beautifully surreal and if you like anime style art, this could be one of the best games you'll see.  Both the characters and environments are colorfully rendered to create the perfect fantasy setting.Sound 8/10The music is great, especially if you love Chopin or pianos in general.  The atmospheric sounds are serene, and the battle sounds are ok.Story 6/10The story takes place in Chopin's Last Dream.  In his dream, he visits a fantasy world where terminally ill children have magical powers.  There are cities, beaches, forests, castles...  The concept is truly amazing!  However, the execution is not.  The story is told through slow paced cutscenes where there is a close-up shot of a character.  He or she says the line, there is a 2-3 second pause, and they switch to a close-up of the next character...  Repeat.  After a while, the pacing and direction of the cutscenes really starts to get annoying.  This is something that you'll have to overlook if you want to enjoy the game.Writing and Acting 5/10The concept behind the game is great, but the lines of dialogue are sub-par.  One of the main characters shouts, \"Did I make your eyes spin?\" in just about every battle.  Polka (girl) says sorry for just about everything.  In Japanese, it is polite to say sumimasen, meaning 'I beg your pardon or even a subtle thank you.  In English, it translates into \"Sorry.\"  So Polka, being polite, says, \"I'm sorry.\" for just about everything, attacking, healing, using an item...  It gets on your nerves after a while.  Some of the main characters are voice acted well.  Frederick and Salsa are good, while Beat sounds like a 4 year old with a stuffy nose.  If you can overlook these things and focus on the beauty of the art and the concept of the story, you'll be ok.Gameplay  7/10The concept is great, but again, the execution is flawed.  The game combines turn based gameplay with action.  When it is your turn, you get a few seconds to move your character and attack.  Lighted spots on the battle field allow you to cast 'light magic spells' and if you stand in the shade, you can cast dark spells.  So, you'll move and try to get off as many attacks as you can.The problem is that almost every battle is 3 on 3 or 3 on 1.  There isn't enough variety and the combat gameplay starts to feel stale after a while.  If your levels are high enough, the battles are really easy, but if your levels are too low, you get destroyed.  Because the encounters are so limited, you really don't get a chance to employ sophisticated tactics.The Ending ??/10I won't spoil the ending for you, but if you didn't buy into the story, you will hate the nearly hour long ending of the game.  It will seem like you dropped LSD and watched Baby Geniuses.  However, if you were able to stick with the story and not let the execution ruin the beauty of this game, you may love the ending.  It's heavy handed, but its heart is in the right place.Overall, the game is about 50 hours long.  It is Rated T because of the fantasy battles and its serious take on death.If you're a Hardcore fan of Japanese RPG's, Fantasy, or you can appreciate a beautiful art style, buy this game.If you like your RPG's with Tough Characters, Real Time Action, Good Acting, Deep Strategy, or if the things I mentioned above would drive you nuts, you can safely avoid this game.I would recommend the demo for everybody.  The art and concept are too good to pass up.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

The good thing about the Gamecube is the loading times (especially on Mario Kart). There are 4 controller ports, it's small and even the discs are tiny. The only problem is that you can't listen to music or watch DVD's. But it actually makes sense, because it's called \"Gamecube\", meaning only for games. So far I only own 4 games (Spiderman 2, Zelda Wind Waker, NFSU2 and Mario Kart Double Dash) and that's mainly because I own a XBox and PS2 and I play mostly M rated games. The controller is all right but the PS2 is still better (in my opinion).Overall, this is a system for kids, mainly because of Pokemon and Mario.

{"product_name":"B003H0CBT8","description":"","reviewerName":"Dan Leithauser","summary":"Its getting warmer...","reviewText":"Bulletstorm is a first person sci-fi shooter set on another planet.  It is linear, no open sand box here.  The graphics, while based on an older unreal engine, are spectacular and you may find yourself taking a break and just looking around at the scenery.  I found the game very fun, with some rehashing of classics like Doom.  While the sounds and overall action was familiar, the toys that gamers think up make it all worth while.  Early on you get an electronic leash.  The one they have been showing on the TV ads.  It allows you to pull things toward you, or toss them in another direction.  The fun is in shooting at those (now) slower moving targets or throwing them into a some obstacle that will kill them.  Same thing with kicking things... old concept, but here, not only can you kick things away, but where you kick them is important... like off a cliff.Bulletstorm seemed fresher than it is to me because of the weaponry, and the variety of ways you can get through a level. Lots of ways to have fun depending on what you have decided to collect, use, and upgrade.  It is also fun for the variety of potty mouth dialog you get from your partners, and the bad guy general.  Rated NC-17!  The cutaways are fun, add to the story, and graphically rich -- giving you a break from all the killing.  The reward punishment cycles are just about perfect, especially with getting the \"leash\" early on, lots of dropped ammo, and points for skill shots.You can buy ammo and upgrades for everything you collect in well placed and frequent buy stations throughout the game.  I have two bits of advice. One, it is not super clear at the beginning that you get points for shooting the annoying little news-bots that litter the game.... shoot them.  Two, buy the leash upgrade as soon as you can... it is great fun when you can use it.  As for a minor glitch, during a boss battle, I wanted to die to start over, and I ran right into the boss and let it pummel me.  I would NOT die.  Then I ran into the electrical system I was trying to kick him into.. and normally that would have killed me... it did not. It was fun looking at things from this electrical point of view but I simply could not die, and so I completed my task another way and in the way you were supposed to...  When I started over, the same glitch was not easily found... but it was fun while it lasted.As for running, once I got through the Windows Live bits, the game started up perfectly every time... I am not going to complain about it, because despite the things that you need to do every time you visit WL, when I could not solve my problem and I called them directly... I got an answer by someone who spoke perfect English on the second ring and who understood my connection problems.  Things were up and running in less than 3 minutes.  My relatively new Asus G53JW - SSD laptop, running an Nvidia GTX 460M graphics card, wanted to max out the setting for Bulletstorm.  I let it, and observed some slow-downs and shut downs during the game.  A search for this problem on a notebook forum revealed there were problems with graphic intensive games and running an external monitor on this laptop with an older driver set.  Upgrading the driver to a current (V270) one fixed all problems.I cannot say that Bulletstorm warrants more than a couple of play-throughs, and it is pretty short for a game that costs $50+ (about 12 hours for me without really trying to beat any records)... hence 4 stars rather then 5.

However, this game is still very good and will hold over GTA fans until IV comes out later this year. If you enjoy playing GTA, chances are you will enjoy this game, especially where this franchise made some significant improvements. If you didn't like GTA games and are offended with overt violence, strong language, and direct sexual references, then steer away from this game. Here are the pros, cons, and \"washes\" as they compare to GTA:Pros:Better graphicsBetter sound effects of cars and weaponsCars are coolerSuperior implementation of the map functionality.Save system is improved, but I can not understand in today's day and age of gaming why RPG-action games like this don't have a \"save-at-any-time\" functionality or at least provide reasonable interim mission save points - which this game did not.Ability to save up to 70 cars in your garageInsurance Fraud missions are arguably the most enjoyable missions ever envisioned for a sandbox game.Some other missions that were direct rip-offs from GTA are arguably more fun like the pimp missions, hijacking, and hit-man.Cons:There is no mistaking that overall feeling of an awesome atmosphere you get in any GTA game that just wasn't present in this title. I can't put my finger on it, but you will see what I mean if you get to experience this game vs. any GTA game.Story was a little better in San AndreasNo planes, boats, motorcycles, helicopters, or bicycles.Voice acting is superior in GTA San Andreas. With that said, there was just way too much cursing. Cursing in any game or movie is good for adult entertainment when it is appropriate for the setting. This title just went way over the top on the cursing and was mostly out of place.Music selection is superior in San Andreas in both amount and quality.Washes - neither better or worse than GTA:Open world sandbox environment enabling diverse ways to execute missionsDriving mechanics of the carsDespite popular opinion, weapons functionality, though different, have about the same difficulty/ease factor.Map size and mission amount/scope is more epic in San Andreas, but this title is probably a little bigger that GTA III and possibly Vice City.

LOL!  (by Laura)","reviewText":"LOL means \"Laugh out loud\" to those who don't know internet terms well; and this game caused me to do so... a lot!  I had just finished commenting on another Crash game when I remembered fondly of this one.  I haven't played with it in ages (I completed it a long time ago) but it's still a great game nevertheless.  I was attracted to it by it's comedy; I love games where the villain gets a taste of his own medicine!  It's true, Cortex suffers quite a bit this time around: you can throw him at enemies (when Crash and Cortex are together), use him as a skate/snowboard, get into rolling brawls with him, or just listen to him scream as bees and other annoyances chase him.  It's not all about Crash and Cortex together, though; sometimes you control Cortex alone, as you blast obstacles with his gun (becareful, though; running out of ammo makes him defenseless and cowardly).  Other times you control Crash alone in an old school style.  Other times still, you can control my favorite female villain, and Cortex's evil animal-loving niece, Nina.  However, you don't see hardly any of Coco other than a few cameo appearances.  The game can be difficult (it took me a couple of weeks to complete it) and you feel kind of cheated when you do complete it (all you get for 100% completion is a two minute clip) but it's still worth it.  This game is strictly for comedy; it makes a mockery of almost every character in Crash's universe.  It does compromise other gameplay elements, but, to me, it's worth buying and playing just for the laughs!  The music's good; it's old fashioned, but there's nothing wrong with that.

While Size Matters has some limitations - it is on the PSP after all, and not on the PS2 or PS3 - they do an admirable job of making it work on the smaller system.It really helps to have played the original Ratchet and Clank games before you start this one. Many of the characters are from the other games, and you understand all of their relationships and backgrounds. Also, they sort of throw you into the game, assuming you'll understand how the multiple weapons, jumping, aiming and so forth is going to work.On the other hand, people who have become addicted to the PS2 games (like I have) will quickly realize the \"flaws\" in the PSP version. That's not to say the game makers didn't try their very best to make the PSP version fun - it's just that the PS2 has a much bigger controller with many more buttons. They had to cut corners in order to provide the same gameplay on the PSP. It sort of works. The camera controls get really annoying at times, and many of the key combinations are quite awkward until you get the hang of them.You could say \"they should have just made this for the PS2 or PS3!\" Still, I give them credit for trying to give us something we could carry around with us and still have the same Ratchet & Clank fun while on the bus or waiting in line.That being said, if this WAS intended to be a \"fill in waiting times\" PSP game, they should have made the levels shorter - or done a better job with checkpoints / saves. The way it stands now, if you get 99% through a level, you start it all over again. It can get pretty annoying.I love the Ratchet & Clank dialogue, but I found the mixing to be bad. Several people in my home complained about the inane repetitive music, but I had to have it up loud in order to hear the dialogue. If I turned down the volume, the voices were no longer distinguishable.Also, I'd have liked the game in general to have lasted longer. It seemed to be a weekend game, one I could rent on a Friday and return on a Monday. That was definitely never true for the PS2 games!Fun to play, and a great attempt, but I'd really like the developers to focus on the PS2 and PS3 for their next release.

Its just an wow clone skinned with lotr theme. The graphics are gorgeous but thats pretty much the positive aspect to me. The game has really small number of run-of-the-mill classes aka Captain=Paladin, Champ=berserker, Guardian=defensive warrior, Burgular=Assasin or rogue, Minsterl=Priest and one supposedly caster class=Lore-master. The melee fight system is rather slow for my tastes as the required chain attackes depends too much on other skills cooldowns etc and the caster class is more of a control/debuff than dps. The character creation is profoundly limited and the armor etc looks very similar on everyone. You will get to see lots of clones running around every day.The world in general feels small, compact and not atall 'massive' in size or scope. You just have to run a few minutes in a general direction and you will find your objectives. Run too much and you will move onto the next zone. Major cities and outposts are spaced way close to each other which sometime takes away the feeling of traveling in an epic and massive world. You will also painfully feel the compactness of the game when a bunch of players are trying to fight the same limited named mobs in a questing zone. Not since the days of EQ i have seen such a bad case of spawn and resource camping. This is quite apparent during peak days and times of the week.  Also the game caters towards grouping moreso as you increase levels. The quests are the way to level up in this game and most do require you to be grouped as the mobs are spaced quite close to each other and you are bound to get adds. Within your teen and mid to higher twenties you can get by solo but nearing lvl 30 you will see that grouping becomes much more of a requirement as the mobs hit hard and its no longer that easy to deal with adds you get doing quests. So for a solo player this game might offer some obstacles at higher levels.The Monster player vs players is an istanced version of WOW's battleground Alterac Valley. Its seperate closed area where players can pvp. You can take your own 'good' only character 'Freep' there once you attain lvl 40(though advisable to wait till max lvl cap 50) and go against specialized lvl 50 monsters called Creeps which any players at lvl 10 can access. The monsters are supposed to be avenue for people who prefer to be on the dark side of things. However, the monster are quite weak in the begining(a lvl 47 npc mob can take them down to 30% health) but even in there most upgraded form they stand no real chance against a lvl 50 Freep with all the best armor, traits and weapon upgrades. Creeps are setup to loose(per the lore) and also there is a huge disconnect as they just dont feel your own character. I rather be allowed to level up a darker character and take them to mvmp rather play a monster character who just dont feel like my own. Also the destiny points or buffs you get from doing quests in monster play are geared towards upgrading your monsters as players just get temporary buffs. So essentially the time spend in monster play upgrading your monster doesnt really benefit your pve side of the game in any major format.I have a rig with 2gb ddr-2 ram, amd athlon 4200 series, 512 mb ddr2 vram nvidia geforce 7600 video card. However, even than i suffer real severe bouts of lags whenever I pass through a city or where lots of people are gathered like in craftman areas and farming/cooking area.Well thats the end of my review. In a nutshell anyone who likes WOW or similar mmo's, the pve server aspects, is bored of that game, and likes the alliance side most probably will enjoy lotro otherwise just stay where you are and wait for Conan, Warhammer etc.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2007"}

Lohrke","summary":"i finally get it","reviewText":"i bought killzone 2 the day of its release last year and anxiously threw it in the ps3 when i got home from work that day.  after spending countless hours playing 'modern warfare' [and being relatively new the world of video games at the time], i was expecting KZ2 to give me a similar experience to MW. needless to say, i was in for a huge surprise, and ultimately my pre-conceived notions and biases left me feeling disappointed with the game.  i played about 1/2 through it before finally calling it quits and moving on to other pixelated pastures.well, about two weeks ago i was felled with a bout of insomnia and for whatever reason, i popped in KZ2 for the first time in over a year. i never played the multiplayer during my initial gameplay, so i thought i'd give it a try.  after playing countless TDMs on MW and MW2, KZ2's multiplayer was a breath of fresh air. i had an absolute blast and spent three or foour hours straight playing. i loved playing 5 different game modes ['bodycount,' 'assasination' [my favorite], 'search and destroy,' 'search and retrieve, and 'capture and hold'] during one game is brilliant. each mode lasts a max of five minutes and it keeps the game fresh and keeps you on your toes.  i also found the hit detection to be pretty good, none of the weapons overpowered, and the maps nicely varied in design and art direction.the single-player campaign [which i finally played through over the weekend] was amazing. i don't know that there's a FPS with better graphics than KZ2. the environments are amazing to look at [even if many of them are bleak and dreary]. there's a nice assortment of vehicles and missions. the story is interesting enough and full of moral vagaries. some of the characters seem to come straight from central casting, but sgt. sevechenko [the playable character] manages to avoid, for the most part, the cliches and conventions of FPS characters.  and col. radec, the big bad, is a very memorable and intriguing villan with his scratchy voice/breathing mask and miliary saavy.my biggest complaint the first time i played it was that the guns felt very sluggish and i hard time adjusting to the slow rotation times, especially when scoped.  i tinkered with the sensitivity and fixed that.  the only complaint i still have with the game is having to push R3 to scope instead of L1, like pretty much every other shooter out there.  the end result is that you end up hip-firing a lot, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it makes shooting targets in the distance that much more challenging. one other minor complaint: the load times on the multiplayer are extremely long and you occasionally get some awkward and extended load/save times during the campaign.hopefully the drop in price will encourage more people to get the game and fill the multiplayer lobbies back up.  you can get the three DLCs [which include six maps and various guns] released up to this point for $11.99, which is a bargain considering MW2's 5 'new' maps will run you $14.99. and with KZ3 announced for release this fall/winter, so if you've not taken a trip to helghast yet, now's a great time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00005ME7X","description":"Originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System,Dragon  Warrior IIIis a Game Boy Color port of one of the all-time classic  role-playing games. The game reunites two of Japan's greatest RPG talents in Yuji  Horii (story and game) and Akira Toriyama (character design). Toriyama is also  known as the creator of the immensely popular Dragon Ball cartoons and comics. A  prequel to the first two games in the series,DWIIIcasts you as the  child of a great hero who must defeat an evil demon. New additions to the port  include improved graphics, new minigames, new items, and a better translation of  the original Japanese dialogue.The game starts off with a personality test that loosely determines how other  characters will react to you. Gameplay is standard RPG fare: exploring, building  experience levels, acquiring allies, gaining weapons, and ultimately going after  a large monster. There are some interesting minigames to mix things up. The  Monster Medals feature adds a collectible aspect to the game. Monsters may leave  medals behind after you defeat them. Some monsters only appear during certain  times of the day. Getting all the medals unlocks a secret dungeon. You can trade  medals via link cable to make things easier. Most RPG fans will love this game,  but those raised on modern RPGs might find its combat a bit tedious. This game  is compatible with Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance only.--Raymond M.

It's basically a port of a Super Famicom game that never came out here in the U.S. So how is the translation? I definitely think it's acceptable. I honestly thought it was pretty amazing to see the enemy sprites animate during battle. I just didn't expect that level of detail on a GameBoy. If you were to compare it to the Super Famicom version then you would see that there were some sacrifices that had to be made. It's not quite as colorful and the music still sounds &#34;GameBoyish&#34; but it's all good in the spirit of Dragon Warrior. I might even grade this higher than the NES version simply because it has enemy animations and bonus areas. I'd say chances are if you're a Dragon Warrior/Quest fan then you already got this for your collection. It's a fantastic RPG that still shines in portable style.

I'm going to attempt to make this spoiler free.Pros:Strong FPSArt style = amazingcharacter developmentsoundtrackFPS innovationsuccessful science fiction endingCons:Poor replay valueLimited scopeDumbed down. :(Now, we'll have a few piecemeal scores!Graphics: 5/5Soundtrack:  5/5Gameplay: 4/5Combat: 4/5Storyline: 5/5Replay Value: 3/5Okay, so now to the juicy bits.Bioshock infinite is beautiful.  It provides that same complete immersion factor that the first one did (I didn't play the 2nd, so I can't say).  I'm not one of those gamers that searches in every nook and cranny; I'm a plot advancer.  For bioshock, the collection of recordings encourages gamers like me to get into those crannies and find tidbits of plot around every corner.  None of it is actually required, but it makes your experience that much more rich and complete.  The detail and depth of the aesthetic is wonderful as well- so many scenes, while being drastically different from bioshock 1, harken back to your experiences in Rapture.The setting?  Pretty damn amazing.  City in the sky?  Don't mind if I do.  It's so perfect, too, in the same way that fallout vaults were perfect and contained until you got there and messed everything up.  In Bioshock 1, we came into an already ravaged city. In Infinite, we get to feel the immense guilt of causing ruination.  In games, I so often am a pure white hero, saving lives, saving the day, and most importantly saving the girl... but in infinite I have to wonder if I cause more harm than help.Like the first game, the detail put into the surroundings provides a delicious taste of reality in an unreal setting.  The propaganda, the types of items littering the floors.  Hell, if we know anything, it's that the creators of Bioshock know how to make something ridiculous and impossible seem real.The combat's great, with a few small hitches in the carriage.  It's pleasurable, undeniably so!  Racing along those skylines?  Goodness gracious, the thrills!  As usual, the combination of guns and powers are exciting.  There's something about launching a group of enemies up into the air and then hurling a fireball at them.. or cleaning the rest up with a good shotgunning! Racing back to a safe spot, shooting your pursuants as they fly along the skylines after you... whatever, there are plenty of thrilling bits. It could have been done better, though... In order to be spoiler free, I have to be disgustingly vague, but there were a lot of options that could have been taken advantage of that instead became commonplace. For instance, Elizabeth is a girl with certain skills and she doesn't actually make use of them very well.  She could give much so much more than health packs and the occasional gun.  I chose to consider this a lack of imagination on this part, though.  Also, I could have used either more interesting guns.. or a few more guns.. or the ability to carry around more guns?  I've no idea.  I need more gun action! GUNS GUNS GUNS!  The upgrades system was weird, too.  Just cash?  Whatever.  Kind of boring.  Levine did say he listened to college playing Call of Duty dorm-members, so I guess this is a result of that.  Me?  I'd prefer a little more rpg gameplay in my rpg plot, but it's not my masterpiece.  Still, even with these problems it still is enjoyable and the line of 'heavy hitter' enemies was done incredibly well.My first playthrough was about 16 hours and I explored probably 85% of Columbia.  I also played on Hard because that's what people do if they want a challenging experience.  I'll play on 1911, too, and I dare you to wring an 8 hour run out of that!SO.  You're thinking.. flawed combat in an FPS, how are you giving this five stars? Character development!  Plot!  THAT FEEL.  Remember Telltale's Walking Dead and how you felt about Clem?  Did you feel that way about Clem?  Like disappointing her was the end of your world?  Did you want to be a better man?  I do.  I want to be a better man for Elizabeth.  Nevermind that I'm a catlady, sitting on my couch so far divorced from the world of Columbia.  I want to be the person you deserve, Elizabeth. That feel.  This is a 5 star story with 5 star character development.  Yeah, it's a short, linear campaign but so well crafted and such an experience that 60$ doesn't feel like adequate compensation.  The ending may be familiar to you - science fiction, a twist.. but to be so emotionally involved at the time really gives the ending a lasting impression.  For me, it was very positive.Unfortunately, there's only one ending.  Kinda sucks.  You got a few in Bioshock 1, and they were incredibly satisfying.  The one-ending-thing kind of kills replay value.  The only replay value lies in going back to piece together the twist and the clues leading up to it. I immediately wanted to watch my husband play it so I could ooh and aaaah about the knowing and how everything hinted to it.Is that all I can really talk about without spoiling?  I think so.  It's not a perfect game, but it is a game that gives you an intensely emotional experience and for that reason is the best game I've ever played.Since reviews are opinions, I suppose a list of my favorite games in the genre would help:  For (non j) RPGs, Mass Effect 2, Witcher, and Kotor w/ Extended Cut.  My favorite FPS ... Resistance series (THE GUNS!).  I'm also still a goldeneye fan.  Whatevs.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2013"}

In multiplayer you level up by killing people and winning matches for bonus points. At level 80 you have to make a very difficult choice but it is no easy task to get there. If you ever want to be any good at multiplayer mode you need to constantly practice and hone your skills. If you do that you may lead your team to victory.--Alan was here_______________________________Note:Alan is my son and the above is his review.

There are slight differences such as the way the game is structured and some of the mechanics. The game is filled with that classic Nintendo charm and personality. Exploring the mansions in this game is just fun. From hidden cash and gems, to finding the hidden boos. There is plenty to do. I also find myself going back time and time again to make sure I get the highest rating on each mission.The only complaint I have about the singleplayer portion of the game is that there is a lack of unique ghosts like you had in the original game. That's not to say the ghosts it has do not have personality. They have a lot of personality but they tend to have the same one since they are the same ghosts over and over. Sure you have a few spots that you have some more unique ghosts but those are but just a couple of instances. I'd also say I liked the final bosses of each mansion except the boss of the 4th mansion. They're all the same basic boss but they always have differences to the fights in either how you get to the boss or the mechanics of the fight.One of the best additions to the game though is the multiplayer mode. You can hook up with 3 other people either online, via local play, or even download play from the cart. The mode has a couple of different options and they are decently fun too. I would like more variety in the floor of the Scarescrapper though..All that said if you loved the first then you will love this game.It's without a doubt going to remain in my collection for the rest of my life alongside the first game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2013"}

Was to hard getting a feel for the game when everyone online kept owning me.  I decided to pick it up because my friends kept talking highly of the game.Once you understand the battle mechanics the game is really enjoyable.  It's entertaining when you use a level 1 super and take out 3 opponents with it.  I think the game really shines with the 2 vs 2 mode.  Very fun teaming up on your opponents by distracting one and having your friend come along and use their Super on them.Cross play works very well, my roommate will be signed into the PS3 while I'm logged into the Vita, this way we both can level up and receive trophies.  My only complaint is that there are two seperate trophy sets for the Ps3 and Vita.  Just seems cheap being able to receive two plantinums from the same game.I was really disappointed with the shipping.  My game case was busted on the bottom and the disc was moving around.  Was debating to even open it incase the disc was scratched or cracked.  Luckily there were no scratches.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"Terrence A. \"cinemaparker@twitter\"","summary":"Xbox One does it all and quite a bit more","reviewText":"Consider this rating a four and a half star review.The Xbox One has arrived and I can tell you in all honesty that this is an amazing console with a ton of potential down the line. As it stands now, there's a ton of things you can do with it. You can play games naturally and in a first for a Microsoft console you can play Blu-Rays, which can be done once you download the free corresponding player app from their app store. There are plenty of apps to download from the store as well such as Amazon Instant Video, Vudu, Machinima, Xbox Fitness, Netflix and more.Setup is extremely easy and simple. So much so that there's not even instructions in the box. Once you get your console plugged in, it'll prompt you to perform a system update and the rest is self explanatory and simple enough for even those who've never hooked up a gaming console before to hook up.The system itself is big but not as big as some people are making it seem. It's larger than the current model Xbox 360 for sure. There's a power brick also to take into consideration but that shouldn't pose any problems for you in terms of space management.The controller is absolutely wonderful. I love the Xbox 360 controller but the Xbox One's new controller takes it up a notch with rumbling triggers and a much more improved d-pad.Kinect 2.0 is a massive improvement over the original and you'll see it immediately when you get a glimpse of what the camera view looks like. With a 1080p camera, range, width and clarity are all greatly increased. One of the very first things you should do is check out Skype to give the Kinect a proper test run and see just what it can do. It's pretty cool how the camera responds and focuses on whoever is talking or whoever arrives into the picture. I wasn't a big Skype user before but the way it's set up on the Xbox One, I'm positive I'll be using it a lot more now. One of the other really cool Kinect features is its ability to recognize users within seconds of sitting in front of the camera. It can even tell who's holding the controller which is simply mind blowing.The voice commands on the Kinect work very well but I've noticed on several occasions that it won't understand me or do something else other than what I specify. It doesn't happen often and it's nothing that ruins the overall product. Maneuvering through the user interface with it quickly becomes second nature and nothing beats being able to turn the system on or off with just a simple voice command. Speaking of the user interface, it's very clean and eye catching and switching from apps to games to movies is lightning fast.As for cable TV functionality, I really couldn't tell you as I currently don't have cable TV but from what I've heard from others, it seems to work fine.As a verified purchaser, I can tell you upfront that I have had absolutely no problems with this console and I'm pretty pleased with it. I've had no disc grinding, discs getting stuck or the rumored \"green screen of death\" that so many of these suspect one-starred reviews are complaining about. If you have any questions in regards to the system or my review, please leave me a comment and I'll be sure to respond.The best compliment I can pay the Xbox One is that even though it's incredibly impressive in its infancy, you just know it's only going to get better with age, once the developers get familiar with it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0000503MO","description":"The third title of the Gran Turismo series takes full advantage of the new PlayStation2 game engine, which is capable of rendering about 20 million polygons per second--roughly 10 times the number of total polygons of the series' previous installment,Gran Turismo 2. Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course. They don't drive perfectly, either; some will spin out and make other mistakes over the course of a race.","reviewerName":"George","summary":"This is the racing game i was waiting for!","reviewText":"When I went to the store and saw the other racing games for the PS2, I just said to myself, wait for GT3. Because I knew that GT3 was going to be the best.  This game has the most realistic graphics.  The cars look VERY real.  Especially in the replay mode.  You can see heat waves coming off of the ground, real time reflections coming off of the cars, the backgrounds are really GOOD and they actually have real world locations(my Dad came in when I was playing the Rome level and he said he was in the same exact street I just drove in), and see what it's like going 130 mph! But one thing you may notice is that you don't get ANY car damage at all.  You can hit all the cars as much as you like, but you bounce off them like bumper cars.  I guess they did this because the car companies didn't want their cars to look bad.They call this a &quot;realistic driving simulator&quot; and it is....kinda.  See, I asked REAL drivers to play this game and they said it wasn't, even when they played on the steering wheel. See, the thing is, each car has it's OWN FEEL to it.  So not every car handles the same...just like in real life.  And also, you can hear the differnt engine sounds each car makes.Some people might not like this game because of the control...and I admit, it takes a while to get used to.  This isn't arcade style driving, it's a simulator.  That means you can't go 130 around a corner, you're going to have to slow down when going in, and then accerlate while going out.In the game, there are two modes, a simulator mode and an arcade mode.  In the sim. mode, this is where you have to make a living on racing.  You start out with a certain amount of money, buy a car, and let the racing begin.  When you win, you get more money.  With this money, you can buy parts for your car, and believe me, you can just about buy almost anything you can buy....engine, shocks, breaks, tires, seats....and more.  You can also get a NEW car, and get a car wash.  What you can also do is test out your car.  In the arcade mode, you are given some cars, and a certain amount of levels.  You get more levels by getting 1st place in each level.  But just because it's an arcade mode doesn't mean the control is differnt.  One thing I like about the control is that it uses the pressure sensitivity on the dual shock 2. The harder you press, the faster you go.The soundtrack is also nice, and the game has a nice replay mode after each race, which you can also custimize for your own taste.  One of the games faults that you may notice is the weak AI. That doesn't mean you'll win easily it just that when the race starts, all the cars immedatly go into a single file line.  But the game doesn't cheat on you, at least I haven't noticed any cheating. But this game will take a long time to fully complete.  You can finish the arcade mode pretty quickly but the sim. mode is the core of the game.You don't have to be a hardcore racing fan to appreciate this game and have fun.  This is also a great game to show off your PS2 with, and it's certainly the best looking game out for the system right now.  Just don't expect it to be very easy and jumps, and catching big air like in Crazy Taxi.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2001"}
{"product_name":"B00009TW6R","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements.

As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions.

Ever since Doom and Grand Theft Auto 3, all serious video games have shifted to lush 3-D environments.  Halo is no exception.  What sets Halo apart is it's innovative story line which makes a game like this much more engaging and rewarding to play.  If there is a solid plot line behind the action, the game succeeds (look at again, The Grand Theft Auto series, and Manhunt, though the plot was dimented, once you got to the end of the story, the plot made great sense), if there is a weak or little plot line and just action, the game fails to generate excitement (see 'State of Emergency') regardless of how great the graphics and action are, if the plot stinks, the player loses interest rapidly.Halo, has a great story line, which makes it's graphics and gameplay a very rewarding experience, especially when the player reaches the end of the story.

{"product_name":"B000HCQK0A","reviewerName":"Greg","summary":"Hit em hard, agent... but not too hard.","reviewText":"It's getting harder and harder to forgive the little things, but here we go again.Crackdown is a great game that gets bogged down way to much in sub-par controls and unimaginative progression.  It's a great idea - you're a cop in a city full of crime, only you're awesome!  You can, like, jump on roofs and throw cars and stuff!  You start up as only sort of awesome but as you blow up guys and gather randomly placed orbs (orbs of awesome?) your powers get better.  Which works well enough because there's a progression and you get to earn your awesomeness.  And who doesn't want to become a pure truck-tossing baddass, right?  But not long into your journey to super-agent status - about the fifth time your little guy locks onto a passing car for no reason - you realize it's going to be an uphill trip.Your super cool looking agent can do lots of heroic things - drive cars fast, shoot guns, punch people into next tuesday - but he can't do any of them well.  Driving, even at the highest \"skill level\" is blocky and un-fun.  Shooting is unrewarding and there's no real difference in weapons; there's no reason to use the pistols over the machine guns, for example, even though there's a couple to collect.  And don't even get me started on the lock-on feature - it's unreliable and yet COMPLETELY necessary.  Good luck firing from the hip, you'll be lucky to hit the building the bad-guys are standing on.  Also, why the hell does pulling the trigger sometimes make me swing the butt of the gun?  And usually into the railing or piece of wall I'm tyring to take cover behind?  I've got a dedicated punch-in-the-face button, I'll use it when I need it, stop trying to force it on me, and STOP HITTING THE WALL!  Oh, and good luck with that punch button by the way.  Sure, when you connect with the bad-guy(or even the car they're hiding in)and they  go flying, it's pretty satisfying.  But that usual only comes after a riduculous amount \"turn around- no, turn around- no, turn, turn- there I got him- oh, I'm dead again\".  Being able to leap tall buildings in a single bound is cool, but the frustrating and overly-touchy controls murder even that bit of fun.  Aiming your landing is dodgy at best and when trying to jump you have two options - not enough to clear the curb and SUPER HIGH!  The imprecision of it is severly limiting, especially in a game where the enemy is so effective and numerous that it makes fighting them in the steet abosolute suicide.  It goes beyond making it \"challenging\": the bad guys with the crazy, heat-seaking guns are challenging enough.  This is about making the controls freaking broken.Forgive the rant, but with each generation of console, it's getting harder and harder to forgive these basic gameplay problems.But it's not all bad news.  The visuals abosolutely need to be praise.  Going in the opposite direction of photo-realism, they've still managed to make a city that clean and precise and visually stimulating.  And the distance you can see is marvalous - not just buildings but collectibles and cars and targetable enemies pop in and a vast distance.  It's really satisfying and immersive and shows the power of scaling graphics away from photo-realism and towards something much more artistically even and functional.So here we are, with lousy controls and interesting visuals (God, this intersection's starting to feel familiar).  What's needed to push this game into something worthwhile is a good-darn story.  Something compelling to keep my interest while I try to make my stubborn avatar do what I tell him to do.  But... no, not gonna happen.  You're fighting three different gangs (latins, asians and russians - groundbreaking!) in three modest sized sections of a city.  Each gang has lieutenants and then a general to hunt down (mini-bosses and a boss in video game parlance) in order to eliminate the faction.  But there's only a handful of each and finding them feels less like \"Succesful hunting\" and more like \"blind, stupid luck\".  To be honest I'm not entirely sure what grants you access to the boss locations.  Is it wandering near them?  Is it unlocking more skills?  The game doesn't tell me and I was never able to piece it out?What happened to the days ofMercenaries?  Four chapters!  Fifty-two targets!  Sprawling levels!  Remember those days?And yes, the city is nice (Champion City?  Capital City?  What the hell was it called?) but it really lacks personality.  It's described as this gang-ridden, crime polluted, horrible place than needs to cleaned up with rocket launchers... but it actually looks really clean.  And functional.  People live there, they drive around like normal.  If there's any shooting in the street it's all at or because of ME.  So... what am I cleaning up?  It feels like a small thing, but some grime in the city, or a change because of my actions would have felt rewarding after all of my jumping into walls and driving over civilians by mistake (again).At the end of the day, Crackdown is a decent game, I suppose.  Thing blow up, you jump over stuff.  But, ugh... just ugh...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2012"}

The dire situation forced the two opposing factions to negotiate a cease-fire and an agreement was quickly reached, but although the war may have ended, its effects remained. With the deteriorating environment, Earth's population was drastically reduced and those who survived lived a confined existence trapped in underground cities. Eventually countries joined together to form the Greater United Nations and turned their eyes skyward, to space.

His signature weapon is the sword.Faize Sheifa BelethA young Eldarian committed to etiquette and logic, and capable of astounding feats of engineering, Faize is always honorable of those possessing abilities he lacks. His signature weapon is the rapier.Reimi SaionjiThe kind and levelheaded navigator of the Calnus, Reimi was born in an aristocratic Saionji family and has a shared history with Edge back on Earth. Her signature weapon is the bow.Lymle Lemuri PhiOrphaned on her home planet of Lemrick long ago, Lymle is mischievous, but friendly and inexplicably retains the appearance of a young girl. Her signature weapon is the wand.Gameplay and CombatAlthough Edge Maverick is the main character inStar Ocean: The Last Hope, players will of course experience gameplay action in the form of a number of different characters and utilize the signature attacks assigned to each. The game features a real-time combat system which allows for up to four party members to remain active in battle at a time. Improvements to the game's combat system include 'Rush Mode,' where players can switch out active members of their combat groups for reserve members in real-time; 'Sight In/Sight Out' which allows for timed evasive and counter moves against enemies; and the BEAT (Battle Enhancement Attribute Type) system, through which players can change a character's fighting style at will. Other actions players will master through gameplay include piloting of the spaceship Calnus, a first in theStar Oceanseries; item creation in the form of weapons, healing items and accessories; and Private Actions (PAs), a cause and effect relationship between character in-game actions and the acquisition of new abilities and scenarios. Through the increased flexibility mastery of all these skills provides, players should be able to more easily increase their team and individual team member's combat experience and status, and so unlock more advanced combat styles and linked combinations.Key Game Features:Series prequel-Star Ocean: The Last Hopeis a prequel in the classic series, combining sci-fi and fantasy elements, spanning multiple planets and the vastness of space itself to recount the origins of the Star Ocean universe.Exciting Battles- Exhilarating combat expands upon the franchise's famous real-time battle system, including the amazing graphics and visual effects only possible on Xbox 360.Compelling Scenes- The game features breathtaking CG movies by Visual Works, the cutting-edge studio whose previous work includes cutscenes for the acclaimed Final Fantasy RPG series.","reviewerName":"A Pudgy Pug","summary":"Fantastic","reviewText":"Love the fact that it stayed true to its free roam.

Players begin their adventure as an angel-like guardian. In order to achieve a heavenly design players are sent to the world of mortals to retrieve the magical fruits of a sacred tree. These fruit have the power to grant wishes, but are also perilous, containing the unexpected power to transform those who eat of them into monsters. Together with up to three friends players must battle those transformed beings, and in the process improve their angelic skills and regain the heavenly fruit in order to gain their heavenly reward.CustomizationPlayers can create their own heroes, deciding how they would like their face, hair and clothing to look. As the story unfolds, players become stronger, smarter and more powerful, and can create custom companions to join their group as well. Players will also have fun discovering more than 900 pieces of clothing, armor, weapons and other items that will provide them with a unique appearance and special abilities. Even occupations can be customized and changed at any time. Players can take on one of a dozen different jobs with varying strengths, weaknesses, spells and skills.BattleFast-paced turn-based battles unfold as players decide what to do and then view cinematic action scenes. This format rewards careful thinking and strategy over quick reflexes. The more foes players defeat, the stronger their characters become. In the lead up to conflicts, talking with different characters will unfold the story and point players toward their next mission. All quests come with a reward, which might be anything from a rare item to a new, unlocked occupation.Tag ModeDragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skiesincludes the interactive Tag Mode that allows players to keep the game active even while their Nintendo DS system is stored in their pocket, purse or backpack. When two players come within range of one another, Tag Mode enables them to wirelessly--and automatically--exchange character information, customized greetings and treasure maps.

In Tag mode, treasure maps and customized greetings can be exchanged automatically by players who come within range of one another.

{"product_name":"B0002SQ0BS","reviewerName":"Adam B","summary":"The multiplayer is CRAZY good!","reviewText":"The multiplayer portion of this game is so good it'll have you playing for hours on end.  The fact that there are 11 new multiplayer maps is enough for you to go out and buy this game, that is if you are Xbox Live enabled.  All of these maps are very \"hands on\" when it comes to gameplay.  You will find plenty of hiding spots, crawl spaces, ventilation shafts, switches, and buttons that will make each game new and exciting.  These maps are much more detailed than anything you've seen in past games and with so many ways to complete the task at hand, each time you play it will seem very new.There are 3 different gametypes that you can choose from when setting up a game online.  They are story mode, disk hunt, and last but not least a deathmatch mode.  In the story mode, the spies try to comlete a task while the mercs try to stop them.  When you complete a certain part, another area usually becomes accessable where another task needs to be completed.  In the disk hunt mode, the spies much search for and collect disks scattered across the map.  This is a pretty easy gametype to play as it requires less skill than the previous story mode.  The last type is pretty self explanitory where each team tries to kill the other.While the graphics and visuals in multiplayer aren't as top-notch compared to the single player campaign, they are in no way less superior.  The graphics are great and keep the multiplayer fresh and new.  I don't think anyone can gripe about the graphics in the multiplayer portion of the game.  All the levels are very detailed with smooth, crisp textures and lots of different environments.With all the different maps and gametypes available, this game has definite replay value and will keep gamers playing for a long time to come.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2006"}

I've had several issues with bugs from Bethesda's titles in the past.  Morrowind and Oblivion, while some of my favorite games, were a nightmare to start up because of some of the bugs.  Fallout 3 was notorious for crashing my PS3 (especially the expansion material.)Well, recently started this game, and I'm several hours into it.  So far, I haven't run across a single bug (that couldn't be killed by my machete.)  The story is pretty good.  Good enough for a sandbox game.  I'd say the graphics feel cleaner and smoother than Fallout 3's.  The voice acting is at least as good as Fallout 3's, and I love the music -  The fine folks at Obsidian did an amazing job with integrating the music!  It really feels like \"The Wild, Wild West!\"I'd also like  to take the time to point out the improvements of the skill system.  Having a repair skill doesn't just allow you to fix up your weapons.  It allows you to convert ammo you don't use into ammo that you do use!  I really like how the speech and barter skills have been beefed up:  Instead of your skill level giving you a % chance of succeeding, they put a quota - A dialog option, for example, will say [Speech 25] and if you have a 25 or higher, you automatically succeed!  Survival is also a very useful skill now.  Having higher ranks of the skill will allow you to cook food and make some equipment.The perks you can chose from at the start aren't that great (Wild West was the only one that didn't have ridiculous negative effects on you.)  Once you start leveling up, the perks that become available are quite nice.Over all, I really like this game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2011"}

I did not like the game therefore I am rightly entitled to MY opinion on it. I bought the bundled package yesterday, wanted to really play the game. So after downloading it and playing for about 2 hours, the servers go down. And still are not 100% up today. I find this unacceptable. The graphics are ok, crisp, clear, but with some jagged edges and blurs that harken back to last generation consoles. I have noticed all the 1 star reviews have been deleted by Amazon, in order to boost sales, and not let good old Microsoft down. Well guess what? Tough %%%%!!The game has it's fun moments, wall running, jumping with the jetpack in the air to take down a titan or soldier is great fun. But after a while you think wow I payed 60 dollars, or got the console JUST for this. Which I was ready to purchase Forza 5 and Dead rising as well. Well suffice to say I won't be purchasing anything from them. I took back the system, period. Especially when the servers went down, and the excuses started.Also having 6 vs 6 is not that much fun, people are easy to hunt down, I want more challenge, free for all, a single player campaign that doesn't require the net. In case it goes down (again). So this game is/was overhyped, but I think the true gamers know there are a lot better games with much better substance out there. I've never in my life seen something like this, just to boost sales, and popularity for a product. Take it down as much as you want, I'll just keep posting it back.ProsAccurate controls, unless your in the air, then it's toughThe learning curve is pretty easy, but not overly so.The Titans are loads of fun, especially to pull out the pilot of your rival, and toss him away.Environments are rich.Very fast paced, so if you have epilepsy, best play something slower.ConsServer keeps crashing, even today.Graphics are ok, barely looks next gen.Frame rates can drop dramatically, making it very hard to play. (I have a 50mb connection with boosts to 70mb) btw.Overall it's just another innovative shooter that has been glorified because of poor console sales.

Being so unique puts Mass Effect in a category all of its own which is one of the reasons it has one so much praise.Starting with the good aspects, the story was deep and well thought out.  They did not make up just some old story but they went in a totally original direction and made up an entire universe with a rich history which is no small task.  A lot of thought was put into the back-story which has a lot of details and connects all the characters into a believable world.Each character connects to that story and they do a good job explaining their motivations for why they do what they do and where they come from.  All your character options are interesting and depending on how you interact with them will impact your story and side quests.The combat was a blast with lots of options especially for the biotics and techs.  There were a lot of options on how to fight and how to use the terrain or surround objects to your advantage.Some of the levels are breathtaking looking, especially one towards the end.  A lot of cover is offered for the players so you can use tactics and shoot around objects to take on the bad guys.  Exploring can be fun and rewarding in some situations as well with a good amount of side quests.However the exploring and levels suffered from some of the biggest issues.  A lot of levels were cookie cut duplicates, especially the side quests.  Most of the levels lacked grit and detail and the open world exploration was bare and plain.  The open world was made even more frustrating with the rover vehicle which handled like crap and had to go over crazy mountain ranges which was irritating and not fun.The characters were great as I mentioned but you could only use 2 at a time which sucked.  I ended up only using the people that were the BEST at their specialty since I knew they would always have the talents I needed.  Dragon age was bad with 3, but only having 2 really sucked.Even once you picked your players, managing the inventory was another huge issue.  It was a pain to manage the equipment and your inventory.  While there are only a few types of weapons and armor, there are tons of different manufacturers which offer different properties.  Really IMO it was too much and made the inventory that much more difficult to manage having to scroll through 20 or 30 shotguns of the same level.The combat was great as I mentioned before but once you killed everything... then that was it.  No respawns or random encounters.  With exploring already not being great due to the lack of details and cookie cut levels, this really killed that aspect for me since there was not much to fight.Being in space and all with your own ship I had hoped to have some space combat and boarding fun.  I wanted to see some random encounters where I could take on other factions in space combat and try to board their ship to take it over!  Buck Rogers was an old game on the Genesis and did this really well and with loads of areas to explore.  I would just fly around the galaxy until I found an enemy ship and then take them on.  I could either blow them up or board them and take on the crew.  Doing this would have been tight to not only attack and take other ships but to defend your own.Even with the faults and some areas that could have been better, I really did enjoy this game a whole lot.  Overall it felt like a Beta and kind of incomplete in vertain areas like the world environment, the rover, and the equipment system but its a solid start and hopefully the next game builds on the good and replaces the bad from this game.  It was a lot of fun for the action that I had, the classes were great, the story was original, and just a really fun game.  I am very excited for Mass Effect 2!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXI6K","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Gordon","summary":"Long Overdue HD Compilation of 3 of the Greatest 3D Platforming Games Around","reviewText":"When the whole \"HD compilation of last generation games\" move began a few years ago, the question on many people's minds was when the @$#@#! Sony was going to release a Ratchet and Clank HD collection.  After all, Ratchet and Clank was one of the few franchises identified with Sony that had successfully transitioned to the PS3, and was one of the few surviving, somewhat traditional platforming franchises with some degree of critical and commercial success.  The PS2 adventures of the mechanically inclined, tabby cat-like Ratchet, and his somewhat nerdish, diminutive robot companion Clank still remained absent, even as God of War, Metal Gear Solid, Sly Cooper, and Jak and Daxter collections all were released for the PS3.  In 2012, Sony finally relented, and has released the original PS2 trilogy of Ratchet and Clank games for the PS3, in high definition.  The question, as is the case in any of these HD re-releases, is whether games released so long ago, and in a lower resolution, can retain the same magic under the stark light of modern gaming conventions and high-definition expectations.The good news is that the Ratchet and Clank games do stand up to that scrutiny.  The collection includes the self-titled debut (RC1), Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando (GC), and Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal (UYA).  The franchise is essentially a mix of Super Mario Brothers style platforming, the over-the-top gunplay of Contra, and the cartoon aesthetics/sensibilities of Looney Tunes (Duck Dodgers in particular) mixed with Pixar films, all in 3D.  Unlike Jak and Daxter, the core principles and approach of the games have remained relatively consistent (more on the differences between the 3 games later).  In terms of how this collection is put together overall, I have to admit that, like many of these collections, there's not a lot of polish.  The title screen has artwork obviously ripped from 2011's Ratchet and Clank: All 4 One, the skimpy digital manual (there's no physical one) fails to retain all the detail and charm of the original PS2 manuals,  and there's no extra features to be found.  As is the case for almost all HD compilations, some of the in-game movies are either sub-HD or have had their aspect ratios altered, and switching games requires exiting entirely back to the PS3 dashboard.That being said, I was shocked at how much care they put into restoring the first Ratchet and Clank game.  Despite the general conventional wisdom that RC1 was inferior to its successors, I always felt that it had the strongest level design and best aesthetics of the series, and as a result, liked it a bit better than the others.  The planets are memorable: the lush, open plains of Novalis, Eudora's forested greenery, the night-time desert frontier of Aridia, Hoven's wintry chill, the vast skyscrapers and hovercars of Metropolis, Pokitaru's blue water, and Gaspar's vivid red and orange lava fields all made quite an impression the first time around.  Each of the many worlds also felt fairly busy and filled with things to do; there were usually at least a couple of distinct main paths to take.  I'm not sure if it was due to the game possibly being originally designed at a higher resolution than its original PS2 release, but the HD version seems to be significantly more detailed and cleaned up than one would expect after playing the original on a PS2.  Textures mostly seem more detailed than before, and the colors really \"pop\".  The gameplay in RC1 is very much focused on \"meat and potatoes\" platforming and 3rd person gunplay, with a few diversions (hoverboard racing, turret gun sequences, one-off starfighter sections) thrown in to keep things fresh.  The Clank solo sections provide an interesting change of pace, as the focus shifts from shooting and jumping to managing herds of robotic helpers, a la Lemmings.  The gunplay is solid and very entertaining (Contra fans should note the probably unintentional tribute to the game's influence when on Batalia), albeit with a slightly wonky auto-aim mechanism, made up for by the sheer variety of crazy weapons.  The platforming is pretty good, too, with rail-grinding sections that acknowledge that sometimes you just want a Sonic-esque roll-coaster ride, and magnet-boot sections that confound the player's orientation.  Perhaps most importantly, RC1 has a camera-centering button- something that Naughty Dog never implemented to the detriment of its Jak and Daxter series.GC was developed well within the timeframe of \"Grand Theft Auto fever\", when focus group testing pushed gaming towards \"grittier\", less cheerful fare, and \"open world gaming\" became the new bandwagon to hop on, even if the concept of a game didn't mesh with that.  Insomniac mostly stuck to their guns in terms of developing GC, but some of the new sensibilities still crept in.  One thing that sticks out is that the worlds in GC were gloomier than those in RC1, with duller color palettes.  The level design also felt somewhat stripped down and simpler as well.  With that being said, Insomniac also took cues in terms of making the gameplay broader in scope, in line with the GTA games.  Hoverbike racing challenges were made deeper than the prior game's hoverboard races, space combat/fighter racing took greater prominence, and the series' signature arena combat was introduced.  RPG leveling aspects (for both Ratchet's health and his weapons) were worked in as well, while new gadgets such as the glider, and 2 distinct hacking mechanisms (each with its own minigame) further varied things.  Targeting and movement were improved quite a bit, and RC1's unforgiving checkpoints were replaced with something a little more palatable.  And despite the more spare aesthetics, GC had its share of memorable locations, including a desert world and a tundra world with large open sections for harvesting crystals while fighting enemies.  Let's not forget the escalation in weaponry from the prior installment (you'll be tossing portable mini-nukes, unleashing balls of plasma-lightning, and spraying enemies with lava on a regular basis before all is said and done).By the time UYA was released, the \"next big thing\" was the rising popularity of linear, accessible shooters, even as open world gaming was still settling into its place as a genre that was here to stay.  UYA shows that influence, even if still within the stalwart Ratchet and Clank approach.  UYA returns to a more vivid art style, while the wide scope of GC has been scaled back a bit for something more focused on set-pieces and visceral combat (with yet another bump in the arsenal providing the player with plasma whips and a space-rift creator).  Gone are the racing aspects, and rail-grinding is a no show.  Instead of space combat, UYA introduces sets of military-style \"missions\" on certain worlds, with both ground combat and gunship sequences.  The arena combat does return, while the spherical moon sections from GC (years before Super Mario Galaxy hit the shelves) also return with more polish (check out the vista on the Obani moons!).  UYA is probably the quickest-paced of these 3 games, and weapon-leveling has been segmented further so that you see more immediate improvements through continued use of any given weapon.  While my game's save file clock indicates I've put in something like 16-17 hours to finish UYA, it feels like the \"shortest\" of the games.  I should also note that UYA has the distinction of being one of the few platformers to have an online multiplayer component, which has been included here.Overall, the games themselves are fantastic, with each bringing a distinct enough strong point to the series, so that it's hard to say which is \"the best\".  Unfortunately, there are a few odd glitches here and there (Ratchet's space helmet in cutscenes from GC and UYA, some players having occasional freezing at points, issues with how meters appear on the screen, and whatever you do, don't go right back into single player after playing multiplayer in UYA, unless you want to permanently disable the weapons wheel pause).  In addition, there are a couple points where for some reason, the graphics look a bit....unpolished (notably in UYA, where the very first world of Veldin has a grotesquely fake-looking sun-glare \"ring\").  This, however, may simply be due to higher resolutions drawing attention to the occasional lapse in fidelity that was present in the originals.  All told, the diligent gamer will get 40+ hours out of this compilation on the first playthrough (there's also a \"new game+\" challenge mode for each game), while the obsessive player could tack on another 10 or more hours before revisiting the games via challenge mode.  While all 3 of Sony's platforming collections are, in my opinion, essential PS3 purchases, this collection is the best of them, simply due to the consistently high quality of all 3 games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0002BJQDY","description":"Guild Warstakes the best elements of today's massively multiplayer online games and combines them with a new mission-based design that eliminates the tedium of those games. You can meet new friends in towns or outposts, form a party, and then go tackle a quest together. Your party always has its own unique copy of the quest map, so camping, kill-stealing, and long lines to complete quests are all things of the past. Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder.You don't have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don't have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you've previously unlocked. You'll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn't allow bad decisions to ruin a character. And you'll never meet new players only to discover that you can't play with them or compete against them because their characters are on a different server than yours; in Guild Wars, all characters live in one seamless world.Built for CompetitionAfter learning the game and building up your first character, you may choose to test your skills in head-to-head competition or guild warfare. The game is designed to reward player skill and teamwork, not time spent playing, so you won't need to spend hundreds of hours leveling up your character to compete.The game includes integrated support for guilds, with guild banners and halls, chat rooms and forums. Guilds can challenge other guilds to battle, compete for control of key parts of the world, and be ranked on a worldwide ladder.Unique Streaming TechnologyArenaNet's unique streaming technology forever eliminates the concept of patching a game. You don't have to wait a month for the next big patch to experience new content. Instead, the game constantly and intelligently streams new content to your computer in the background while you play. The world can change continually. This allows us to build a much more dynamic game world than any that has existed before.","reviewerName":"ellafan","summary":"Older gamer loves this game!!","reviewText":"\"GW\" is my first foray into the world of online gaming.I was a little intimidated at first,what with the zillions of people running around all over the place,but I quickly found that other,more experienced players were more than happy to help a newbie such as I.I soon became immersed in the huge GW lands and have been having such a good time with the characters I created.I am a Ranger/Elementalist in this game,and it is really fun to add skills,and win battles,complete quests,and a myriad of other stuff.I was invited to join a guild,which I did,and the people in the guild are helpful,funny,and obviously in love with this game as much as I am.I am currently playing GW and Factions at the same time.Tonight I load Nightfall and have more fun!!!This kind of game is perfect for someone who has been a fan of RPG's since Diablo.The advances these kinds of games have made are incredible.Prepare to have your slippers knocked off!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2008"}

I'd see a friend of mine playingLumineswhen it first came out, but that was about it.Now I begin to see what I'd been missing.I bought thePSP Daxter Entertainment Pack - Ice Silverversion of the PSP hardware yesterday on something of a whim. I'd heard decent things, read some reviews and thought it might be a good investment. Plus, hey,Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lionswas out, and I wanted to play that.I turned out to be a good purchase! The unit itself is very well-designed and comfortable to use. The display screen is incredibly vivid and bright. The interface is nicely designed. I had a few problems getting onto the internet at first, but I managed to resolve those within a few minutes (the little web-browser they have built-in to the software is... ok. Not great, but it gets the job done).In fact, about the only thing I would have liked that did not come with this system was a USB cable. Fortunately I was able to find one at my local game store and now I can hook this sucker directly up to my computer. Very useful, given that I now am able to play MP3s on my PSP, as well as store photos!In addition to the system, I also got a one gig memory chip. That's pretty handy! It also came withDaxter, which I haven't played too much, but it's proving fun. It also came withFamily Guy - The Freakin Sweet Collection (UMD  Mini for PSP). Alone, these items would likely add quite a bit more to the expense, but they came included for only a little more than the system itself (I sold the UMD, however. Why? Well, partly cause I have that same product on DVD and partly cause I just don't \"get\" the whole UMD thing. They're overpriced, have no extras and just aren't very interesting).I've owned and enjoyed aNintendo DS Lite Onyx Black, but I gotta say this little system is worlds away. You get video games, internet access, an MP3 player, a movie player (though not my thing, as mentioned), and a picture viewer, all for not too much more than a DS. Nintendo, I love you, but in this case Sony has the best product (don't hate me!).The only down-sides I see is that this is not a system for younger kids (what with the UMD discs), and it is a little larger than the DS. It would be nice if it came with a wrist strap, since I'm sure dropping it would have tragic consequences, and as I said before I would've liked to have had a USB cable in the box. But still, I'm happy with what I bought and I think you would be, too!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2007"}

Toss him aroung like a rag doll while choking him?  Toss a lightsaber into him?\" while he shoots at me with single-minded stupidity as I deflect his shots with my saber.  Oh, look...an obstacle on a linearly-constructed level.  Do I go around it?  Wait, use the Force to blast through it a 27th time?  Really?  I...did...not...see...that...coming!Ultimately, the original Force Unleashed turned into a \"how do I get to the next cutscene so I can look at something else besides endless hordes of Bantha fodder occasionally interrupted by 'God-of-War lifted context-sensitive boss fights.'\"  By the time that I got to the end, my character was so incredibly endowed with force powers, it made Luke Skywalker (from Return of the Jedi) look like a whelp.  Apprentice, Vader?  Yeah, right.I was hoping that the Force Unleashed II would offer something new.  It does:  a couple of new ways to \"kick a** with the force.\"  Beyond that, MOTS.  Congratulations, LucasArts, for taking THE SAME 5-word sentence and wrapping a game around it.  PS - LucasArts laid off 30 of their software developers prior to this game's release.  Read into that whatever message you'd like.\"But, seriously,\" you may ask, \"What do you know?  You only played a complete DEMO.\"  Here's the 5-and-dime on this, folks.  The purpose of ANY GOOD marketing exercise is to showcase your game's BEST features in order to entice you to buy the full game.  Uncharted 2 is a great example of this; the game throws you into Chapter 5 of the game (about 1/4 way through) and chucks you into an action-packed level full of bad guys (who actually think, take cover, and generally do a good job of NOT being cannon fodder).  The Force Unleashed II shows me that LucasArts has learned NOTHING if this is the BEST that the game has to offer.  The Force Unleashed II (yeah, THAT rolls off the tongue) ultimately becomes similar to what Episodes 1 - 3 did for Episodes 4 - 6 -- The Force Unleashed (compared to Jedi Outcast) is all about the eye candy without any actual substance or sense of adventure.Don't buy unless you can get it for $9.99 or less, USED.  Don't support LucasArts by purchasing this new and encouraging them to release more drivel.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2010"}

Before the game was released Lucasarts canned the third game for good. Now that you know this is the end of the line should you buy the end of the saga?Let's start with the positives first. The graphics are gorgeous.  The game really looks great 95% of the time. Even in the cut scenes the characters look ten times better than TFU 1. The environments are very diverse and no one level looks like any of the others.The story is pretty well done in this game. Yes I do wish there was a little bit more content at the beginning but when the credits roll it's a nice clean-cut story that really hits some emotional heart strings. There are two endings as in the original game. One is the Sith ending and one is the Jedi ending. Trust me the Jedi ending is better though both end without a cliffhanger which I feared when entering the game.Now onto the gameplay section of the review or shall I call it the con section. All of the moves from the first game are back but with a few additions. There is a force overload meter that you fill up when you kill enemies. When you use it you get about 30 seconds of unlimited Force energy. It's very similar to the power of the Gods meter in \"God of War.\" Another addition is the grappling option. You can grab an enemy and a small cut scene will commence with you killing the enemy. The only problem is that there is only one cut scene per enemy so it gets really boring really fast.Every enemy has a weakness. Some die with electricity or Force Repulsion, but their weakness never changes. This doesn't give you any variety in which you kill your prey. Along with boring combat is level design. While every level is distinctly different from one another they don't have a lot of variation within that level. If I'm on Kamino it doesn't look like any other level but the room I'm in looks just like the one I left. Overall the game play is very monotonous and leaves you with very little creativity. Even the final boss battle is just a survival round with waves of enemies jumping in and no variety to the actual boss battle. The game is very mind numbing to say the least.If you like to collect things the costumes and lightsaber crystals are back. There not as well hidden though and most can be found right in front of you. Also as you kill enemies you gain points that help you upgrade your force powers similarly to the first game.If you liked the first game I recommend you rent this game, you won't be playing through it again so no need to buy it. Just to see the story unfold is worth a play through though. It's nowhere near as good as the first, but it is fun for the most part.  I do wish the designers would have added more variety to the combat and levels, but at least the attacks you have work and are easy to use. It's a shame this is the last we will see of Starkiller because he is one of the most interesting characters in the Star Wars universe.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2010"}

I am a huge fan of the previous Arkham games, and was very much looking forward to playing this next installment. Then, I heard that it was no longer being developed by Rocksteady. This turned my excitement into worry. Still, I sucked it up and waited.Finally the game arrived, and I popped it into my PS3 system, and was treated to...an almost exact duplicate of Arkham City. Yes, the graphics and sound are amazing, because the graphics and sound were amazing in arkham city. I didn't notice any major improvements. You zipped around the city, you find Riddlers hidden packages scattered abouts, you grill riddlers stoolies to find out new locations.If you are expecting a brand new experience and think this game will be an improvement as Arkham City was to Arkham Asylum, you have another think coming. Again, other than story, this next installment brings nothing new to the table, at least in the main campaign. (Although exploring the batcave is kind of nifty, having a wayne manor mission would have been kind of cool as well).What this game does add to the Arkham franchise is it's online gameplay, that lets you create your own thug, and get assigned to either the Jokers gang, or banes gange. Once you reach level 2, you unlock the ability to play as a hero(Batman or Robin). The online mode is actually quite fun and entertaining. To me, this alone was worth the price, though if you aren't much into online gaming this means little to nothing to you.One nice thing is, that the game is fairly lengthy, which is rare for games that offer online modes. The game provides something for both the campaign player as well as the death matcher, which was refreshing.Overall, if you enjoy online gaming, and the Arkham games, then you need to own this title. Otherwise, it may not be worth your money, and you might be better off waiting to rent it, or pick up a used copy. $60.00 is a bit much considering the campaign feels less like a new game, and more like an expansion pack for Arkham City.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2013"}

This was a challenging game that offered very little plot, instructions and complete utter chaos to me.  I play this game for hours running around like a chicken with his head cut off, but I enjoyed it.  I learn that taking on 5 enemies at once and running up to a boss without any strategy would get me killed fast so I learned patience the hard way.Story: The story is definitely not clear at first, but in time things become obvious after 4 playthroughs lol.  You learn you're a hero who has entered the fog to save the world.  You will meet many NPC who have given up trying to save the world, prisoners you save, and a few villians as well.  Each of them will tell you what has happened and their experiences as well.  My favorite NPC was Biorr of the Twin Fangs because of his excellent commentary and fighting abilities. 4/4Character development: Not really a game based on character development.  Yes you can level up your character and yes you can be good and bad I guess.  The good and bad decisions are really never bad or good.  Yes you can kill all of the NPC, but they all come back in the next playthrough lol.  The only consequences are dying too much in body form in the worlds thus giving you PBWT thus making it harder to kill enemies, but you get more souls and better drops that way.  Your character doesn't even talk lol.  Still I enjoyed seeing my character die and die and die again lol.  3/3.Artwork/graphics/character design:  These levels were done amazingly well.  My favorite levels were definitely 1 and 4.  I really didn't 5 because it didn't suit my fighting style lol.  The swamp slowed my endurance down too much, but the level was amazing and creepy to look at.  3/3.Overall, the hardest game I played but it was worth it.  This game had a long learning curve and I messed up a lot on my first playthrough.  Learning techniques of fighting and adjusting were hard.  Even the typical monsters were hard to kill sometimes like the skeltons in world 4.  All I have to say is good luck and learn to adapt to your enemies and exploit their weaknesses.10/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2013"}
{"product_name":"B007FQUEZ8","reviewerName":"teejay","summary":"A real 2nd-Gen MGS experience on a portable is definitely worth having if you own a vita","reviewText":"Full disclosure: MGS3 is probably one of my favorite games of all time. Despite being a military game, I find playing this game very relaxing. The pace sneaking around in camo in the immersive forest environment is almost a zen thing for me, and for relaxing in bed at the end of the night, it can't be beat.  When Peacewalker came out I got my first taste of what that could really be like as the MG3-style gameplay was -mostly- captured in Peacewalker. But this, my friends, is the real thing.MGS3 on the vita is a sight to behold. Gameplay, graphics, story - it's all there. Some changes to the controls were necessary due to the lack of L2/L3/R2/R3 and touch sensitive face buttons, but it's been mostly remapped well enough although as its been stated earlier, aiming rifles and the like in first-person hasn't gotten any easier. I actually like the touch screen item selection better, it makes a lot of sense, but the touch screen cure menu could have been implemented more naturally. As it is, you need to touch the wound, then touch the item  you want to use, then press the up button on the D-pad(?) - It took me 10 minutes and listening to the tutorial from Para-Medic twice to catch what I was missing.Incidentally - it was a nice touch to get the original voice actors to re-record all the tutorial sections in the game that changed, but the matching of old recordings to new wasn't perfect, and you can hear where it was done if you listen. Not a huge distraction, but it's there, like a bad f-bomb overdub in a prime-time TV movie.This is the Subsistence version of MGS3 as well, so as a bonus you also get the original MSX versions of Metal Gear 1 & 2, so what you're really getting is FOUR games, not two. These games are fantastic in their own right, but being 8-bit NES style games, they're kind of irritating to play on a full-size console, but PERFECT for a portable. These two games could be released on their own on the PSN and people would probably buy them, so bundling them in with MGS2 & 3 is a nice touch.You'll notice I'm not really reviewing MGS2 yet - I haven't played it. But if it's as good as the MGS3 port, it won't disappoint. While these games aren't the killer-app the Vita needs, they really show how a true console experience can be had with a Vita. As a parent, my PS3 spends more time collecting dust than playing games anymore, but having a portable unit like a Vita, along with the ability to play for a few minutes, pause, and come back to the gameplay in a moment works a lot better for me.  MGS:HD is not going to convince anyone to buy a Vita, but if you have one, you owe it to yourself to pick this title up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2012"}

{"product_name":"B002I0GF72","description":"","reviewerName":"Quoad Toad","summary":"Not a great introduction to Zelda games","reviewText":"This review is geared to those new to Zelda games, like me.  I decided to give this Zelda game a try because the concept sounded like a lot of fun.  I was drawn to the idea of sailing around and exploring colorful islands, while fighting monsters along the way.  The concept itself reminded me of Assassin's Creed Black Flag, which I enjoyed a lot.I didn't like the execution of Wind Waker.  First, there aren't all that many enemies to defeat in this game.  While I enjoy exploration in games,  it gets tedious when there's not a whole lot to collect (your wallet can only contain a very limited amount of money).  The game has a lot of areas where you have to jump/climb to get from place to place and if you fall or have to backtrack, you have to climb back up or jump over the same pit that was tedious climb the first time.When enemies do appear, they are usually very easy to kill.  The frustration I felt in this game had mostly to do with the large amount of climbing/jumping/back tracking.  Fights with enemies are usually over in a few second.  If there does happen to be a difficult enemy and your die, you often end up having to navigate back to that same area, which is especially irritating when you have to climb to get there.Playing this game felt like work instead of fun and so I ended up giving up on it after about 10 hours of play.This game does deserve some credit.  The colors are beautiful and the atmosphere itself feels happy.  The concept is captivating.  I just wish the game play itself wasn't so tedious.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2014"}

{"product_name":"B004FS8LYK","description":"","reviewerName":"The Matrix Fan \"Video Gamer since 1979.\"","summary":"\"You can do this...You're a Croft.\"","reviewText":"+ PROS:+ An enjoyable 'gritty reboot' of the Tomb Raider series+ Borrows gameplay elements fromBatman: Arkham Asylumand theUnchartedgames+ Upgradable skills and weapons for the main game and multiplayer mode- CONS:- Tomb puzzles are almost too easy- Several missable trophies which can require another playthrough- Multiplayer mode is unbalancedPLOT:Our introduction to Lara Croft isn't the battle-hardened Lara we've come to accept over the years - this is an origin story. It's her first journey, on the ship Endurance. Ignoring the advice of her companions, The Endurance heads into the Dragon's Triangle. The ship is pulled apart by a violent storm leaving the survivors stranded on an isolated island. Lara is separated from the others and wakes up in a room filled with human remains, but manages to escape while a cave collapses around her. As Lara emerges on the side of a cliff, she sees the skeletal remains of ships on the shore below.She's wounded, tired, and alone...and her adventure is just beginning.GAMEPLAY:As with other games in the old series, Tomb Raider is presented as a 3rd person adventure game, with some stealth elements. When we first start out, we have no weapons, no special skills, and no tutorial level to practice jumping in Lara's mansion, as we had in the 1996 version. No, we're put right into the action here. We have to learn how to hunt, find weapons, and scavenge for upgrades.Lara can upgrade 9 different survival skills, 8 hunter skills, and 7 brawler skills. Throughout the island, there are hidden tombs which hold treasure maps, and other goodies.Some areas are inaccessible until we unlock certain upgrades (such as the shotgun for blasting through obstacle blockades, or the rope arrow to access certain areas).In combat, we can either use long range weapons such as a bow or a shotgun, or we can get up close and personal with a pickaxe or a well-placed arrow to the knee. There are some Quick Time Events during battles which allow Lara to perform finishing moves, or special attacks to weaken her opponents.The Quick Time Events also happen during cutscene transitions - so Lara might have to dodge a tree limb, avoid falling over a cliff, or punch someone with a well-timed press of a button.  No rest for the weary.Lara also has an ability called Survival Instinct - with the push of the L2 button, Lara can perceive nearby animals, hostiles, and even collectible items.This is the first game in the Tomb Raider universe which offers a multiplayer mode. There are three campaigns:(1) Team Deathmatch, a player-versus-player combat mode which lasts up to three separate matches.(2) Private Rescue, where the survivors have to take medical supplies to a specific area, and the scavengers need to reach a certain number of kills, all within 10 minutes.(3) Cry for Help, where the survivors search around and retrieve batteries for defended radio beacons while being hunted by the scavengers.TROPHIES:There are 51 trophies to earn in this game. Most of them revolve around collecting items like GPS caches, upgrading all your skills & weapons, finding all the hidden tombs, hunting certain animals and using specific weapons to rack up kills.**NOTE: If you're a trophy collector, 3 of them are missable in this game, so be sure to look up the requirements before you start playing!**15 of the trophies can only be earned in multiplayer mode. They run the spectrum from killing two people with one explosion, to reviving a teammate, to buying all upgrades & character models.PROS:I wasn't sure what to expect with a 'gritty reboot' of the Tomb Raider series, but I was very pleased with the result. I was able to identify with this character much easier than her 1996 counterpart. In that game, Lara was shooting bats and bears with her two-handed pistols (and their infinite ammunition) before 10 minutes had passed. Here, I didn't even start with a knife!This game uses the same dynamic as Batman: Arkham Asylum. When you first start out, you're not the battle-hardened Lara - she's scared, and she's inexperienced. I got killed more times than I care to admit. But while the game progressed and Lara became more accustomed to using her skills, I found myself becoming a more skilled combatant, which lead to me enjoying the story all the more.In the Uncharted series, we've been able to see all our collectible treasures in a separate window, and Tomb Raider also lets us do this. We can rotate the items or reread documents at our leisure, just like Drake. The folks at Crystal Dynamics clearly saw what worked for the games by Rocksteady Studios and Naughty Dog, Inc., and brought those elements together for an enjoyable Tomb Raider experience.I liked the upgrade system here. You have to gather experience by either hunting, exploring or combat. You can also use salvageable materials to fashion better weapons. I upgraded my survivor skills first to live off the land and gain experience faster, but there are excellent benefits to becoming a more efficient hunter or brawler.CONS:Firstly, I didn't find the tomb puzzles very complicated. Many of them require the player to pay attention to elements like timing or weight-distribution. A seasoned Tomb-Raider player from the 90s might find them overly simple, but for a person that's never played any of the previous games, these puzzles will present a few challenges. However, once you solve one, the others are very similar.Next, the trophies. A few of the trophies can only be earned during the single-player story. Because this game auto-saves, if you complete the game and miss your opportunity, you'll have to start the game all over again. There are three confirmed missable trophies, but thankfully, there's more than enough guides online to walk you through getting them. If you're not a trophy hunter, this isn't too big of a problem.Finally, the multiplayer mode. In my experience, this mode was horribly unbalanced. The first few times I played, I was matched up with opponents anywhere from level 31 to level 60, while I was a lowly level 1. My enemies had perfected their skills of jump-shotting around corners and under bridges, and could take out enemies on a rope slide with one arrow.But me? I was having trouble figuring out basic elements like swapping between my rifle and my grenades!As I slowly improved, I found that 95% of my quick joins to multiplayer put me into Team Deathmatch, which seems to get the most traffic. It's hard to get a bead on someone when they're jumping around like Peter Cottontail, and when you're a low-level player, this means your weapons will have a slow reload time...so you'll be used as target practice for the more experienced players.THE GLITCH REPORT:Thankfully, my game experience had very few glitches.In one sequence, Lara had to fix an elevator. When I fixed it, I couldn't get inside the elevator without instantly dying for no apparent reason.My next glitch came in the Summit Forest, Lara's Survival Instinct stopped working and I had to reboot the game to fix it...going back to the main menu didn't correct the issue.The last glitch was at Shipwreck Beach...everything was in slow-motion when I arrived. I had to reboot the game and thankfully this didn't happen again.FINAL VERDICT:I thoroughly enjoyed this gritty reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise. The main story was pretty linear, but there was more than enough backtracking to pick up missing objects and optional challenges to give it an open-ended feel. The combat was easy to adapt to, the music was epic, and the scenery was absolutely breathtaking.I didn't care for the multiplayer modes, but I would highly recommend this to adventure gamers, especially folks who like the Uncharted series.Rated M for blood & gore, intense violence and strong language. Several of the death scenes are very graphic in nature - parental discretion is definitely advised.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2013"}

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"Nightmare","summary":"Amazing system","reviewText":"There's not much to say that others haven't already said, but I would like to offer my opinion to the masses already here.  I have been playing the Wii since it came out, and it's still going strong.  But for the record, let me point out that you should read this review with the understanding that I am a huge Nintendo fan.  Also, I am a 22 year old Male who's been playing video games since the original NES.The Wii is truly awesome.  The motion controls, from swinging the remote as a sword to using it as a steering wheel, make for some very exciting experiences.  Although some games don't use this feature very well (sloppy motion to on-screen translation), the ones that apply it properly are gems.  Some examples are Madworld, Mario Party 8, Zelda: Twilight Princess, Mario Kart, and Wii Play.The pointer is a huge plus.  It reads extremely well on every game I have played that utilizes this feature.  Metroid Prime 3, Super Mario Galaxy, Zelda, Wii Play, and Red Steel are great examples of how good this can work.  Shooters, like Metroid Prime 3, are greatly augmented by being able to point and shoot with such accuracy.  It adds a realistic layer of skill to shooters that I find very immersing.There are plenty of games that can use the Gamecube controller or Classic controller attachment instead for those that don't like the Wii controller--Guilty Gear XX Accent Core, Super Smash Brothers Brawl, etc.  Virtual Console downloads are awesome, as well as some of the Wii Ware games that have emerged.  Having the opportunity to download great games from the NES, SNES, NeoGeo, Sega, Turbo Grafx, etc. adds some serious value to the Wii, in my opinion.  Backwards compatibility with all GCN games is cool as well.The Wii has frozen a few times in the middle of a game, but it's very rare.  The overall performance of the Wii is excellent.  It doesn't over heat, the electric power usage is (understandably) less than the other major systems, and its nice compact size is very appealing.The problem that a lot of people have with this system is the \"lack\" of \"mature\" games.  I will admit that if you are into hard core shooters, the Wii is not the best system (although the Conduit might change that).  RPGs aren't very common either.  However, there are plenty of great games that older gamers can enjoy on the Wii.  For example, Zelda, Metroid Prime 3, Mad World, No More Heroes, Medal of Honor: Heroes, Super Mario Galaxy, Battalion Wars 2, Okami (a PS2 port with Motion Controls added), Resident Evil 4 (what many people consider to be the best version), Excite Truck, and others.  There are also many more coming out in the future.To summarize my points, the Wii's controller features can be very effective when used properly.  The pointer is very efficient for shooters, the motion controls add plenty of depth, and there are some really great games for the system.  It's not going to be everybody's favorite, but it's definitely mine.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2009"}

(it offers you Powers Not to kill it)some of the quests have moral choices that will really  pull on your emotions about people and things like power over friendship and the feel you have an impact upon the surrounding world.everything you choose to do has a \"ripple effect\" so your action will be known throughout the world. the characters control via one of two ways,one is using the hack & slash method though this is harder then hitting pause so you can set all your mages attacks etc.there's a lot of micromanagement in this but for loot mongers and rpg lovers this will be one of the years ultimate treats I assure you. there seems to be loot everywhere for those that search every area rather thourough. I also must say the amount of DLC available at this time for the collectors edition is amazing. (non collector edition owners will pay 6.99 and 14.99 for both dlc packs)the graphics are excellent (though not mind blowing)particle effects are wickedly done and the quests are crafted well enough to let you know you have many approaches to each \"situation\"and will pull at your emotions. if you weren't lucky enough to get this collectors edition no worries I know the goodies will be released as DLC to everyone eventually since they listed prices (wardens keep 6.99 and the stone prisoner 14.99)you have many abilities such as settinhg traps, stealing, dual wielding and so much more. while the game may be a bit \"baldurs gat-ish) it's the BEST RPG on ps3 without a doubt.the skill trees are similar to those you've seen in baldurs gate, diablo II and others. another thing is they must have over 200+ voice actors since I have not heard ANY voices repeat.excellent actors such as Tim Curry, Kate Mulgrew, Claudia Black and more!an excellent creature variety, large skill trees,great loot and D&D; style gameplay make this titleone of my all time fav's.Graphics: Excellent and crispy. not mind blowing but perfect for me 4 1/2 stars great spell effects! excellent creature models and good variety of them.Sound: the voice work is Top Notch and hundreds of actorseven the crickets put on a great perfomance! 5 stars!the sound is a star here, the voice talent is top notch.Gameplay: the micromanagement might put a few off but most will never let go of the controller since they got the controls so spot on for the ps3 on this title. it's amazing! 5 stars.the controls are well mapped to the ps3 controller.Fun: Yes Yes Yes! betray a friend or help him in a \"forbidden\" quest, help a grey warden or not?, kill a demon or trust the mouse? so many choices it's unreal! want to slay a dragon? you can!want to go into dungeons and hack away, you can!it's a Mature game so some of the things you can do are a tad graphic and as someone reminded me you end every battle absolutely painted in blood.the game is brilliant what more can I say? 5 Stars!!Overall: the package wraps up nicely into a 5 star Must Have!the Gods at Bioware have greated the best \"baldurs gate\" style game yet! it's brilliant! you have to buy it asap if you don't you're missing THE BEST RPG experience of the year and possibly in my lifetime. (it's Very similar to Baldurs gate Dark Alliance)this coming from a Hardcore70's D&D; player!!!that's what I'd call an endorsement!Dragon age origins is the RPG to buy.EDIT: the Ultimate edition ships the 25th with ALL the DLC and the Awakenings disc!Buy it here (ultimate edition)Dragon Age Origins: Ultimate Edition","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2009"}

You could probably imagine my disappointment when I heard how much of a train-wreck Sonic '06 was. Ever since then, I've witnessed the downfall of Sonic the Hedgehog. This is one of those games that really needs a redo.Pros:1-The Secret Rings has great graphics-Sonic looks so realistic, you could probably imagine him popping out of your TV.2-The party games are pretty fun when you get a few people to play with you, but I wouldn't recommend playing alone-they're called party games.3-It seems like a lot has been focused on the music. Yeah, the music's good, and I like the Seven Rings in Hand song, but it just doesn't seem like our spiky blue hedgehog. Other than that, it's good.Cons:1-Sonic games do NOT need more human women. I really did NOT think Sonic 06 would go that far with Elise and Sonic, but they did, and it was just plain disgusting. Sonic isn't Shadow for one, and for two, Sonic should just stick to Amy.2-Where the HELL is Tails in this game? Tails was Sonic's first best friend and sidekick (I'm talking about the games, not Archie). I never wanted Tails to be some infomaniac like Ali Baba. I think Tails should have had a bigger role.3-Robotnik is evil. Then WHY is Erazor evil, not the famous Egg Head? I'm complaining a lot about the characters, I know, but it's only because his name is being destroyed along with all the other Sonic characters. I liked Sonic games better back then, when Robotnik ACTUALLY KILLED PEOPLE!!!4-The game seems to be all about speed. Half the time, I don't even know where I'm going. I liked Sonic games when you could take your time and roam around freely. Now there always seems to be one path for our blue hero. Not even two--one.I think that's about all I have to say. The cons out-balance the pros, so that's bad.

{"product_name":"B000R37S00","description":"The legendary action game Castlevania: Rondo of Blood is reborn on the PSP system with incredible 3D graphics and timeless side scrolling gameplay in Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles. Gamers take up the Vampire Killer whip as Richter Belmont as they seek to destroy the maniacal Dracula once and for all in this pivotal piece of the ongoing Castlevania saga. Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles also includes the original Rondo of Blood and Symphony of the Night games, delivering incredible gameplay and value while updating two of the most beloved video games of all time for a new generation of gamers.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Rondo of Blood in the US for the First Time","reviewText":"Castlevania Dracula X Chronicles is a big collection of sorts.  It contains the never before released: Rondo of Blood.  A different version of this game came to the Super Nintendo in 1995 and was called Dracula X.  However, this version was completely different from the original which appeared on the Turbo Grafx-16 in Japan.  For more than a decade, American gamers have been wondering when they'll get the chance to play Rondo of Blood.  Now is the time.Rondo of Blood is more or less the prequel to the all time best: Symphony of the Night.  You control Richter Belmont on a quest to defeat Dracula.  Something the Belmont clan does each and every time Dracula is resurrected.  There isn't much of a story here.  There are some cutscenes but not much else.  The original Rondo of Blood, however, was not huge on story either.  It was, however, big on gameplay and that's exactly where Rondo of Blood hits a high and a low point at the same time.If you can remember the Castlevania games before 1997's Symphony of the Night, you'll instantly be able to familiarize yourself with the gameplay.  You play as Richter and you use the whip to smite your enemies.  You also have your fair share of sub weapons like knives, axes and the cross.  It's all simplistic stuff.  You'll go traversing through the levels and fighting bosses at the end of each level.  It takes no time flat to learn the game because it plays exactly like the old school Castlevania games of the NES and SNES days.  However, it seems like too much comes from that era.To say Castlevania Dracula X Chronicles is hard is an understatement.  The game can be downright punishing.  Especially for those who've never played a Castlevania game.  It's great that it's a challenge, but it's only a challenge because they didn't work on mechanics that weren't so good in the early Castlevania games to begin with.  Jumping for example is clunky.  You have little control once you jump.  In fact, the majority of your deaths will probably come from you falling into pits.  Either because you land on an enemy and fly back or because you don't make the jump.  And since you have little control when you jump, it actually gets annoying.  It seems like a minor issue, but trying to survive this through several stages is annoying.  They changed almost nothing about the game.  The enemies (particularly bosses) do a good decent amount of damage as well.  If you're looking for a challenge, you'll definitely find it here.  The problem is that it sometimes borders on frustration rather than actual challenge.  In other words, this game is old school right down to the core. With that in mind, it goes without saying that the game is fairly short.For those interested you can also unlock the original Symphony of the Night.  This will certainly please some of the more hardcore Castlevania fans who consider it to be the best in the series.Rondo of Blood is a 2D side-scroller.  It scrolls from one end of the level to the other, but the characters and enemies are all 3D.  The game also has lots of 3D environments.  It's actually pretty good looking and runs just fine.  The music, of course, is fantastic.  Casltevania is known for having some of the greatest music in gaming.  Rondo of Blood certainly isn't the best soundtrack in the series, but it is definitely a good one.  There is voice acting in the cutscenes, but it's not very good.  You can, at least, change the voices to Japanese if you so choose.The Dracula X Chronicles is a really good game.  It's really fun and exciting, but in some merits it is just too old school for its own good.  It's a great game, but not for anyone who began with games from the post Symphony of the Night era.The Good:+Release of a good game never before released in the United States+Great graphics+Fantastic soundtrack+Fun gameplay and easy to pick up on+Some really nice cutscenes to advance the story+You can unlock Symphony of the NightThe Bad:-Frustrating jumping mechanics-Very difficult games","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2007"}

At the time of this writing, Treyarch have released four patches for this game, some of which aren't rollups (meaning, you have to install 1.2 before you can install 1.4).  Despite this many fixes, critical bugs go ignored.  \"Hard Landing\", for example, can take you all the way to the end, only to not actually finish the mission--instead of a short speech followed by the last leg of the sequence, your team stand around and nothing happens.  Reloading doesn't fix this bug, either:  you have to replay the entire level, again and again, and hope this time your men continue to the end.  I was shocked to find this is a problem across all platforms, and disappointed when the official website didn't even seem to acknowledge the many posts regarding the issue.The odd part is that some levels almost seem to be written by entirely different groups of people:  a smooth Russian rooftop chase across Stalingrad armed only with a sniper rifle ends in impressive gameplay, but then an American push through a jungle river takes forever because the enemies seem bulletproof.  When a soldier is fountaining blood ten feet in the air and I've just stitched a red happy-face across their torso, their next action should not be to leap over a log and bayonet the team-mate standing behind me.Which is unfortunately the other flaw:  teammates will jump in front of your fire.  They will run up to you and push you out of the way, sometimes when you're taking careful aim with the gun to your shoulder.  Your commanding officer says, \"Follow me--the supply truck, up there!\" and then proceeds to do nothing for minutes on end before finally giving a different order and going off in another direction.  It's as if the AI gets impatient with you for not charging in guns blazing, and decides to occasionally nudge you out of cover and in front of the enemy just to get rid of you.All in all, the environment and gameplay of Call of Duty: World at War are impressive, but it's disappointing that the team-play dynamic and the realism of combat are so seemingly hampered.  With luck I hope Treyarch are able to smooth out the inconsistencies before too many more gigabytes of patches need to be applied.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2009"}

The gameplay was also a a mix for myself, while standard if you played RE4 or 5 the camera angle controls were sometimes an annoyance to use especially when you were battling a boss or other powerful monster.  The effects/graphics/soundtrack fit incredibly well and the voice cast did a superb job in their roles it's also a little neat how all they writers interweave the trials that happen to each player couple into the main storyline very well and of course you can't have a recent Re game without the Ada Wong hidden level too.If you're a fan of the RE series or action games then this one is a good choice but just a warning to the RE fans while overall the game will be entertaining keep the expectations to a more realistic level or you will feel some disappointment...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2012"}

Undercover investigations weave players through a murderous web of gangs and deceit as they battle crooks, Marcus' past and everything else the city throws at them.","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Trying too Hard; hits Technical Shortcomings","reviewText":"This review was written by James Shea, my son.The sequel to True Crime: Streets of LA, \"True Crime New York City\" takes the main idea of Grand Theft Auto and changes some key element; for example, the main character is a cop, rather than a criminal, and the game takes place in a map that is based on the actual NYC.The general story follows an ex-gang member who joins up with the NYPD to follow in the footsteps of a family friend, and simultaneously tries to escape the influence of his crime-lord father. The story progresses to involve corrupt police, gang members, and the mafia. Like \"Streets of LA\", the player can choose to be a good cop (arresting suspects, using non-lethal blows, turning in evidence) or a bad cop (killing suspects, pawning evidence, and generally being corrupt). This leads to two different endings, but not as many branches as in Streets of LA.The gameplay elements are fairly diverse. The controls, to start, are absolutely terrible. They're complicated, they don't handle well, and oftentimes they don't go where they're supposed to. The range of activities, and how the player deals with a given scenario, is extensive. There are many random crimes comitted across the city to deal with, ranging from a stolen car on the loose to a gang showdown to an assault and battery. There are many ways to deal with these problems. A good cop dealing with a sidewalk full of gang members has to flash his badge or fire some warning shots before they'll cooperate; a bad cop can simply run them all over with his car. Good cops need to only arrest legitimate criminals; bad cops can plant evidence to boost their reputation for getting an arrest. However, due to the bad controls, sometimes good cops may slip up and accidentally break a neck or some other unapproved act. This limits the full potential of the game. At the same time, civilians aren't entirely helpless, either. Frisk the wrong guy for drugs and he might just decide to pull a taser or a handgun. However, in a lot of regards there is no penalty (besides a bad cop rating) for running over civilians or your fellow officers.The graphics are decent to good, and the sound has lots of good licensed music. However, the main issue in the game is the lack of crowds. Considering that the game takes place in NYC, the entire city should be jam-packed, but due to the software and hardware limits there are only four or five people on a sidewalk generally. This makes the game feel like it's more ambitious than it can afford.As a whole, this game isn't terribly good; despite a lot of neat attempts, the game ultimately falls short due to a wide variety of technical shortcomings. It just seems like it's trying too hard to be GTA, and this makes it lose a lot of the little things that it had going for it.Rating: 6/10.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2008"}

Many knock the game for the things it doesn't share with RB(full set of instruments, less dowloadable content)  I will celebrate the differences.  You wouldn't want 2 of the same game out there.  GH3 is much more difficult than RB and offers more guitar centric tracks(for obvious reasons)  Suprisingly, GH3 out trumps RB in forms of difficulty progression and actually telling a story.  In RB you basically play songs in different locations until you see the end credits.  I didn't even realize the last song of the game was the final song because it was just as difficult as the rest of the songs.  You won't make that mistake in GH3.  The final 3 songs are probably the hardest time ive had with the genre( even on normal) and the Dragonforce song that plays during the credits is unbelievable.  I like the story in GH3.  I wont spoil it but you basically go from rags to riches to infamy.  All in all, at some points the game seems too hard and the play list is kind of hit or miss.  All in all GH3 is worth a buy if you find RB too easy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2008"}

Fox \"billfy\"","summary":"The best modern Final Fantasy game yet!","reviewText":"Sure, FFVII was a huge leap in graphics and gameplay, and VIII and IX improved at least in the graphics area (I wasn't too thrilled with the stories in VIII and IX), but X blows them all away.The first Final Fantasy to take advantage of the PS2 with it's superior memory and graphics capabilities.  FFX's graphics are superb!  There are basically 3 different levels of graphics, the gameplay, which is the lowest in detail, the cutscenes, which are slightly higher in graphics, and the full motion videos, which are absolutely the best I've seen in any game!  One of the best examples of the high quality video capabilities is the first time you see Lulu (the magic user) in a FMV.  The detail in her costume (especially the belts) is the best I've seen for the PS2.Setting the graphics aside (Hey, it's a FF game, you should expect great graphics) and on to the game itself:About twice as long as any of the recent games (VII, VIII &amp; IX were about 20 hours or so if you zipped through), FFX will take at least 30 hours to beat, and that is if you know what you are doing.One thing that might disappoint fans of the Final Fantasy series is that FFX is a lot more dirrect than the other games were.  Although I am not very familiar with IX (and told I hadn't missed much), FFVII and VIII allowed for a lot of wandering around to build up levels, this was done mainly in wandering around on the map and running into random groups of monsters.  But FFX is missing the map that you may be familiar with, in fact there isn't much of a chance to wander around at all.  75% of the game is spent on a narrow trail with very few intersections and choices in dirrections.  For the most part of the game you are given a single trail, and a direction (given on the small transparent blue map that is a familiar site).Another big change in gameplay is the way that your character increases their skill.  There are no &quot;levels&quot; really, instead you earn points from battles which eventually give you &quot;levels&quot; but those levels are then spent in conjunction with spheres that you pick up along the way in an elaborate system of earning HP, MP, magic, and specials.  I'd try and explain it, but it isn't important, and it is explained in the game.With this latest installment in the FF series Square has continued it's streak of keeping in head of the other RPGs, and eating hours of our time that should probably be spent sleeping, but you just couldn't find that save spot that wasn't in the middle of a plot twist until about 4AM.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2001"}

I bought this on the 22nd of marchas of this writing it's april 12th (my old ps3 died and thus the delay)the graphics aren't Improved so much as Cleaned up and the game even jestsabout the \"muddy browns of ferelden\".the camios by DA:O Characters are a very nice addition as well as a special trophy for loading your old DA: Origins save and letting this effect your plotline (you may select from several preset plotlines or go it from scratch)the character customization felt rather pointless here since I was Forced to play a specific character I figured Might as well leave him alone and skipped customizing him (you do get a decent amount of freedom though)the class I played through was Warrior and I had a good time BUT at no time did it ever feel as Epic as Dragon Age: Origins did. it felt lifeless and the reused environments do get dull after a while and this coming from a dragon age nut!I should say, those looking for more darkspawn slaughter might want to rent first. the primary enemy type seems to be a rogue/assasin/templar which is the same character model for all three. the rest such as the returning Rage Demons you'll not see until about halfway through the game.I am not really sure what my story line did from Dragon Age Originsto Dragon Age II (though I've only played through Once just did Both endings while I was there lol)except for the trophy (which is a gold so I'm good)the \"new\" hack & slash style combat is not what I prefer. I do love hack & slash games (such as diabloII)but this seems a setback for the franchise. I really like what the game got right and most of what it does wrong didn't bother me much Except the combat.the animations are very fast and hard to see at times, the mage animations are really excellent though. overall the ending is Not epic and you'll not even figure out whom the main antagonist is, until over halfway through the game and you will do A Lot of fetch quests. also if you miss a single resource and time passes (three years pass at a certain point in the game)it's gone and you will have to play through again for the crafter trophy (Ugh!)Overall a solid RPG that never needed fixing just More added to it!Graphics: much cleaner and more vibrant 4 of 5 starsGameplay: ugh the new fighting style you'll love or hate. 2 of 5 starsSound/Voice Acting: as usual Bioware delivers with all camios delivered by the original actors and the battles sound good (when not too clangy)overall the sound is good 3 of 5 stars the voice acting 4 of 5 starsFun: the game is really fun for fans of the first title and importing your game just drives you to play more. the camios are excellent voiced by the same people and great to see again. the hack & slash style puts some off others love it. I'm in the middle. the game is really fun though 4 of 5 stars!Overall: not nearly as solid as Dragon Age: Origins nor as Epic but worth it to rabid DAO fans or someone looking for a decent hack & slash RPG Fix.3 of 5 starsTech issues: I had the game freeze TWO times during peak fights so save often!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2011"}

Bullets flying every which way, grenades, RPGs, attack dogs, shouts from your team mates, it's pure chaos and it's wonderful. I've found out one thing while playing this game, I would suck as a combat soldier. I'm not much for online combat so I can't comment on that part. What I really liked about playing this game was the frequent checkpoints. If you get killed you don't have to start way back like so many games. I'm very happy I bought this game.Great graphics and sound effects (my neighbor must really hate me now).

I will only discuss the multiplayer at this point because realistically, I believe the majority of gamers will be buying this game to play it online.When I first jumped on-line, I was immediately struck with how familiar the game play felt. The phrase \"evolution, not revolution\" really comes to mind in describing the game play.  I felt like I was playing a re-skinned version of MW2.  The controls are exactly the same, which is good, but nearly everything else about the game play itself just feels a little overly familiar.  Calling in the recon plane, stopping an enemy just short of a kill streak, etc., it all just felt like I was still playing MW2 but on new maps.Ironically, even though this is the next installment of the franchise, the graphics seem a bit drab and generic, at least on some of the maps.  It appears to be a different graphics engine, and it lacks the polish and detail that was present in MW2.  The character animations look pretty generic.  In the end, it is really the game play that matters(and it is very good), but I was surprised the graphics appear inferior to MW2.Leveling up and acquiring new weapons, attachments, and perks has been changed up a bit.  You still generate XP, which moves you up the ladder to different levels, level 1, 2, 3, etc.  What's new is that as you acquire XP, you also accumulate COD points.  As you level up, you will unlock new weapons as before, but rather than having to complete challenges to unlock new weapon attachments, multiple attachments are simultaneously available that you can purchase with your COD points.  Think of it like this:  Your XP is the cover charge into the bar, but you still need money in your pocket to buy the drinks you want.  I like this approach because I don't want to waste time unlocking an ACOG scope that I won't use so I can get to the unlock for a red-dot scope, which I will use. This ability to customize is an improvement on MW2.Aside from straight kills, another way to generate COD points is to purchase contracts, which offer a COD point reward upon completion.  Some are pretty attainable, like killing three enemies in a row without dying.  You pay 25 points to purchase that contract and gain 250 when you complete it.  Another contract involves using your knife to kill a single opponent.  There are contracts that appeal to all play abilities and offer a nice new, personal goal to attain when playing online.  I like this concept because it offers additional goals beyond just trying to have a decent kill/death ratio.  Each contract has a cooling period where you can't repurchase it until a specified period of time has passed.You can also still customize your emblem, although you now get to pay for the privilege with your COD points.  I am not sure how much I like having to pay for this ability, but I must admit the first time I saw my customized emblem adorned on my weapon as a new \"gun emblem\" I was pretty impressed.  Another nice new feature is the ability to save or upload movies of your matches.  That is pretty welcome.Finally, there is a combat training mode that allows you to play all the maps against bots offline. (although you must be online to play it).  The bots are actually pretty good at simulating a real opponent, and this mode allows you to get familiar with each map without getting slaughtered on-line.  You can also unlock most of the same weapons and attachments, so you can try out new weapons and tactics without sacrificing a few matches to learn whether you like them or not.  A cool feature of the training mode is that the bots are all named from your friends list, rather than generic, computer-generated names.  I was laughing out loud when I was killed by my friends, or vice versa, when they weren't really playing.  I thought it was a nice touch to personalize it this way and it really adds to the immersion that you are playing a real on-line match.  This mode will be excellent to learn all the little hiding spots that snipers will exploit on-line.Speaking of snipers, after putting in a fair amount of gameplay, I should point out that the map design seems improved over MW2.  The variety of maps is excellent, and vary from spread out areas to close quarter battle maps.  The ability to quick scope or camp and snipe are happily gimped.  The weapons balance is also excellent - the weapons you start with in multiplayer allow you to compete against higher ranked players just fine.  So far, I haven't encountered any uber-weapons that seem unbalanced and unfair.The popular zombie mode is also present, which when combined with the training mode, online mode, and single player campaign, really provide a fair amount of content for your gaming dollar.  If you liked MW2 and are ready for a subtle, but not overwhelming change, you should be pleased with Black Ops.  You will immediately feel at home, but it is fresh enough to be a comfortable second home.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2010"}
