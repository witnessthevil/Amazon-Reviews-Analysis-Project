{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"Omnes","summary":"L.A. NOIRE","reviewText":"Released by Studio Bondi amidst huge controversies between its founder and his employees, L.A. NOIRE is a video game that got stuck during seven years of 'development hell' (2004-2011). Set in 1946-1947, it is the story of a young police officer (Cole Phelps) who quickly becomes a popular detective in the LAPD, but also uncovers a Los Angeles filled with corruption. Drugs, rapes, thieves, arson, there's in this story enough dirty laundry - based on true incidents from that time period - to please all fans of David Lynch (Blue Velvet, Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks) and of Mad Men. Speaking of Mad Men, many actors from that show got to perform roles in L.A. NOIRE, most notably Aaron Staton (Cole Phelps), either by voice acting or by motion capture of their faces reactions as the story goes on.So far the animation is very credible to the player's eyes, as much as the design of this virtual portion of Los Angeles which has been apparently well-replicated based on what L.A.'s streets looked like at this time period. The props, buildings and outdoor effects are a treat to look at, though the only criticism (small one mind you) is that some of those textures will take a longer time to completely load during cutscenes or the gameplay, even when you have installed the whole game on your Xbox Drive. As for the soundtrack, players get to listen both to real radio shows that were broadcast in the forties and to an official soundtrack made by various artists (Andrew and Simon Hale, Fly, Claudia Brucken). What a treat for fans of the forties; who can also, in the game's options, play the game either in color or in 'black and white', as if they were watching an old movie.The gameplay mixes both the main storyline and secondary situations that Cole and his partner (depending on the department) have to deal with. Players can do those secondary situations either during an investigation or during a free play where they can roam around the city and solve cases that they may have missed. So far there are no achievements that seem to me impossible to complete, but there are others which you will maybe have to retry again and again to succeed, (example: using every weapon in the game, finding all the movie reels, all the police badges, shooting a certain prop during a fight, etc.).The X Box Live marketplace offers a few investigations not included in the official game, but have to be bought on its online service (either manually or with a special ticket available on the X Box Marketplace/Copy bought at a store). You don't necessarily need those investigations to complete the game, but those stories add more details to a game that was supposed to offer more levels in the beginning (six departments), but didn't get to as the Studio Bondi's management problems took a toll on the game's quality.So why the five stars even though the game has been done under a cruel and traumatizing work atmosphere, during which certain employees never got the credits they deserved, or came out swearing to never work again in the video game industry? Because it is a rare chance to play a game that forces players to be action efficient and to be also very observant during the investigations and interrogations as everyone's reactions (voice, winks, smiles, eye contacts) may reveal if the person interrogated tells the truth or is in fact lying; if he is, it is then that showing the right proofs can confirm his involvement in the case.Then again, I do hope that the Behind-the-scenes events that happened during L.A. Noire's making - and which have been further detailed in many articles and websites - will force the video game industry to reevaluate its working methods and offer decent working conditions. But I also hope that it will encourage all video game employees to unite together and to better defend their working conditions; making sure that they won't tolerate any rubbish from their employers, and that they won't be leaving the game development industry traumatized and with a sour taste in their soul.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2011"}

Wargames never change.Welcome to the new post-apocalyptia. Our hero emerges into the world after been cocooned into the underground shelter known as the Vault - no, strike that: the Ark, the Ark! The year is 2029 and, following a near-extinction event (namely, the asteroid Apophis spiraling down Earth's gravity well) humanity has pealed back the last vestiges of our civilized facade. Small surviving communities fight to the death for the small pockets of land, shelter and water. They fight off brutal bandits, persistent mutants and each other.SHOOT. LOOT. BARTER. UPGRADE. REPEAT UNTIL SATISFIED.RAGE is a RolePlaying Shooter (RPS), although it plays much more like an FPS than an RPG. There is no leveling up and you have no real inventory. On the other hand, you get missions (apparently no one strained any creativity muscle to think those up), you keep what you kill, you sell the junk you do not need and upgrade whenever you can. There are schematics (buy them whenever you find them) that allow you to MacGyver gadgets and customized weapons out of found components.The characters you meet are quirky and interesting whereas your enemies will react to your killing shot (strangely though, not to all the previous ones!).All in all, the game is fun to play and although its replayability is not that high, it is a game well worth of your attention.AS NEO HAS REPEATEDLY EXPLAINED, WE WILL NEED GUNSAnd by \"guns\" I doubt he meant...WingSticks. These are what you'd get if you were to cross a boomerang with a Ninja-star: they may look good in action but I found them to be far less satisfying than a good shotgun. Do not be disheartened though. Every weapon is extremely beautifully designed and they come with up to four different type of ammo.InBioshockone could complete the entire game by first zapping the enemies and then finishing them off with the wrench. In RAGE you can do the same with electric ammo followed by some WingSticks. And, unlike BioShock, ammo is plentiful in RAGE.IT'S A BEAUTIFUL WASTELAND OUT THERE (IF YOU CAN SEE IT)I was one of the lucky ones because my gaming PC has a single nVidia video card and I am running in a 32bit WinXP environment. ATI cards, SLi stacks and 64bit systems are out of luck: the developer did not care enough to optimize the game for them! Hence the number of gamers complaining about this.So, when they work, the graphics are gorgeous. More artistic than realistic and with great light/shadow transitions. Ever since the originalUnrealI always notice the skies of a game and RAGE has beautiful cumulus and stratus clouds, through which the Sun scorches the Wastelands.So, crack open a cold bottle of Kola-Kong, sit back and enjoy. (No, you do not need to keep the cap. Do I need to keep reminding you that this is notFallout 3!).HAVE BUGGY WILL TRAVEL. THE SLOW SHALL DIE.After so many hours raking Pandora for that perfect Chimera pistol, it was inevitable that once I slipped into yet another sand buggy and start roaming desert vistas I would think ofBorderlands. Buggies here are not only a means to travel but they can also be raced around tracks.They are a good addition, the are fun to handle and they offer a nicely done racing component to a shooter game.CAN YOU STOMACH THIS NEW WORLD?The game comes with surprisingly modest hardware requirements for the eye candy it is. The biggest problem is the HDD space - it will hog ...25GB! For a game that is far from being...100-hours long that is on the excessive side. I had to uninstall no less than 4 games in order to fit this on my primary HDD.Now, the rig I am running RAGE is a two years old Intel Core i7, with 3GB of RAM, nVidia 480GTX (updated to driver 280.26) on a MSI Eclipse running WinXP (SP3) - and it plays at a decent framerate but not free of frequent rendering and the occasional tearing. And this is where the game looses its first star: it is not finished.Consoles are sold at cost and the companies make a profit by pricing console games higher. PC games are different. No one...subsidies our PC systems. So, if you are going to ask for 60$(!) for a PC game, it better be PC-optimized and polished to a shine. And when you think you are done, polish it some more.Otherwise what exactly are you selling, the...promise of someday been able to play the game I pay at such a price?FAST! SHOOT THE VALVE THAT CONTROLS THE STEAM.Yes, RAGE comes with mandatory STEAM tie-in. This means two things. First, for the love of God, if you bought the game retail, activate, then kill the STEAM download, delete the local content that managed to slip through and finally reinstall from your disks. Do you really want to wait for 21.6GB to download?Secondly, this means the $60-game is not yours to keep. You can play with it but you have to leave it in STEAM's playroom when done. You cannot resell it if you so decide and you cannot gift it if you get bored with it. I take a full star off for such DRM schemes; however, if this is not important to you, feel free to adjust my rating accordingly.A FINAL BULLET.Although not that original, RAGE incorporates a number of RPS ideas with gusto and style. Unfortunately, the game has not been polished yet, a number of graphical glitches persist even for nVidia systems. Game publishers should learn the value of respecting both their product and their paying customers.My advice is to wait until the price matches the product.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2011"}

Or the beginning of a new teaching genre?O","reviewText":"Ok I have to start this out with saying I play the piano. Not awesomely, but I read sheet music. The fact that I find reading sheet music easier than playing pro keys kind of bothers me. I don't know if it's just that the learning style is different, if the keyboard should be bigger, or what, but that whole element falls flat on me. One thing I wish is that when you hit a sour note on the keyboard, if you got aural cues telling you where you went wrong, as opposed to a generic click. That's sort of a good frame of reference for really playing the piano. (however I will say the piano tutorials actually delve into music theory so a+ there)It's like HMX had a totally awesome thing going leading up to Beatles Rock Band (which I still think knocked it out of the park) and then squandered it with Green Day Rock Band (seriously?) and then Rock Band 3 which is essentially a really awesome extra long track back with some baffling changes.The menus are annoying to navigate, you now collect spades as well as stars (I have no idea why) and if you want to get into the pro realm of things you're looking to spend another couple hundred dollars. And while I appreciate HMX wanting to teach people to play real instruments, for real, I kind of feel like I'd rather spend the $300 for the pro guitar on a cheap electric and some lessons.I feel sort of like, for whatever reason, Rock Band is trying to recapture the more annoying elements of Guitar Hero, with the game telling you when you've got certain length streaks going on, throwing challenges at you, and having sound effects that detract from the music.It is not a black mark on the franchise, but I feel like there's some of the soul of the earlier releases missing and that makes me sad because I love Harmonix, and have supported them since Frequency and Amplitude.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2010"}

There is definitely screen tearing on this game, specially the cut scenes. The loading time is not all that bad, but occurs frequent between gameplay and cut scenes. I dont mind this myself but others might not agree. You'd think that in this day in age (specially a game on blu ray) the loading times should be shorter or not there at all. It would have been probably better for Sega to have had a mandatory install to cut down on the loading a bit. Anyways, thats all of the cons, the rest of the game kicks behind, the action is crazy and the heroine moves are a thing to watch and definitely dont want to miss.

The modes, missions, and side missions are all very fun to play. Cars, people, and cut scenes are all very good. Same concept as the previous GTAs : explore at your own pace, while finishing missions whenever you'd like. Missions are of great variety, never feel redundant or boring.The drawbacks:- Graphical details like water and buildings are not nearly as good as the time and effort they put into the car models. The cars look stunning with the reflection, density, and driving behavior.- The goal of realism seemed to have taken away some of the fantastical fun seen from previous GTAs like vice city and san andreas. Those games didn't need to be realistic to be fun. I miss some of the funny and crazy dialogue from San Andreas. Here in GTA IV, you may get some laughs here and there, but it's relatively serious and blunt. The gritty realistic vibe is also in the missions, which is fine by me, but the sandbox feel isn't quite there. Aside from several ridiculous unrealistic missions like the bank robbery, most of the missions can happen in real life, which may not be a good thing if this game is played without parental supervision (for minors).Overall, a fun, realistic, game with a vast map to explore and a variety of missions. Looking forward to GTA V.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2011"}

LotR: Return of the King features the entire cast from the movies, music from the movies, clips from the movies, and levels based on concept art and designs from the movie. It's this lavish treatment that really makes the game worth a cash investment for fans.Not to say that the actual gameplay is bad, only that its pretty standard. This is a beat-em-up/hack-and-slash affair, and you basically plow through the levels killing everything in your path, then trade in those points for upgrades so you can kill a little easier. However, the controls are solid, and the graphics engine is amazing. The main characters are kinda average, but the detail in the backgrounds, as well as the hoardes of enemies and real-time chaos really make the experience. The game perfectly recaptures the epic size of Peter Jackson's trilogy.And then some. This is a faithful translation of the movie, but its a stretch to think Tolkien intended for Gandalf to chain combos and crack wise. Still, one has to smile when Ian McKellen twists lines from the original story, including my favourite: \"Oh Saurman....Gandalf the White comes to Isengard...no longer seeking your council!\"It's a short game, but its a fun game, a good two-player game, a very polished game, and now also a reasonably cheap game.

The graphics in the first Infamous are kind of chalky and gritty but that said the game is still very playable.  There are trophies or achievements galore for those who love the motivation of such things.  The controls are well laid out and soon you get comfortable with deploying your powers with relative ease.  After a while you merge right into the Cole McGrath character the controller becomes an extension of your will.  There is little about the actual game mechanics of Infamous or Infamous 2 to remind you that you are playing a video game.  There is a great deal of repetition in the Infamous game world. There were times when the gritty detail in infamous one reminded you it was a video game. The character development is first rate.  Your decisions drive the game in unique ways as you become a beloved hero, a universally hated maggot or something in between. I was impressed by the detail of many of the New York Landmark Buildings in the game. The graphics in Infamous 2 are clearly better the colors are far more vivid, bright and true to life.  The dark scenes are excellent because the light mechanics and physics in the game play just blow you away with their realism. Already good control schemes were improved upon greatly with the release of Infamous 2. The downloadable extra powers aren't needed but I found them fun and worth the small price.  If you notice I do not give you even a thumbnail of what the story line is about because; I don't want to spoil it for you.  Just take it from me if you never played the Infamous 1 \\ Infamous 2 franchise this is a treat you owe yourself. I actually grew to really like the McGrath character. The game is long and rich in content. In the Infamous 2 you fight the same ice creatures and huge metal junk men more times than you care to count. Infamous 2 takes place in a New Orleans like city complete with appropriate buildings streets and atmosphere. After the 5th time fighting a metal junk man or ice mega beast you learn to dispatch them without too much trouble. Yes the scene repetition gets old fast but if you train yourself to not care about that the game is much improved  This Infamous 1 and 2 game set was and is both great overall fun and at this price you can't beat this opportunity with any winning hand! At this price Infamous 1 & 2 are so totally worth their price.

{"product_name":"B000035Y38","description":"super nintendo\nstarfox","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"one of the best shooters ever","reviewText":"Many Star Fox games have been released since the very first one that appeared on the Super NES.  The only one I have ever played was the original on the Super NES, which also happened to be the most groundbreaking of all the Star Fox games, and it's a challenging and exciting game.  Perhaps the only game on the Super NES to have more enemies to shoot at than the Mega Man series.  The levels are packed.You're a fox, and you fly a plane.  You fly through the universe shooting and avoiding all sorts of wild looking creatures.  That's basically what you do.  You have animal friends available to help make your journey slightly easier.  It's a good idea to try to help out your friends if they're in trouble because keeping them alive might be to your advantage later on in the game.In Star Fox you really have to tap that shoot button because the further into the game you go, the more enemies you will encounter.  This is one tough game here folks.  Much harder than the Super NES Mega Man X games, and certainly much harder than the Mario and Donkey Kong Country games.  But come on!  You need a solid challenge every so often!  But it's certainly beatable.  And this game never gets tiring either.I remember when this game first came out and how a certain store in a mall had NOTHING but this game all over the shelves.  This game was packed on the shelves on the wall and the shelves in the middle of the store.  It was everywhere!  You couldn't avoid this game if you had to!  There must have been thousands of Star Fox games at that one tiny store that one weekend, when the game first hit the market.  The game was that popular.Everyone was making a big deal about this game because of the never-before-seen graphics.  Sure, today the graphics look pretty outdated and even more so compared to the newer Star Fox games, but at the time this was some new unique stuff that showed signs of the future of video gaming.I always feel satisfied making my way through Star Fox not only because it's a hard game, but also because it's a fun game.  Not a dull moment to be found anywhere.  Enemies constantly fly at you from all over the place.  Exciting stuff.You have three routes you can take.  Level 1 is the easiest and Level 3 is the hardest.  I can't even beat Level 3 in all the years I've been playing this game.  I can make it to the end on a good day but basically I'm lucking out.  That doesn't mean the game requires luck.  Just the final two places in Level 3 require some luck.  I can beat Levels 1 and 2.Incredible music.  I love every theme.  Very much like outer space music.  It all works.You can find this game for a couple dollars these days.  One of the coolest games on the Super NES happens to be reasonably priced.

First for the DS handheld.","reviewerName":"dark54555 \"dark54555\"","summary":"More of the Same Good Stuff","reviewText":"Bottom Line: If you liked the first two Advanced Wars titles, you'll like this one too.  (if you hated the first two, don't bother.)Advanced Wars Dual Strike is just a further tweak on the series.  More new COs, more new missions, more new units.  The biggest change is you can control the entire battle on the touch screen of your Nintendo DS.  While this is cool, the units are small enough that occasionally youcan miss what you're trying to hit with the stylus.  For those who get annoyed by this, you can always revert back to the tried and true D-Pad.The other big change is the top screen is constantly giving you information about the battle.  In later missions, it even extends to a separate battlefield, allowing you to use two COs at once.In any event, this is a must own for fans of the series and fans of turn-based stragety.  Real-Time Strategy fans and new players may or may not like the title.  People who didn't like the first two won't find anything that different in this game, so they should probably steer clear.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2005"}

First for the DS handheld.","reviewerName":"Salvatore Paradise","summary":"countless options, impossibly hard but tons of fun","reviewText":"i picked this game up about five years ago as i was checking out what the DS had to offer. i got to about mission 20 when the slow climb of progress i was making through this game ground to a halt. i began noticing also that single levels were consuming entire days and decided it was best to put this game aside for a while...five years later, a friend of mine is starting to get into DS games since they're so cheap now and i decided to give this another shot. it took me a week or so but i was finally able to beat the game's remaining eight missions. i'm glad i gave this game another shot and will most likely check out the other advance wars titles for the DS or maybe even GBA. here's some of my main impressions of the game:countless options! and i don't mean just what type of armed forces you use, which could be anything from soldier to aircraft carrier (and everything in between). but also commanding officers, COs, that each have their own unique strengths and weaknesses that you can develop. this theme has major pros and cons of course. having tons of options is certainly entertaining. &#34;do i use a neotank or a megatank to destroy this lowly enemy reconnaissance unit?&#34; but having too many options can also be paralyzing. &#34;should i recruit more soldiers first or just start off with a rocket launcher?&#34; the game grades you on a myriad of criterion, one of which being speed, so developing a long and slowly unfolding strategy on the battlefield may not always be an option.going back to the COs, by the time you're well into the game, you'll be commanding a couple or sometimes even three armies at once. luckily the game has no shortage of commanding officers. it seemed like every one of the earlier missions, i kept recruiting a new one. and eventually i found some that just kinda popped up on my roster. each one has their own strengths and weaknesses which is cool. they'll even try to hint if you made a good choice from the dialogue preempting the battle. the downside is that there are so many playable characters, that you're spread too thin and have to focus on a smaller pool to develop talent. otherwise you end up with a large group of mediocre COs, instead of 5 or 6 nicely ranked ones.the second theme i want to touch on is this games difficulty. the battles can be tough to get an S rank, due to the time issue. but also, the tide of the battle can very easily turn and change a decisive victory into a nail-bitter. each step in the battle execution is important and i had to sometimes replay entire levels and tweak placement, attacks, etc; in order to get S ranks.lastly, despite being difficult and sometimes having too many options for its own good, this game is tons of fun. it is often ranked highly on lists of 'best ds games of all time'. most other strategy RPGs like fire emblem or final fantasy tactics do not have the modern day story-line setting of the advance wars series, which i find to be refreshing. if you have an open mind about gaming, it's worth checking out, even in 2014. the 3DS would be wise to add an advance wars title to its catalog.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2014"}

It has many different endings, multiple races, and a plethora of dialog choices. One thing that could have been better was the NPC AI. I really got tired of healing them.

{"product_name":"B000PS4X7S","reviewerName":"irukandji","summary":"First Person Shooter with Team-Play lite","reviewText":"This is a First Person Shooter combined with cooperative team play. Hence the Left 4 Dead logo. With the \"4\" stated as a number and emphasized. There are \"4\" players. You control one, and you will have 3 other computer allies. For the most part, when playing with computer allies, they stay back and will allow you to snipe and kill zombies. They are not glory hogs. The teamplay is \"light\" and not as involved as those war games.The game is setup with 4 campaigns. Each campaign is seperated into about 4 or 5 stages. At the end of each stage you find a \"Safe room\" and close the door once all teammates are inside. That completes the stage, and proceeds to the next one. Each campaign will usually last 30 minutes to 60 minutes. Each campaign is themed, for instance one takes place at an Airport, another a Hospital, etc.The stages consist of you killing a bunch of zombies till you reach the safe house. The zombies consist of 6 kinds.Normal Zombies (abundant)Smokers (few)Hunters (few)Boomers (few)Witches (fewest)Tanks (fewest)A Smoker grabs you with his tongue, and if this happens you must be saved by your teammates. Hunters pounce on you and pin you to the ground, you must be saved by teammates. Boomers are fat-zombies that puke on you, and this attracts a hoard of zombies. Witches are female zombies that cry by themselves and if disturbed will attack and are usually strong, and you may or may not have to be saved by teammates. The aptly named Tanks are big muscular zombies, that take awhile to kill, and are very strong. These can knock you down to the ground, and you may or may not have to be saved by teammates. The unique zombies special attacks often require your teammates to save you is why you need to have teammates and stick together.Zombies can spawn out of different parts of the stage, and there are a lot of zombies perhaps 30 or more in a horde and they usually keep coming. Headshots do more damage. When undisturbed the zombies are stupid (as they should be) and pretty much just stand around, puking, fighting, sitting, pretty much idle. However, when a hoard is attacking they can be classified as the \"fast moving\" zombie types.At the end of each campaign, the final stage, there will be a bunch of zombies, unique zombies and 1 to 2 tanks until your rescue. You usually trigger the \"finale\" by activating a trigger, like a radio. When you have beaten the campaign, it will then roll the credits, and give you your stats, such as Head-shots %, Accuracy, Damage Taken, Etc. There are achievements in this game which you can earn, which are like trophies, and little icons. For example, 100 headshots will earn you the \"Brain Salad\" achievement.You are only aloud to select 1 good weapon and will always have 1 pistol, which has unlimited ammo.  The weapons are: Machine Gun, Shotgun. Scattered through the map are their better counterparts which you can use, they are: Assault Rifle, Semi-Automatic Shotgun, and Sniper Rifle. You can also melee attack (smack enemies with the butt of your gun) and use Molotov cocktails and pipe-bombs. There are medkits and ammo supplies scattered throughout the stages, and are always in the safe houses.Graphic wise, it is just okay/acceptable. You can blow off zombie heads and they will lose limbs occasionally. There is a lot of blood spatter. Compared to Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil 4 has much better headshots and zombie hit reactions. I was disappointed at first with the graphics in Left 4 Dead, however, once playing the game I got used to them. 3/5 for Graphics.The multiplayer modes are:Campaign (co-op just like single player except with humans)Survival (hold out as long as you can against waves of zombies)Versus (play as infected or in the group of the 4 survivors)This is not a real \"FPS\" like a Doom type game. It is a unique teamplay FPS. It is still fun to replay the 4 campaigns in single player or online. However, this game could have used more content. If you only play single player your limited to just the campaigns, no survival, or other types of play.Bottomline, could have a lot better graphics with better hit reactions and more gore, but still fun with replay value albeit somewhat small amount of campaigns with just one mode for single player.Installation:DVD install's Steam agent and has DVD activation code. You must be connected to the Internet. Run the Steam program, enter your activation code and it will download the game. It is about 5.0GB worth of content, however the box states 7.5GB. The Steam agent keeps all your Steam games up-to-date with the latest patches.The installation is easy, as long as you have broadband. Otherwise it will take a long time on dial-up.Do not buy Steam games USED since they are linked to a Steam account.You can play this game Offline. It is very simple! When the Steam agent runs, it says \"Start Offline mode\". That's it.After a reformat, I had to reinstall. It was very easy, once the Steam agent loaded, it said, \"Log-in with current account\" or \"Create New\". I logged in with my account I made from before, and it installed from the DVD disc rather than having to redownload the whole thing all over again. Very nice, I hope they continue this. It also saved all my configured controls and achievement/progression.Steam also has \"Steamcloud\", which allows you to keep your game settings/progression in sync with other computers you may have installed it on.System Requirements (from box):OS: Windows XP, Vista, Vista64CPU: 3.0GHz P4, Dual Core 2.0 or AMD64X2 (or higher)RAM: 1GB for XP / 2GB for VistaDISC DRIVE: DVD-ROM DriveHARD DRIVE: At least 7.5GB of free spaceVIDEO: DirectX 9 compatible video card 128MB or more and should be DirectX 9-compatible with support for pixel shader 2.0 (ATI9600 or higher.

This makes a game so darn predictable that replay value goes down the tubes!I am not impressed with the graphics either. They seem outdated, stale. There are too many other games out there with nicer details and realistic features. COD 4 is not one of them.This game is not worth the high price tag they have slapped it with. NO WAY! I recommend you borrow a friend's copy, install it, play it and if you still want to buy it, go for it. It is too soon to tell if the multiplayer will be worthwhile. There were a lot of claims that the COD 2 MP was outstanding and a tremendous success, yet the servers were empty.

Taegel","summary":"Not Great but Not Unplayable","reviewText":"Having played through the campaign and a good amount of multiplayer....The story campaign is a bit dull.  The main bad guy is not the leader of the invading force. He\"s not even one of them, but a traitor who used to be a ghost.  So where it makes the villain a \"personal\" nemesis, it seems ludicrous to place that much importance on him compared to the much more important issue of the country having been invaded.  While he's tough, killing him won't end the war or turn the tides.  So it seems our heroes are being a bit thick going after him.  If the story had played with that idea thematically, it might have been interesting--the question of whether personal vengeance has any place in war.  But it doesn't really develop our heroes at all.  They're just a couple of guys whose father was a ghost, so now they're joining the family trade.  We don't get any idea of who the Federation is or what they want or what the day to day existence is now like in the US under occupation.  It ends up feeling like a bunch of disjointed battle sequences with no sense of stakes or what they're fighting for.  In other words, the characters and world were vague.  Hence it was kind of boring. The mechanics are mostly the same as other COD titles, and it was fun enough shooting lots of people, but I never really felt like I was fighting for anything -- as I did in Modern Warfare 2.The multiplayer feels to me not unlike all the other Infinity Ward Multiplayers. I do concur with a lot of people that the maps are too big. I personally prefer smaller maps. It makes the gameplay faster.So all in all I'd have to say this is a good game. It falls short of its predecessors for sure, but it's not hyperbolically horrible as some reviewers have asserted.  There are certainly much more fun games out there right now.If you've never played a Call of Duty game, I'd suggest playing the first two Modern Warfares. Both their campaigns are great and the multiplayer very fun -- though naturally the most robust community online will be with the most recent games.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"B.

{"product_name":"B0050SX3KG","description":"","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"I wanna run around and free full-figured Nymphs too!","reviewText":"It's always a shame when a game that obviously has a ton of work and passion put into it goes nearly unseen. Panzer Dragoon Orta, Otogi: Myth of Demons, Psychonauts, Enslaved Odyssey to the West...there are tons of games I've recommended to people over the years that they never heard about, yet had even more work put into them than some of the big name franchises. Rayman Origins is another one to join the long list of underappreciated games. If you still haven't played the demo, please do so, since screenshots don't do it justice. Rayman Origins has set the standard for 2D graphics in games now and playing it for the first time was a jaw-dropping experience as far as visuals are concerned. But it's all about the gameplay right? Don't worry, there's lots of good stuff in that department too...though it could have used some fine tuning.The story for Rayman Origins is practically non-existent in the game, and you'll get more about the story from the Product Description above, oddly enough. It's a simple action platformer where you play as one of four characters, collecting Electoons (little glowing bug-like thingies), beating up bad guys and making your way to the end of each stage. Basically, think of Super Mario World or Donkey Kong Country, and it's right there with those. Walk, run, jump, punch, swing and swim your way through the stages. It's that simple! Jump on bad guys or knock their teeth in, it's up to you! Collecting the Electoons is a big part of the game since you need to rescue a certain amount in order to progress to the next areas, and collecting a certain amount in each stage earns you medals which let you choose alternate costumes for your characters. None of the costumes have any special attributes but it's always nice to have options. Each area on the map has a different theme, from jungle to ice to water, again, similar to Donkey Kong Country. One stage might be a simple run and jump kind of deal, the next could have you doing a side scrolling shooter bit, and another could be a frantic race to the end of the level before some huge creature devours you. For the most part, all of the stages are fun and will require a few tries to get the hang of things. The game also supports up to 4 players for a great co-op mode that more developers should take a lesson from. Rounding out the good gameplay are the excellent visuals, a memorable soundtrack and a couple of challenges to keep you coming back for more until you finish it 100%. As I said above- A LOT of work went into this game and it shows. For an extra challenge, sit through the whole end credits to see just how many people worked on this sucker.Now while many people praise Rayman Origins and feel like it's one of the best games ever, I can't agree on that. There were many moments in the game where I was getting genuinely frustrated, and most of the time it wasn't my fault. Hit detection with certain enemies and bosses is very spotty, leading to lots and lots of deaths. A couple of later levels where you race through the stage as it falls apart could've been a lot more clear as to where you're supposed to be going instead of taking huge leaps of faith. I can't count the number of times when I died and said out loud \"HOW? HOW DID THAT EVEN HAPPEN?\". It's funny how Rayman Origins reminds me a lot of the most recent Donkey Kong Country game on the Wii both in art direction and hair-pulling instances such as these. However, my problem with Donkey Kong Country Returns was mostly due to the stupid motion controls and not level design. If you played DKCR and cringed whenever another rocket barrel level showed up, just wait until you see what Rayman Origins has. Charging up your basic punch attack is pretty much useless since it takes so long and you'll be a sitting duck when doing it. Finally, I really don't like the floating mechanic in this game or just how animated some movements are. I'd often react to a situation faster than my character would reflect that, and he'd be a goner because the turning animation hadn't completed or something similar. Saying that is weird since the animations in the game are so great and yet they animated it so much that it hurts the gameplay a little bit. Controls were always a little off to me here, kind of like how the jumping in the first LittleBigPlanet was off (to me) with Sackboy having such a floaty jump.There's no denying that Rayman Origins is a beautiful game. It's amazing that so much work went into something that's directed at kids for the most part but can be enjoyed by all ages. It's great to play with your kids if you're low on games to play together because, face it, there are barely any good games that don't involve guns these days. Had the controls been tighter and those later stages had bitter direction, I'd probably bump the overall score up to 5 stars. But apparently I'm in the minority on these things, so it probably won't be a big deal for most people. It's a shame that the game sold so poorly, even with all the high review scores. Give it a chance.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2012"}

That's what I do with pretty much any new system I plan to buy. The more I played it in the store, read reviews, and saw videos of it, I realized I wanted to break my normal routine.  My son & I are glad we took an early plunge!  The set up was easy to follow.  It took 30 minutes for all the updates.  The TVii feature is nice. The Wii pad interacts nicely with televised sports.  You can check stats and chat with friends during games.  The internet is very fast!  The web pages look nice & only takes seconds to load.  Netflix works just as well, if not better than the Xbox.  You can zip through the menus and the streaming is excellent.  The Amazon video app works equally as well.  The picture for Netflix & Amazon Video looks very good on the Wii pad when you want to free up your TV for someone else to use.  The only two games I have now are Mario Bros U & Black Ops 2.  Mario Bros looks very nice in HD.  It is fun to use the gamepad when you are playing multi-player to get out of some tough jams.  My son loves playing the game on the game pad.  I have got to hand it to Nintendo for Miiverse.  It is extremely fun to interact with people all around the world!  My 4 year old son wanted me to read all the comments and clues left by people while we were going through levels on Mario Bros.  He really gets a kick out of it.  Black Ops is awesome!  I have played Call Of Duty on PS2, Wii, and Xbox.  This is the most fluid version I have played.  The visuals are really stunning.  The wii pad, classic pro, wiimote, & the Wii U pro controller, all work flawlessly with this game.  I experience zero lag playing online & Zombie mode.  I was quite impressed.  This game also looks and plays nice on the game pad alone.  My only gripe, If I had to pick one, is the game pad's battery life.  It last 2.5 to three hours tops.  I try not to play that long in one setting so that can be a good thing if you want to limit your kids time.  You can always play while charging it.  Does it make me want to give up my Xbox...No!  I enjoy both systems for their differences.  I chose the 8 GB because I wanted to get 2 games rather than Nintendoland, which is a great game from what I heard.  Plus,  I can get a 32 GB thumb drive for 15 bucks later, thanks to another reviewers tip.  I look forward to the 2 big system updates to see what more tricks Nintendo has up it's sleeve!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0065NP6NC","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"strump\"","summary":"Almost Perfect","reviewText":"There is only one fault with the game, but it's a big one. A game of this nature (an open world, do things your own way - in your own order type of game), and one adding DLC, cannot - absolutely CANNOT end - IT CANNOT END - NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES - NOT ACCEPTABLE. The character and game must stay open so the player can continue to do side missions, DLC, or whatever, in his or her own way. (I believe Oblivion stayed open after the main storyline, for example. That's the proper way to do it. Fallout 3 also ended, then they had to scramble - lamely - to reopen it for the DLC - SO STUPID - STOP IT ALREADY! Then after that travesty, they came out with this game, and they repeat the same exact mistake? How is it even possible to be that stupid.)Okay, my strong objections aside. This version is as glitch free as any game I've ever played (and I've played a lot of games - I also played the original version of this game on day one - the version that included the infamous \"getting locked out of the Strip glitch\" - a truly inexcusable bug to be sure). But this version has corrected every glitch as far as I can tell. The people with problems are surely having hardware problems or are playing a different non-updated, or non-ultimate version of the game. Also. I have now played this ultimate version on a very modest notebook, a decent desktop, and an Xbox 360 with no bugs, glitches, or unexpected problems whatsoever. This is truly amazing considering the extraordinary ambition of this game.Also on the plus side, this is probably the most intricate RPG of this generation. It can be fairly challenging to achieve certain goals. There are times when things must be done just so, or you will suffer disappointing and unintended consequences.Lastly, if you're into a more \"REAL\" role playing experience, then try the hardcore mode. You will soon feel the full impact of the post apocalypse. You must adapt or you will die - die of thirst, starvation, or the even the tiniest of enemies.4.5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2012"}

Pawar \"thestoneman\"","summary":"(single player only) Good shooter, story is meh","reviewText":"(single player only review)Gameplay and graphics are excellent for a fps.  The problem lies in the fact that the mission length is way too long and they are broken up strangely (the pirate sniper mission is a good example; it's a one shot mission).  Some of the npc-character models are awful both in game and in cgi.  The ai of the npcs (voodoo, mother, and the assorted other guys) is pretty awful, they'll run right into your field of fire and not kill the guy you're shooting.  Because of the mission length the gameplay feels pretty repetitive and the \"story\" introduces characters you'll never see again (argyrus) even though tf mako (the special forces task force) ends up in the same training ground where he would be.But otherwise it's a decent game and the gameplay is there.  If they would've tweeked the ai, mission length, and story (quite) a bit it would've been an excellent campaign.  As is, it's only \"pretty good\" if you can look past the faults.  There are one shot kills (with a shotgun I believe) that can happen to your character so it's moderately realistic, not completely but moderately.I guess they make these games for multiplayer but I don't have xbox live.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2013"}

Now don't get me wrong, all the rest of the games are good, but playing a game to become a Jedi just gets old after a while.  But not with this, finally they have made a Star Wars game that actually puts WAR back into the name.  Experience the battles in the Star Wars movies like never before!Yes, this game is just like Battlefield 1942, and the engine seems to remind me of it, but the game is nothing like BF1942.  The main menus are much more spiffy looking, and the graphics much more crisp.  The graphics are smooth as silk on both my machines at their maximum resolution (one Radeon 9800 at mobile and one geForce FX-6800 GT).  Although I have had a few problems with hardware surround sound, I must say that the sound effects in this game are just like what you get in the movies.  I am also sure that they will patch any kind of hardware difficulties within the next few weeks, too.Just like said in other reviews, you can pilot ANYTHING (and I mean anything).  Take a speeder bike through the forests of Endor, ride a tauntaun across the icy plains of Hoth, or (and the best thing to do) ride a sluggish AT-AT crushing down those Rebel dogs!All in all, if you are any kind of a Star Wars fan, or just a fan of good first person shooters, then this game is perfect for you.

The graphics are grittier. The gameplay is tighter. Gone is the too-obvious auto-aim in Halo 3. The Flood does not exist at all. The Elites are not superfriends, but are a vicious enemy.There is more the reality that the SPARTAN soldiers are really distrusted by many humans.Where Halo 3 felt like an xbox 1 game with some next-gen graphic features tacked on, Halo Reach truly feels next-gen. The lighting is better, everything is crisper, it is simply a superior game.What makes this game great for me is that it is sci-fi, and yet it feels so real. The SPARTAN soldiers are otherworldly, yet some of the early game locales feel like isolated farming hamlets not too different from Earth. Early on, I got the sense that the SPARTAN team was reminiscent of Latin American death squads, which at least is somewhat more realistic of groups of men with guns who maraud across the countryside. If you know anything about the game's fiction, if not for the Covenant invasion, that is pretty much what the SPARTAN soldiers would have been: fascist stormtroopers taking out high-value targets of the human opposition, because the lumbering government refused to negotiate.But then the Covenant arrive and that gives them the opportunity to unite against a common enemy and be heroes.Because this is, after all, a video game.Still, I appreciated that early part.

But I am not going to buy it. I used to a have a standing pre-order but not anymore, that has been long canceled. I gave EA a chance to mend its ways but it failed. Here is why.This is a warning Review. Warning of the dangers of the harbored Digital Rights Management (DRM) subroutine that comes unavoidably bundled with the game. This type of DRM (SecuROM 7x with Limited Installations) is well known as it has already been used in at least two other games (BIOSHOCK & MASS EFFECT). So my review is based on first-hand experience of a core aspect of the game.Apparently EA would rather keep its customers in the dark. That is why, in the past month, EA Forums got censored, Wikipedia entries selectively edited and Amazon reviews repeatedly deleted. What is worse, Amazon (possibly without knowing it) is breaking the law which requires the full disclosure of bundled snoop-ware.LIMITED INSTALLS? Yes, LIMITED INSTALLS!!! We only get to ride this shiny pony for...3 laps! The official announcement mentions \"on 3 different computers\" but avoids to clarify what a \"different computer\" makes: will changing the graphics card trigger the loss of a token? what about attaching a new hard-drive (internal or external) or adding a new user account. All the above have been reported to subtract installation tokens from BIOSHOCK or MASS EFFECT - and EA has intentionally left this area dark gray.Moreover, in order to enforce the limited installations, exactly like BIOSHOCK, there will be IRREMOVABLE FOLDERS placed in our systems' Root that will effectively revoke our Administrator rights to our own PCs! Short of reformatting, there is no deleting them even if logged in as Administrators.Is EA trying to pave the way towards a nightmarish future where PC gaming will be a continuously-billed service (such as direct-Pay TV) and not a product?Is EA trying to trigger a lemmings stampede towards the Pay-per-Play cliff, where gamers will be regarded as herded cows to be milked over months and years?Is the Company trying to turn our PC systems (that we bought and paid for) into their proprietary consoles, hence monstrosities such as SecuROM that offer zero anti-piracy protection?According to statements by their own spokespersons (such as John Riccitiello, CEO of EA) the answer to all of the above question is YES. However, I want to make clear that none of these statements had any impact on my rating of this game. The game has enough troubles as it is...Is it fair to rate badly a game based on its short duration or bad graphics? How about its instability and bugs? How about harboring potentially dangerous subroutines that will render it useless within a 12-16 months? You see how this is going?In the end, after all is said, with SPORE it boils down to this: who will actually be owning my copy? Are we to pay $50 only to...RENT this from its publisher, be potentially pestered with the insulting need to prove our purchase forever and place our hardware and data in danger?And what makes this even harder to understand: will such extreme measures actually prevent piracy? Of course NOT! They did not work for similarly DRM-plagued BIOSHOCK or MASS EFFECT, why should they start working now?So, one has to ask: what is next in store for customers that make the mistake of buying such a product? Will they be required to pay again to buy another copy of the game when the first one expires?Is THIS the solution that EA executives came up against piracy: since they cannot stop piracy, let's make all our paying customers PAY TWICE to make up for their million dollar bonuses?!NO THANKS! No game is worth such harassment!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2008"}

If you're a casual gamer, Dark Souls is NOT for you. If you're a competitive gamer who loves challenges, this is your game! It's extremely hard - you WILL die, and you will die often. You will be discouraged at times, some of your enemies will seem unbeatable. You're dead after you make two mistakes, sometimes even just one. After much trial and error, you will discover effective strategies, and you will have beaten who you thought was unbeatable. It is an extremely rewarding feeling, especially if you figure things out on your own, without the help of tips and guides online.

I was a fan of the previous titles and was super excited for this one.However, after starting it I was not really blown away (the graphics were amazing but the story was not).However, after you advance and begin to learn to powers the story started to grow on me too and by the time I was finished I immediately started a new game to play through on a harder difficulty and as an evil version of Delsin.The villain in this game is awesome, I really wish they had more screen time since they make you love to hate them.The graphics in this game are quite possibly the best this gen, so far. The effects and the facial expressions are top notch, though some characters work better than others and a few (the females mainly) came off a bit awkward.The powers are awesome, and though some are basically clones of the others (blasts, flight) they all have enough little differences to make switching them out not only fun but often necessary to advance.Sadly, all of the enemies have pretty much exactly the same powers and just use them slightly differently.I kept waiting for something big to happen like in the first two games where there were such a large variety of abilities on display (ice, oil/fire, electricity, shape shifting, mind control) but it never happens.The story has several missed opportunities in my opinion. I would have liked to seen more of Delsin and Reggie's back story and a bit more of an explanation of him being &#34;the second son&#34;. The relationship between these two is fun to watch, but I'd have liked them to have expanded on that, I never really felt like I got to know them.Another interesting thing is that the game play often feels much more like a shooter ala Uncharted/Gears of war than an Infamous game. It's not a bad thing really, but kind of odd at times.I know I had several complaints and if I'd made this review back when I was bored I'd have given it three stars...four at most.But after experiencing the game to it's fullest I have to go ahead and give it a five on Amazon's scale. On a scale from 1-10, it wouldn't get a ten, but it would rank high enough to be a must have for the PS4.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYZS0","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Mizov","summary":"A Satisfying Conclusion to an Epic Sci-Fi Trilogy","reviewText":"I went into Mass Effect 3 with incredibly high expectations. From the trailers leading up to the release of the game, you could tell that the emotional impact was going to be significant. The Reapers are finally here. In a universe with such rich backstory, where decisions have a major impact, and you've grown to know and love characters over the dozens of hours of the two previous installments, it would be easy for BioWare to have a major misstep.Luckly, they didn't. This game is AMAZING!The scale and scope of the game leaves me in awe. From the skyscraper sized Reapers to the battles that are occurring in the background. From the magical space battles to the conversations with the crewmates, everything is beautifully done. BioWare knew what they wanted to do with this game and they delivered in spades.Gameplay:If you enjoyed the feel of Mass Effect 2 more than 1, you're in luck. The gameplay carries over almost verbatim. Squadmates are even more independent than ME2 and that's a good thing. The micromanagement that went into ME1 was tactically interesting but really slowed down the battles. They know what needs to be done and they do it. Getting into and out of cover is at times a little wonky, as in the past, but there are times when it flows perfectly it feels like a perfectly executed maneuver. Then sometimes I bounce around and get shot in the face... win some/lose some.The only notable addition are the melee strikes. This is helpful, as more often than not you're forced to abandon cover (whether it's a grenade or you're being charged). This makes the battles a little more dynamic than the \"pop out of cover when the other guy does\" battles of ME2 and makes them feel a little more fast paced. I generally avoid melee unless I have to, but it's an interesting addition nonetheless. I will say straight up that the environments and enemy types vary more than the previous two games combined, and that's awesome. It's nice to face different strategies, keeps things fresh.There's the Kinect option to use. I tried it and I couldn't get anyone to listen me half the time. I attribute it to the fact that my speakers were cranked so, if this were real life, they probably couldn't hear me anyway. Yeah... that's the ticket. On the rare occasion it does work, it's pretty cool.Graphics:The look is a little crisper, the framing a little better, everything looks a little more polished. I absolutely loved the background events, the cinematic space battles, all of the crazy stuff.Sound:Everything is very sharp and works well on my surround system. The Reapers make some sort of crazy bass sound that shakes my entire living room. It's awesome. Seriously.Multiplayer:If you liked Gears of War Horde Mode you'll love this. Simple as that. I think it's fun but I'm always placed with random since my friends don't buy games very often. Still, it's pretty sweet. Plus, it helps you becomes \"more prepared\" in the actual campaign. It's not required to play but it's a nice touch. Persistent leveling also gives a sense of purpose. Be careful cranking it up to hard, it gets pretty nuts.Overall:GET IT! If you loved ME1 and ME2 this could be a bucket of crap and you'd get it since the story is so amazing. Luckily, it's fantastic. Enjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2012"}

Hands down this is one of the best games I've played on Xbox 360 and ranks right up there with Bioshock for sheer fun and quality.  CoD4 has a good story and decent voice acting but not to the degree that you find in games like Bioshock.  But at its core CoD4 is a first-person shooter and Bioshock wasn't your typical shooter (not a bad thing mind you).  If you dwell too long on the story of CoD4 you may find faults with it so I don't stress it as a game selling point - it is good, but not great.  With CoD4 it is all about the action.  Unlike many of the first-person shooters I've struggled with in the past the graphic quality of this one is amazing and that makes it a lot less frustrating to play - anyone who has struggled to discern the snipers blending into the pixel nightmare of early shooter games will know what I mean.  In CoD4 the graphics are pristine and smooth and very realistic.  There is a fair amount of texture recycling and the like and if you've seen a couple maps you've seen the extent of what you are likely to see terrain/clutter wise, but man, they are sure pretty.  The forests and skies, as well as the closeup detail on uniforms and weapons is exceptional.  Even ground clutter like grass and foliage is better than I have seen before and you can and move and discern targets from the graphics with ease allowing you to focus on firefights and not on trying to find a target to shoot at before they see you.  You may still struggle to find them at times though, as the shadows and ground clutter congestion are also very good - especially in multiplayer.Multiplayer:So how is the multiplayer? I think it is very good.  I was much more impressed with CoD4 online than say any of the Halo series.  I think the weapon damage is much more realistic in CoD4 with less emphasis on how weak one weapon is vs. how powerful another weapon is (think the pistol and the sniper rifle in Halo vs. the assault rifle).  In CoD4 I found it matters less what weapon one was using and more on how they are using the weapon.  Usually situational awareness and accuracy will save the day regardless of the weapon you are using.  Also, each play style, and some maps, call for specific weapons.  You don't want a weapon with slow reloads or small magazines in close quarters combat, nor do you want an inaccurate submachine gun on open maps where your gun will be much less effective at range.I also found that there was less of a disparity among those who play all the time and the casual player than many other multiplayer games.  Unfortunately, I think this has to do with CoD4's nature of rewarding \"camping\" players, that is players who set up ambush points and wait forever for someone to cross their paths instead of mixing it up in the firefights.  CoD4 has a lot of potential choke points where a single sniper or someone with a great submachine gun and some mad skills can stave off countless attackers.  That can be really frustrating, but as the maps are open and spawning appears somewhat random the tables can be easily turned on your opponent if you choose to do the same - although rewarded for doing this in the game mechanics this makes for slow, painful and often upsetting matches.CoD4 offers players \"perks\" that can be equipped and more are available for unlocking when certain levels or skill challenges are unlocked.  While they don't turn the tide of the game often they do come in handy or exceptionally frustrating depending upon the situation.  At first I found these fun, but as time went on I found they would get more and more annoying as certain perks can make it harder to setup certain traps on opposing forces or make the enemy much harder to spot and kill in certain circumstances.  Sometimes the perks you equip will give you an edge, but also having the wrong perk at the wrong time can be frustrating.For players with enough skills to rack up a number of enemy kills without dying (3/5/7 in a row) there are additional perks in the form of radar, air strikes and air support (attack helicopter) that benefit the whole team.  While it is frustrating not to be able to call these in yourself because you may not be the best player out there it is nice that they are an asset that the whole team can share in.All in all the multiplayer was fast and frantic most of the time with intense firefights and fast respawns and was a real blast even if I'm not very good at it.  If you have a team that likes to work together and take their time you can also enjoy team tactics setting up choke points, assaults and defensive scenarios, etc. where everyone can work together to accomplish a goal.  I found that when a team was willing to work together than they could really decimate the competition but most of the time it is more free-for-all - still good and intense if a bit less effective and less rewarding.I have had a moment or two of lag but have not had the scenarios that other people have complained of where constant lag is upsetting the game play.  Perhaps they have internet problems or they just play so much they see it and I don't.  If I had any complaints it is that players aren't evenly matched up, often a new player is pitted against people with a disparative skill level and that makes play frustrating and people aren't very forgiving to players of lesser skill.  I guess for some people they can't understand that this is just a game and any \"reward\" is only what you take away from your time playing.EDIT:  In regards to the online play I wanted to add an additional update.  As others have said (and I originally dismissed) there are some quirks with the online play.  Call it \"lag\" for lack of a better term.  I've noticed situations where I've fired my weapon (especially noticeable with sniper weapons) and nothing happens, the bullet never appears and never strikes the target.  It is bizarre.  Also, when you view the 'kill cam' showing you being gunned down you can see that what you were seeing and what the opposing player was seeing are not the same.  For example, I've fired into an approaching opponent and been killed only to watch the kill cam and notice that it doesn't show me shooting at all.  Genuinely weird and more than a little annoying.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2008"}

TS is basically a clone of Goldeneye/Perfect Dark.  Any fan of those games will definitely notice the similarities.  The look, the perspective, the weapons, the music, everything has that air of familiarity about it.  TS was even made by former Goldeneye developers.If you can gather 3 friends, though, be prepared for the epiphany of FPS.  A round of TS/PD/Goldeneye with 4 people beats an LAN game of Quake or Counter-Strike hands-down.  There is something about everyone sitting together that is lost when people have their own screens.  Still, I feel the multiplayer part is lacking.  TS offers better graphics than an N64 FPS, and the framerate never drops no matter how many bots you play with.  However, TS just doesn't offer the same number of options or levels that Perfect Dark offered 6 months ago.  I think that is very important for preventing a game like this from getting boring.  I have much more fun with Perfect Dark because of this very reason, despite the improvements in Timesplitters.  Most of all, I *don't* recommend buying this game to play by yourself.  The &quot;story&quot; mode is boring, and the bots are fairly dumb.  You fun is directly proportionate to the number of people you play with, so be wary if you can't get the gang together all that often.The biggest disappointment is the level builder.  The available &quot;building blocks&quot; are very few, like 8-10 total rooms and various corridors to connect them.  Don't expect to make a replica of your school or house, because every level looks like the same non-descript maze.  Overall, the level builder is easy to use and a great advancement to the genre, but most creative people will get bored with it really quickly.

It is very good even judged by the high standards set by its peers.  But it does have some significant flaws.Story (7/10) - The first half of the game set the stage for a very solid storyline.  The presentation of the game is outstanding - the voices are a remarkable improvement over the poor voice acting from FFX.  The interaction between the characters feels very realistic and was enjoyable to watch, with a solid balance of serious, emotional scenes to witty and well timed humor.However, the high expectations for a solid story and and well-developed characters is not met in the second half.  The most glaring story deficiency is surprisingly found in the \"main\" characters: by the end of the game, you really start to wonder why Vaan and Penelo are sticking around.  They don't contribute much at all to the main plot, and their young age compared to the other mature party members really begs for a better explanation of why exactly their running with this rag-tag crew.Graphics/Sound (9/10) - The graphics of Square's latest Final Fantasy is superb.  Prior installments of the Final Fantasy scenes really show the developer's improvement in the realm of computer animation.  The character movements are much more detailed and realistic, leaving behind the awkward body gestures from FFX.  The sound effects are your standard rpg fare (I'll admit I'm not a big audophile, and can't really tell the difference of sound effects from one game to another), and as stated above, the English voice-overs are really excellently done.  The sound track is an extremely pleasant departure from the overly rehashed Nobuo Uematsu themes that have plagued the series the past few iterations.One small complaint would be the lack of diversity in terms of enemy models.  After 60-70 hours, you really start to tire of hacking through the same Malboro/Skeleton/Wolf mob models that are recycled throughout the entire game.Gameplay (8/10) - Square really rolled the dice on this game and it payed off.  The real-time gambit combat system is a marked improvement and evolution from Final Fantasy's turn-based roots.  The gameplay features smooth, uninterrupted breaks from travel to combat, a welcome relief that takes much of the hassle of battling away from the prior FF's.  Still, Final Fantasy's first flirtation with real-time combat suffers from two significant flaws:1) The gambit system is imperfect.  FFXII's combat system relies a lot on the gambit system, which basically involves the player \"scripting\" its AI for its characters.  Three party members battle simultaneously, and the combat takes place in real-time (except the player can pause to issue a command), which means much of your party's actions are done automatically.  However, for simplicity's sake, the gambit system is very basic: you can issue simple conditional and prioritized commands for your AI controlled characters.  For example, you can create a gambit that causes a character to cast \"poisona\" to cure poison on a party member when he/she has been poisoned.  The drawback for simplicity is that in certain situations, you'd like to have more refined conditionals.  Sure, if a character is poisoned you'd like to cast poisona, or if a character is blind, you want to cast blindna, but if a character is poisoned AND blind, you'd rather cast the high MP cost Esuna, which would clear BOTH blind AND poison.  Because the simplicity of the system, you can either set it up so it'll cast the two spells, or set it up that you'll always cast the more mana intensive esuna, wasting mana in situations where you only need to cast one spell.  Similarly, if one character is afflicted with a status effect you might want to cast esuna, but you kind of wish that you could write a gambit for the condition where TWO party members are afflicted with a status to cast esunaga instead (which is an area effect esuna spell).  Another similar problem is encountered when scripting healing spells.  By the end-game, I've scripted healing gambits to cast Curaja, which heals in entire party.  The condition is when a party member is below 50% health.  Obviously, if two party members have health below 50%, you only need to cast once, since it's an area effect spell.  But there's no way to script that with the simple gambit system, and if I allow the game to go full auto, two spells would be cast, wasting a lot of mana. The speed of the combat system makes it really tedious to micro-manage all these events as well.2)  Spell casting is poorly done.  For some reason or another, the game mechanics make it impossible for two spell animations to be on screen at once in certain instances, meaning that if all the of your party members have a spell queued, the first animation will go off, and while it's going off, the other two characters will just sort of stand around: problem being, the enemy is still allowed to do regular attacks.  So if you're casting something with a fairly long cast animation, the enemy will be wailing on you in the meantime, making it regular attacks preferable, in case you need to get an emergency heal off.Another minor complain I have is that the character progression system, the license system, means open-ended character creation, which sort of takes away from the character development of the individual characters.  It'd be preferable to have a class system where the character's combat abilities reflected the character, like Vaan, the street theif would have theif abilities like steal, and use weapons like daggers.  Instead, it's possible to turn the small framed Penelo into your hardy tank class, which kind of doesn't make sense.  And by the end-game, you'll have acquired all the licenses for all your characters, making them identical for all intents in purposes in combat.In conclusion, FFXII is a solid Final Fantasy game, in a series with many outstanding iterations.  However, contrary to the way many reviewers paint the game, it is not a perfect game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2007"}

The small kingdom of Dalmasca was one such neighbor, and it is here that our tale begins. \nIn a fight for freedom, fallen royalty and unlikely allies must struggle to liberate their homeland.","reviewerName":"Christopher Barrett \"Evil Corgi\"","summary":"Not the best storyline, but a solid RPG ~","reviewText":"Let me equate my review by stating that I have been playing Final Fantasy games since the very first release when I was young.  I have been generally well impressed with the games, and have to say that 12 kept up the high bar.  I will list some of the faults that I have, but compared with many other PS2 RPGs, this one shines.First big plus: open exploration!  You now have huge, expansive maps to tread around.  No more random encounters unless you count the occasional monster popping out from behind things.  But in order to gain rare items and drops, you must take out a few monsters every now and then.  Oh, and for experience points.  But now it's fun to go hunting for particular monsters in order to secure some rare drops (from even common foes).The graphics are superb for the PS2.  They easily rival FFX with the improved engine and lack of static and flicker.  Detail on the characters is superb.  Yes, Vaan is weird looking (kind of like Meg Ryan on testosterone treatments).  The voice acting is superb, even in the English dub.  Again, not comparing to FFX (which was in a class all its own thanks to the amazing story).  Music is enjoyable and catchy, thanks to the same composer from FF Tactics and Vagrant Story.  It suits the moods and settings and never really gets irritating, even with long hours spent in certain areas with the same track playing.Warp crystals add a nice touch of the insta-travel.  You get access to them pretty soon, and they become indispensable.  Of course you have to 'touch' one first to be able to warp back to it. The addition of the hunts are nice.  These occur at all times and add a nice bit of side adventure challenge.  Especially if you are tackling a rather tough hunt at an early level.  The rewards are nice, and the weapons and items found can often be purchased or found later (which makes tacking these hunts later rather ho hum and easy).  There are many other side quests mixed in as well.The interface is nice.  Being able to target monsters, NPCs and such is nice.  You can actually see who you are targeting before attacking or speaking (avoid some long re-rants).  Battle is fluid and fun thanks to the gambit system.  The fact that the characters are all set to 'fight' is nice (though you can manually control them or remove the 'fight' gambit to have them prioritize some other action).  You can purchase or find gambits later on to make fighting even less of a headache.  Since battle is fast paced it makes since.  Again, you can slow it down and set it to queue up individual character actions if you want the true old school feel.  But with the gambits you could, say, have Fran attack the strongest enemy as her lowest priority, then cast fire on any enemy weak vs fire with higher priority, or heal a player with less than 30% HP as the highest.  You can still give commands, it just queues them up for that character's next action.  Again, fluid.  It takes some getting used to, and you can turn the gambits off on the fly.  To prevent someone from attacking that far away, yet creepily close level 25 T-Rex while you're at level 4 hunting quacktaurs or cockatrices (ouch!).  But the AI is basically set to whatever you want.  You have a max number of gambits, and can acquire new slots, but it still maxes out.  Just so you can't program dozens of gambits and then just take a nap while the game plays on.  But the system sure beats mashing the 'attack' button dozens of times.Finally we come to the story.  Rather... limp?  Not really weak, just not really all that exciting for a video game.  It is a more politics driven story and one with lots of subtleties.  But gone is the romance aspect (other than a few characters having a crush).  The main villain is also rather... ordinary.  After the cast of amazing baddies, you think that SE would be able to come up with someone better than Val Kilmer's stunt double.  And there is really no true 'last dungeon' instead it's a short, rather easy area.  The previous are though is massive and requires hours to reach the pinnacle.There are interesting side stories and secondary characters to keep things interesting.  Balthier is a treat to watch on screen.  Basch has some witty remarks here and there.  Ashe is full of pent up rage and angst, but not too whiny.  Vaan and Penelo were actually an afterthought.  Which is why they don't seem to work into the rest of the cast.  They were apparently added to appease the Japanese audience who they feared would not become interested in a huge cast of very \"Western' looking and acting characters.So the story does play out like a very slow version of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, but with all of the adventuring and side quests, you really can take quite a break between cut scenes and story advancements.  A worthy game that I still enjoy playing today, and one of the last truly Epic and truly adventurous mainstream RPGs.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2011"}

In the Katamari games, you are rolling a sticky ball. That's it! It's amazing how addictive it can get.This is the second game out, after Katamari Damacy. You are a prince. Your dad is the eternally bizarre and self-absorbed King of All Cosmos. He sets a series of challenges up for you, with the aim of creating stars. You wander along a grassy meadow, meeting up with people and choosing which challenge to work on next.The graphics are just amazing here, in a cartooney sort of way. You wander through an undersea world, rolling up various sea creatures. You roll around a home office, gathering typical office supplies. In each case you start with a little ball. As you roll the ball over an object, if it's small enough, it sticks onto your ball and you can actually see it rolling around. As you pick up more items, the ball gets larger and larger.You're ranked, depending on which section of the game you're in, on how quickly you make your ball grow large, on how large you get the ball to be, and various other ranking schemes.The music is fine, although I would have liked a little more variety. It's just a little too techno for me, all the time. I like to hear a variety of music types in a game like this.This is really a game that is PERFECT for all ages. There's no bloody shooting of enemies. There are no super complex puzzles to solve. All you do is roll, roll roll. It's very soothing, in a way, a mindless way to rid yourself of the stress of work or school. You're achieving something, and you just roll along to do it.My only complaint is that the co-op mode is rather challenging. It's tricky to get two people to roll a ball together. With this being such a great game for kids, I *really* wish they could think up a way for a parent to play with their kid (or even a grandparent to play with their kid). It's a game that appeals to all age levels - but there just isn't much of a way for those people to play \"together\". Surely there'd be some way to do that - maybe give one character a 'freeze ray' to stop items that are in motion, so the other character can then go roll them up.In any case, the game is quite a lot of fun, for those times that you want a relaxing, mindless, casual game.

I saw it sitting on a shelf and thought it would be just another generic shooter with Tom Clancy's name on it that would probably end up collecting dust if I bought it.  I couldn't be more wrong!  This game is the epitome of addicting fun.  It's a tactical strategy game, in the same vein as Final Fantasy Tactics and Advance Wars, with a military theme.  You are given a squad of troops, each with different specialties, and you must complete the missions using their strengths to your advantage.  The game's plot revolves around a conflict involving the Russians and Ukranians, but really the story isn't the reason you play this game.  You can just skip the cutscenes altogether and not miss a beat.  The missions, however, are extremely well-done.  The game throws a lot of variety your way, and you'll easily find yourself losing hours of your life to this game.  The game is also really long, with 35 missions to tackle in the main campaign as well as a meaty selection of skirmish missions.  On top of that, there are also multiplayer missions, though sadly the game doesn't support online play.  The main missions themselves are pretty long as well, with several taking 30 minutes to an hour to complete...sometimes more on higher difficulties.The 3D effect is pretty neat, though it adds absolutely nothing to the gameplay.  It is purely for aesthetic purposes.

{"product_name":"B0058SHNF4","description":"","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"Woah, a dance game for kids that isn't dumbed down.","reviewText":"As soon as your game's name mentions being for kids in the title, that's usually a red flag as far as quality's concerned. Most developers churn out a kid's game without having much of an understanding of what it takes to make a good kid's game. And for a 'grown up' system like the ps3, it's rare to get a good kid's game that isn't a platformer. It's even more rare when the game turns out to be one that uses the Move, and is a music game of sorts. Just Dance Kids 2 is one of those games that I sighed at when it arrived in my mailbox, but shocked me at how much time UBI Soft put into making it a great package. But here's a quick warning for parents thinking about getting this title- this game is more for kids ages 4-7. Kids older than that will probably be ready for the regular dance games, but as usual, it depends on the person playing it. There are a lot of songs on here that anyone past the 2nd grade will probably roll their eyes at once they see them. That aside, if you have a young child, Just Dance Kids 2 is worth a shot.Amazon finally got the song list up in their Product Description section, so I won't need to list them out here. It's a fairly good selection of songs, and I was glad to see two tracks from Yo Gabba Gabba! and the infamous Gummy Bear song. Even the 'classics' are pretty good, though I don't know if any youngsters will know any of these in this day and age. Unless you're showing them Tiny Toon Adventures dvds or you're a big They Might Be Giants fan, there's not much of a chance that they'll know Istanbul. The game itself plays like your typical dance game, and grading is a little generous compared to something like say, Everybody Dance. If my old tubby self from the early 90s were to play this game now, I'd probably be getting above average scores and feeling like a Disco Stu[d]. You can even have it set so up to 4 kids can dance to a song, provided you have the Move controllers to do so, and have a good time at birthday parties or holiday events. Of all the features included with Just Dance Kids 2, the one that surprised me was the tracker that shows how long your child has been playing, which song they've played the most, and about how many calories have been burned. You know what else is cool? They even included a 'Pose & Shake' mode that has your child pretending to play instruments in the song. It might not seem like much, but the fact that they threw it in here is nice. Finally it has to be said that the kids dancing in the game are full of energy and look genuinely happy to be doing all of the dances. Even the little dude dressed up as Gru for the Despicable Me track looked into it, despite being a bad guy.There's not much negative to say about Just Dance Kids 2. It's a cheap game, so you won't feel like you've been ripped off, the gameplay is simple to get into, and it has a lot of great features. I just feel that the covers of the songs on here could've had a bit more energy in them (was it that hard to get the rights to the original songs?), and it would've been even better if the songs would've been played out in full. But with everything else the game gets right, I won't nitpick too much. Just Dance Kids 2 is one of the better dance games out there, and one of the better games for young kids at the moment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Bill.B \"Bill\"","summary":"Halo Has Done It Again!","reviewText":"I hated XBOX ever since it came out.  Then I heard all the talk about Halo 2.  Everyone said you have to play it.  So finally I broke down and bought Halo 2 and an XBOX.  I don't have that many games but I don't need to.  Halo 2 is all I need.  It's true that the overall game is only around 7 or 8 hours but it's the best 7 or 8 hours you'll ever have.  I love how you can use duel weapons.  It is so much better preportioned then the new 007 game.  The graphics once again show how the XBOX has better graphics then any other system.  The story line isn't as good as the first but I've seen worse.  The replay value isn't as good as the first Halo which kind of sucks.  I still play through the game over and over though due to it being so much fun.  The multiplayer action is the best I've ever seen.  It's so much fun. You can just play it with your friends for hours before noticeing that you've been playing for that long.  The online play is obviously just as good.  When I played everything seemed to run smoothly and it was extremely fun.  Overall it's worth buying an XBOX just for this game.  I did and I'm not dissapointed.

{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"Mali","summary":"Pass","reviewText":"I have never played #2 or #3, but from what I've read and heard, they have all the parts of this game that I didn't like amplified.

Nonimowse. \"bomber214\"","summary":"Good mix of shooting, platforming, and light puzzle solving","reviewText":"Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is a third person perspective game that combines cover style shooting characteristics with easy to navigate platforming portions.  You play Nate Drake, a descendant of Sir Francis Drake.  Nate is a treasure hunter, thrill seeker, and general all around movie actor Dirk Pitt sorta guy with an incredible vertical leap and ability to stick to pretty much anything.  Uncharted combines third person shooting, platforming that is intuitive, lightweight puzzle solving, a gun ride mission, a few vehicle style missions, and wraps the entire thing up with nearly movie quality cinematics.  Nate will spend the game hunting for El Dorado, and uttering exasperations at being beset on all sides by bad guys with pretty good aim.The environments are stunning.  I don't want to spoil the game, so I can't really describe all the different areas -- but know that there are a wide variety of interestingly laid out levels.  Lush environments, very three dimensional style level design, and some interesting locations are really the highlight of this game.The shooting action is hairy, plain and simple.  Early on it starts manageable, but as you progress there is, unfortunately, a spam effect.  In the end the amount of enemies you will face is ridiculous.  The AI is pretty good at advancing, flanking, and boxing you in.  The enemy AI is also very good at splitting your wig.  They'll use grenades to flush you out, they'll rush you with shotguns, snipers way off in the distance will hone in on you with laser scopes, and guys with grenade launchers will carpet bomb your location.  The cover system is manageable, and the ammo plenty -- in some cases.  Near the end of the game ammo becomes a more significant issue.  You'll get a few different weapons that have different feels to them, but weapon variety isn't really this game's strong point.  Sometimes you'll have a choice, but depending on ammo usage you'll just end up using whatever is lying around.  The grenade tossing system makes use of the Six Axis stuff...  and, at first, is irritating, but in the end is actually quite usable.The puzzles are very lightweight and shouldn't take too much actual thought to complete.  Mostly you'll get a page out of Drake's diary and you'll have to play \"match the symbol\".  The platforming, for the most part, is straight forward, although there are times when you have to look around a bit -- and think in three dimensions.  There is one puzzle level where the environment, itself, is a puzzle and that was pretty neat.  Again, stunning environments in three dimensions.Lastly, the cut scenes are movie quality.  Yes, the story itself is pretty run of the mill -- treasure hunters, intrigue, betrayal, twists, good guys, bad guys, and Germans.  Yes, I said Germans.  You'll see.  Despite that, the story is very engaging, the characters believable, and the cut scenes are immersing.The game is not without its flaws.The game uses a checkpoint based system that is silent -- you don't know when you've crossed a checkpoint.  This can be a bit irritating as sometimes the checkpoints are very frequent, and sometimes they aren't.  Sometimes you can cross a checkpoint, get killed, reappear, and be facing the same group of bad guys and get killed...  again.It has moments of cloudy pathfinding, overkill combat scenes that end up with you repeating them multiple times because that one guy to your right keeps headshotting you with a shotgun at fifty paces, frustration relating to odd perspectives during platforming that result in you falling to your ragdoll death, and so forth...  but, overall, it is a very fun game.  I'd say that I was very surprised at the quality of the game.  The game does a good job of mixing up its elements and varying how you play through each level.A game worth of sixty dollars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2009"}

Wake is able to sleep again, but after he meets a mysterious woman, he begins to have terrible nightmares. As he puts these nightmares on paper for a new book, he soon notices that all the things that happen in his book are coming true right before his eyes.Using cinematic effects and technology such as real-time lighting, shadows and reflections, you'll be treated to a game that is oozing with atmosphere and able to invoke an emotional response from the player. The realistic environment features real-time weather and light changes that effect the game play for a remarkably immersive experience.Explore an Entire TownThe town of Bright Falls is 100 square kilometers, and players will be able to roam through this incredibly detailed area any way they like, roaming the town or wandering out to the lakes, forest, satellite towns, and more. The game gives the player goals, but how he chooses to go about completing them is up to him. Clues are scattered throughout the town, and solving mysteries will require players to pay close attention to the little details.Intense CombatIn addition to solving puzzles and exploration, the game also pushes players into serious action and combat; when night comes, creatures will take their best shots at Alan, and you'll have to be quick with strategy as well as weapons to beat them back.Alan Wake presents an unusual and new gaming experience that features a riveting, multi-layered story while giving the player the ability to freely roam a giant environment. It supports Dolby Digital sound.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Lots of hype but lots of greatness","reviewText":"It's kind of an old thing to say now about the long development period that Alan Wake had since nearly everyone who brings up the game asks \"was it worth the long wait?\" Not so much a question of \"is the game good?\" but rather a question that's posed towards the hype and anticipation more than the game itself. Alan Wake couldn't be seen as just a good or great game you see but a 5 year wait (apparently planned since 2001 but announced 2005) means that this thing had to be the absolute best thing you can buy for your Xbox this year, otherwise what's the point in them taking so long. Now that it is here, it does feel a bit surreal and it's hard not to think about \"wow, we actually have it, like...it's real!\" now we got to ask is whether the game's good. If I don't take into account the long wait, then I'll absolutely say \"yes\". From the superbly told storyline to the occasionally breathtaking graphics and solid voice acting, then I'd say it is but then I think of it's kind of short length, couple of graphical hitches and combat that kind of gets a bit old the more you play and I can say that Alan Wake is definitely worth a playthrough but how great that playthrough will be depends on just how much you're expecting from the game.Story: The story centers on Alan Wake, a successful novelist who unfortunately has hit the most dreaded fear known to his kind: writer's block. Trying to break out of it and take some refreshing visits to the country, Alan and wife Alice arrive at the city of Bright Falls, a small friendly town with a couple of odd locals. But when Alice disappears, people act incredibly erratically and violently and a dark mist/cloud seems to envelop the environment at night, it's clear something's up with the time. But things get even more crazier when Alan realizes the events unfolding have been written in a manuscript for a book entitled \"Departure\" that he himself wrote yet can't remember that he did.Alan Wake uses a clever idea of having the game play out almost like a television episode with a \"previously on...\" opening segment and cliffhangers book-ending each episode. The most common similarities the game has been drawing is that it's like Twin Peaks and some X-Files and maybe even some Lost and for sci-fi/horror guy like myself who absolutely adore the X-Files, this game is nearly a godsend. Paranormal crazy things going on and freaky things happen so when a tree suddenly topples in the distance or a house you're in starts to crash and crumble around you with glass breaking and things flying everywhere, the game gets intense. But where it might differ for you is whether it's scary and to that I say this game is more Dead Space than Fatal Frame or a Silent Hill. This game I doubt will make you lose sleep but you'll sure as hell feel tense when you play it.Graphics: Looking at Alan Wake in the nighttime scenes and you'll think this is one of the more eerie and freakiest games from the unbelievable lighting to the haze/fog that permeates through the forest, this game oozes atmosphere and it's all the more creepier for it. And I can't say more great things about the lighting from the flares you drop and the ones you shoot, this game looks stunning. But then you get to the daytime scenes and you run into incredible vistas that look almost painterly and you're like \"wow, they didn't need to make it that detailed but they sure went whole nine yards to make it look great\". That is until you notice some strange facial animation, especially in the lip sync and it's got some of the more noticeable screen tearing this side of Darksiders. One time I literally rotated the camera back and forth between a window and the tearing kept returning every time. Also sometimes the cutscenes seem different compared to the in-game so for instance if I walked forward and literally stood a foot from a character in some medium ambient light, the cutscene all of a sudden has me in the doorway with more darker lighting. Alan himself is...okay in that his running animation looks oddly funny but the slow-mo dodge he can do never gets old.Sound/Music: In order to freak you out, you need some absolutely great sound design and luckily this game has it. Playing with headphones or with a really sweet surround sound setup and the game takes on a whole different feel than if it was in mono. From what sounds like breathing occasionally in-game to the ambient noise to sounds that almost are geared specifically to creep you out even if nothing caused it (I investigated a cabin once, Alan stood still and I could've sworn I heard footsteps on the outside patio). Voice acting is uniformly excellent as well but the writing in some of it is kinda screwy. The tone in Alan's narration is perfect but when it comes down to lines from townsfolk it just doesn't sound right but the actors make do with it. There's even some music that bookends the chapters that's cool and there's one moment that Left 4 Dead 2 players will instantly recognize midway.Gameplay: Alan Wake's \"gimmick\" as it were is the light vs dark mechanic that the story also centers around. Alan 90% of the time in the game will be carrying a flashlight and when the baddies of the game, dubbed the \"Taken\", are exposed to this light or any forms of light and it starts to for lack of a better description, \"burn\" the darkness of them at which point they become way more vulnerable to gunfire. You can carry a couple of nifty tools to get the job done from flashbangs which are basically an insta-kill grenade to a flare you can throw on the ground which sort of acts like a temporary haven or an impenetrable area and a flare gun which doubles as your \"RPG\" and crowd control. Weapons are standard fare from revolvers to shotguns to hunting rifles and that flashlight will also require batteries as focusing your beam, or zooming/iron sight, will drain more battery juice and pretty soon you'll either need to replace the battery or wait till it recharges. The controls for this feel incredibly smooth and the aiming and gunplay feel completely natural and not as cumbersome as some shooters are. The same cannot be said for Alan Wake's handling of his body in that Alan's fine when he's not in combat as far as controlling goes but he tends to run out of breath easily and the dodging mechanic mentioned earlier where pressing RB at the right time triggers an awesome slo-mo dodge will be wildly inconsistent and sometimes you'll perfectly nailed it and other times you're like \"dude I'm pressing the button, dodge already!\" Not to mention this isn't Resident Evil 4/5 AI where they stand around and take turns to come after you or take their sweet time to hit you as this AI is incredibly aggressive which makes for some tense combat but also some frustrating ones from either the control issues above or trying to flee only for them to practically catch up to you regardless. It's best then to turn around and flash the light in their face to temporarily stun them, then book it.That's really the majority of the game though there is some really light puzzle solving to do and there's some mini-driving sections which hint at the once open world design the game was originally going to have but after awhile it might start to get slightly repetitive. The music cue will start up or the cinema showing enemies walking towards you plays and you feel like \"oh great, more combat\" when you're not running through the levels going \"oh great, more forest paths\". In a way the game works the best when the scary stuff interacts with the environment and really makes you feel like something is trying to kill you. For instance, one scene midway through the game has you inside a building that suddenly gets \"dark-i-fied\" and you're asked to escape but when doors burst open, glass shatters and things go bat*** crazy, it gets intense. But then when you're in combat, it starts to feel slightly rudimentary. Another thing is that the game is quite heavy on things you either have to personally collect or just add to a counter and this ranges from radio broadcasts, tv shows you watched (excellent Twilight Zone-esque show here), town history you've read through landmarks, coffee thermoses that do nothing but add to an achievement, can pyramids you have to knock over that does jack all and the more common ones being page manuscripts.See, the game's premise is that its events were once written by Wake though he doesn't remember writing them and these are found in his manuscript for his new novel with pages scattered around the levels. Reading them reveals some brief narration and either a description of events that just recently transpired or more commonly, events that have yet to unfold. So when the pages start talking of a guy with a chainsaw or something possessed trying to get at you, it can either go one of 2 ways: you either read and know of its coming appearance but don't know when it'll happen but the dread will be there or you don't read them at all so that when these events do happen you're like \"whoa, holy crap!\" so it really depends on what you do with them. Personally, I only read the first 2 I found and left the rest for after I beat the game. By the way, you can only find all 106 if you collect the ones found in Nightmare mode after you've beaten the game and unlocked the mode.Recommending Alan Wake for people to play is easy: definately. The atmosphere and storytelling are absolutely stellar and there's some genuinely creepy parts even though the game doesn't feel like it should've taken this long to make. Where it gets tricky is whether Alan Wake is good enough for a full blown purchase since the game outside of the achievements doesn't have much replay value and unless you search everywhere, the game's roughly 10 hours or so and whether or not the game's worth the full price is where it gets hard. The game's certainly great enough to own but not sure if it's worth the buy right now but the game is great enough and warrants a purchase it just depends on how much mileage per buck spent you think you'll get out of it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0050SX7BQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Old School Gamer \"What the hell's a gigawatt!?!\"","summary":"A storytelling achievement in gaming.","reviewText":"I've been a gamer for 25+ years and I am one of the few ready for what gaming can become. Thanks to the interactivity of the medium, this art form has the potential to connect a story with the viewer more than any other medium in existence. This potential is largely untapped and, for many, unwanted. For the gamers who almost exclusively enjoy titles like Gears of War or GTA or Call of Duty, they don't want what Beyond: Two Souls strives to be. But for those of us who appreciate it for what it is, it's a technical and emotional marvel.Heavy Rain was a magnificent game. It received a lot of flack for the \"playing a movie\" aspect where there wasn't much in the way of typical gameplay, but mostly from gamers, not critics. As with many of the best movies in the history of film, the professionals appreciated it while the normals did not as much. It found its audience, people like myself, and succeeded but it was always destined to divide the masses.This game suffers from the same exact scenario. In a year that has seen dynamic games like The Last of Us(still my choice for GotY) and Bioshock: Inifinite(runner up for GotY alongside Beyond IMHO), we are also getting the obviously stupendous titles like GTA. GTA has set records because, let's be honest here, the masses want GTA. But for those of us who love stories in our games, for those of us who appreciate writers who dare us to be compelled by the characters we play as, for those few who truly want to see where this wonderful pastime will evolve there is Beyond: Two Souls. The game is effectively standing up in a crowd of look-a-likes who are content to excel at the gameplay but not the art form. Quantic Dream desires the latter and this game succeeds on all counts.If you played Heavy Rain and enjoyed it in any way at all, this game is exactly the same. If you didn't like Heavy Rain because of the lack of gameplay, then don't buy Beyond. This is a very simple guideline. It is a characteristic of the insane to try the same thing twice expecting different results. Quantic Dream does one thing and they do it with unabashed fervor. I daresay Beyond features slightly less gameplay than Heavy Rain. While there is \"combat\" and gunplay in this title, it is still in the form of quicktime events and exceedingly scripted. Heavy Rain had a lot more of the \"puzzle\" feel in that you needed to discover more in the environment in order to move on or make certain events occur to get the desired outcome in the story. This game is much more about the storytelling using the gameplay as a mechanism than the other way around.Here's the caveat with this type of game. If you come in expecting to be wowed by the gameplay mechanics, then you're in it for the wrong reason and miss the point of its existence. If you pop the disc in and are immediately drawn to Jodie(played by Ellen Page) and her plight, then you will never even notice the lack of gameplay. As I've aged I can usually rate a games storytelling pretty early on. I'm a big JRPG fanatic and long gone are the days when I would read every dialogue box in FFVI. Very few stories pull us in that way anymore. This is why the ones like Bioshock or TLoU stand out so, because they tell stories more interactively and realize they need to use the medium in its own, truly unique way. Quantic Dream gets this as well. When you combine real actors, probably the most amazing animation this generation(LA Noire is the only game that's come this close to perfect representations of facial animation), and Hollywood class musical scoring, you have the perfect recipe for abstract connection. I desperately want the soundtrack to this game it is that good. It's on par with almost any movie I've ever seen and at times sends chills right down my spine.At no point in my experience with this game did I ever concern myself with how little or in what form I was playing this game. The story is compelling to the nth degree and I was enthralled all the way to the end. I nearly cried at the end to be honest. So much of this story is heartfelt and emotional, perhaps none moreso than the ending(no matter how you choose to end it). I've hardly ever walked away from an experience feeling as rewarded as I do after buying this game. I don't put a value on the amount of time I spent playing it. I put a value on how long the story and characters will stick with me, which is for the rest of my life.Please don't buy this game if you're not open to the idea of what it is trying to be. Quantic Dream wants us to experience story in the most profound way possible and they succeed without error, but only if you are able to let go of your preconceptions on what a video game should be. There is no crime in being different and this game is but one title in a sea of thousands that can satiate your hunger for gameplay. If you love well told stories and truly cinematic, jaw-dropping experiences then give this game a chance.

GO SCREW YOURSELF, PLAYER&#34;.it is interesting, yes. games that have done the illusion of choices (bioshock infinite and walking dead) can sometimes be the best way of making a deep impact that no matter how many times you play it, you can't save everyone or change your outcome. but this game take the idea of something so definitive of 'choices' and gives you the middle finger in the biggest way possible.see, when you have a 'god-like' figure in the game (you know, jodie is like kung fu action jesus) you don't feel the need to protect them. in fact, i realized that i could play the game with honestly leaving the remote down for most of the action sequences. honestly. i know it's a 'movie' geared game to change the mindset of players and such but... what's the point of 'playing' a 'game' like this when you can just watch it?some ideas would make for a more interesting approach for a movie rather than a game. heavy rain? great game! again, the combat didn't always affect the outcome but if you messed up an answer it would take note and change the game like a never ending book. beyond two souls? EHHHHH you're ideas and input don't count so here's a shower scene instead and an awkward make out scene instead.i get how deep and interesting and revolutionary this game wants itself to be... obviously as seeing there's a part 2 that may or may not come out. but this isn't a way to have the game work. you can have a linear story and have it more interesting than this.quantic dream is a beautiful production company but... their director? they need to get rid of him. honestly. to say this is was a huge letdown in my hopes of gaming doesn't properly sum up my true emotions for this game.buy it if you want, it's an interesting idea with great control ideas.. but if you want something that gives the illusion of something much deeper than what it is (just listen out for that annoying &#34;AHHHHHHHH~~ AHHHHHHHHHH~~ AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH-AHHHH-AHHHHHHHH&#34; music that always plays when they want you to 'feel' something deeply emotional) then this is the game for you. the team at quantic knows its shit. it's beautiful, plays smoothly and is wonderful.the story isn't worth a second playthrough.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2014"}

The game goes to painstaking efforts to make the story grounded within reality. The game look amazing and has tons to do within the game.

When I decided to purchase a new video game system, I had a very difficult time in knowing which system to buy. I could've bought the Xbox or Playstation 2, largely because of the value of games they've each came up with. Instead, I felt it was a wiser move to purchase the Gamecube from Nintendo. I think it was a much wiser mover, because it was easier to drag around, and because of the games that were available for it. One of them, really reminds me so well of a classic. Mario Kart has been considered as one of the Top 5 racing games of all time, accoriding to the Nickelodeon GAS show Play 2 Z. When I got to play this one, I thought it was much fiercer than ever before.Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, is the first Mario Kart release to really have a massive impact, since Mario Kart 64 back in 1997. The game takes on a true new light, as not one, but 2 different characters range with special weapons, and much more difficult tracks than the previous Mario Kart. The graphics really stand out on all the tracks as a premium that Gamecube has brought for about the past few years, and the game has more than ever. The game has the exact same number of courses and surprises that was in the previous one, but the oponents are tougher and make your road to #1 a lot harder. I also have to admit, the idea of swapping the team during the middle of the race also makes the pace a lot harder to go around, and the carts are definitely cute to fierce, depending on the status of your driving. I also like the idea of the internet device that can be used to add to the mayhem of Mario Kart. It just makes the game a lot more exciting, considering that just came out recently too. The game stands out a whole lot more than other racers at this time, largely because other racing games are exactly just the same these days.This is the very first game I've ever purchased for the Gamecube, since I bought the game system just recently too. I don't know how many people may enjoy the new Mario Kart: Double Dash!! as much as I am. Whatever the case is, Nintendo should really consider making a sequel very, very soon. This race cannot be stopped.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00009WAUD","reviewerName":"potato_salad \"Marqus\"","summary":"A great addition to an excellent Nintendo library","reviewText":"This is the best Mario Kart game to date. I've played everyone except the one for DS. This is probably the best racing game every too because it is stragety compared to just speed. Anybody can put the pedal to the metal but can you stay ahead when you have no advantage in speed.The best thing about this game is that you can use two characters at once. So one is driving(driver can hold an item also) and the other is throwing the items. That essentially turns the game from an 8 player game to a 16 player game. Chalk this game up on the list of Ultimate Nintendo party games. Whoever on the Nintendo staff thought that idea up should be put in the Nintendo hall of fame beside mario and donkey kong. That is pure genius. Now you can save an item that you may need instead of using it right away. The only catch is though that if you get hit by a shell, lightning, or banana, you drop all you items.That can easily be avoided by dodging shells and bananas. How you may ask. Well here is the other, less noticably addition to the game. When playing with a friend in the back, they can press the L or R button to dodge things, slow drivers down, knock opponents of the road, or steal items from opponents.The last addition is the ability to use specials. Maro & Luigi can throw green or red fireballs. Baby Mario & Baby Luigi can use Chomps to clear the road for them. Donkey Kong & Diddy can throw a giant banana. Wario & Waluigi can throw an explosive bomb. Bowser & Baby Bowser can throw a giant Bowser shell. Peach & Daisy can steal opponents weapons. Toad & Toadette can get unlimited boost for about 8 seconds. Yoshi & Birdo have a homing shell. Koopa & Paratroopa have 3 green or red shells. Last but not least Piranha Plant & Boo have ALL THE POWERS. All in all, this is a best game in the series and well worth owning for any serious Nintendo fan or Gamecube owner.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2005"}

This mysterious power forms the beginning of all life, is the source of all magic and the origin of all thought. For eons the angelic Seraphim watched over the T-Energy and therefore over the fate of the entire world. But eventually tiring of their burden, they passed their knowledge on to the High Elves. T-Energy helped the realm of the High Elves to experience an unimaginable boost of prosperity, making it the reigning culture in Ancaria. But a force as powerful as T-Energy carries great dangers. Not taught how to deal with this, no sooner did the Elves take control, then a heated dispute erupted among them as to how and to what purpose the T-Energy was to be used. Dispute morphed into irresolvable conflict, then rift and eventually to a civil war among the High Elves, where all participants were losers. Their realm collapsed and with it the entire power structure of Anacaria. In the turmoil all the peoples of Anacaria coveted the right, either openly or in secret, to wield the power of T-Energy and in the end, unmanaged, the T-Energy raged out of control warping creature and lands alike. Can anyone regain control over the T-Energy. And if so, will he/she strive to prevent the world from lapsing into final chaos, or deepen it?GameplayGameplay inSacred 2: Fallen Angelin divided into two campaign paths: Light and Dark. As the game begins players choose and customize their character and choose the path they will follow. This choice determines the ultimate goal and intentions of their character, and as the game progresses through literally hundreds of quests and side quests, the paths of different characters intersect at different junctions. Choose one way and you may be tasked to defend a town and its people, while another path could result in you attacking the same town. The choice is yours and the fate of the world and your well-being are at stake.Key Game Features:A massive, seamless and dynamic world delivering hundreds of hours of freeform exploration.Two deep campaigns: play as the 'Light' or 'Shadow' side, complete with distinct skills, rewards and story-elements tailored to the chosen path.Six exceptional, playable characters, each with a distinct look, capabilities and in-game motivation.Modifiable combat arts: change, upgrade and link together your alter ego's combat skills to match your playing style.Fight effectively from the back of a number of mounts under your control; equip and upgrade your character's unlockable special mount.Deities offer unique combat disciplines and unlock additional quests.Seamless transition between single and multiplayer gaming modes via Xbox LIVE.Captivating online modes of play challenge gamers in cooperative, PvP and PvE play.Extraordinary, cutting-edge graphics and Dolby 5.1 channel surround sound utilize the latest technologies for a truly immersive experience.Character ClassesInSacred 2: Fallen Angelplayers assume the role of one of six characters -- five of which are new to the franchise -- and delve into a thrilling story full of side quests and secrets that you will have to unravel. Breathtaking combat arts and sophisticated spells are waiting to be learned. A multitude of weapons and items will be available, and you will choose which of your character's attributes you will enhance with these items in order to create a unique and distinct hero.SeraphimOften referred to as 'Fallen Angels,' these mystical and angelic creatures are the oldest inhabitants of Ancaria. Fast, elegant and acrobatic warriors from a technological future they fight with light to medium weapons and, if required, with massive technological support. Players can assume the role of a Seraphim and protect the world from chaos.Shadow WarriorShadow Warriors were originally humans trained as elite soldiers in service to the High Elves. Upon their death their souls were stolen by an Elven general, bound to lifeless bodies and imbued with T-Energy. Now free, they travel between this world and the next as undead beings with only the desire to return to the peace of the golden halls of Elysium.High ElfThe best student at the ancient academy of magic in Thylysium, the High Elf character lives and breathes magic. Her hunger for adventure and her insatiable desire to increase her personal knowledge and the influence of her once-powerful house are the driving forces as she sets off into an Ancaria boiling over with turmoil.DryadMasters of the hunt and akin to the Elves, The Dryad are in tune with nature and are equipped with the strength of the forests. The most powerful and the strongest among them are knowledgeable of the dark art of voodoo and were chosen in order to save their peoples from extinction. All are expert with the bow, traps, poisons and lore of the forest.InquisitorThe Inquisitors are the High Priests of the High Elves. Arrogant and deadly, they are only committed to themselves and their ultimate goal of assume control over the T-Energy. Proficient in close combat and able to gain increasing power as damage is taken, their manipulative spells make them powerful fighters from the shadows.Temple GuardianSince the beginning of time the purpose of Temple Guardians were to maintain and protect the Great Machine, so that it could keep the world in balance. Neither fully flesh or mechanical, they are half human and half machine. Propelled by T-Energy and devoted to protecting it, they are part of the Great Machine and so able to use the T-Energy for their purposes.A Wide Variety of MountsAcross Ancaria you will find many horse dealers. They offer all kinds of animals, from the simple nag up to a real war horse. You can equip a war horse with bridle, saddle and even special armor. These special items can be found in the game just like player items, ranging in quality from regular to rare and even unique items. In addition, every character also has a unique mount created specifically for their character class. This mount not only fits the personality of the character, but also complements the various aspects of the character's playing style perfectly. All character classes can fight from a mounted position using a variety of tactics that the player chooses depending on the terrain and battle conditions.","reviewerName":"N. C. Hill \"Nchill\"","summary":"Im in the minority, but i like this game.","reviewText":"Despite what some may say, this game is not near as bad as its made out to be.  Its really alot like the first Sacred.  I've read some complaints about the graphics, but im not as picky i guess, i really liked them.  The environments are varied and there is really a lot of detail in each setting.  There are six characters to choose from covering the usual warrior, mage, archer, battle-mage types.  I've only played with the Inquistor and the Shadow Warrior, the warrior being my favorite so far.  He is a warrior summoner hybrid and is great fun to play with, my only gripe is the horrible voice actor they chose for him, the Inquistor is much better.  There is no shortage of quests in this game, you can't go 2 feet without getting another quest, so at any given time you will have 20+ quests.  Thankfully they are easy to find by following the directional arrow and there is no time limit so you can do them anytime.One of my biggest complaints about this title is the inventory and character stat interface, im not sure they could have made it any worse.  I also don't care for the way you acquire abilities, you have to find them on the corpses of enemies instead of just choosing them when you level.  You do get to customize your character with different skills that enhance your abilities at each level.  There are socketed weapons that can be enhanced by visiting a blacksmith.  Learning what the different weapon and armor modifiers mean is kinda a chore as well.  Some weapons will be worth more gold but the stats seem weaker than other cheaper items its weird.  Sacred 2 is a grindfest at its heart, so make sure you are in the mood for it.The game world is flippin huge, i've been playing around 20 hours between 2 characters and i've covered about 6 percent of the game world, wowzers!  I wasn't too impressed with the mounts this game offers, they don't seem all that fast compared to just running, but you can attack and gallop around on your horse if thats your thing.  There several teleporters scattered throughout the realm making it easy to get around.  You can join a friend or two online and quest together, good stuff.  Sacred 2 is far from perfect, but its definately worth trying out if you like a dungeon crawling grindfest.  I feel it translated pretty well into the console realm.  Its tiding me over till Diablo III comes out anyway.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2009"}

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

The bundle came with Sports Champions game, move controller, PS eye, and a demo disk of some other move titles. It was all easy to set up. The games on Sports Champions were very fun. Table Tennis is a blast, and I still can't believe the accuracy of the move. Putting spins on the ball is a blast and I love how you can hit it soft or hard. Disk Golf, Archery, and Gladiator duel are the only other games on Sports Champions I tried, but they're all fun. I have two move controllers, and playing Gladiator duel and Archery is a blast. After 15 minutes of Gladiator duel I was sweating big time. The Shoot was included on the demo disk and I enjoyed it, I'll pick it up when it hits stores in October. The move is way more accurate than the Wii, which brings in more fun. It's also nice to have HD graphics, that's another thing that I hated with the Wii. Yes it's a little more money than a Wii, but it's worth it and its just a better product. If you're on the fence about this or you love Wii, go pick this up.

The good is that the game is pretty relevant to the tunes heard in clubs and on radio today. The bad is that there really isn't as much variety as found on the \"Just Dance\" games, and because the focus is only on current music, \"Everybody Dance\" will probably feel pretty dated in just a few months. (Of course there will be tons of downloads made available from the PS Network to keep it semi-current I'm sure)What I love about this game, and similar titles, is that it gets the kids up off of the couch, jumping around and having a blast instead of just giving them a thumbs only workout. The motion capture feature actually tapes you doing your moves, and has become a source of great laughs watching everybody's moves.I can really see this becoming a hit of the holiday parties we'll be hosting over the next few months too! And for the price, you can't beat what is sure to be a fun game for almost any age.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2011"}
{"product_name":"B006W41W4Q","description":"","reviewerName":"Stephen M. Lerch","summary":"Comparison to X41","reviewText":"About 2 years ago my fiance was complaining about the noise from my surround receiver and my gaming habit. I took the plunge and bought theEar Force X41and couldn't have been happier... except for the near constant popping and clicking I heard. Moving the receiver away from my wireless router fixed some of this, but still, I would get the pops at random intervals and it could be quite annoying. Don't even try to use the microwave if you have the X41s turned on and on your head!I then received aSteel Series Spectrum 7xBvia Vine and did a comparison to the X41s. The 7xBs were only marginally better at keeping down the interference and the extra features over the X41s really didn't make me want to move into using them day to day, so I went back to the X41s not long after my review for the 7xB.Now I'm comparing the XP400s to the X41s and I think I'm going to be sticking to the XP400s this time around.First, there is NO interference to be heard on the XP400s. You read that correctly, NONE. I put the receiver almost on top of the wireless router that caused all my issues with the X41s and the 7xBs and not once in 4 hours of playing like this did I hear even a faint pop or click! I even tried to use the microwave and... still, no pops or clicks! For many people this alone will be the single best reason to upgrade from previous Turtle Beach models.Pairing to the wireless controller communicator was done at the factory, so it really was a matter of: charge the headphones, plug in the receiver to the 360 (I used optical and replaced the X41 receiver), plug the headphone puck into the controller and power up the headphones. Powering up the headphones also turned on the wireless puck.You can control the volume of game chat with buttons on the right headphone, mute is also on this headphone as is the Bluetooth pairing for cell phones. Being able to pair via Bluetooth is also how this headset also works with the PS3. PS3 chat isn't bad, but not as nice for me as the 360 chat, for which these headphones seem to have been designed. I paired this to my phone and made a few calls - everyone thought I sounded OK, just a little tinny.Another nice feature is the mic gain control. This is what changes the mic sensitivity. With it turned all the way up, I hear a near constant hiss and those in my party commented that they could hear a lot of background noise, such as the heater running and family members talking in the background. I dialed this down, which eliminated most of the hiss, if not all, and my chat partners all commented that I was then quite clearly heard, however, I was still described as sounding \"tinny.\"One feature I really liked about the X41s was how no matter what volume I had the game volume set to, I could always clearly hear my party's conversations because they had some algorithm to figure out and volume match in game audio and raise chat volume when explosions and other loud audio is heard in game. The XP400 do as good a job as the X41s, which means it's quite a solid experience to hear conversation clearly as well as in game audio. The 7xBs had a similar feature, but it would actually audibly turn the volume down of game volume, which was kind of distracting, which was another reason I went back to the X41s.The detachable microphone is nice, and seems to be about the same as the X41, though the XP400 is a bit thicker and beefier. The connection seems to be the same, though I haven't yet tried swapping mics between the two. I preferred the 7xB due to the retractable mic, but that feature alone wasn't a big enough reason for me to use them all the time.In terms of sound quality, since the XP400s can use digital audio output from the 360 (and it can also take analog, that red and white connection), you get very clear audio and darn good surround sound as well. In terms of the X41 vs the XP400, I think the XP400 has a little bit of an edge in terms of sound quality. In game surround just sounds better with the XP400s to me. The XP400 also has the ability to change the surround configuration to 4 different presets, all changing how it mixes each \"channel\" of audio in headphone. I've tried all 4 presets and each does change surround configuration subtly. I find the original surround mode works best for my ears.Another nice feature is the preset \"equalizer\" modes. You can enhance nothing (what comes from the 360 is what you hear), you can enhance just bass for bigger explosions, you can enhance just treble for some dialog enhancements and other higher pitched sounds and then you can enhance both. I find I prefer the \"both\" option as it makes the audio sound a bit richer. All of these settings sound better, to me, than the 7xBs.There is one feature, however, that I am completely not happy with on the XP400s. The battery is rechargeable, which is good, however it is built into the headset. It is NOT user replaceable! This means that in 2 years or so, after many recharge cycles, I'll either be forced to buy another pair of headphones or send these to Turtle Beach to pay a fee to have the battery replaced. I absolutely hate this about modern day electronics. Absolutely detest it - built in obsolescence so that people have to spend more money with the company releasing the product. iPad, iPhone, many Android phones, other MP3 players, etc. It's a huge load of horse patoot in my opinion. I like the X41s because I can field replace the AAA batteries on my own. 7xBs, same thing, replaceable batteries. Not so with the XP400. Thankfully you can still use the headphones while they are charging, however this means they aren't always wireless. Nothing is more annoying than having the headphones die mid game and then have to plug in. Of course, this isn't a completely different experience over having to replace the batteries mid play either, just different. I understand the need for a more powerful battery given the added features - Bluetooth eats battery, being completely wireless eats battery and so on. Just because I understand the need for more power than a few AAAs, doesn't mean I like having to have planned obsolescence and not being able to purchase and replace the battery on my own.One thing that is an improvement is the XP400 actually gives you beeps to tell you the headset needs to be recharged. There was nothing more annoying with the XP41s to have them just die mid game, especially during multiplayer fighting as you stop hearing game audio AND chat when this happens. At least now I have about a 10 minute warning before the battery completely dies.Turtle Beach claims 10 hours of battery life on a single charge for \"normal\" use and 15 for \"optimal\" use. What I've found is I can actually pull off about 12 - 13 hours if I turn off the Bluetooth function and just use it for game audio when I'm playing on my own. Adding BT and chat all the time and I'm down to around 11 hours.Over all, the XP400s are a great improvement in every way to the XP41s in everything except for the battery being non-replaceable by the end user. Of course, the MSRP on the XP400 is about $20 higher than the X41s so there is that to remember.Pros:Great surround soundTrue surround sound, not simulated when using optical audioChat and game audio equalization (chat isn't covered up by in game sounds)Completely wirelessNo interference360/PS3 compatibilityCan be paired to your cell phone and used while gaming - no fumbling to put headphones down to answer a call10+ hour play timeCan be used w/ third party controllers (see Con below)A step above the X41sAdjustable microphone gain - if you want to hear yourself louder in the headphones, turn this up. If others in your chat can't hear you clearly, turn this upBT pairing to cell phoneCons:Tinny chat sound during party chat on 360 according to those in my partiesBattery isn't user replaceableThird party (or 1st party wheels) require a cable for chat, which is NOT included (THOUGH THOSE w/ THE X41s, the cable that came with those headphones DOES work)PriceyWhy 4 stars? That battery thing does really annoy me. IF you don't mind not having the ability to replace the battery and don't mind the price, these are a solid 5 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0050SWVIQ","description":"","reviewerName":"I Teach Typing","summary":"Not legendary like the first two, but fun","reviewText":"The Dead Space series, at this point, has been recognized by fans and critics alike to be one of the best survival horror franchises. It's addictive, simple enough to understand but difficult to master gameplay accompanied by the incredible story of &#34;that space engineer&#34; Isaac Clark who just has bad day after bad day. Now, after two long awaited years, Dead Space 3 is upon us, but it is as incredible as the other two games?Taking place after the events of the second game, Isaac is (yet again) being forced into conflicts with the government, crazy Unitologists (worshippers of the zombies in the game, dubbed &#34;necromorphs&#34;), and relationship problems. The story of Dead Space takes place primarily on the frozen planet of Tau Volantis (which isn't as scary as previous games, more on that later). I welcomed the scenery change; the claustrophobic twists and turns in space eventually started to get old late in the first two games. However, Visceral Games dropped the ball in terms of the story; I felt like I just didn't care as much for Isaac, mostly caused by the game's shallow and almost dull script. Don't get me wrong, the voice acting and sound is spectacular in this game, but the writing just doesn't feel as fresh as the other ones. Veterans of the franchise will feel like the story is nostalgic, but simply not as interesting as the others. A big let down considering the franchises' fascinating lore and backstory.Also new to DS 3 is the new weapon crafting system, which is a double edged sword in its own right. While I'm glad Visceral added something as innovative as building your weapon from the ground up, allowing you to make crazy weapon combos, it is intimidating to say the least. While there are blueprints for pre-made weapons, these cost more of your resources than building them the regular way, almost forcing you to make your own weapons. I suggest looking up a guide on how to use the system, because it can be quite confusing to the casual player.The gameplay of the original game returns, with the addictive dismembering of limbs and point-and-shoot gun mechanics. While the new human gun battles aren't as fun as strategically cutting apart necromorphs, I didn't mind them because they are few and far, and well mixed in with the rest of the game. My only complaint about the gameplay is it doesn't feel as tense as the other games, and part of that is caused by the open environment that Visceral has crafted. While beautiful, Tau Volantis just isn't scary, and this makes DS3 feel more like an action horror title rather than survival horror.Yes, it's different. Visceral tried a few things new here, and while not all of it works, it can be forgiven because of the incredibly fun gameplay and stunning graphics and sound design. Recommended to fans of the series and action fans alike.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2014"}

I have several games, and NGS is the one I play the least. It doesn't feel like a next gen game, grapfics aren't that great, sounds isn't so good and the camera really sucks. It's actually the exact same xbox game with MINOR improvements. Why bring a game back if not you're not gonna make it a real competitor to current games?.The game is hard, simply because you can't stay in one spot without getting killed in a second. You have to keep moving and jumping and fighting (with the cameras, not just the enemies). Sounds fun?  naah, it's not. To have some chance, you have to actually learn the combos, and this combos are many, and different with each weapon, but even if you learn and master the combos, theyre not easy to execute because of a really bad camera.Let me say some good thing about this game, theres always good and bad things to say about almost everything. It has a wide range of weapons, the long combos look great when performed the right way, and you fell a great relieve when you finish a level after trying for many times. if you buy this game, you'll probably think it isn't so hard. Wait till you get to level 6 or 7.Unless you have a lot of games and can't find anything to spend your money on, dont buy this game.

With Zelda games, Nintendo is rarely lazy (they do have their moments but they aren't THAT lazy) but this is a game you'd have to play to decide for yourselves. I'd also recommend side questing.... a lot of it is well worth your time and more of the game is sidequest over required part but also makes it so much deeper and makes the characters deeper as well...it also makes some parts a whole lot easier though not always right away.

As the title of this review indicates, this collection would have been worthwhile if it only included Phantasy Star II, II and IV, all of which are good (although II shows its age significantly). However, there are 28 other games present here. A reviewer above had given his opinion of the games; I think I'll give mine as well:Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle:I'm stunned that this character got so many Sega games - I find this game incredibly annoying. Controls (as is the case for many genesis games) are incredibly dicey, and the game itself seems rather insipid (rock, paper, scissors? I'll pass). It's fin for a moment, but like arcade hits of the past, quickly loses its charm.Altered Beast:The cheese factor alone makes this a fun game. Some of the worst voices ever to grace a video game. This game is so-so, but nothing to write home abou (the arcade version, which can be unlocked after a painful ordeal, is much better).Bonanza Bros:I don't get this one at all. Terribly unsatisfying - I feel for the schmoes who paid big bucks for this in the 90's.Columns:Decent Tetris knockoff, but gets difficult quickly. The 2-player versus is a lot of fun, though (although it's no \"Puzzle Fighter\"). I found this game incredibly frustrating after the first few levels.Comix Zone:One of the surprises of the set. A later Genesis game, you travel through comic panels fighting bad guys that you created while in the real world. Stylistically, it is incredibly nice. The voices again are incredibly painful (particularly the \"See ya!\" spoken after defeating any character), but I found this one to be a hidden gem.Decap Attack:Another game I don't remember from back in the day, you play as a mummy attempting to thwart an evil underworld denizen. A pretty good game.Ecco the Dolphin:I liked this game when it came out, and I like it now. Although the undersea graphics aren't so impressive now, the game remains original and fun to play. Two of its sequels, present on the game, are also OK.Flicky:Platform game. I'm not a big fan of the genre in general, and this game did nothing to really make me one. It's cute saving your young chicks, but only OK overall.Gain Ground:Essentially, you run around shooting enemies and saving hostages. The fact that you can ultimately play as 20 different characters gives this game some interesting history, but it's not all that great.Golden Axe:Why is a sword fighter named Ax Battler? And why is \"ax\" spelled two different ways in the game? I'm sure scholars will ponder these questions for eons. As for the game, Golden Ax is incredibly frustrating now (depth issues of which the AI is a master is the main foe) - at the time, I accepted bad controls as part of the game. There is significant improvement in the sequels, however (GA 2 and 3 are also present).Kid Chamelion:I found this game to be kind of charming. An obvious Mario knockoff, you play as a kid in a virtual world, who can...that's right...hit blocks with his head to acquire helmets that will give him new powers, while hopping and bopping enemies. It pales in comparison to Mario, mind you, but it's got its moments.Phantasy Star:Is it Parma? Palma? I sure remember \"Palma\" from my youth, but \"Parma\" seems to be the name now. In any case, great games, WELL worth the price of admission. No, they're not as good as \"Final Fantasy\", and never were, despite the yelps from the games' fans. But nonetheless, these games had excellent stories, with great plot twists (even for today).Ristar:Fun little game where you play as a guy with a star for a head. Resembles \"Sonic\" too much to warrant exceptional praise, but it's a fun game.Shinobi:There are two \"Shinobi\" titles on this disc. \"Shadow Dancer\" stinks, in my opinion. \"Shinobi III\" is still a lot of fun.Sonic the Hedgehog:Oh yeah, THAT guy makes this collection, too. Both \"Sonic\" and \"Sonic 2\" are present here, and both remain excellent. My only gripe (which was the same as when the game was released) are the controls are too fidgety for such a high-speed game. But both games are still excellent to play.Super Thunder Blade:Going WAY back into the Genesis library(I didn't play this version, although I played the original arcade version), STB is an OK game (for an early 3-D shooter), but it's not my style.Sword of Vermillion:Ummm, well, this game is baffling to me. The game tells me that a 106-page hint book was included with the original release because \"Americans weren't used to RPG's\". Thank God all RPG's weren't like this one. Essentially, this game manages to mix all that was wrong with many of my favorite games (\"Ultima: Exodus\" comes to mind, as does the far less-well-known \"Dungeon Magic\"). This one is the stinker of the bunch.Vectorman:Late additions to the Genesis library, and both games were very good. The environments still look kind of trippy even today. I was happy to see these appear here.Virtua Fighter 2:Don't be fooled - this was a horrible port of a great game. Nothing about this game is VF2 other than the characters' names. Released near the end of the system's life, this game has \"We want money for a shoddy product\" written all over it.So that's my take. Happy gaming!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2007"}

The research staff has been funded by a respected (if slightly unethical) corporation. The weekly laboratory reports have been increasingly vague and now they have stopped completely. Recent gory attacks near the mansion have lead to rumors of unnatural canines on the prowl. Something has gone terribly wrong.Two S.T.A.R.S. teams (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad) are sent to investigate these strange and gruesome developments. Bravo Team mobilizes first and disappears almost immediately. Alpha Team follows, urgently driven towards the mansion. As either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, two valuable parts of the Alpha team, you work your way inside. Everything is quiet... too quiet.","reviewerName":"Kevin Collins \"Kevin\"","summary":"The first of the best.","reviewText":"Welcome to the first adventure of one of Capcoms best series games. You are Jill Valentine, a stars member and you are trying to investigate some strange dissapearances in Raccoon City. You can play as Jill or Chris Redfield. You start in the game by going out to the outskirts of the city and see a house, a mansion. (There is a monster chasing you outside while you investigate, thats why you enter the mansion.) Once you arrive in there you look for things around the house and notice a zombie that ate one of your pals. You kill him and go tell your friend Barry Burton what went wrong. This game is the hardest of the whole series in my opinion because there are more puzzles and more zombies that are so hard to kill with your weapons. You will go through so many rooms and so many doors and find clues and clues and clues of to whats going on. Ill only spoil one part of the game if your new to resident evil. (The mansion has a research lab in the back yard that youll find later in the game. The whole mansion and lab belongs to the bio chemical organization,Umbrella).

Controlling a motley crew of renegade characters, you must hunt down the TimeSplitters across environments such as the gangster-filled 1920s, the lush jungles of Aztec temples, Soviet military installations of the cold war, and futuristic robot factories in space.The game delivers an involved single-player and cooperative story mode, with a complex narrative, multiple objective-based episodes, and animated cutscenes. The game engine has been extensively upgraded to accommodate bigger environments and special graphical effects. The MapMaker has also been enhanced, opening up even more potential to the advanced gamer looking for customizable game scenarios.","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"OK singleplayer, great multiplayer","reviewText":"TimeSplitters was a popular game when it came out. It took the normal shooter game and added in changes in environment - you moved through time to persue your enemies. TimeSplitters 2 expands this with better graphics, sound, and multiplay features.The plot isn't much to get enthusiastic about. An evil enemy race is trying to wipe out humanity, and they have a time portal. They run back through time with crystals and you have to go back into each time period to track down the crystal and do other miscellaneous tasks while you're there.The graphics are indeed nice, from flaming torches to dreary sewers and polished marble floors. But when you compare them to the likes of Halo or Kingdom Hearts, they're a bit old looking. There aren't shadows. The backgrounds aren't very dynamic. You shoot walls and get tiny holes, unlike the deformable terrain of other current games. The textures seem flat and a bit repetitive.They did make an attempt to have the sounds match the eras, with lovely chanting during Notre Dame and twanging during the Western era. Even so, you don't feel 'immersed' in the game. Characters don't make noise when they walk. There isn't really any ambient noise.The weapon choices are fun and time-appropriate. In Chicago of 1932, you've got Tommy Guns. In Notre Dame you're playing with shotguns. So there's always new variety as you go from level to level.The missions aren't very challenging compared to other games that are out. They are extremely linear and there's rarely any brainpower involved. There's side missions like \"blow up file cabinets along the way\" or \"shoot out whiskey barrels\". There's usually a rationale given but it's pretty flimsy.There are other 'mini-games' that you can play. Do things like fight off the living dead, smash the glass and so on. Try to get the best times to get high rankings.Where the game really shines is multiplayer. There are HUNDREDS of characters to choose from in multiplay, and tons of ways to play that you unlock as you go. There are the standards like deathmatch as well as more interesting variations. The game is savvy about game hook-ups and LANs to open the game up to as many players as possible for your system.In addition, TimeSplitters 2 comes with a MAP EDITOR. This is something rarely seen in a console game!! You can choose from a beginner or advanced mode and design your own maps, and then have your friends play through it! Customize the tile set, bot placements, choose weapons, music, you name it. You can create your own full maps and play a new game every day!A great game if you're into multiplayer or map creation, and a fun shooter if you're not too particular about graphics or sounds.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2002"}

When Nintendo announced it was releasing a first party wireless controller I was very excited.  This controller doesn't disappoint, with the same button and stick layouts as the wired first-party controllers.You choose a frequency to use (by rotating a numbered dial on both the controller and the receiver that plugs into the controller port on the Cube), which allows you to use up to 4 Wavebirds at a time (should an aggressive Super Smash Bros Melee match be in your future).The controller also has an on/off switch, which allows you to shut it off and save extra battery life, which is a nice touch. I also appreciate the red light on the receiver, which lights up when it receives the signal from the Wavebird (making it very easy to tell if you are in range).The only complaint that I have is one that Nintendo has addressed, namely the lack of Rumble functionality.  To paraphrase Nintendo, to add the rumble feature would have greatly shortened the battery life of the controller.  For many games, the lack of rumble feature isn't an issue, and the WaveBird works perfectly.  For those games that rumble is a major part of, I just use an extension cable for my wired controller.  ;)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00027CXEM","reviewerName":"Tstops","summary":"Well....it has lightsabers.","reviewText":"Knights of the old republic 1 was one of the greatest games and stories every in videogames.  That's just my opinion but any rpg fan,  Star Wars geek or just any gamer that enjoys a deep story will agree. I think I've beaten the first game six or seven times. I was really excited for knights of the old republic 2 Sith Lords. I remember  the day I got it. I installed that bad boy and with wide eyes and a smile I created my future Jedi guardian. My wide eyes and smile turned into shooting daggers and grinding teeth and me saying \"wait....what\", \"huh, who this guy talking about\", \"wait, why am I here?\", \"what was the point of that\", \"this can't be the only dialog choices they give me\", \"that cut scene makes no sense\", \"what kind of garbage ending was that?\" , I've beaten kotor 2 three times now, and it's obvious this game is completely and painfully unfinished.So lets talk about this poop shoot game first. It's 100% playable and combat is an exact clone of the original. So if your a fan of combat from the first game you'll be happy but like a double edge sword this is a freakin sequel, it should be enhanced but they didn't change anything at all and I mean anything,including skills.The main problem with this game is the most important thing with a game like this, the story.Now first let me explain something. Bioware is the company that made the first knights of the republic. Bioware is also responsible for making other great games like baulders gate 1&2, neverwinter nights 1, jade empire, and most notably the mass effect saga. Now, after bioware made kotor 1 they immediately began work on jade empire for Xbox. Lucustarts wanted them to make the sequel to kotor, unfortunately their developers were tied up with jade empire. So lucustarts turned to obsidian, a well known company that made such hits as icewind dale, neverwinter nights 2 and fallout new Vegas. Sounds confusing doesn't it. Obsidian is well known for picking up sequels that bioware and Bethesda don't have time for. But they're still a great company. Unfortunately when they took on a sequel for knights of the old republic it's obvious that they struggled with it and lucustarts really rushed them on the project. I think....no...I know that obsidian couldn't have done better than bioware. The story was to much for them to take on. Unless they could've gotten into the minds of bioware and gotten more time to work on the project I think fans like me would've been much more satisfied.Just like in kotor 1 you wake up on a a ship with no memory and you have to relearn your powers....gee...off the bat this game sucks. Are you serious ?! The further you get in this game feels like a cheap rip off of the first. Except your an exiled Jedi they call \"the exile\".....wow the cheese is strong in this one. You have to go around the galaxy looking for the rest of the Jedi which are almost driven to extinction by the Sith. Hmmm that's funny,  in the first game I destroyed the Sith armada. It doesn't matter. Kotor 2 didn't follow the plot to first (which it should've) but it does desperately try to name drop from it. Kotor fails to follow its own plot. Each story quest is a struggle to get momentum going and the events that happen within move the arc of the plot further away. The boring characters who join you all have lack luster and generic personas. You won't want to befriend any of them or romance them. Each character in the first game all had a story to tell and a quest to boot. In kotor 2 the characters leave you scratching your head and going \"mmmmkkkk, I guess since I have no more dialog options ill go see what the droids are up too\". It's really frustrating when this happens. Once I noticed I was headed towards the endgame, I knew it was almost over. I had more questions than answers and strange cut scenes started playing. A boss fight later and credits rolled. My jaw dropped and curses flared out. I immediately started another game....same thing....third game...same. This games plot is just a wreck.Some people agree with me and some people say I'm to hard on it.  We should be hard on sequels to great games. It's one thing if the sequel isn't \"as good as the first\" but it's an insult to just give up and send an unfinished product to the consumer. Obsidian pulled a fast one on us. Many well known magazines praised this game as \"good\". How this happens? I don't know but I do know that knights of the old republic 2 Sith Lords is an unfinished game. And unfinished games do not deserve praise no matter what the title of the game is. If you never played knights of the old republic 1, you can get it on steam for cheap and even on iPad. If you want to play the sequel, find a box, write \" this has lightsabers\" on it, dump in used kitty litter with a glow stick and that's about as good as knights of the old republic 2 Sith Lords is.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2013"}

Only physical and mental agility can keep you alive, though they are by no means a guarantor of life.

Martin","summary":"High Quality Story-Focused RPG","reviewText":"The Witcher is a well supported story focused RPG. the original game has been updated and supported in ways that far exceed expectations for game companies these days. Even years after the games release, people who are just now buying can be secure in the knowledge that this product is still supported by the company that produced it. Even now, years after the games release, the company is still releasing new content, patches, director's cut content, and general product updates. Most gaming companies will not do this for you. They'll make a product, then toss it by the wayside after they have your money.I recently bought it even though it's somewhat old now when I heard about all the new content that the company is still releasing for this game. There really aren't that many high quality RPG's being produced anymore, and this is certainly one of those few. The game's mature themes add a level of character and depth to the story and world that many other games won't even approach. This world is a world that is driven more by story and role-playing then by endless \"grinding\" and leveling like many other RPGs out there. Put more simply, this means that there is a lot more dialogue, and the game is less action oriented, at least during the early stages of the game.The combat animations in this game are nothing short of fantastic. The longer you play the game, and the more feats and skills your character obtains, it appears that the combat animations get that much more impressive looking, as you might expect them to. Say goodbye to the boring, bland, and lifeless combat animations of older RPGs like Neverwinter nights, and say hello to what this game has to offer.While it is single player only, The Witcher brings a lot to the table in terms of play time. Even though I was rushing through the game, I still managed to get between 90 and 100 hours of playtime out of this game. For a single player game, that is quite impressive. There is no shortage of game content in this game. if that isn't enough for you, it is worth noting that different ethical decisions you make as you play the game produce different outcomes later in the game. This helps lend greater replayability to the game.On the whole, while this game is not my favorite RPG that I have ever played, it's easy to see that it is a high quality game, that it is well supported, and that it has more game content than most people could ever want. For people who prefer games would emphasize the story and role-playing aspects of RPG's with less emphasis on pixel bashing, this is the game for you. For those who prefer a greater emphasis on pixel bashing, you would probably be better off playing something like Dark Messiah of Might and Magic instead. How much you like this game will depend largely on which of these two different types of RPG you prefer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2009"}

Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"A perfect ressurection for the devout!","reviewText":"Let me get a load off my chest at the confession booth. I suck at Mortal Kombat. Even in the arcades I was always better at Street Fighter 2.  Some people may tell you MK is an \"easier\" and more `mainstream\" fighter. However, make no mistakes about it there is \"skill\" needed in order to prevail at this game. If you are a split second off chaining together a combo the victory train completely derails off the track. Frankly to me it seems easier to build up multiple hits and pull off counters in SSF4 but apparently I'm some sort of weirdo in that regard.Anyway, if you were good at MK back in the arcades you'll be even better at it now! What you \"loved\" about the klassic first 3 games returns in 2.5D splendor and everything flows much smoother.  If you were the type of guy or gal who delighted in upper cutting hapless saps into the air right before \"ninja-porting\" mid jump with another volley of punches and kicks to pound on your opponents further before they even touched the ground you'll be able to re-live your glory days here. MK 2011 \"rewards\" MK fans in every regard! Sadly, for those of us that got beaten to bloody pulps back then we'll complete that same pathetic cycle in the presentSo you`re probably thinking because I get my butt kicked all over the place when playing this game I'm going to give it a bad review, right? Wrong! Despite my ineptitude MK 2011 is a great fighter. So great in fact it makes other fighting games seem as if they're slacking off in comparison! Don't know what I mean yet? Well, read on....\"Story Mode\"Call me \"insane\" but I always believed fighting games benefited from having a good story line.  Mortal Kombat makes you play through the perspectives of its most memorable characters. Want to see Cyrax and Sector in their human forms? Ever wondered who Noob Saibot really was? Was Liu Kang truly the \"perfect hero\" everyone made him out to be? How exactly is Mileena Kitana's sister? Can Jax refrain from punching Johnny Cage in his big mouth? What's Scorpion's beef with Sub Zero? Will Raiden's vision of \"Armageddon\" come to pass?  These questions and more get answered along the way.Luckily, there are no painfully tedious pauses of scrolling text. Every event plays out with in game cut scenes and spoken dialogue.  MK 2011 unfolds like a great movie and \"most\" of the minor plot tweaks are for the best. Stating that for the record, a few of my favorite protagonists are killed off needlessly. It makes me wonder if the next MK game will include them or if they'll be brought back as cheesy kung fu zombies.\"Modes Mucho Grande!\"When you're done in the story mode there's 300 objectives in the challenge tower, tag team co-op & versus match ups, the regular arcade ladder, and a plethora of mini games testing your concentration and button tapping vigor.In many aspects MK 2011 is like getting multiple fighters in one package. Whether you want to go at it alone or with a friend either option is open to you.\"Online shine\"MK 2011 adds a spectator mode in which little gamer avatars watch fights and rank kombatants. It's a much nicer alternative than id cards humping each other. In \"King of the hill\" matches I experienced lag but when 8 people are in one room from all over the world that tends to happen. Fortunately nothing was any worse than what I`ve experienced when playing other fighting games over Xbox live .From what my friends say most of the other online modes run at a much more fluid rate. If NetherRealm studios can fix what little is wrong the online play will be unsurpassed!\"Krypt kickin\"The krypt is back! All the koins you get playing the other modes are  spent here to unlock content in \"The Necronopolis\".My biggest problem with the Krypt is much of the \"Kontent\" is useless. Certainly I like the wonderful art, alternate costumes, and new tunes but \"stick figure depictions\" of fatalities aren't really a worthwhile reward. In addition the \"extra fatalities\" are in the game even before you uncover their commands. Assuming you can get on google you can execute the \"secret finishers\" without ever having to spend koins on them directly.\"Gore galore\"Call it a \"sign of the times\" or call it \"harmless dumb fun\" but MK 2011 has blood, bruises, exposed bones, and wretch inducing  fatalities in abundance. If for whatever reason you weaned on the \"living dead gurl\" supple breast milk of Saw, Faces of death, Hell Raiser, Blood sport, and other extra violent 80's and 90's action movies there's a lot to love here.The best new feature of MK 2011 are the X-ray moves. After tapping the top trigger buttons when you've saved all 3 stocks of your power bar you can break skulls, snap spines, and shatter limbs as the game slows time down and let's you see the gruesome work you're inflicting upon someone's skeleton! These techniques dish out a lot of damage so be sure to save them for when you're in a pinch and need to turn a match around.Even in the Krypt you rip people apart on stretching racks, behead prisoners by dropping guillotines, make the bellies of unfortunate souls pop as you feed them molten lead through funnel devices, and  call upon ravens to pick at the innards of bloated water logged corpses. \"Killing victims\" frees green energy that is transferred into unlocked treasures.This all goes a bit over board for me but MK has always pushed the envelop. I cannot dock points for features that have always been at the core of a popular franchise no matter how shocking and revolting its' blackened heart actually is.\"The fighting\"I made the mistake of trying to perfect my game with a kombatant  I'm not good with. At first this tainted my impression of  the game. Later as I played with more characters I discovered a fighting engine that is not only deep but very slick once you get the hang of it!If you've never been good at MK chaining hits may seem to come off as disjointed and a little wooden at first. However, once you play for a couple of weeks to a few months everything \"flows\" more naturally. While I cannot say this from personal experience the gamers I interacted with truly moved their favorite fighters with poise and grace.If someone tells you MK 2011 is an \"amateur fighter\" for scrubs they're talking out their rear end! MK requires a lot of patience and commitment to master it fully thus I have admiration for anyone who has done so.True enough, certain characters such as Kung Lao and Smoke are a little imbalanced. Like it or not every fighting game has it's upper tier, middle tier, and lower tier warriors. MK 2011 is no exception. However, NetherRealm and Ed Boon have been quoted saying patches are coming as is dlc for more characters. Another words it can only get better from here on out right?\"Organic world\"Not only has exquisite detail been put into the characters but many of your favorite set pieces have been redone in HD glory! Remember the creepy trees in the living forest, were you frightened by \"The Katherdral's\" scary unholy hymn music and stain glass decadence? Did you enjoy knocking defeated adversaries into an acid pool or a pit of spikes below?  If so, you are in good hands. Perhaps more impressive is the Out World's invasion upon Earth Realm. Giant demons rampage upon asphalt high ways, crushing cars beneath their hardened feet as dragons take to the sky and breath fiery death upon huddled survivors. It's quite the spectacle and occasionally you'll lose a fight as you gawk at the macabre theatre unfolding throughout the various backgrounds!\"Bottom line\"If you have been patiently waiting for a MK game that captures the magic of the original games before it all went to crap \"this\" is your game. As a fan I would rate this one up there with MK 2, Ultimate MK , and MK Deception. It's really that good.\"But\" if you've never understood the hype around MK or if you detest excessive pointless gore and violence I warn you that this entry will not sway your stance. Aka if you're outside this niche there's nothing which will draw you in. Mortal Kombat is still Mortal Kombat. It's unapologetic in all its' kinky blood splattered gratuity and is still happy mud wrestling in the flesh pits whilst wearing nothing but a string bikini! (Oh Mileena, you so crazy!)By the way, if you're a mother or father do not buy this for your underage kids. Prove to the world adults at least have some common sense! Mortal Kombat is a bad influence on young impressionable minds \"15 & up\" is acceptable so long as said teenagers are mature enough to handle it.\"Pros\"1. Good story line (albeit campy in a Big Trouble In Little China meets Hell Raiser kind of way)2. Tag team co-op and versus3. A plethora of extra modes and challenges4. Every character has at least one other alternate costume which isn't merely a color palette swap . (Thanks guys! I hate having to get all this stuff as dlc in other fighters.)5. Improved fighting engine6. Nice online features that make for a friendly socializing experience.7. The MK Kommunity is surprisingly laid back and accepting of newcomers!8. Kenshin and Skarlet are on their way as dlc as well as patches to make your MK experience more balanced.9. Helpful in depth tutorial which covers many in game nuances.10. Most of the absolute favorite Kombatants are accounted for. There's roughly 27 or 28 in all even without additional dlc!\"Cons\"1. If you rent or buy MK used you must pay a $10.00 toll to play online (Kooperate jerk baggery!)2. Even if bought brand new MK doesn't come with a fully fleshed out instruction manual. The decent tutorial softens the blow somewhat though.3. Believe me, I realize MK is fantasy fulfillment so I have no problems with the ladies dressing up in stripper lingerie BUT why do they all have to have the same cup sizes and same basic physique? More anatomical variety would have been nice. Not every female in Edenia has to be a plastic surgery modified porn star. Just saying!4. Some of the violence, torture, and gore is too excessive even for me. Feel free to disagree!5. Shao Kahn is still the same cheap trash talking skull mask wearing frat boy with a chip on his shoulder. Expect to die when facing him A LOT.6.During story battles fights versus multiple characters can grow cumbersome.7. Some lag during king of the hill matches.8. Much of the Krypt treasures are pretty useless.9. \"Vomit inducing visual wounds\" cannot be turned off.10. Certain pivotal protagonists die off early.End VerdictThough MK 2011 has frustrated me in places and almost made me lose my lunch a few times it is by far the best fighter in terms of extras, depth, and craftsmanship. NetherRealm and Ed Boon really cared about their fan base and set out to make the best iteration of Mortal Kombat they possibly could. Assuming you're an MK supporter from the \"old days\" my highest score recommendation is meant for you.If you're not into MK I'd suggest knocking off 1 or 2 points just to play it safe. Though MK 2011 is awesome overall it has its' fair share of faults and they will be more jarring for those not intoxicated by the nostalgic ambrosia of the elder gods!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00008QOL6","description":"When it comes to first-person shooters, there are two schools of thought. One harkens back to the originalDoom--frantic action, scary monsters, big weapons, and story is given short shrift. The second school is best exemplified byHalf-Life: strong narrative, consistent real-world weapons, consistent monsters, and settings.Doom'sheirs up until now have beenQuakeandSerious Sam, but nowPainkillercomes onto the scene leaving bloody footprints, and &#x85; let the carnage begin!You play a man who dies in a pathetic car crash (he's distracted because he's holding his girl's hand) and has spent a long time in purgatory. He thinks this is unfair because, despite being well-schooled in the art of killing, he maintains that he's done nothing wrong. Heaven makes a deal with him. Take care of a little invasion problem concerning Hell, and our hero can enter those pearly gates.Weak storyline aside,Painkillerbasically amounts to a brilliant series of arcade-style levels and challenges. The settings include darkened monasteries, graveyards, a horrifying asylum, a medieval town under siege, and even H-E-Double Hockey Sticks itself. The level design is brilliant, varied, and jam-packed with enemies. There seems to be no end to the amount and variety of cool monsters to fight, and they each explode into chunks of blood and gore in a most disturbingly satisfying manner. At the end of each level is a challenge, such as collecting a certain amount of gold or killing a Boss within a time limit. Winning the challenge gives you tarot cards you can use to make the game easier. The different cards bring haste, double-damage, invulnerability, and so on. This simple mechanic makes the game far more replayable than your average shooter.The graphics are first rate, which means you need a powerful PC to run the game with all the detail settings maxed out. The only other problem is a CD-copy protection bug that makes the game unplayable for some (a patch is available).Painkillermay seem a bit silly at first glance. But the gameplay mechanics, replayability (full multiplayer is also available), variety, and brilliant level design make it one of the finest and most satisfying shooters ever made. -Andrew S. BubPros:Superb gameplay and game balanceExcellent level designStrong replayabilityCons:Poor, unnecessary storylineHigh system requirementsProblematic copy protection","reviewerName":"J. JAGELLA","summary":"What a pain!","reviewText":"I believe that playing Painkiller might be likened to eating an anchovy pizza--for a person who loves pizza but hates anchovies. The bulk of the game is very good and fun to play, but the parts that aren't fun are just plain annoying.Painkiller has great graphics and very good level design. If you lob a grenade at a wagon, for instance, that wagon will fly apart in a very realistic fashion. The game's engine renders smoke very well too. Many of the levels are superbly designed and include a medieval town, a castle, a cathedral, an opera house, and my favorite, a haunted lunatic asylum. This game's levels are works of art in their own right.The weapons also are good. Your basic weapon is the \"painkiller\" which I assume the game is named after. Its primary fire is a spinning wheel of daggers, and its alt fire sends out a sharp piece of metal that you retrieve boomerang fashion. You also get a rocket launcher that can literally send your attackers flying off in several directions. The shotgun's primary fire  is rather boring and just involves shooting shot at your enemies, but its alt fire turns attackers into brittle ice which you can shatter with a primary blast. I also like the weapon that uses lightning to fry attackers. My favorite weapon is the stake gun which in primary fire shoots stakes of wood impaling enemies to walls, floors, or just runs them through! In alternate fire it lobs a powerful grenade that can blast an entire mob of baddies. Oddly, the game doesn't allow you to use these weapon's full potentials in boss battles. In many cases the bosses are immune to your weapons.Speaking of bosses, if you think you hate boss battles, then this game will really make you loathe them. They are the \"anchovies\" you might hate on an otherwise luscious pizza. The bosses and the battles look simply spectacular, but the gameplay reaches a low point in these battles. In almost every boss battle, you need to know tricks to defeat each boss. For example, you need to make a boss killable by shooting his hammer. Now, do you think I spent a lot of time shooting that boss's hammer? Of course not! I sat there shooting that boss which is the logical thing to do. I shot, and I shot, and I shot...All to no avail. Almost all of the boss battles follow this same idiotic style of gameplay. You cannot logically discover how to defeat the boss, and the only way I got past most of the bosses is by looking up how to kill them on the internet.I didn't even bother killing the last boss or finishing this game. I just got fed up with the often wretched gameplay. I'll go back and enjoy the parts I like, and there are many such parts. However, those \"anchovies\" have left a bad taste in my mouth that I cannot ignore. If you love shooters with great graphics and level design and can overlook wooden-headed gameplay design, then Painkiller may be the game for you. Otherwise, give it a try, but make sure you know the seller's return policy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2007"}

I want to be able to control every action; that's how I prefer to play RPG's.  Therefore, I did not like this game, despite the good setting (though the story was generic, the ~10 hours I played through).  I'm sure other reviews cover the positives, but this negative was enough that I stopped after [constantly] replaying content because the AI was another hostile enemy.  This may give the impression the game is hard, but it isn't.  I could see how to beat every battle, if only the AI would cooperate.  It would not combo with me, and it would not heal me.

I don't think it's fair to be called a complete disapointment though. As a 24 fan I must say that some things are pretty cool. I like how the villian is voiced by Christian Kane (Lindsey in Angel) and looks exactly like him too. Since the show itself usually always has recognizeable main villians. I think the interigation mode is challenging and well done as well. Plus if you miss characters like Tony and Chase, it's cool that you can play as them too on certain points.The first shooter mode is a little primative and not as good, as lets say a Rainbow Six game. Plus there's too many car chase parts when they aren't really that good to begin with. But even if some things are lame I must say that I still have a ball playing this as a 24 fan. Just to rescue CTU from terrorists, rescue Kim and facing a lot of the other dangers that Jack does on 24. I do think that a second one could be more promising though. Especially if it was released for X-Box 360 with more effort put into the shooting mode and a little more put into the gameplay as well.

The Pokemon are cute and it can be a fun challenge to get them to do something entertaining... but after a while the game gets kind of boring. I went through the river course 5 times and still have not unlocked anything. The game is set up like one of those arcade rides. You ride in a car on a preset path through the Pokemon's world. I was a little upset that the ride went so slow, but I guess it was like that so that it would be easier to take photos. The Pokemon did interesting things. I fed one too many apples and it exploded (it was an electric pokemon). I shot an apple that hit a lizard Pokemon on the head and caused him to fall in the lava. After the ride Professor Oak judges the photos. He is kind of annoying and has an awful voice. Almost every one of my Pokemon photos were rejected by him because they were not big enough and in the middle of the frame. After half an hour I wanted to throw my controller at him and tell him to shut up. Overall, this is game is not half bad. Taking and saving photos of cute Pokemon is somewhat addicting, even with some minor flaws.Graphics- C+: This is the Nintendo 64. The pokemon are accurate enough, but a game over a decade old is not going to look very good.Sound- D: The sound is rather dorky, but again, this is the Nintendo 64.Replay Value- B: I come back to courses to get a good photo.

With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story.

Sparks fly, chunks of metal go hurling past you, huge explosions, overall a great job on the action aspects of the game. RPG fans will be a little let down as most of those elements have been toned down or removed all together. Also you never really bump into side missions anymore (at least not yet, I'm about 5 hours in), they're all presented to you so the need to thoroughly explore places like the citadel is gone sadly. While I do miss the customization that your usual RPG delivers, Bioware didn't skimp on the action so I can't dock too many stars for that. I almost always skip the companion missions in Bioware's games but this time around I'm doing them all because completing them not only adds story but gives your companions bonuses as well, well worth it. Scanning planets for resources is pretty dull and feels like the brakes get stomped on on what is otherwise a fast paced, action packed adventure.

The buttons are a little small and close for big hands with a surface that can be hard to lock onto with a fingertip in the heat of play.  Working the crossfader can be frustrating as the only click point is the center channel, but after a few days of practice I find it much easier to grasp the crossfading gameplay element which is really the hardest part of the gameplay to master.  The hidden control pad has a touchy dpad but is otherwise functional and smoothly implemented.  Gamewise the graphics look like Jet Set Radio ran into a truck carrying some rejected anime characters (think SSX phunky). Ignoring the graphics and focusing on the music that the few mashups included hint at the possibility of greatness and annoyingness(VINE VINE VINE), possibly without the replayability of other music games due to lack of true user input.Nitpicking aside the game feels fun on all skill levels, there is a flow to the music and gameplay on EASY mode  that the added crossfading of MED and Hard take away.  The guitar turntable co-op is fun for two people but it doesn't exactly feel like anything too groundbreaking, just the new game with someone playing GH next to you.  The music is going to sell the set as fans of herky jerky, mashup style genre defying DJ music will feel right at home and want to hear more, in other words I would be more likely to play this game for the music than the overall addictiveness of the gameplay which isn't insignificant.

Make no mistake, though:Final Fantasy Chroniclesmarks the first time this pivotal installment of the cherished game series has ever been available on the PlayStation. InFinal Fantasy IV, players take on the role of Cecil, a loyal captain who questions the orders of his king, and for it is sent to slay a mysterious beast in a nearby valley.InChrono Trigger, Chrono must follow princess Marle's teleportation through time and locate her before an intergalactic parasite arrives to destroy the world. The original game, also on the PlayStation for the first time, was one of the first nonlinear role-playing games. The decisions that players make during the game will point them toward one of more than a dozen possible endings.These new versions retain the authentic Japanese SNES stories and characters while updating their graphics and adding new full-motion video sequences and other features.","reviewerName":"From Detroit","summary":"One of my all time favorite games!","reviewText":"This is a really nice remake of a great classic (FFIV).

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Mark E. Valenti \"FireMarioGalaxy64\"","summary":"One of Mario's greatest games","reviewText":"Super Mario Sunshine is one of Gamecube's top 3 games. The graphics are very good quality for Gamecube, since Mario is on a tropical island, you can see heat waves. There are 6 courses in the game, they have good variety. Each course contains 11 Shine Sprites for Mario to collect, plus there are a lot of secrets. This game will definitely be worth replaying. The best part though, is the controls. I have never played a game with better controls than Super Mario Sunshine. There are a ton of moves for Mario to do, and he responds to the controls perfectly. This game takes Super Mario 64 and evolves and adds to it. Sunshine sets a new standard for 3D Mario games. It has a balance of Classic Mario and new innovations. I rate this game a score of 98.5/100. A near perfect game, although not quite up to Super Mario 64 and Galaxy, which were absolutely perfect.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2009"}

Unlike  games where you must choose a class (e.g. warrior, rogue, wizard) at the beginning, in Fable your \"class\" is defined by which attributes you use.  Not only that, but your physical appearance changes based on: which class you choose, and if you are \"good\" or \"evil\".The fighting is more like Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time than Diablo, and it the intricacies of the enemies and the stories are amazing.  I have already started playing through a second time, as a \"bad\" mage.The graphics and sound are outstanding, as is the storyline.  The only warning I have is that the main storyline is quite short.  If you ignore the side quests and don't spend extra time roaming through the countryside (which is gorgeous), then this may only be worth a rental for you.I like that even once you finish the game, you can return to Albion as your character and just wander around, visiting places and finding treasures you hadn't seen before.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2004"}

As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction.

The story is good at times and slow at others and at times feels slow when your playing it but that happens with all games. It still was good enough to keep me intrested. The junctioning system was different and I didn't mind it but it had problems. It was easy to figure out what magic to junction to make my health maxed out and when I got it maxed out I found myself not useing magic through the entire game so it wouldn't bring down my stats. So if always felt like it was missing something since I never used magic through the entire game so this bothered me but not too much. The other thing I had a problem with was the world in wich the game takes place felt empty. Most final fantasy games have a lot of areas to explore and visit and this one had a lot of empty space.

I wish I could go on about how cool the \"Heat\" concept was, or how making drug deals and supply runs was innovative but the reality is, this is GTA with a fairly good voice over/impression of Pacino's Tony Montana.Pros:-Fun to \"be\" Tony Montana-Interesting \"Exotics\" that can be used to \"pimp\" your mansion.-Minor innovations like \"Blind Rage\" and \"Driver\" that improved upon the GTA conceptCons:-Mission difficulty jumps wildly from mind-bogglingly easy to tear-your-hair-out frustratingly hard.-Fairly repetitive-A fair amount of glitches (not riddled with them, but enough to warrant mention here)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2007"}

I didn't think think the game was going to be that good but it is. The story mode is like \"No Mercy\", it is the best! The match types are great like the \"Hell in the Cell\", \"TLC\", and \"Braw and Panies\". The thing that is new that I love is that when you put your opponet in a submission there is a meter for if your gonna tap out or not(same with braw and panies). Also is the new create a wrestler mode. There are new features to put in to your wrestler. New moves and everything!The story mode is the usual wrestler looking for a dream to win the world wrestling champion belt. In this game the story mode has a little more debt from being a underdog to the biggest name in the WWE. It gives you an option to join Smackdown or Raw. If you join Raw you join \"Evolution\" and Smackdown is \"The Ministry of Darkness\". I love that there are new secret characters from the good ol' days of wrestling like Bret Heart, Beefcake, Andre, ect. I was a big Bret Heart fan when I was little and when I heard he was in this game I knew I had to get it. The thing I didn't like though was the fact that Bret didn't have his old song.Overall you have got to buy this game, you won't regret it. Buying moves, weapons, appearance products, and arenas all the stuff you want is in this game. You wont disappointed buying this game. Pick this game over the \"Smackdown\" series and definitely way over the \"Raw\" series. You need to get this game. It's worth every-single penny. Only one or two draw backs. Buy this game!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00005ME8S","description":"Originally released in 1998, the PC version ofHalf-Lifechanged  first-person shooters forever by proving that a compelling story can be told within  the genre. Prior to the game's release, first-person shooters were mindless  action games.Half-Life, while containing its fair share of action, also  contained plenty of exploration, puzzle, and story elements. Now released as a  PlayStation2 game,Half-Lifehas never looked or played better. This  version contains the outstanding single-player story mode, as well as a few new  ones. While the new additions aren't so great, the story mode is one of the best  escapades available on the PS2.The game follows the adventures of Gordon Freeman, a young research associate at  the Black Mesa Federal Research Facility. A typical day at the office goes  completely awry as numerous alien life forms invade the facility. The fate of  the facility, and quite possibly the world, is in the hands of an unlikely hero.The graphics here trump the original's (understandable, as more than three years  have passed). The character models have four times as many polygons, as well as  smoother textures and animations. The sound is also very good, with some of the  funniest voice acting yet heard in a game. Of course, the single-player gameplay  is excellent, thanks to some very well-developed enemy artificial intelligence.Unfortunately, the new modes aren't nearly as brilliant. Decay, the new  cooperative mode, seems like an afterthought and pales in comparison to the  cooperative modes inPerfect DarkandHalo. Deathmatches only  support two players, which is incredibly lame considering many PS2 first-person  shooters support four. Despite these flawed modes, the single-player story is so  superb that it totally warrants a purchase.--Raymond M. PadillaPros:Greatly improved graphics from the originalExcellent storytelling, especially for the genreStrong enemy artificial intelligenceCons:Cooperative mode is dullDeathmatch only supports 2 players","reviewerName":"G. Lindquist","summary":"Raising the CrowBar","reviewText":"As most people have heard by now, Half-Life is one of those \"God Like\" games. I like to argue with a lot of claims like that because most are so far fetched and so far off base that it actually makes me crindge a little (*cough* Killzone being a \"Halo Killer *cough*). That and all the flames that will come from it aside, lets get to the point. Half-Life not only lives up to it's hype, but it surpasses it. Especially since back in the day when the PC version first came out, there wasnt any hype for it! This game though is amazing, it's extremely entertaining and easily soaked up more of my childhood then sleeping did. This game actually fueled my love for the gaming industry and is what has me making videogames today.This game has a great story. The only reason anyone would claim it's story is medicore is because they leave you hanging and refuse to easily explain the exsistance of Gman who is a mysterous character that shows up periodically throughout the game.The graphics by today's standards are obviously poor. By the standards of 1998 they are fantastic. If you can sit down and play Final Fantasy on your DS, or on your GBA, or even on your playstation and tolerate it then you should be able to tolerate the graphics on this. I realize thats an odd comparison. One would ask \"Why compare oldschool 2D sprites to oldschool 3D?\" Well that's actually kind of simple. Each game represents the best they could possibly do with the technology given at the time. If you can sit down and play new releases of an old game or call yourself a fan of oldschool games then to you these graphics should be awesome. I appreciate older games, they remind me of how far we have come and a better time when games required more imagination then processor power.This game is the package, the entire package. To pass up this game is to deny a turning point in gaming. If you already own this game, then purchase the second one. If you own that then you should be playing it instead of reading this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2007"}

The action seems to be more fast-paced and the graphics are very impressive.  I was hesitant reading some of the bad reviews, but if you liked the original, I don't see how you can hate the sequal.  Maybe it gets worse as I go, but I don't see how.Yes the camera is quarky, but it was like that in the original as well.  With the replenishing lifeline and replenishing save points, the game is a little easier (at least on easy mode)--I didn't die until fighting the boss in Hayabusa Village.I'm tired of programmers dumbing down games.  Although I'm a casual gamer nowadays, I hate games like Bioshock and Bad Company that give you no reason to get skillful because enemies don't respawn with each continuation.Bottom line is if you played the first and enjoyed it, you should definitely enjoy this one.  If you like hack and slash games, you should enjoy it.  If you're looking for a challenge you should enjoy it.  If you like blood and decapitation and mutilation (in video games), you should enjoy it.  If you have A.D.D., you should enjoy it.

Does it leave a bit to be desired, well yes. They are missing a series of cars that should have been in since day one. Well one was in the first Forza. But if you love cars or want to learn how to start to tune your car, well you're luck. This is a good outlet.Unlike many of the other critic here, I accually have custom cars. Three of them and a newer V6 Camry. A Vette, mustang conv, and Camaro. So I have dibbled into alomst everything you can do in a car. So this game makes me realise how fast my cars are.  But I also have expeirence in tuning, so this gives me an edge on the game. But it asks you in the begining how you treat the racing game. So even if you know nothing you can learn.Not the graphics are amazing and the sound is awsome, but as impressive as the beging sequence of a race is, it gets old quick. Also, it keeps you from really getting you RPM in the spot for launch. This really kills the drag racing. But there are a ton of tracks, and cars. Also unlike the Turismo series the cars are cool, and usefull. Most of the GT cars are just different models of the same year. Forza keeps you with the choice stuff. The Hondas are even decent; well as they can get. The physics are spot on, and really nothing can touch it.Now my beefs. No rallys, real stock cars, F1 cars, and sports/muscle/classic cars. Where is the 97 Camaro Z28(feature in every GT), 89-95 ZR1, GTR, 77 Trans Am, 62 Vette fuelie, Porsche 550 spyder(which was in the original), 69 Camaro SS(has gone missing), Ferrari GTB, and 442. But as a odd twist the fox body mustang has made a debut here. It took this many years, but the most popular car for racing in amaerica is finally in a game. Still I want 20s-30s-40s-50s sports cars/race cars/ and luxery cars. But still a good turn out of cars.All in all this game is as good as we can get right now. Lets hope they improve on in these ways,or GT5 will be the best of the bunch period.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2009"}

Jefferson","summary":"A delightful, gem of a game.  Don't miss out.","reviewText":"Short and sweet:  This game is a real gem.  A great puzzler/platformer for anyone.  The game's pace isn't fast...there are no explosions or guns.  There really isnt even any dialog.  What you have is a game that requires complete reliance on your blob companion, as well as some quick and creative thinking to determine how best to get around an obstacle or past an enemy using the Blob's various transformations.  This is a game that I can see myself easily sinking 10-20 hrs into to complete (there are hidden treasures in each level, which ups the replay value).The environments are gorgeous, as is the soundtrack and sound effects.  Also, the game has a certain \"warm and fuzzy\" quality to it.  When you click up on the D-pad, you give the blob a big squeeze... and when you click down on the D-pad, you scold him.  If you walk away from him after scolding him, he turns red.... and then when you return to him (and invariably give him a hug because it is so darn cute and rewarding to do!), he returns to his standard white color.  Little touches like that, and sticking the blob in your backpack to use as a parachute, and sticking him under your head to use as a pillow make this game really interesting and appealing.Even though the art style of the game may seem to be more focused on younger players, the truth is that this game can get really challenging (and kids these days arent really into being challenged in my personal experience... but I digress).  This game is really reminiscent of World Of Goo (on WiiWare).... it has loads of personality and heart... beautifully drawn 2-d graphics, and an amazing soundtrack.  Much like World of Goo, I see myself slowly progressing through this game bit by bit over a long period of time rather than hammering away at the game over the next week just to complete it.  This is one of those games that I like to savor, rather than defeating and trading in @ gamestop for the newest iteration of Guitar Hero.In closing, all I can say is that this game is a real gem on the Wii, and it would be a shame for you and your family to miss out on its charming presentation and challenging gameplay.Here is my overall rating:Presentation: 9/10Multiplayer: 0 (N/A)Sound: 8/10Graphics: 8/10Replay Value: 7/10 (lots of secrets to unlock, but once they're found, they're found)Overall: 8/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2009"}

Certainly Not He-Man.","reviewText":"Since I first heard news of a Ghostbusters game back in 2007 I was overjoyed as the lack of a third film left me sorely disappointed.  Whether you're a child of the 1980s or a sci-fi comedy fan, the Ghostbusters franchise probably gave warm and fuzzy feelings inside you and a hole that needed to be filled.  Problem was Ghostbuster co-writer Harald Ramis (played Egon and also co-wrote Animal House and Stripes) did not want to make a third film since almost 20 years had passed and he knew how badly such a time elapse faired for the fourth Indiana Jones film.Enter Ghostbusters, the video game.With CG graphics and voice acting, Ramis and Aykroyd were able to successfully create the third film albeit for the gaming console.  Ghostbusters the Video Game (\"GVG\") is a virtual tribute to Ghostbusters fans as you feel as though you are in the film with all the themes that made the franchise as popular as it is.StoryIn GVG you are \"Rookie,\" the new \"experimental equipment technician\" that gets to test out all the new tools and weapons just incase they malfunction (which, they don't) and the guy they send in to any situation if it is too serious for them to handle.  In short, you're a red shirt.  On your first day on the job you get a virtual baptism of fire with Slimer, Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, and many other familiar and new ghosts along the way as you try to figure out why the recent outbreak of ghost activity is happening.The story is intriguing as you actually investigate the paranormal events with your PKE meter (some sort of paranormal tricorder) all the while listening in to the guys coming up with hypothesis leading right up to the end twist, which actually surprised me.  This kind of comedic sci-fi mystery is exactly what put Ghostbusters on the map and the tradition continues with GVG.  While your character does not speak (nor is his real name specified beyond \"Rookie\"), this actually adds to the experience as you feel like you're part of the movie and you're just letting the main actors play their part with little to no interference from you.The dialog is just plain hilarious.  Aside from Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis, all original actors returned to reprise their roles including Annie Potts as Jeanine and even William Atherton as Walter Pecker.  Between the bantering from the actual characters (\"We eat gods for breakfast!!\"), the ridiculous phone messages (\"That Viggo painting is a priceless artifact - it belongs in a museum!!\"), and the abstract sayings of the Viggo painting (\"I sense a dark future, where music is free and available for download.\"), I had almost non-stop chuckling and some heavy laughter throughout.  The moments of boring dialog were VERY few and far in between.Game playThe game play uses a mixture of styles from mostly Dead Space and the last two Resident Evil games.  Like Dead Space, you see your character in third person over their right shoulder with the health and weapon gauges on the proton pack as opposed to a standard heads-up display or basic overlay.  This means the screen has more screen space for actual gaming rather than obtrusive numbers from a display or overlay.  It also gives the player a more realistic experience.  The game play takes some ideas from Resident Evil 5 with the inventory selection from the D-Pad as the proton pack has four weapon modes (standard photon blast, slime gun, etc.) although it is more similar to Republic Commando than RE5.The controls are very basic and require little time to master from basic movement, dodging, and selecting between primary and secondary fire.  The games movement is actually very well calibrated as I required no tweaking to the sensitivity, I just picked up the controller and went with it despite how much movement is required (which is a LOT).GVG's game play is also surprisingly simplistic but without the boring repetition.  You spend much of your time \"zapping\" a ghost with your weapons weakening them, and then you snare them into the \"trap\" and retrieve the trap.  There are some monsters that can be destroyed but you'll find yourself snaring a LOT of traps.  This requires you to master wrangling ghosts with the snare secondary fire of the photon beam (which activates automatically thank God) as your controller will be moving back and forth trying to reel the ghoul in, like fishing.When you're not zapping ghosts, you're following their trails with your PKE meter, scanning everything as you go.  This means you focus in night-vision first person, which can mean that things will pop out at you and potentially startle whoever is playing.One of the greatest things about the game play in GVG is the ally AI.  For once, they are actually capable and helpful.  Last night, on my second play through, I was at the Sedgwick Hotel and the guys actually reeled in two ghosts by themselves as I only provided cover.  Not to mention the best part is that not only can you revive your team mates but they can revive YOU and do so in a timely fashion.  This is unbelievable as your allies in GVG are more reliable than Delta Squad in Gears of War 2.  Who woulda thunk it?The only downside to game play, and it's a big one, is that you cannot drive Ecto-1.  You get to cause serious property damage, shoot people with your proton beam and not get into trouble, and even ride down the fire station pole, but when it comes to driving the only ambulance every child has wanted to take out for a spin, it's a strict no-no.  The main characters even taunt the player for not being able to drive in the last mission.  Jerks.The only other downside is that there is no new game plus.  Once you beat the game, you're done.  Like Fallout 3, this is just unacceptable as it diminishes replay value.  I sincerely hope they will include downloadable missions and add-ons later on.  You just can't leave the game like this!Graphics and MusicThe graphics are pretty well done.  The facial expressions and movement is akin to Gears of War 2 as the textures are well done (but we'll be frowning upon them in six months when Assassins Creed 2 comes out).  The lip-syncing is out of whack but it happens.The environments are simply stunning... and fully destructible.  You can blow up virtually everything.  I had a blast (no pun intended) turning the Martinez's Bar Mitzvah buffet from a kosher delight to one charbroiled casserole with my proton pack (and subsequently got a gamer score for it).  From the stores, the damage, the cemetery, it's all done exceptionally well.As for the music, it's almost all from the original movies from the piano riffs to Ray Parker Jr's Ghostbusters.  This gives the game a much more realistic feel to it, not to mention makes you feel like you're part of the film.All in all, Ghostbusters gets a solid 90%.  The controls were near flawless, the dialog was excellent, but the game could've been longer (took me eight hours to beat on casual), lacks side quests and a new game plus option, and you cannot drive Ecto-1.A worthy rental and purchase!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2009"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner.

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner.

Denick","summary":"Not quite as good as #1, but still enjoyable for FPS and Sci-Fi fans (campaign review)","reviewText":"Although Resistance 2 still has plenty of \"Wow!\" moments, it can't quite recapture the excitement of the original.The biggest and most disappointing change to the series is the loss of the \"weapon wheel\"- the feature that would allow you to carry as many weapons as you can find in your journeys, a la old school shooters like Doom. Instead, Resistance 2 adopts the more popular convention of games like Halo and COD, permitting you to only carry two weapons at at time. This is so disappointing for a couple of reasons. First, what sets the Resistance series apart from the crowd is that it generally doesn't try to copy the other franchises- it has whacky weapons, an alternate timeline, and top notch monster design. By following this mainstream convention, #2 loses some of what sets it apart (although the weapon wheel thankfully returns for #3). The second reason it's disappointing is because the weapons in the Resistance series are AWESOME! Why would Insomniac want to handicap one of the best features of the game, and limit your exposure to their excellent weapon design?Furthermore, the graphics somehow became worse in this entry, which is surprising, since Insomniac had an additional two years of experience with the PS3 hardware at this point. I suspect the depreciation of visuals is at least partially due to their effort to adopt the horrid gray palette color scheme that was so popular at the time, in games like the first Gears of War. The first Resistance proved that you can have a convincing post-apocalyptic world, and still have it teeming with color and nice visuals. Resistance 2 tried a bit too hard to make everything \"bleak\".Despite these complaints, there's still plenty to love here. In your campaign against the Chimera, you get to battle a Godzilla-sized alien beastie, a Kraken, and a bunch of new monsters that are downright eerie. Resistance 2 still has quite a bit going for it that sets it apart from the crowd, and the creature design (not to mention the mechanical war machines) is at the top of the list. The action remains exciting throughout, and the controls are satisfying, as you attempt to take back our planet from the dastardly Chimera invasion.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2012"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E67A","description":"","reviewerName":"GarionOrb","summary":"A thrilling, deep and engrossing shooter!","reviewText":"On November 17, 2006, the PlayStation 3 was released.  As is common for any new console launch, a handful of games of questionable quality were released alongside it.  Launch games are usually rough around the edges as developers are still learning the nuances of the new platform, and rarely is a game released at launch that qualifies as a \"killer app\".  But in that respect, the PS3 launch was different.  It had a killer app, and that game was Resistance: Fall of Man by first-party developer Insomniac Games.  It took the best parts of popular shooters such as Halo, Call of Duty and Medal of Honor and added some really cool weapons and a compelling story of an alternate history where man is at war with a force called the Chimera.  Despite the PS3's lackluster launch, Resistance: Fall of Man was an instant classic.  The game was further refined a few years later with its sequel, Resistance 2, though that game failed to capture the thrill of the original, in my opinion.  Now, Insomniac gives us Resistance 3, and I'm happy to say that this game delivers in every way.Picking up right where Resistance 2 left off, you are now playing as Joseph Capelli.  Gone is the military theme of the first two games.  Joe is now a civilian who chose to start a family and live as best he could while trying to keep everyone alive against the Chimera, who have pretty much taken over everything.  A Dr. Malnikov, who was present in the prior games, arrives and asks that Joe travel to New York to stop the Chimera by destroying a wormhole they have created there.  Despite his better judgment, Joe agrees for the sake of giving his family a better life and the adventure begins.  The bleak and dire circumstance of the state of the world is felt throughout the entire game.  The world is all rubble, desolate and abandoned, and it's just Joe and Malnikov on their own journey.  The story is dark and foreboding, and Insomniac pulls this off wonderfully.  Throughout the game's 20 chapters, you are treated to a varied campaign that never gets stale.  It's not just going from beginning to end doing the same thing for 10 hours.  The levels are drastically different, and it keeps you playing.  The plot twists and turns in unexpected ways, and I can firmly say this is one of the best stories in a first-person shooter ever.In true Insomniac fashion, weapons are a particularly fun highlight of the game.  The first two Resistance games had some creative weapons too, but in this game they are so refined and improved that it's almost a tangible difference.  Each weapon just feels unique, and their alternate fire method is almost like a separate weapon in itself.  As each weapon is used, it will increase in level, which introduces even more firepower and perks.  In a welcome move, the \"weapon wheel\" from the first game returns here, and this time the campaign is built around the clever use of your entire arsenal.  You cannot complete this game by using just one weapon...but even if you manage to do so, you'd just be doing yourself a huge disservice by not playing around with what you have!  By the last third of the game you will have every weapon available, and that's when fierce firefights become some of the most exhilarating and intense moments you'll ever have in video gaming!  You'll fight waves upon waves of Chimera, switching weapons on the fly and creating death and destruction in an enormous variety of ways.It probably goes without saying that the game also looks beautiful.  Unlike Resistance 2's overly orange color scheme, this game is more subdued, yet it's still wildly colorful and detailed.  Character models are well-done and the voice acting is great.  The game controls wonderfully, and is also compatible with PlayStation Move.  However, I found that using the Dualshock controller was actually the more precise way to play.  The frantic nature of the fights, particularly near the end, is just too much for the Move's way of controlling the player.  And while shooting from the hip works great with Move, aiming is a huge inconvenience.It goes without saying that fans of the Resistance games simply must own this game.  And anyone looking for a good first-person shooter on the PS3 in general will find this an incredible experience.  This is by far the best shooter on the PS3, and one of the best games on the console overall.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2011"}

Yes, the campaign is great for Resistance 3. I have played all of the Resistance games and they have all been great. But I purchased this specifically for the online portion. You wouldn't think that if you buy a relatively recent game that the online portion would no longer work.You can only play the campaign so many times before you want to know where you stand amongst your fellow players. If you can't do that, then they have no business selling the product to unsuspecting customers like myself. Given that this game only came out only three years ago, and still on the shelves of many stores, Sony should not be shutting down its servers for this game. To purchase this game brand new and only to find that a major part of it is no longer functional is a total letdown. In an age where publishers such as Activision keep their servers running for games such as Call of Duty: Black Ops that came out four years ago and at the same time still serving the other Call of Duty games from Black Ops to Ghost this should not be. Sony with its deep pocket should be able to continue serving the Resistance community. They chose to go the in the wrong direction and follow businesses such as EA whose business practice has been to nickel and dime customers and give them less for their money. Producing a game such as Resistance 3 and then pulling the plug on the customers is simply, to put it short, bad business practice. As such, I will no longer be purchasing any more Resistance iterations ever again. I am sure that they will do the same to the Resistance 4 customers.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2014"}

There are 6 missions in call; unfortunately you cannot choose which one you want to play; it loads randomly, which kinda sucks.Ammunition - The Mexican Army has the town of Tesero Azul under siege. You and your comrades are pinned down, caught under heavy artillery fire and enemy reinforcements. Your first goal is to clear the town of all hostiles while avoiding enemy artillery blasts from the ridge. Once completed, the next phase of the mission shifts to clearing out the Eastern and Western fortifications surrounding the town. These areas are rife with snipers, riflemen, and gunners on mounted Gatling guns. Once the flanks are secured the final phase of the mission begins, prompting one of your team members to grab explosives from inside the town and plant them on the high ridge amidst the opposing artillery encampment. The mission concludes once the camp is secure and the explosives detonated.Walton's Gold - Walton's gang has taken control of a small mining camp rich with gold. Fight through the camp while avoiding sniper fire from the ridge and mounted Gatling guns near the entrance to the mine. Once inside, pile as many bags of gold as you can into a mine cart while fighting off waves of Walton's cronies. Be quick, the mine is rigged to explode! Once safely outside the mine, defend your newly acquired riches from Walton's reinforcements.The EscapeInterrupt an arms deal and steal a coach full of gold, with the option of using a second, Gatling gun-equipped wagon for protection. Turn the gold in to the American Army and clear out remaining resistance in the town of Tumbleweed. The battle at Tumbleweed involves cannons and Gatling guns. After a classic double-cross that ends in a stand-off, escape with the Gold Coach to Mexico, battling Army soldiers the entire way.The HerdCattle rustlers have taken control of Box Canyon. Fight your way in and wipe out the rustlers, then use teamwork to protect the herd as you lead them home to Armadillo under heavy fire - watch for snipers on the ridge, and reinforcements on horseback.The Kidnapped GirlAnother gang has taken over Fort Mercer, and they're holding a farmer's daughter hostage. Charge the fort and eliminate the gang's inner stronghold, then fend off reinforcements as you transport the girl by stagecoach to her home at Ridgewood Farm.The RiverUse a raft to head downriver, taking out rebel encampments along the way until you reach the rebel stronghold of Nosalida and a final epic battle for the town's massive weapons caches. Watch out for Gatling gun-equipped enemy rafts.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYXSW","description":"","reviewerName":"Charles \"Altered Confusion\"","summary":"Gunstringer Review","reviewText":"The Gunstringer is a Kinect game created by Twisted Pixel. In the game you play an outlaw who was double crossed and comes back from the dead to seek vengeance upon those who betrayed him. Well at least that's what the puppet show is about as you are a marionette. You will be controlling your directional movement with your left hand and trying to squeeze off your shots with your six-shooter in your right. Now of course there is a left-handed mode, so at least this company remembered that the world is comprised of individuals of different handedness.Graphically this game looks good. It's probably one of the best Kinect games I've seen graphic wise. You'll see that most of your enemies have that puppet look to them, or paper cut-out look. You'll also see that there is some interference done from time to time by a human hand (green screened) in. From time to time you'll also get to see the audience which I'm assuming was just filmed in a theater down the street from their office. Now of course your common enemies all look relatively the same per level, but there is definitely variety of different enemies when it comes to different areas. There's also the bosses which all have their own ways of attacking, and they all definitely have unique character models.The music is your standard spaghetti western type music that doesn't distract from the game. The narration is really hit or miss. Most of the times it tells the story well, but when it drops in for comments in the middle of the level it can sometimes get really old fast.The controls of the game as described above are your left and right hand. The left will control movement and jumping, the right will control your aim and pulling the trigger by jerking your hand up. There will be times where you'll use both hands to throw punches or when magically you get a second six-shooter and you can just go wild blowing enemies away.So you are the Gunstringer brought from the dead and out for vengeance. You'll have to get through quite a few enemies to get at members of your old gang, but if you can do that you'll be able to exact some revenge upon them. You'll almost always have your six-shooter at your disposal, but there will also be times where you'll get to use a shotgun, flamethrower, and broadsword for a short amount of time to change up the pace. Within the levels you'll have to keep your left hand limber as you'll have to dodge quite a few things, or attempt to jump over them so as to not take too much damage. At the end of each level you'll be given some money which you can turn around and use to unlock special features within the game. My biggest problem with the game is that the controls weren't as tight as I would have liked them. There were times where the slightest move with your left hand could send your character over to one side of the screen more than you wanted and instead of dodging something you run right into it. There's also the issue of jumping. There will be times in the game where gauging when to start your jump will be difficult and there's a very good chance you'll land on something, causing damage, or fall into something that will cause you to respawn slightly before the jump. There's also the small issue of sometimes your right hand motion not causing your gun to fire. When you're in for the fight of your life you'll want to have that as accurate as possible and having to exaggerate the movement after failing in an attempt can completely throw off how the game will interpret your next move with either hand as your body has probably moved to a different spot in the room, even if only slightly.Even though there are definitely some control issues this game is very entertaining and fun to play. If you're looking for a Kinect game with a little attitude and that definitely has something a bit different, you're going to want to pick up this game and give it a try. This game gets an 8.0 out of 10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

I loved Super Mario 64 but I thought Super Mario Sunshine was familiar and gimmicky so I had priorly assumed that there wasn't any gas left in the Mario franchise tank.  Boy was I wrong.To summarize the game, it is at its core a collection of puzzles.  The completion of each puzzle awards you with star.  Collect enough stars, and you win the game.It sounds mundane, but completing each individual puzzle and collecting the star has the charm of, say, completing a sudoku puzzle or the daily crossword.  But unlike doing consecutive sudoku puzzles, the quests to earn each star in Mario Galaxy are so fantastically diverse and mind-bendingly innovative, you'll have a hard time putting your controller down.  It stems from the absolutely brilliant and imaginative ways the designers used the gravity mechanic in the game - the direction of gravity is constantly changing, Mario will be flipping upside down, and you'll have a wonderful time manipulating the game.I should address another issue that gave me pause before I bought the game.  I had feared from the trailers and previews that either the game would merely involve jumping from tiny planet to tiny planet, killing one or two enemies on each one and collecting a few coins; or that the space setting would quickly grow tiresome (like the Sun-shiny settings of Sunshine before it).  Fear not - true some levels involving blasting from small space object to small space object.  But there is tremendous diversity from planet jumping puzzles (which are much more fun than I had anticipated) to large sprawling landscapes to explore much like in Super Mario 64.  Further, traveling the different planets gives Mario the opportunity to visit diversely themed planets - such as your standard green grass settings to fire, ice, desert, water, volcano, etc. settings.So in conclusion, if you were skeptical like me about Galaxy, let me assure you it is well worth trying out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2008"}

You lose all your weapons (since it's  a stand alone game this is understandable but annoying) and your mission continues. The game wasn't anything special and while it did continue the story I would never have purchased the game if it wasn't included. It's rather short and there isn't much new.--------------Half Life 2: Episode 2:Just like Episode 1 you start off empty handed as well. It continues from the ending of Episode 1. I must admit this episode had some more interesting aspects to it but it too was somewhat repetitive. It also had the most annoying beginning of any game I've ever played. Who doesn't want to spend the first half of the game with only the gravity gun?It does end in an interesting way and leads you to believe there will be a Half Life 3, however. I'm just hoping there isn't a Half Life 2: Episode 3 before then.--------------Team Fortress 2:Arguably one of the best multiplayer shooter games on the market right now. While there aren't many maps that come with the game the ones that do are fun to play and the plethora of classes to pick from keep the game interesting.One of the only draw backs to the game would be just that there aren't many weapon choices once you do select a class. There's a melee weapon, your class weapon, and usually a weaker but more generic weapon (like a shot gun or a rifle). It does add to the strategy of the game though.My only other complaint would be that for a game that so relies on team combat it requires a lot of work to join a clan. It would have been nice if there was some way to dynamically set a clan tag in your profile so you wouldn't have to actually change your steam login username to join one.--------------Portal:This game alone would have definitely been worth buying if you were given the choice let alone as a piece of such a great bundle.The whole idea behind it is you are a test subject at a facility which is using you as a guinea pig to test out a new weapon. This weapon allows you to create a portal which you can use to move from wherever you set the opening portal to where you set the closing one. This is the only gun you get in the game.I won't spoil much but the game somehow manages (through the genius of the developers no doubt) to use this premise to build an engaging atmosphere and storyline even into such a short game. It's puzzle game meets action shooter. And while it sounds very easy it can be pretty hard as you begin to think about all the possibilities of the portals (like making a portal under you, and one above you pointing out, jumping down and using your speed to propel you a distance).The only draw back to this one is how short it is. You likely can finish this game in one sitting if you put enough time aside and pick up the general idea of how to use the portals quick enough.--------------All in all this is a great collection and definitely worth the money. The HL2 episodes are rubbish but everything else is a definite add on to the compilation.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00004U55E","description":"It's been nearly 10 years sinceWolfenstein 3Dforever  popularized the first-person shooter, and at long last everyone's favorite Nazi  killer, B.J. Blazkowicz, is back inReturn to Castle Wolfenstein. Set  during World War II,Return to Castle Wolfensteinfinds the Nazis  dabbling in the black arts in an effort to create an army of supersoldiers.  Naturally, Blazkowicz is the only thing standing in the Nazis' way, so he's set  behind enemy lines in an effort to end the madness.On the surface, the single-player game seems like pure gold--after all, everyone  loves killing Nazis. But the story jumps all over the place, the enemy AI is  less than impressive, and most gamers will be able to finish the game in a mere  10 to 15 hours. The single-player game falls short of the standards set by  titles such asHalf-LifeandNo One Lives Forever.In fact, the best thing aboutReturn to Castle Wolfensteinis its  team-based multiplayer mode. Each multiplayer adventure features Axis vs. Allies, and  both sides offer four character classes: engineer (removes obstacles), medic  (heals and revives teammates), lieutenant (calls in air strikes and replenishes  ammo), and soldier (only class able to use sniper rifles, flamethrowers, and  other unusual weapons). The game includes only eight multiplayer maps, but they  are all perfectly designed, and in order to be successful teams have to work  together. The result is a great gaming experience that fans ofCounter-Strikeor the Day of Defeat mode forHalf-Lifewill really  appreciate.Graphically,Return to Castle Wolfensteinlooks amazing. It uses the  powerfulQuake IIIengine to great effect, and the character models,  explosions, and lighting effects are all perfectly done.

{"product_name":"B000O5DS32","description":"Prepare to experience an evolution in the first person shooter. Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"Josh A.

I also tried beating the game by only using the knife/bow which is also really fun.  But the Graphics are very good i would say a step up from gears of war.

{"product_name":"B000WCE9XK","description":"Uncover all the mysteries of Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword as you fight enemy ninjas and battle various fiends while taking on the role of Master Ninja, Ryu Hayabusa, in an all new storyline for the Nintendo DS.","reviewerName":"Steven Rinck","summary":"Horrible control, horrible game design, pretty graphics","reviewText":"My review title sums up the most important aspects of this game.  This was an attempt to bring the action of the reborn Ninja Gaiden series to the Nintendo DS.The first thing you'll notice is that the game is actually quite pretty for a Nintendo DS game, and what it pulls off on the screen is very impressive from a technical standpoint.Pointing at places on the screen makes your ninja go there.  Touching down on the screen makes Ryu move there, tapping enemies hits them with ranged attacks, swiping them makes you attack them with your sword, and just brushing up makes you jump.  The game eases you into its difficulty curve so that at first it works fairly well.  The game is a giant linear path (excluding your \"hub\" world between missions) of a series of \"kill every enemy in the room to proceed\" gameplay.  It works well for the first hour or two, but for the next 3-4 you'll be rolling your eyes and trudging on only because the attack interaction is novel and works pretty well.  Some of these rooms seriously take upwards of 10 minutes of non-stop respawning enemies; may I repeat, the level design is horrible.By the time you get to the last third of the game, however, many of the encounters are either in such poorly designed terrain or have too many enemies on the screen to make the controls manageable.  When the screen is completely filled with enemies, the game simply can't tell the difference between: move here, slash this enemy or ranged attack this enemy.  Jump is similarly confounded in being unable to tell if you're trying to slash a target or jump.  A single incorrect input can be the difference between a flawless battle and losing half your health, so you have to at least keep moving (also a problem since your attacks typically commit you to being unable to dodge/change course for several seconds). With any option for careful control thrown right out the window, the only viable way to attack is to simply swipe the screen back and forth to fly around and slash around wildly.  Bad level design then pairs up with lackluster control to provide a very poor game experience.  There are also times when the terrain is a hindrance, particularly on narrow ledges where you have about a pixel-thin ribbon to touch that means the difference between your character moving and just standing still doing nothing (or getting munched on by the damn ghost fishes).Some of the last bosses are also an exercise in tedium.  They are the kind that take an hour and a half because to beat them takes 30+ minutes straight (29.5 of which they are completely invincible) plus a half-dozen retries learning their patterns through trial and error.To summarize, this game is very pretty to look at by DS standards.  It starts out interesting, but poor level design and an eventual breakdown in the game's  combat interface very handily kill what fun the game elicits in the early stages.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00064MUIA","reviewerName":"Matthieu P. Raillard","summary":"Tons of potential, will Nintendo deliver?","reviewText":"I've come to expect both the best and worst from Nintendo.  The best being terrific triple-A titles such as Metroid, Zelda and Mario, solid hardware and a pedigree second to none (I still play my 8-bit NES every now and then!).  The worst has been the amazing decline in third party support for Nintendo's consoles.  The N64 was in many ways a bust, and the Gamecube has suffered a similar fate: solid hardware capabilities, but dwindling support from anybody but Nintendo.  Now, it's no secret that Nintendo's moneymaker over the years has been the the Gameboy line of hardware/software.  The DS is the latest in a very successful family of portable gaming, and it has the potential to be very successful.  The big innovation is the dual-screen configuration, with the bottom screen also being a touch-screen.  The possibilities are intriguing, yet my question remains: will Nintendo deliver, or will this be another gimmick that goes under-utilized by the big N?  The backwards compatibility with the Gameboy Advance is a welcome feature, as is the included wireless capability and the included Pictochat software.  I've only played two games on this system thus far: Metroid and Madden 2005, and my reaction is generally favorable.  In terms of graphical prowess, the DS is somewhere near the original playstation.  It is a step-up from the gameboy advance, but those expecting to be blown away might be disappointed.  One of my biggest gripes is the ergonomics.  The unit doesn't feel NEARLY as well designed as the Advance SP, which was a real gem.  The buttons on the DS are too close to the edges, meaning that a normal hand position will result in cramps, and a difficult time in reaching the shoulder buttons.  The overall look to the unit isn't bad, but it feels more plasticky and less sleek than the GBA SP, and certainly will pale in comparison (looks-wise) with Sony's upcoming PSP portable.  I have faith in the DS, and I hope that Nintendo will support this potent little system, and all of its innovative features.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2005"}

I put a five spot down for pre-order back in March or April, and when it came out, the store said they had my copy. While the shelves were empty and everybody else was scrambling to order a copy, I just waltzed right in, plunked down the rest of the money, and got my copy right away.But that's not important. This review is about the game. Although I had read about how much more advanced the gameplay is, I had no idea it was THIS much advanced. This is unbelievable! Buying clothes, eating food, getting snacks and sodas from vending machines, getting haircuts, working out, getting tattooed, dancing (a big step ahead of me making Tommy Vercetti crouch up and down at the Malibu)... it goes on and on. Also, more cars (another Impala was added to the mix, along with a '68 Torino) have been added, and I know this has been said before, but... San Andreas is HUGE. I'm talkin' HUGE.

{"product_name":"B002I0HIMI","description":"","reviewerName":"stevie","summary":"Great game, but is missing some things","reviewText":"Well, I have not payed much attention to baskeball games for a few years. My roomate had one of the recent 2k games, but I didn't pay that much attention to it. The last basketball game I really played was NBA live 2005. I was really surprised with how well this game is put together. Compared to mlb the show, a franchise I have played in depth the last 3 seasons (and one many people consider to be a model for sports games), nba 2k12 really rocks. I think its probably the best sports game now in terms of realism and gameplay controls.The graphics are top notch and the presentation blows away both the show and madden 12's so called new and not so improved presentation styles. The controls in the game are designed well, but are quite difficult at first to get a hold of. You will definitely need to use the tutorial in this game, although its not laid out very well. You have to sit through an explanation and demonstration by a famous nba player. You cannot skip directly to the demonstration and the word boxes are a bit to slow to get through because you cannot skip them. However, there are a few mini games where you get test your new skills in the tutorial which are quite fun. The button combos consist of either holding L2 and moving the left stick or just moving the stick. Moving the stick a certain way will allow your player to perform a certain move. R2 is designed the same way except it is used for dunks, layups and some post moves. This sounds easy at first, but it can be quite difficult to remember all the nuances because the moves branch off each other on the stick. Thus, the game has a little bit of a learning curve. Fortunately, once you start get these down, you feel more and more in control of the player. It is very satisfying to master these controls and know which moves work better in certain situations. Its a whole level of control you will not feel in some sports games like madden with EA's we made the game for everyone-yet for older players to model in which the controls feel too simple sometimes.I only rented this game so did not get to play every mode extensively, although from reading a lot of other reviews about this game, some features are almost unchanged. One of these is the association mode (franchise). If you played 2k11, there is no difference and the streaky trade AI is still present. There is also an online association mode which I heard was very weak. In addition, there is a my player mode similar to Road to the show in MLB 11. However, I enjoyed this mode a whole lot better in 2k12. It is generally more fun and provides you with a better in depth experience despite being a little shallow. You have to do some simple interviews that will affect where you land in the draft. They are not very long or in depth, but its more than you will find in other games. You also get to play sort of a scout game with other college pros to show off your ability. This was difficult if you did not have much experience with the game. Either way, I found myself being drafted in the first round anyways. Depending on where you go, you will probably start out on the bench. You can skip instantly to whenever your time to play comes up. You have some objectives to in the game such as having a certain shooting percentage to get your points to spend on your skills. You also receive a pay check in the game and have pay days. As far as I know, you can spend these on new shoes if you please. Can't remember if the shoes were purchased by cash or by skill points, but they are there nonetheless. Overall, its an enjoyable mode and is better than Road to the show.The only area this game really suffers is its lack of simple features like 1 on 1 and no dunk contest. I was disappointed to find this out when I took it over to a friends house hoping to get some virtual 1 on 1 action. Sadly, this is not in the game. There is a 'street' mode where you can play five on five on a blacktop. First to 21 wins. Its a fun experience, but not that different from the normal exhibition games. The other feature is the NBA greats. I read that in 2k11, you could play with the greats on normal teams with current players and this is not in this version unfortunately. You can't even play as M.J. or anyone for that matter except in the NBA greats mode. This is just a challenge mode where you go back and try to win those famous matchups. They do a good job making it look authentic (Black and white for fifties), but it doesn't feel like anything significant. There is also no variation of a dunk contest. Even in practice, you have a limited number of dunks. Every player has about 5 signature dunks. Simply, run towards the hoop holding R2 and you slam one down. The dunks look great, but there is no control over them. In the old, NBA live series, there was an amazingly fun fleshed out dunk mode with where you could do all kinds of different dunks. It felt a little 'arcadish' at times, but I wished something like this was implemented in the game. Sometimes, its fun to mess around when you don't feel like getting absorbed into the games larger modes. The same holds true in that there is no 3-point shootout either.I gave this game a five stars fun rating because it is really fun for the modes it does have. I would give this an 8/10, but 4 out of five for amazon. This is a really great basketball game that is disappointing in some areas for lack of very simple modes. Also, it is not much different from the last game in some areas as well. I saw this game for $30 on Steam. If you have the computer for it, that is a pretty good deal. I went to gamestop and could not find a used copy yet. Not many people are taking this game back. I can't say for sure if its worth buying new. Maybe the fact that I tried to find a used game explains its inefficiencies.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2011"}

For example a group of dwarves attack you and you have to go about recruiting stupid people and the PC's dynamics is not set to \"if they aren't there yet!\" So maybe the goofs don't \"produce thier first wave\". Why do companies always buden us with the task of \"director of the scenes\" instead of \"player of them\"  They absently and precariously do this and think we gamers like it as if they are sleeping while programing.  Star Wars KToR 2(Kreia's cuts) and Ultima 9(Minoc/Yew rock climbing caper/mine sh@#) were the same way, why not stick with the old formula of just gaming in any order(RPG) without having to \"trigger this event before that or that won't happen and will blotch up the computer\" Despite the plot which is excellent start to-- well I just ran the prologue and was saddened by my  --SPOILED HERE 20 somthing rich kid!=-- P character's plight and his dead Amiee.(highly unusual to kill off a main NPC character of intresting backstory so early in the adventure).

The main reason I don't care for this game is not the play but the sloppy programing and steap PC requirements for very little.  That it makes my wrist ache as the camera cannot be set in ANY options to work properly.  That occasionally Creative sound drivers revert from multi speaker setting to the primate native 2.1 cheeze whizz setting when ATARI logo pops up.

I was subscriber for 6 years stopping near the first year of the Cataclysm expansion. Even though with the subscription numbers dropping after Cataclysm and the release of other games in this genre of video gaming, WoW is my official definition of what a MMORPG truly is. I don't care if Rift, Star Wars: The Old Republic (even though I am currently playing it), or Guild Wars 2 do become the new games to subscribe or play F2P, WoW will remain the best one in the past decade. The sales and numbers simply prove it with a record of 13 million subscribers during it's second expansion: Wrath of the Lich King.The original/core release takes place 4 years after the events of the amazing Warcraft III real time strategy game and its Frozen Throne expansion (even the previous game entries!). So with that in mind, Blizzard Entertainment already had a huge world with rich history/lore at their disposal. Immediately after choosing your faction, race, class, and customization, the player is thrown into arguably the biggest and most diverse game world ever conceived by any game developer. The simple fact that each race's 20+ (sometimes all the way to 40!) leveling environments are so unique to one another proves that Blizzard created this with extreme precision. Classes are very disperse from each other. Nothing truly is the same with each class you pick. Even after 10 days of actual play time, a player will never master a particular class. WoW not only evolved into a bigger game with its first 11 major content patches, but increased in dramatic size as the implementations of each expansion be it environments, classes, races, or game mechanics.I would go into detail of the hows, whats, wheres, but simply the best way to find out anything about World of Warcraft is to just simply use the internet or start your own account. Because I'll just simply state it's an absolute huge and fun game to play. The only reason I am not currently subscribed with this installed is because I am done, retired, whatever. The game did have it's super highs and it did have super lows, but memories from playing WoW will never ever go away. The world has drastically changed with Cataclysm, but this game still deserves nothing else but a perfect 10/10, 5/5, or 100% score from anything. There is so much to explore and quest in this game.The price for this game right now is an understatement to be honest. It was worth the $49.99 price I paid back in 2005 to me.

The campaign just never gets old, and the multiplayer provides some good fun as well. I'll discuss the different parts of this game in their respective sections below:CAMPAIGN:The campaign is amazing in COD4, and is one of the best in the series, in my opinion. It's a good length, has a good story, cool characters, and fun gameplay. You play as either Soap, a soldier in the British SAS, or Jackson, a soldier in the USMC. It's set in modern times (as the title clearly says), and you're dealing with either a war in the Middle East or a revolution in Russia (Jackson and Soap, respectively). The campaign is probably the longest of the series, but it never feels like it's dragged on. Even though the graphics are somewhat outdated byy today's standards, the game still looks good and plays great. There's also Arcade Mode, where you play through specific missions (or the entire campaign!) as fast as you can, racking up points for each kill, headshot, etc. Your scores are then put onto the leaderboards, so you can have some competition with your friends. Sadly, there's no split screen co-op campaign, which would've been a great addition to the game. However, this doesn't really detract from the overall experience, and you're still left with a great Campaign. There are four difficulties (and achievements tied to completing each one of them), and Veteran, the highest one, is extremely hard in some parts. Multiple difficulties, in addition to Intel scattered throughout the campaign, makes this a 2-playthrough game at the very least.MULTIPLAYER:Although I have not extensively played Multiplayer, it's still a very fun thing to be had in this game. It feels much more balanced than future CoDs, so it's not so much about getting the most overpowered gun in the game and dominating everyone with it. The killstreaks, although simpler, work very well and make sure that your team isn't getting absolutely destroyed because some guy got lucky. Even though not many people play Multiplayer here anymore (right around 1,000), it's still a fun thing to do now and then. However, the Campaign is the primary attraction now.OVERVIEW:COD4 is a spectacular game, having an epic campaign and entertaining multiplayer. Even though it's much older and simpler than many of the CODs that are out now, it's still a classic, fun game to play. It's an absolute bargain for $20 (as of June 2013), and I highly recommend that you get it if you're a fan of FPS games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2012"}

I always wait a year after launch to buy a console and I could have gone easily to an XBOX 360 after all they were out first and they had more games. I spent many a nights trying to decide this issue, but what it came down to was the exclusive titles. Playstation at the time had a lot of exclusives and they continue to grow each month as new titles are released. Uncharted 2: Among Thieves being the best as it literally makes other games look like their standing still with it's gorgeous graphics and game play. Other excluseives include Infamous, Killzone 2, Socom, Mag, God of War 3, the Resistance trilogy, Gran Tourismo, AGENT, Motorstorm, Haze, Ratchet and Clank, Little Big Planet, Heavy Rain, and Metal Gear Solid 4. All of these games are why I stuck with Playstation they always have had and always will have the best games.The system also has the best graphics and there are few that can deny that with games like Killzone 2, Uncharted 2, and Gran Tourismo Prologue. Yes the 360 also has good graphics, but what it is missing is that Playstation 3 games are released on a high-def Blu Ray disc. The Playstation doubles as an amazing Blu Ray player. Can I say great deal any louder.This version of the system is my personal favorite, because it includes PS2 and PS1 backwards compatibility. You can also save all your data on the hard drive so you don't have to fumble around with a memory card. Just get an adapter and download all of your memory cards onto your hard drive.This version also has SD memory card slots and 4 USB slots on the front for easy access to any media you have. You can store and even print pictures off of your PS3 along with holding videos and music. Also you can play online for free you heard me free. There is no charge to play on Playstation. There will soon be a premium package with exclusive content for money but I doubt it will be worth it. You can also surf the net on your Playstation. How Microsoft who makes computers doesn't have this feature boggles the mind.The PS3 is the ultimate computer, and best console I have ever played in my life. And yes I've played a lot in my time including the Wii and Xbox 360. You have your classic Playstaion controller as well it's just wireless Bluetooth now.

For those who don't know, this is the story of Darth Vader's secret apprentice set between episodes III & IV. It is a single-player game with no multiplayer or splitscreen. There are many force powers that you can use, and the control layout is very intuitive. You only have basic force powers in the beginning, but you unlock more as you progress through the missions. The campaign is fairly long, with about 10-15 hours of gameplay, not including replays to find holocrons and beat the game on a higher difficulty. There have been 3 DLC packs released, which are Hoth, Tatooine, and Jedi Temple. They are very fun, but are a bit overpriced (800 Microsoft Points or $10). The story is OK, but could be much better.

The graphic detail, the use of more than one main character, and the storyline were nothing short of fantastic; but the games hype and marketing killed its mojo. The hype alone gave the perception that it would conquer all... but it was like a movie preview. All the best stuff was hyped up and that's all that was good about the game. Honestly I still like Sleeping Dogs more. I have played it over 10 times and it never gets old. This game just seems cumbersome and boring at certain points.2) The biggest disappointment above anything else was the map. Yes, it is technically the biggest map as far as square miles, but does not a have \"big feel\". Most of the map is gone to waste on countryside. 95% of the game is played on 10% of the map. Plus it's just one big island with one major city and the rest is scattered mini towns. GTA San Andreas was smaller but it was separate islands and 3 major cities that gave it the \"huge\" feeling.3) I cannot see myself playing this as often as I do other titles. Once you know the storyline and play all the missions the shine is off the apple so to speak. I have many titles that I still replay over and over: Timeshift, San Andreas, the Uncharted franchise, Enslaved, and the Resistance franchise to name a few. This game would get boring playing a 2nd time thru.It is a great game, no question about that. Is it the best game ever? No. Is it the best GTA ever?

Penniless and shipless, you venture around a space dock until you find a ship and a job. You'll encounter a heady mix of canned missions that follow one main quest, and a million opportunities to make money or aggravate the various factions that co-exist in the universe. Like an online role-playing game, or Bethesda'sMorrowind, you determine who your enemies are and who your friends are by your own actions, and, in another nod to role-playing, you can customize your ship with guns, rockets, and equipment just as you would customize a RPG character with swords, bows, and magic items. Best of all, you can play cooperatively with friends or fight it out with enemies online.The backstory posits a future where various countries, divided by both nationality and, seemingly, race, have boarded massive colony ships and ventured into a wormhole that appeared within reach of our crude space technology. They found themselves in a galaxy far, far away and they got stuck there when the wormhole collapsed. They quickly colonized new home worlds and named everything with familiar locales that make navigation a breeze. In the American sectors you'll feel at home entering the New York system and landing at a spaceport called Manhattan, for example. While contrived, this device is used beautifully and it's far better than having to memorize a bunch of sci-fi names and remembering where they are, perfect for a massive universe such as this one.ThoughFreelanceris set in space, it is technically not a space simulation. The game was designed to be accessible to casual gamers. For example,Freelancermakes you use the mouse for ship control. This is quite a shift for a game genre normally known to require joystick control. But even old-schoolWing CommanderorX-Wingfans may find that the sacrifice of verisimilitude is made up for with gains in agility. The mouse controls your guns, while you use the keyboard to maneuver around the rich universe that developer Digital Anvil has constructed. Much like a first-person shooter, you can dodge and weave while precisely blasting your enemies.Despite the game's age, its graphics are spectacular, as is the sound and voice acting, and in that way, fighting and trading with friends or alone,Freelancerproves worth the wait. Just keep in mind that it is explicitly not a hardcore space simulation, and you'll have to leave your joystick on the shelf.--Andrew S.

One particular standout is an angry confrontation between Ian Ziering's character (Edison Trent) and George Takei's character (Lord Hakkera). It's very rarely that we see two actors in a computer game getting to exercise their acting chops this way - it's a lot of fun to watch and worth the price of the game alone.The ship designs in Freelancer are very unconventional, and seem to have more in common with the works of Science fiction artists like Chris Foss and Boris Vallejo, rather than the &quot;Star Trek/Star Wars&quot; stylistic fetishes that some sci-fi simulators follow. The designs will not be to everyone's tastes, and it's possible to underestimate a ship's performance based purely on its design. The Sabre is a good example of this - it looks like a gigantic spacegoing anvil, but is one of the best ships in the game.The most prominent and most successful innovation in the game, is the successful implementation of a mouse-keyboard interface, which replaces the joystick used in most sci-fi simulator games. The interface actually works much better than a joystick, giving the player a much greater sense of freedom. It also makes it much easier to execute complex manuevers like strafing or loops - very important when dodging enemy fighters or spoofing missiles.The less successful innovation, is an attempt at implementing a dynamic universe in the game. It almost works, but there are obviously some features that should have been implemented in the game to make it more convincing. For instance, even though your reputation with a particular faction can change, a faction's area of influence will not expand or contract, based on the actions you take. Furthermore, the news feed is a very useful way of keeping track of events during the single-player campaign. However, once the campaign is over, the newsfeed becomes totally useless.Furthermore, the graphics are slightly out-dated now. This is testimony to the lengthy development time of the game (almost five years). The graphics in Independence War 2, which was released 18 months ago, are far superior than those used in Freelancer. The objects are not detailed enough - especially &quot;super heavy fighters&quot; like the Eagle or Titan. Large objects like space stations and battleships, aren't big enough to give a sufficient sense of size or scale.In the end, Freelancer is an extremely worthy addition to the sci-fi simulator genre. As the Single-player campaign is extremely short, and replay value is limited, many hardcore sci-fi fans probably won't want to play full price for it. However, for the enterprising novice, who shies away from space sims due to their complexity, Freelancer is a wonderful introduction to the genre. Here's hoping that Digital Anvil are given the opportunity to develop a sequel to this wonderful game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B000056KDW","description":"After making a name for himself with horror classics such asThe  Damnation Gamenovel,The Books of Bloodshort-story collection, and  the feature filmsHellraiserandCandyman, Clive Barker has slowly  moved away from the horror genre toward more fantasy-centric work. Barker hasn't  completely forgotten about his first love, however, andClive Barker's  Undying, a first-person action game from Electronic Arts and DreamWorks  Interactive, beautifully captures the type of horrors that populated Barker's  earliest works. And not only is this game genuinely frightening, it's also a lot  of fun to play.Cast against the backdrop of Ireland in the year 1923,Undyingfollows  Patrick Galloway, an investigator of the paranormal. Galloway has been summoned  to Ireland by his old war buddy Jeremiah Covenant to put an end to the strange  occurrences at the Covenant family estate. What Galloway finds is a house of  horrors that is populated with Jeremiah's dead siblings (and other ghastly  creatures), all of whom want to snuff out Jeremiah so they can complete a spell  cast when they were children.Graphically,Undyingis first rate. TheUnreal Tournamentgraphics  engine has been used to great effect and the result is amazing character models  and environments. The haunted mansion is suitably dark, with wispy draperies and  macabre paintings. The estate's grounds are a mix of lush Irish countryside and  crumbling ruins, all set against vivid skies.Pretty pictures aside, the most impressive thing aboutUndyingis its  atmosphere--this game is flat-out scary. Every element of the game, be it the  gothic architecture, eerie story, great weather effects including rain and  lightning, or amazing sound effects, perfectly complement each other. The result  is a gameplay experience that rivals theResident Evilseries in terms of  generating sheer terror in the player.The great atmosphere isn'tUndying's only innovation--it also features a  very cool two-handed attack system. Most action games saddle the player with an  attack system where one hand controls all the weapons and the other hand does  nothing. InUndying, the left hand (and left mouse button) controls the  standard weapons, such as the pistol and shotgun, while the right hand (and  right mouse button) casts spells. This is a great gameplay device and ensures  the action stays at a frantic pace.Of all the spells in the game, the coolest is the Scrye spell. When cast, it  lets the player see and hear past events--some of which are quite  horrific--and  occasionally it shows you how to progress beyond a certain level. This help can  come in the form of highlighting certain objects or unveiling a portal, but  whatever the method it is a very well-designed gameplay element.The only real complaints withUndyinginvolve the long loading times  between levels and the system requirements, but even those aren't enough to  derail this excellent--and terrifying--action game.--Kilmic RobbinsPros:Very, very creepyAmazing sound effectsExcellent graphicsSlick controlsCons:Long loading timesStory is a little convoluted","reviewerName":"ALLGODOWN","summary":"WOW!","reviewText":"Its 2005 and I know this game came out 5 years ago but I am still impressed not to mention a little freaked out. The graphics are just fine by any standards and the gameplay is typical first person shooter, but thats not what make this a great game its the feeling you get when youre playing it and its creepy atmosphere. The game has an erie horror feel to it that will scare you into turning on the lights even if youre an adult. I was playing this game with no lights and it was dusk outside and dim in my house. I saw a shadow come around the corner and my heart beated faster. It was my dog!!! Thats what kind of psychological effect this game has on you! It will creep up on your mind almost stressing you out with its subtle and violent horror.  A skeleton rips your heart out and then eats it. Monsters can quietly come upon you and just start ripping you apart furiously if youre not careful.  This is one great survival horror game that was sadly overlooked when it first came out and is worth a go to any action survival horror game fan.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2005"}

Those who side with good will get to follow Frodo's journey through Middle-Earth, playing in battles inspired by both the books and the movies. Or join evil to find out what may have happened if Frodo had failed to destroy the One Ring, as you fight your way with Sauron back across the map in an attempt to destroy Rivendell, the Shire, and all that is good in the world.You can play as a warrior, scout, mage or archer.View larger.The online multiplayer mode allows for massive battles with up to 16 of your friends.View larger.Building off the model Pandemic used with Star Wars: Battlefront, Lord of the Rings: Conquest provides you with a first and/or third person shooter style of game that not only lets you command strategy, but also lets you control the players in the center of the action. Participate in the Battle of Isengard as an Ent or fight Saruman at Orthanc as Gandalf himself. Take on the Nazgul as Aragorn while still protecting Frodo, or battle at Pelennor as a Rohirrim cavalry soldier. And that is just for the good guys!In Conquest you will have to play many different characters in order to win. And it isn't always such a balanced match, as you will find yourself destroying towering siege engines and taking on hulking oliphaunts with your companions. You can choose to play all the heroes you love, or fight as a Nazgul tasked with killing Frodo and stretch your powerful wings as the Balrog himself in your battle for Moria.Pick Your Own Style of PlayIn the game, you'll be able to play as one of four different character classes. Choose the melee-based Warrior or Scout for up-close action, or pick the Archer or Mage to perform devastating ranged attacks. There is also talk of a 'special' class called the Guardian to give gamers a third choice. But don't worry about getting locked in, as you can actually change which character class you're playing on the fly, in the middle of the game's various objective-based missions.Each class of characters has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as unique special abilities. Playable units range from grunt soldiers, which are the weakest, to captains, which are the strongest AI units in the game other than the heroes. You also get to order in air strikes using either eagles or fellbeasts. Even better, players will be able to mount the occasional horse, unless they've chosen evil, in which case they will have to master the skill of riding a fearsome warg.Multiple Modes for Endless FunAs in Battlefront, Lord of the Rings: Conquest has enormous competitive multiplayer modes, including Conquest, Capture the Flag, and Hero Deathmatch. In addition to these classics, Conquest adds a Ring Bearer mode, in which one player tries to stay alive as Frodo against a host of ringwraiths, and Stronghold in which you fight on various maps in a Risk-style battle for territories. Fortunately, you won't be limited to roaming around with only your teammates, however, as battles occur in large scale with non-player combatants joining in the fray.Conquest allows online play with up to 16 players for massive battles with all your friends, or in two-player cooperative mode. Players can also play locally with up to four players competitively, or two-player co-op on a split screen. When in the game itself, fans will get the thrill of hearing Howard Shore's score for the films accompanying the action, and both good and evil campaigns are narrated by Hugo Weaving, who played Elrond in the movies.You can choose to play either good or evil, each with different endings.","reviewerName":"Lestor neeker Wong","summary":"Dynasty Warriors: LOTR Edition","reviewText":"Lord of the Rings: Conquest has an interesting premise. It allows you to play through key battles from the movies in epic, cinematic environments. It also includes a \"what if\" option that lets you play an entire campaign as the bad guys. To add depth, it even has characters with different classes, trying to pass itself off as some sort of a RPG. Essentially, however, the game is quite simply a button-masher from start to finish, and a slightly more polished version of Koei's Dynasty Warriors.Let's first talk about the good things. For one, it's Lord of the Rings. It has undeniable star power, and EA lets you tap into this from time to time. Even though you play through a large part of the game as one of the classes available, there are parts that provides the opportunity for you to play as a specific character to relive a key moment of the show. For example, you get to take on the Witch King as Eowyn, the Balrog as Gandalf and an Oliphaunt as Legolas. These sequences are included as part of the mission objectives, and it's a nice touch to allow the player to play as different characters from the show during different parts of the game. The question then is, why won't EA allow us to play through the entire game as these characters?Next up, the life system. Unlike many \"modern\" games, LOTR: Conquest actually has a limit on how many times you can die before you have to start a mission all over again. Most games nowadays use checkpoints. You die, you respawn from the last checkpoint. You could save a game beforehand and reload from it to continue on. Not this game. You get a number of lives to start with, and if you exhaust them all, it's game over. It doesn't matter if you lose all your lives at the final boss fight, you simply restart from point A. You also can't manually save the game at any point in time, which is really unforgiving on the hardest difficulty level. I can't be sure if this is a \"good\" point to you, but what it does is that it encourages you to be more careful in your approach. It's easy to simply choose the standard melee Warrior class and rush in for a massive fight everytime for every mission, but at times, the mission gets easier if you actually uses ranged attacks, magic, or stealth.These tie in with the classes in the game - you get the Warrior (melee), the Archer (range), the Mage (magic) and the Scout (stealth). Each class plays slightly differently than another, with different sets of combos and abilities to boot. The Archer, for example, can shoot both poisonous and fire arrows, while the Scout can throw bombs on enemies. These keep playing styles varied, if you actually bother to switch classes on a regular basis. Unfortunately, it's good only for as long as it lasts.This is when I talk about the bad points. Despite the varied fighting styles for the classes, the game is essentially the same through out. You've many objectives to fulfil in the various missions, but eventually it all points to one thing: enemies swarming, kill them all. This is exactly why I compare it to the hack-and-slash legend (ahem) Dynasty Warriors. To make matters worse, all abilities are given to all classes from the start, so there's no new combos to learn, and no new abilites to use. This also means that there's no scaling difficulties from mission to mission. Enemies in the final mission behave similarly in the first one. All these add to the repetition, which is no surprise when it gets old really quickly. At least, in Dynasty Warriors, you actually level up your characters.The game also ends too quickly for me. Those who know me would know that I love short games, but seriously, this short? The \"good\" and \"evil\" campaigns each has seven to eight missions, and each mission is achievable in about 15-30 minutes. You do the maths on how fast the exercise would be. At the point of writing, I've already completed the \"good\" story, and it hasn't even been a day since I bought the game.Perhaps EA is banking on the multiplayer feature to generate longetivity. Unfortunately, deathmatch and capture the flag types have been played to death in so many other games. I'd prefer if the company actually focuses more on co-op elements. Instead, we get a co-op mode that offers only one achievement, and none for even completing the story modes with the help of a friend.On the topic of achievements, those who enjoy unlocking them (like me) will have mixed reactions to the list. A large portion of it is dedicated to completing missions, while some are for completing the above-mentioned movie-specific key moments. A sizaeble part of it is also listed for kills achieved as various classes. For those who honestly dislike playing competitive online matches, these could be a turn-off (although you could always \"boost\" them with a friend...). You also don't get the achievement points for chapter completions if you play through the game with a friend, which is mystifying. In games like this, I usually play co-op right away with a friend. As far as possible, I try to avoid playing alone whenever co-op is available. But I've to now, because the game refuses to acknowledge that I've completed a chapter just because I've played it with a friend.All in all, LOTR: Conquest is an ok game that has its moments, but falls short on other areas. Nevertheless, it does offer the chance to revisit one of the greatest movie trilogies ever made. For this, I'd recommend that you at least pick it up for a try. Whether you'd want to purchase it to do so, however, is another matter altogether.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2009"}

While the first Burnout game had you dodging traffic through crowded streets like the best scenes out of your favorite chase movies, and Burnout 2 had you purposefully crashing into intersections for maximmum damage points (like some kind of crazy car crash physics puzzle game), the Burnout series yet AGAIN moves into an entirely different direction with the third installment: Takedown!Yes indeed, all the wishes of the people who played the first two games have been granted. Before, I had found myself wishing that the computer players would fight back more (instead of just trying to outrun me), the gas tankers would explode when you hit them (they do!!!!! In a flash of white and a fireball!), and that you could make the computer players crash in a way other than crashing right in front of them (now you can run them off the road, into walls, and manuever your crashing car right in front of them!). But ultimately this game is much more than just a remix, it's a revolution.The graphics have been cranked up a notch yet again, with sparks, flames, glass shatters, crumpling metal, flying tires, big rigs losing their cargo, and cars doing the most amazing acrobatics you have ever seen. All this at incredible speed (looks like about 300 miles per hour to me!), silky-smooth framerate, and with perfect control. More than that, you the new Aftertouch effect allows you to put the car into bullet-time as soon as you crash (to make your car do wicked stunts, or hit other cars), as well as letting you precisely aim yourself in crash mode after hitting a ramp so that you hit right where you want to. And speaking of crash...You didn't think they would just leave the crash mode alone, did you? Now there are crash icons you need to collect (or avoid) which can half your score, double it, quadrouple it, give you bonus cash, increase your speed, or make you explode instantly. And since when you rack up a certain amount of cars crashing you can make your car explode with the push of a button, and gas tankers explode on high-speed contact... it is indeed possible to make your car explode three times in a single crash!I remember back when Need for Speed:Hot Pursuit 2 came out and everyone thought it was so great. It seems like garbage now compared to this game. That game had annoying bullet-time (too long, too often, poorly executed, and just plain irritating), this game has sweet bullet-time (unobtrusive, not too long, auto-steering when it happens, perfectly executed, and just plain cool). And while that game may have been fast and furious, this game is just...umm.... faster and furiouser.With all the multi-player modes and single-player modes and unlockables and world tour ect., you'd think this was the perfect racing game. Sadly though, this is not the case.The music soundtrack is quite frankly absolutely terrible. Ditto for the annoying annoucer. Thankfully, both can be turned off (and you can listen to whatever music you like). The interface for selecting music, however, is not as good as the previous Burnout. Also, the excellent cops and robbers aspect from Burnout 2 is gone as well. Just another reason to own all three Burnouts I'd say.If you love racing games, and especially if you liked the previous Burnouts, this one is a definite purchase.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2004"}

But Uncharted quickly became the household name of PS3 stable with slam bang, over-the-top Hollywood summer blockbuster-like action, big set pieces and impeccable pacing along with charming likeable protagonist Nathan Drake.Tomb Raider is a reboot and the origin story of Lara Croft from a long running franchise that combines action game with the elements of game such as puzzle solving and platforming, but in the past, the biggest asset of the series had always been none other than her voluptious phisical assets.  The series' popularity began to tumble as the series went on for 9 games and 2 rather bad movies, asthetically still stuck in the PS1 era as late as 2009 Underworld with one dimensional character and juvenile sexual innuendo, and was eventually dethroned by the new comers like Uncharted series.Uncharted expertly mixed and mashed the borrowed elements from Tomb Raider and made them its own, and became PS3 mega hit and one of the most popular game of this console generation; Pupil became teacher.Now the circle is complete.  Heavily influenced by Uncharted series, Lara Croft is back with a vengeance.((THE GAME))While Uncharted borrowed many elements from Tomb Raider series, Uncharted never resorted to directly copying and pasting, Tomb Raider seems a little too similar to Uncharted series.  Unmistakenly benchmarked Uncharted series both stylistically and  mechanically, and also reminiscent of Far Cry 3 in some ways.  Then again,  Lara is simply returning the favor.Uncharted has always been high on action and exuberant charm of Nathan Drake, but light on puzzle and platforming, semi-auto at that.  Tomb Raider still offers more puzzle-solving and manual platforming action of the past.  The puzzles are all environmental and on-hand tool-based.  The method you traverse implements 'Metroid-vania' style progress; you acquire new weapons and gears, and they will be used to reach areas that were inaccessible without them.But this time, Tomb Raider pumps up the volume in action department; it offers better gun play mechanic, proper stealth and melee combat than any entry in the series, and better than Uncharted series in some way.The strength of Tomb Raider also lies with expertly designed game world full of diverse style and location within the confinement of single island.  The Dragon's Triangle Island is not an open world like Far Cry 3, but more like Dark Souls, the whole island all interconnected.  You can freely traverse each area without restriction.  While the story is very focused and linear, the actual tomb raiding is aplenty and all optional and you can freely go back to them anytime you want to via various camp fire sites at which you also upgrade your weapons and skills.I very much love the fact that many developers started to make games that offers smaller and more focused but tightly constructed open world / open level design (games like Arkham City and Dark Souls to name a few) rather than giving you a huge empty world that stands as nothing more than the playground for mindless mayhem and destruction.  If you can't beat Skyrim in the amount of freedom and the size of the game contents department, this is definitely the way to go.Lara Croft is highly vulnerable and the new Tomb Raider plays like a realistic survival horror movie at times.  As you progress to earn xp and upgrade your various skills, you will become an expert killing machine.The story is well-paced and well-told.  But if you look for any trace of Lara Croft's past cool demeanor, charm and sex appeal, you will be sorely disappointed.CGI cutscenes look most natural and impressive yet shown in video games.  It is breathtakingly beautiful.  CGI cutscenes and games are pretty much seemless.  All the bells and whistles for PC-specific graphical options are available, and Tomb Raider is a looker even when you don't max out all the options.  Tomb Raider joins Crysis 3 as the true next generation graphics in 2013.  The next generation is definitely here in terms of graphical prowess.The game is also very long.  It took me well over 20 hours to complete the campaign without raiding any tomb and the majority of hidden treasures not found.  But I always take stealth method over run and gun method if given choice, the most of you will spend 12-15 hours for the campaign.  And if you enjoy searching for hidden items and collectibles, you got your hands full long after the main campaign is complete.((DOWNSIDES))The tone is disturbingly serious.  The raw violence unseen in any game can be quite brutal and jarring; not the violence itself (we've seen plenty of more violent games before) but the tone is very harsh, and it doesn't gel quite well with the Lara Croft we've known for a long time.While Lara and Roth, her mentor figure are very well-drawn, the minor characters are all one dimensional and honestly very annoying.  I wanted to end them all myself during my playthrough.The movement of Lara is too nimble (not to be confused with being agile), and that causes some unnecessary mistakes during close-up encounters with enemies.Tombs are all scaled down from the past Tomb Raider series, and those puzzles are also one and done to the treasure chest.Multi-players hasn't been well-received by the gamers so far, but I'm never a fan of multi-player, so I skip the review on it.((OUTRO))Despite being derivative of Uncharted, the new Tomb Raider is an exhilirating, pulse-pounding action adventure game that offers a long single player campaign with plenty of action, platforming, environmental puzzles and exploration.  It matches everything the best of Uncharted throws, minus magical super-charm of Nathan Drake, but with bigger game world, more contents and graphics to make Nathan Drake cry for mommy.  The new Tomb Raider is just as good as Uncharted in my opinion.So join the expedition.  If you loved Uncharted series and Far Cry 3, you will love the brand new adventure of newly shaped Lara Croft.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2013"}

Featuring a sophisticated physics engine, five fully controllable vehicles, a variety of unique natural environments, and Volition's proprietary Geo-Mod Technology, Red Faction is one of the most advanced second-generation titles ever released for the PlayStation 2. Geo-Mod technology supports the real time, arbitrary modification of the geometry that makes up the game's environment. This means that players have the full ability to destroy whatever they want. Just point a weapon at an object or structure and shoot -- total destruction always follows.","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"Pushing the limits of first-person shooters.","reviewText":"Red Faction is easily one of the most enjoyable PS2 games around, mainly because it doesn't hold conventional limits. In RF, if there is no door, you can make one by blowing up the wall. Find a locked door? No problem, if you have the firepower, you can &quot;unlock&quot; it. This is definitely a plus, considering that a locked door is never fun to be stuck with in a shooter.The setting for Red Faction is on Mars, hence the red scenery. You are joining a resistance army of renegade miners who want to rebel against the system. You quickly become part of the chaos, and the fun really begins. The enemies in RF are quite cumbersome, since they can duck behind walls, call for backup, and jump to avoid your firepower. The smart AI adds more challenge to RF. The weapons range from somple handguns, to rocket launchers, to plastic explosives. And they can be used for anything. Like I said, you clear your own path.The graphics are first rate, one of the best for a first-person shooter. Despite the sometimes murky environments, the visuals are crystal clear. The voice acting is a bit hokey at times, but it is not a central point in the game, like it was with shooters like &quot;Max Payne&quot;. The music is hardly memorable, but with the intense action, you are unlikely to notice.RF is a stellar game for the PS2, and one which fans of &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; would love. What I loved most was the limitless areas of destruction. Virtually anything can be blown up. The story is not very deep, and it has definitely been done before, but it has never been this much fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2002"}

I mean it ! It's virtually flawless. I didn't find anything that I didn't like in this game . Everything was just so perfect.Now the storyline in this game is based around greek mythology. You play as this really tough spartan warrior , Kratos, who is on a mission to go kill Ares, the god of war.The gods of Olympus have charged him with this task , and you must kill him before he destroys Athens. Kratos also wants to kill him out of revenge , but I won't tell why , because it will just spoil the game for you . The storyline also has lots of character development. Throughout the game , you will slowly be fed information about Kratos's past, and as time goes by , you will start to know more and more about him ,and understand why he wants revenge on the god of war.Now the gameplay itself is really good . You will fight tons of beasts from greek mythology, like medusas, centaurs, minotaurs, undead soldiers , satyrs , and more .the combat system is also great .You start the game with only one weapon , a pair of extendable swords , but as you progress , you will other things ,too. Besides getting another weapon , you will also get four different spells. Don't think that this is a small amount of weapons , because they will be enough throughout the whole game. You will also be able to upgrade them several times. The spells include things like medusa's gaze, which lets you use the head of medusa to turn your enemies to stone, and zeus's fury , which let's you shoot bolts of lightening from your hands. Also ,sometimes there are enemies in the game , that when you've hit them enough , you will be able to beat them using a minigame. This is really fun , and a great aspect of the game . for example , if you hit a minotaur enough , a circle will appear over his head(like the one on your controller). You will need to get close to him , press circle , and then , in order to defeat him , you will need to mash the circle button repeatedly in order to defeat him. And another enemy requires you to press certain buttons on your controller as they appear on screen. These things are awesome , and if you manage to pull them off, Kratos will pull off some really cool moves.The boss battles are also a great characteristic of this game . They're very fun and exciting .But the thing I liked most about this game is that it's not focused only about action . You do get to fight a lot , but there are also platforming sections and exploring sections. There are also some puzzles in this game. They can be pretty challenging . One puzzle sequence requires you to push a number of blocks a wall in a certain order , and it's pretty tough . Believe me , it's more challenging than it sounds. So don't listen to the people who say this is a hack and slash game .They are horribly wrong.However , let me just warn you that this game has LOTS of violence , blood and gore .There is also a bit of nudity here and there, and that's why this game is rated Muture. Because of this , some people might not like it , so I thought I should mention it .Overall this is the greatest game I've ever played. It's even a bit better than jak 3 , my most favorite game . You can even choose the difficulty level , ranging from easy to very hard , and there are lots of unlockables.Most of these can be unlocked only if you play the game a second time , so there's also some replay value. So if you don't mind tons of violence and a bit of nudity , do yourself a huge favor and buy this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2005"}

The only real problems I have with this game is the difficulty in switching weapons, and the somewhat wonky \"targeting slice\" mechanic but the problem with that may have been my old controller and not the game it's self, I'll update if I ever get a new controller or if Sony ever makes the PS3 backwards compatible for PS2 again. Another problem I had was the story mode, it's broken up into era's which is there way of not saying \"shows\" you play through a few missions of each shows particular ship in chronological order which of course means you have to start out with the craptacular NX-01 which was the biggest pain to command. I think it would have been better if they let you choose the era from the get go instead of making you play through them all just to get the Enterprise-E unlocked.

The controls are so cumbersome that I feel as though I'm driving a tank, let alone a 150 lb. character.  I'm not even going to mention the time it takes to control the faithful horse.

Among other things, the Dunia Engine delivers realistic, interactive environments, special effects, real-time night-and-day cycles, and smart enemy AI.Expansive, Realistic EnvironmentFar Cry 2 is set in a fictional region of Africa where you are caught between two rival factions at war. The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah. Wild animals such as zebras, buffalo, gazelle are encountered during the game, with both players and enemies allowed to interact with them.Far Cry 2 features an incredible level of detail and realism, with a minimal in-game interface to detract from immersion. For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game. To fulfill your mission, you need to play the enemies against each other, using both strategy and skill.Huge Range of Weapons and VehiclesFar Cry 2 offers gamers a wide range of weapons, from a machete for hand-to-hand combat, to a sniper rifle that can stealthily pluck off enemies from afar. As weapons disintegrate over time, they might jam or even explode in your hand.There are also a large range of vehicles such as gliders, trucks, cars, and boats that will let you fly, drive, slide, and hover over the open landscapes.Multiplayer Options for up to 16 PlayersFar Cry 2 supports up to 16 players and has four gameplay modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond, and Uprising. Players can choose from six different classes in multiplayer, each with its own set of pros and cons. Just as in the single-player mode, multiplayer games will feature dynamic elements, making each session unique.System RequirementsMinimumRecommendedOperating SystemMicrosoft Windows XP with Service Pack 2 or Windows VistaCPUIntel Pentium 4 3.2 GHz, Intel Pentium D 2.66 GHz, AMD Athlon 64 3500+ or betterIntel Core 2 Duo Family, AMD 64 X2 5200+, AMD Phenom or betterMemory1 GB2 GBHard Drive Space12 GB of free spaceGraphics HardwareNVidia 6800 or ATI X1650 or better; must support Pixel Shader 3.0Nidia 8600 GTS or better, ATI X1900 or better","reviewerName":"J.

Wright","summary":"Titanfail","reviewText":"This is probably one of the worst games I've ever played for $60. As a standalone multiplayer game, it's worth maybe $15-$20 as an Xbox Arcade digital download. Though, it's not exactly $60 in my case. It was $249 because I bought the collector's edition. Suffice it to say that the CE-included humongous lighted statue and book combination are both far and away more impressive (and well worth the money) than the actual game. Let's begin with what's wrong.RepetitiveOkay, okay. What game isn't repetitive? But, literally level after level after level is the same thing over and over and over. Other than the map changing, you're literally doing the same thing on each new level. There's no questing, no level ups, no strategy, no cover, no secrets, nothing to find.. I mean there is nothing. You're running around on a multiplayer map trying to avoid being constantly shot dead by the IMC (other live players). Titanfall is merely a death match wrapped around a weak semblence of a 'campaign' story.So, the gist is that you either play as the Soldiers (blue) or IMC (red). The sole point is to win the level or be defeated. After one of the two outcomes, you get to the evacuation ship or you don't. You get points for being evacuated or you don't. The only and sole point is to run around killing anything you can find that is not someone on your team... and avoid being killed.HUDThe HUD on this game just plain sucks. Unless you're close enough to actually be killed by another player, you can't tell if the player running around in the field is an enemy or a friendly. By the time you can get close enough to find out, your character is already being shot dead.ControlsThe movement is way way overly sensitive. Even on the least sensitive, you can literally spin in place with barely a tiny press of the stick. It's way way too sensitive even on the least sensitive threshold. So unrealistic.TitansAbout 2 minutes into each level, you can call for a Titan and it will fall from the sky. You can enter it and start your battle with your mech for as long as it survives (which is usually not longer than about 1-2 minutes). You then have to wait for another one to become ready (randomly between 60 seconds and never).By the time you get your titan, all of the other players on the level are now in their titans. So, the playing field is leveled, kind of. Meaning, you can't exactly run around squashing other players by stomping on them. So, the point in being in a titan is really pointless by the time you actually get it.Oh, and the animation to get into the Titan takes AGES to finish. It's like watching paint dry each time you enter a Titan.Yes, the Titan armor is a clever gimmick. When playing the Titan portion of tutorial, I got the impression that you'd actually be able to use all of the clever things included. Like, jumping out of your Titan, opening doors and then calling your Titan through the doorway to get back into it. Nope. No need for that feature. At least, not in the first 5 level ups. I'm guessing if that's to become useful, it must be in a much later level. I have no intention in waiting through this poor excuse for an expensive game to get to a level where I can actually find out. I really don't have that much interest. If this game is actually about Titans, then let us use them more than not. There are far too many multiplayer ground combat simulators already. We don't need another. If you're going to offer us the use of a Titan mech, then offer the use of it to us all of the time.Fun? No wayEvery level starts and ends the same. The only thing different is the map. Everyone gets their titan at the same time. No fun to be had in that. Basically, every level ends up a free for all death match scenario with a really weak story premise behind it just to get the level going.Worse, you can be playing the first level of the so-called 'Campaign' mode, but the game selects people who are level 42 and pairs them with people who are level 2. There's no fun in that either. If you're going to design a game where levels are important, then you should pair up people are within no more than 3-4 levels higher or lower than one another. Sorry, but this is single the biggest fail of Titanfail. When you design a multiplayer based game, you don't pair up players who are orders of magnitudes levels higher. That just doesn't work.Definitely not enough Titan mech time. These things are far too fragile and explode when someone sneezes.OverallThis game offers absolutely no single player campaign play. This is strictly a multiplayer game. Worse, this game is a weak multiplayer game wrapped in a pseudo-campaign mode that offers just enough of a premise to set itself up as a death match multiplayer game. Worse, there's nothing to do other than running around shooting everyone and everything in sight. There's no strategy, no questing, no dossiers, no audio files, no nothing to pick up around the level. Yes, it is eye candy, but that's it. If you really like just doing nothing but mindless death match and leveling up, there's nothing to see here.So far on the Xbone, there has been no bigger fail than Titanfail... unless you count Ryse.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2014"}

It's like buying a car, getting it home and when you try to turn it over it won't do nothing.

( ** NO SPOILERS ** )","reviewText":"\"Heavy Rain\" is a hard game to categorize by today's standards.  Certainly, it has roots in the old mouse-hunt, point-n-click, movie adventure games of years ago, like Sierra's \"Phantasmagoria\" or \"Gabriel Knight\" series, but it brings so much more to the table than that.  It's a murder mystery, an interactive movie, and a psychological thriller.  It's a very character driven story, and because you spend so much time with the main protagonist early on, you really do develop a bond with him and you truly want him to succeed.By now, if you are considering buying this game, you've probably read something about the game's unique control system.  If not, then all you need to know is that there isn't a standard control system to speak of, rather a cleverly-devised contextual button pressing system that changes from scene to scene.  It's easy to learn, but hard to master, especially on higher levels of difficulty.  This system succeeds in giving you, the player, an emotional investment in the game, because you don't know what button you are going to have to press next.  This system successfully builds tension into fight scenes and other 'thriller' moments, and will have you on the edge of your seat.  You don't dare put down that controller!There are four playable characters in the game, and you play all of them, individually, as their 'scenes' in the movie unfold.  How you play determines what happens next, with each of your decisions influencing the way the plot pans out.  Sometimes it's just a minor decision, but sometimes it's a major stumbling point, where doing the right thing is still a choice between the lesser of two evils.  That said, there really is no right or wrong way to play.  The game does not reward or penalize you for doing the 'right' or 'wrong' thing.  It simply adapts to you choices and unfolds accordingly.  In theory, this means that you and your friend can both play this game, and both come away with completely different experience.On a technical side, you can't look at \"Heavy Rain\" without thinking that the four main characters are works of computer art.  They are probably the most detailed and expressive computer characters created to date.  Facial expressions mimic the emotions happening in the scene, so it's very easy to see if the character is happy or upset, etc.  Holding L2 shows their thoughts swirling around them, giving the player visual (and verbal, when the corresponding button is pressed) insight into what they are thinking and feeling, and what to do next.  When they are anxious, these thoughts shake, which tends to makes them difficult to read at times.  In a few instances, while I was trying to read them, I must have taken too long because the game automatically picked one for me, and not necessarily the choice I would have made.  Other characters in the game, although still good looking, are a little rough around the edges.  Same can be said for some textures in the game (with all that rain, you'd expect more mud!).  Overall, the graphics are just superb.The accompanying musical score is hauntingly sad and appropriately moody.  Sound effects are spot on; lots of rain drumming down on various surfaces; rainwater running and dripping everywhere, as you might expect from the title.  The voice acting is good for the most part (ie: the main cast), but some of the incidental characters come off as bad portrayals of stereotypical characters.  Thankfully their appearances are limited.Although I have heard of some PS3s freezing while playing this game, I did not experience this, nor any framerate issues during my play through.  I did noticed a couple times the background textures taking an instant longer to load, but that was about all.  If you have your PS3 connected to the internet, the first thing you will do is download a patch, which I am sure helps with/fixes the reported console lock-up issue.  Overall, I thought the game ran very smooth, delivering a graphical masterpiece which showcases the technical prowess of the PS3.In conclusion: If you own a PS3, and you are looking to play something a little out of the norm, with masterfully stunning visuals, emotional attachment to the characters, unique control system, and a compelling multiple-ending story, then this is the game I recommend for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2010"}

I knew it was a story driven game and different from most games people played but that was about it.After getting my PS3 late I decided to scoop this title up and give it a try. Now the thing is that Heavy Rain isn't a game for everyone. It's not borderlands, it's not resident evil, it's pretty much a Movie with Quick Time Events and a \"choose your own path\" type of options that appear from time to time. The thing that makes this game amazing though is how well everything is just adapted into the story. It never feels like a game it just feels like your watching a movie, and a very good one at that. I couldn't take my hands off the game once I picked it up. It does stand as a mark in how far games have come. There is nudity and sex scenes, which I never thought I'd ever see in a game.Heavy Rain also has extremely gruesome and violent scenes that would fit in right with movies like SAW. The actors and animators did a very good job bringing the characters to life. That's mostly what the game is about, no super heroes, no super powers, no infinite lives or Health kits, just normal people trying to survive. The game has a very adult theme and this one isn't for kids at all.Gameplay wise I actually didn't care to much for the Quick Time events. It reminded me of Sega CD, and the worst parts of modern video games today. That's one of the lesser aspects of Heavy Rain as when you try to relax and enjoy the story all of a sudden you're thrown into events when you have to get up and start swinging the remote around and frantically pressing buttons on your controller in hopes you get the sequences right. I actually loathe this game play style because it doesn't exactly feel \"interactive\". That and the terrible character movement controls where you walk around holding down R2 and turning awkwardly as you try to find the Markers for hints and clues as of what to do next. This game by far has the worst controls I've played on since SEGA CD. Right up the alley with Sewer Shark.Overall there's not much to say about the game in other detail without spoiling it. The best advice I can say is that this is more of a Movie type of game where you feel like watching a movie but playing a game also. Heavy ran has great characters and a decent story with plot holes never to be explained. It's a good game that deserves 5/5 for the world the developers created as a backdrop to the story. The game truly is more of a movie than anything else and it really just happens to be a good one at that.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2012"}

I don't think so.","reviewText":"First off the first Dead Space was awesome, what a thrill ride.Second Dead Space 2 is also awesome, same thrill ride......only different......The Game Itself: 5 starsJust finished my first playthrough and I'm impressed, at first I kept on saying how much I liked the first one better. Then as I played on and it got a lot better, especially toward the end. These Necromorphs are relentless, I found DS2 to be more difficult then the original DS. Maybe it was the pace, I'm not sure, it's a little faster. But the overall game is longer.I like the new weapons, they work well, and the old ones are classic. I also set the crosshair setting to classic, because I hated the new way they have it, in fact I tried to make the controls as similar as I could to the original game.As for replay value, I'm going to play this over again, a couple more times.Overall 5 stars just like I would give the first DS, both are great and even better together, I'm happy about how this turned out.Multiplayer:It's ok, it will be fun for a bit, I hope they have DLC for it, some more game types are needed.--------------------------------------The Collectors edition contents: 3 StarsWARNING!!! As all others have said the replica Plasma Cutter is garbage, do not buy it for that, I'm ashamed to say I even own it. Plus when you put batteries in it, it's the dullest darn thing I have ever seen. Garbage total garbage.I feel bad for the PC and Xbox guys who got the Collectors Ed. Because they didn't get DS Extraction, sucks to be them I suppose. And I must stress Extraction is the only reason I bought this edition, and then I was very angry to find Extraction on PSN the same day as DS2 came out. I would have just bought the regular version and Extraction on PSN if I had known better. My fault I was dumb and didn't check before buying.You get a soundtrack, that's neat until you realize you could have just downloaded it onlineAlso a \"Rare\" lithograph of a Necromorph, that's pointless, you only get one, maybe a set of 3 or 4, that would have been cool.And you get a nice little box to put it all in, I would be disappointed in this edition if it had not been for Extraction.Plus there is some DLC a kick @sss suit and a couple weapons.

{"product_name":"B00BQI3UQG","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Going Bananas In 3D","reviewText":"\"Donkey Kong Country Returns\" was, in many ways, a benchmark for what a modern platformer ought to be. Inventive, fun, and infuriating in equal doses, and packed with replay value to boot. That being said, there were some notable issues that held it back from being as great as its predecessors; namely, the shoehorned inclusion of motion controls, and an unforgiving difficulty that new players might not appreciate. But like usual, Nintendo has heard the complaints, and decided to give it a second shot. Enter \"DKCR 3D\", a large improvement over the first version, and one of the must-haves for the 3DS, as well as for 2013.The story isn't really integral to the entire experience, but it's worth recapping. There are strange creatures disturbing the wildlife of DK and Diddy Kong's habitat, ones that are shaped like instruments that lull animals into a trance. This is bad enough, but the most egregious error they made was to start stealing all of the island's bananas for some nefarious reason. Cue the dynamic ape duo to barrel in (erm, no pun intended) and start jumping and rolling their way to the root of this madness.As you know by now, this is a 2D platformer game, like a majority of the past DK entries. You'll platform your way through eight worlds (plus a hidden ninth one exclusive to this version), each with a varying amount of levels. There are jungles, mines, pirate ships, and other fun worlds to explore, each with alternate paths and an unfathomable amount of hidden content. One playthrough is simply not enough to get the most out of this game, and it's one of the rare experiences that is truly worth seeking out the secrets for. It's a difficult feat to make finding seemingly trivial tokens in odd places seem worthwhile, but Retro somehow managed to pull it off.Now, if you've played a game in the Country series, then you already know about the difficulty. If you haven't, though, then it's important to note that this is a seriously unforgiving experience. Precision is of the utmost importance, and the challenge gets ratcheted up quite quickly. Once you hit the fourth world, the game will reward caution and punish confidence; after this point, there is positively no room for error, and you will die several times before getting even a tad bit farther along. That being said, there is a \"New Mode\" that lightens the load a bit, and gives you extra life. But masochists like myself can still enjoy the game with its original difficulty intact. Well... \"enjoy\" is a relative term in this case.The difficulty is definitely eased in this version, in any case, because of the finely tuned controls. Waggling the Wii remote is a thing of the past; ground-pounding and grabbing have been remapped to the X/Y and R/L buttons, respectively. It's shocking how much of a difference this makes. Levels that made blind with anger in the original version are now significantly more easy to get through. Furthermore, this new layout allows players to focus on tight, accurate platforming as opposed to finagling with motion controls issues. As a longtime fan of the series, it makes me happy to see Nintendo understanding that the precision of the games is what made many people fall in love with it.Another thing that defines the series is its soundtrack (originally done by David Wise, who is now held captive at Microsoft... god rest his soul), and DKCR definitely has one of the best. A large team of composers retooled classic melodies from the series, as well as adding some new tunes of their owns. This results in one of the most absolutely astonishing soundtracks in a game today, covering a variety of styles and soundscapes. From cheerful to eerie to exciting, the evocative score is positively delightful, and cannot be praised enough.Nor can the fantastic environments, each with their own unique flavor and gameplay element. But while the aforementioned variety of these is impressive, what is truly astonishing is how good they look on the 3DS. Despite the barely noticeable drop in framerate and texture detail, everything here looks crisp and vibrant. Almost no significant graphical adjustments have been made, which makes for one of the most beautiful games on Nintendo's handheld. Extra points should be awarded for the impressive 3D effects, which really add a great deal of depth to the levels, moreso than in any other game.This year, only a few games have captivated me, but only one (\"Tomb Raider\") has done so like this. \"Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D\" is not only the best version of the game, but one of Nintendo's finest achievements. Punishing and rewarding, fun and frustrating, this wonderful adventure is full of content that will last you for ages. This is not only one of the best 3DS or Nintendo games, but one of the best games of 2013... and perhaps of all time, just like the pedigree to which it belongs.Full of heart, fun, and creativity, Nintendo and Retro's adventure is about as perfect as a game can get.Plot: N/AGameplay: 10Graphics: 10Sound: 10Overall: 10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2013"}

I had to charge it 1st but after that connecting it to my PS3 it was easy and connecting it to my phone was even easier.  One gripe with was I could not get it to sync using the usb cable so I had to use discovery mode so I am missing a few features like battery life and stuff like that.  I will probably figure that out later once I get the hang of using bluetooth since this is my 1st headset with bluetooth.  Even though it was my 1st time using a bluetooth headset I was very happy with how simple it was.  When I use it as a headset for my phone people dont even know I am not using a headset since the quality is so good.  The audio quality of the ear piece is very nice as well with no gripes about it.  I like the way the its setup as well with volume up on top and down on the bottom.  Answering calls is a simple task a well with just a tap of the button on the side.Overall my major gripe is its not very comfortable and my ears are kinda big so no matter how I adjusted it on either of my ears it would get uncomfortable after awhile.  I could never get the headset to feel snug.  I think most people agree with the fact that it does get uncomfortable after awhile though.I have yet to use it on Playstation Network and I will edit this review later when I have but I have heard it works pretty good.  Since I am new to this I wonder how easy it will be.  I am waiting for Resistance 2 to try it out.Update:I got on PSN recently and I found that after about an hour the headset felt like it was cutting the inside of my right ear.  I guess its b/c the headset goes in the ear instead of on it.  I hear these things are like that for some people so I switched ears and it wasn't so bad but I hear more bass like sounds in my left ear which is my problem not the sets.  Worked very well playing on PSN and everyone could hear me fine and vice versa.  I wish it felt more snug against my ear but its kinda loose b/c my ears are big.  Its pretty easy to use and you know onscreen whether its mute or not and plus it beeps in your ear.  Just like with XBOX live you have to look for mics b/c not everyone uses them and some people are plain annoying as I am sure everyone knows.

It was good for a while, but then I started getting problems with charging the battery. I charged the battery in full and then after a couple hours my controller would start flashing indicating there was only a couple of hours left of play time. When infact a full charge is close to 24 hours playing time. I also started to get fustrated with all the wires especially since I was using wireless controllers. So if you dont like the wires and have tried the play and charge kit and dont like it then the quick charge kit is for you. It takes only 2 hours to charge a fully depleated battery compared the play and charge which takes close 6 hours. Also you can charge two batteries at one time which takes about 4 hours. Another plus is that you dont have to use a usb device like your computer or xbox 360 to charge your battery. You can plug the charger into a regular power outlet. The play and charge kit was fine in the begginning when there wasnt any other option, but now that the quick charge kit is out its a no brainer that the quick charge is the right choice.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2007"}
{"product_name":"B006YDPU48","description":"","reviewerName":"Neoncloudff","summary":"Go Beyond Death (And Have Fun The Entire Way)","reviewText":"Sequel to the widely acclaimed Dark Souls and finale to the &#34;Souls&#34; trilogy, Dark Souls 2 puts sword and shield (or sorcery, or hammer, or axe...) into your hands once again in hopes that you can triumph death and despair in this RPG by FromSoftware. Bigger, meaner, and more epic than either of its predecessors Dark Souls 2 represents a stunning achievement in design and execution. It welcomes new players with a friendlier tutorial and improved mechanics, but veterans of the Souls series need not be worried. Dark Souls 2 is brutal and challenging, testing you every step of the way with tough bosses and overwhelming odds. But Dark Souls 2 is also beautiful and stunning, featuring a world that is well worth exploring every nook and cranny, from dark and dead pits to harrowing civilizations long lost in time above the clouds. Dark Souls 2 is nothing short of a masterpiece, through and through.Story, Presentation, and World &#8211; 10/10/10 &#8211; 10The story of Dark Souls 2 is a fantastical tale of kingdoms lost in time, ruled by monsters and hostile forces ready to challenge the player. Similar to the previous games, Dark Souls 2 is a mildly minimalistic game in terms of delivering information; the player must explore and discover most of the world himself or herself. It&#8217;s an impressive story and world, with a staggering amount of thought behind its deep lore and characters. It&#8217;s a world filled with mystery, where the player&#8217;s imagination is key to understanding and connecting the loose ties between characters and their place in Drangleic. And I&#8217;m sure the ending will be something discussed by Souls fans for years to come.Dark Souls 2 also features a significant upgrade in presentation values. Things are cleaner, nuanced elements in character building are more clear and menus are designed with a greater emphasis on ease of use. It&#8217;s all still very much like the previous games, just refined and improved to perfection.Graphics and Art Direction &#8211; 9/10 &#8211; 9.5The world of Drangleic is an epic land ripe for exploration. Half of this experience, though, is the staggeringly huge variety of places you&#8217;ll visit while on your quest. Decrepit crypts, castles in the sky, and even the garbage bin of Drangleic itself, the art direction for Dark Souls 2 continues the FromSoftware&#8217;s creative trend in developing horrendous creatures and placing them in a fascinating world. There are tons of unique bosses and enemies out for your hollow head, and each and every one is animated with a certain professionalism only a Japanese studio could produce. Along with these disturbing denizens of Drangleic, the places you&#8217;ll visit are equally impressive; not simply because of their design but also the character, increased color pallet and pure imagination every new area brings. To say that Dark Souls 2&#8217;s art direction is great would be a crime; it is simply stunning, and is one of a kind.Graphically, Dark Souls 2 is superior to its predecessors in many ways. You&#8217;ll be happy to know that the game runs at a steady 30 FPS throughout (PS3) to 60 FPS (360 version is more consistently smoother, PS3 does hit 60 FPS in enclosed and small areas) and technically performs without a hitch. The big improvement here is the animations, which have benefited immensely from being motion captured. Elements of your character react with realism, and enemies feel lifelike and move like they should. The improved lighting engine creates a surprising sense of immersion (although is not the lighting engine we were advertised last year), and the improved physics engine is icing on the cake (character&#8217;s armor, such as loincloths and hoods flow in the wind and react realistically). Grainy textures and anti-aliasing problems do occur more often than I would&#8217;ve like to see (and are simply limitations of the Xbox 360 and PS3). The dumbed down lighting engine is a disappointment as well as the grainy textures and various visual hiccups, making a next gen version of Dark Souls 2 all the more tantalizing.Gameplay and Design &#8211; 10/10 &#8211; 10Where as Demon&#8217;s Souls introduced us to the impossibly challenging difficulty the series is known for and Dark Souls improved the online and flow of combat, Dark Souls 2 has perfected what the series is known for. Tight and claustrophobic combat headlines the game, while rewarding exploration, online PvP, summoning and aiding other players are all improved. Dark Souls 2 continues the trend of &#8220;endless tactics&#8221; with the numerous amount of weapons, which all feel distinct and fun to use. Everything has been improved, refined, and polished. The classic gameplay is still as challenging as ever, too. Fears of Dark Souls 2 dumbing down the difficulty and level of challenge have gone completely unwarranted. If anything, this may be the most challenging of all the Souls games, but also the most fair. Yes, you&#8217;ll die, get punished because of it, and lose your souls (which can be retrieved within the next life) and your human status, if you&#8217;re human. But Dark Souls 2, unlike its previous entries, clearly explains the effects of items, materials, and penalties. You die because you&#8217;re unfamiliar with a boss, area, or unique enemy tactic. You only come back stronger, more aware of the dangers you will face and more capable to tackle them quicker with more precision. Of the 245 times I died through my play-through, I rarely felt cheated. Only a few times (fighting optional bosses and online PvP) did I feel this way.In terms of design, Dark Souls 2 is built with the player in mind. Beginning the adventure is tough, as is every video game. Healing items are rare in the beginning, and the Estus Flask only offers a swig at first. But as you explore this hostile and beautiful world, you&#8217;ll be rewarded with new and better armors, lifegems, status ailment healers, new weapons and sometimes the rare shards to improve the Estus Flask. Exploration doesn&#8217;t get more rewarding than this. Dark Souls 2 also offers a huge collection of memorable boss battles; everything from quick thinking to pure dodging skill is required throughout the many, many bosses that stand in your way. And you will take them all out, I believe in you! Dark Souls 2 is rewarding every step of the way; from it&#8217;s improved, tighter combat, intricate level design and unique character building this is an RPG that sacrifices nothing it&#8217;s famous for, but rather embraces its flaws and only improves upon them.Sound Design and Soundtrack &#8211; 9/10 &#8211; 9.5Dark Souls 2 will immerse you in more ways than one, and that&#8217;s mainly because of it&#8217;s subtle sound design. Some say the best sound design is one that you don&#8217;t even notice; Dark Souls 2 is accomplished in this aspect. Swords will clash and spells will be cast, and they all sound great. The ambience while exploring each area really shines brightly as well. From creepy distant cackles to hollow and decrepit crypts, everything sounds as it should. Voice acting, a small part of all the Souls games, has been improved and expanded here and it is all delivered very well.Dark Souls 2 features, hands down, the best score for any of the Souls games. Each boss fight has it&#8217;s own unique theme, memorable and musical enough to listen to outside the game. The tragic and intense orchestration and score really highlights each boss fight, making each an assault on the senses and emotions (and the emotional depth of the soundtrack itself is stunning). And don&#8217;t worry, the classic finale aria is beautiful and thoroughly composed with a purpose. Mr. Motoi Sakruaba, take a bow.Lasting Appeal &#8211; 10Unlike previous Souls games, once the credits roll there is still more to do. An altered new game plus allows people to continue to explore past the credits which is excellent for those who want to continue their adventure and clear optional areas. The game does have the classic new game plus, though, in which you do less damage while enemies do more. There are multiple new challenges that await players in new game plus, all of which require new tactics and skills. Aside from that, players can re-spec their characters to try different builds, join and work through multiple covenants, beat optional bosses and work your way through PvP. Dark Souls 2 offers a lot to do post-credits.Final Score - 10/10Dark Souls 2 took me just about 52 hours to complete (final time - 51:50) and I died 245 times. Oddly enough, though, every minute within this world was incredible. Drangleic is a gorgeous and oddly inviting world to explore, and your adventure will take you to the far corners of this hostile place, fighting off monsters and battling players along the way. It was an immensely satisfying and enjoyable game, and most of all it felt incredibly fair the entire way through. It is not only one of the best games I have ever played, but it gives reasons for video games to exist. Only in video games can you receive the same sense of exploration and discovery that Dark Souls 2 offers, and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s such a grand masterpiece and a testament to video games as a medium.(average = 9.8, rounding to 10 based on 20 point scale)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2014"}

The Empire has set its sights on invading a small neutral country called Gallia, which is situated in the middle of the two great empires.

With this new discovery, the fate of the Federation&#xBF;s ability to win the war and a hope for a better future hangs in the balance.","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Strategy RPG plus hardcore military","reviewText":"\"Valkyria Chronicles\" is a fairly unorthodox game - it's got the art and general handling of \"Final Fantasy Tactics\" combined with the military tactics of \"Full Spectrum Warrior\". Possessing the feeling of an RPG despite taking place during WW2 (or a fantasy representation of it, more accurately), Valkyria Chronicles represents an exciting new game that should be liked by both strategy-RPG fans and the more hardcore military crowd.The game takes place in \"Europa\" - a fantastic version of Europe, where the two dominant countries are the Federation (to the West) and the Empire (to the East). Caught between these is Gallia, a small independent nation rich with Ragnite, the world's fictional power source. The player takes the role of Lieutenant Gunther, the leader of a 20-person unit of militiamen raised to repel an invasion by the Empire.To that end, the player must manage their squad of soldiers and drive back the enemy. From a pool of 50 soldiers (though most have to be unlocked by progressing in the game) the player selects 20 to serve as the active squad. Soldiers can come in one of five types. Scouts are light and fast, but are lightly armored and don't do much damage. Shock Troopers are more heavily armored and armed with machine guns, but are slower than scouts. Lancers are anti-tank troops armed with heavy rocket-tipped lances; they are the most heavily armored, but are only useful when dealing with enemy vehicles. Engineers are armed and armored like scouts, but trade the movement speed of that class for the ability to pass ammo out to comrades, disarm mines, and repair friendly tanks. Finally, Snipers have long-range capabilities and can take out an enemy in one hit if they're lucky, but have slow movement and low defense.Besides their classes, each of the 50 unique characters has their own set of traits that affect their stats in battle. Character traits can reflect everything from upbringing (characters are more at home in their home turf) to sexual preference (some characters prefer to be around lots of women or lots of men) to more individualized personal effects (like a character who gets a huge attack bonus for charging headlong into the enemy's guns, or a character who gets a bonus just by being around tanks). In addition to these traits, characters also have bonds with certain other characters, and will do better when around those characters. Finally, there are certain stats (accuracy, damage, movement) that differ from character to character - but the stats themselves aren't recorded, so the player has to find out for themselves which characters have which statistics.The characters' personalities are revealed through combat - use a character a lot and a newspaper reporter will conduct an interview (off-camera) that puts more information in their biography. This also adds new traits to their character, as well as background information. In addition, each character has unique voice acting, and they will often call out to characters that they have bonds with. All the characters are really fleshed out by their traits and biographies, and it becomes fairly easy to find at least a few favorites that you're likely to use over and over.The gameplay itself is a sort of hybrid between turn-based strategy RPGs and tactical squad games like Full Spectrum Warrior. During a mission, the player usually has 9 soldiers (selected by the player) plus a command tank. At the beginning of every turn, the player has a certain number of command points; these are used to take actions with characters. While using a command point, a character can move a set distance (based on their class) and take one action - either attacking or healing themselves/a nearby ally. Complicating this is Intercepting Attacks: if a character runs into the line of sight of an enemy unit, that unit will fire at him as he moves past. The same is true for the enemy, of course, so it's advisable to set up a position where you will be well defended and where you can counterattack enemies easily as they enter the area. Due to the cone-like nature of weapons fire, using cover is advisable and helpful.Besides infantry combat, the other main part of warfare in Valkyria is tanks. Your side only has one tank, which is upgradable throughout the game. The enemy, on the other hand, tends to have a few more at their disposal, necessitating the use of anti-tank Lancers. Tanks, when hit from the front, may take a while to destroy, but if a character can sneak around the back of the tank and hit its exposed radiator, the tank can be taken down easily. Tanks are very powerful (being equipped with an armor piercing cannon, an explosive mortar, and a coaxial machine gun) but cost 2 command points to take a turn, rather than just 1.Leveling up and advancement is handled fairly simply, compared to a lot of similar strategy-RPGs. At the end of a battle, the player receives gold and experience based on their performance. Gold is used to develop new weapons and armor for your characters. A certain amount of gold is spent to upgrade a specific category (rifles, for example), and all soldiers who use rifles are armed with the upgraded rifle. These weapons are standard issue once developed, and the only customization comes when the development paths split into certain specializations (higher accuracy, higher damage, etc). In this case, you can choose for individual soldiers which weapon they should have. Leveling up works similarly - you invest experience in a class, and once you've spent enough that class levels up. This means that EVERYONE who is a member of that class levels up, regardless of whether or not they're currently in your squad, which means that there's no trouble with one unit getting way ahead of the others in experience terms.I only had a few problems with gameplay. One is that speed is emphasized heavily - not just as a nice bonus, in most cases, but as the major source of experience and money. Completing a mission quickly is worth far more than any points you might get for doing things during the mission, which on the one hand works for players who are willing to take risks and rush in, but discourages players who are more cautious and defensive. Another issue with gameplay is that the levels tend to focus more on particular objectives or gimmicks rather than straight-up warfare; almost every level has your squad being split up, or some other condition that makes it harder than simply using regular tactics. Both of these things make the game less fun, and even in Skirmish mode (missions that can be played an infinite number of times to get more money and experience) they pervade the atmosphere of the game.The graphics are incredible - not just in quality, but in style, as well. The game uses a unique colored-pencil style of in-game coloration, so everything has a very artistic feel to it. Some effects - like a tank's movement or an explosion - are represented by sound effects (like \"vrrm\" or \"kaboom\") popping up on-screen, which also serves to give it an \"illustrated\" appearance. The character designs are well-done, while still having a realistic aspect to them and a sort of group appearance emphasized by their standard-issue uniforms. The game in-action is really neat to watch, and the new approach to graphics is appreciated.The sound is decent enough - the English voice acting is well-done, and as mentioned each character has a unique voice and a wide variety of prompts and lines. The music is good, but ultimately forgettable; it serves its purpose as background noise, but isn't particularly enjoyable on its own.As a whole, Valkyria Chronicles is an amazing game that tends to get caught up too much in story and gimmicks. The engine is solid and fun, and the game in basic terms is great. However, the way it's used - the reliance on objectives and unusual gameplay situations - reduces the enjoyment of the system. In addition, the lack of multiplayer is a major annoyance. All-in-all, Valkyria Chronicles is a great game that also feels like a waste, in terms of what is done with the gameplay.8/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2009"}

AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

I just purchased it again a few weeks ago since I want to give my old copy to a cousin and got in the mood of playing it again. It may not rival the shooters out now, but it's a unique game, and it even got good reviews. If you're not convinced, watch some walkthrough videos on youtube and it might help with your decision.As people should know this game is meant to be scary, and during the first play-through it is. It's full of surprises.If you like guns and shooting let me just tell you that there are plenty of different weapons you can have fun with in this game. Each with their own unique touch of coarse.As the story progresses, you come across new types of enemies and levels which really bring interest and make you feel like you're getting somewhere and are soon going to encounter something big. As the levels pass, the evils increase.So far I have not played any game like it. It still remains different from anything else out there, well, at least until another doom comes out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2011"}

One month into my ownership, the DVD drive broke.  I took it back to the store for exchange.  A year and a half later, the video broke.  I sent it to Microsoft for repair for a fee and lost all my licenses in the process (I got them restored after many hassles).  Three years into my ownership, it died - of the dreaded RRoD.  I thought of moving to another platform, but I didn't because I owned too many Xbox 360 games - I was stuck.  My point is that the old Xbox 360 Pro had been very unreliable.  I am happy to report that there has been no issue with my new Xbox 360 250 GB console since I purchased it on September last year.  It has been very reliable so far.  It is smaller and much quieter than the Pro.  The only two buttons, an ON-OFF button and the tray OPEN-CLOSE button, are touch-sensitive, so much so that sometimes I opened the DVD drive tray accidentally in the middle of the game.

Your console has depth and so does this case! Nintendo call it a 'Transporter Case' and that's an apt name. I really don't see this being employed as a regular case that you'd use to take your 3DS to show off next door with; it's more suited to long distance travel protection.Construction is sturdy and there's two main compartments each with their own zipper. The larger compartment holds your hand-held in furry pouch with internal velcro 'seat belt' and several loops for stylus, wires etc. This compartment has a clever vinyl webbing in the lower corners which prevents everything from falling out of the sides the moment you open it. The other has a matrix of slots for the game cartridges plus there's also a front pouch for everything else such as game manuals.This is clearly a well designed monster of a case. The 3DS isn't cheap but it is fragile and I'd highly recommend this case to protect it with ease, especially on flights where it might get chucked about in the luggage hold.

This is particularly true for Project Zero / Fatal Frame cos the whole novelty of the Camera Obscura should have worn out by now. It won't be an easy job to keep players to continue with the series if Tecmo can't make it interesting. However, Tecmo once again did a brilliant job with third game in the series.For people new to the series, it is a survival horror using a camera as your only weapon to survive the nights. As a result the adventure is split between first and third person view. You explore in the third person view but battle in the first person view. The control seems clumsy at the beginning but once you understand the logic then it is very intuitive. The camera functions are more or less the same with the last two games but this time round the difference made is instead of playing as one character, you play as 3 different character using the same yet different cameras. As a result when the story force you as another character, you have to readjust the skills, reaction time and the abilities of the cameras. Upgrade points are shared among all 3 characters, which makes decisions for upgrading a very strategic part of the game. Since the battles are in first person view you will need to switch between the two views regularly as though you can move around in the first person view, ghosts don't just stay inside your frame for you. This could be annoying when it comes to really fast ghost that even come up from the ground.Story wise, it closely ties into the first two games and even one of the characters is from the first game. So when you play as her you feel like you relive the first game's nightmare while at the same time new uncertainties comes in. The familiarity factor works really well, though it resembles the tactic used in Eternal Darkness on the GameCube. Also the story in this game further explained certain things in the first and the second game, making the play through more rewarding as you will want feel like \"wow it's because of this that things happened in the first and second games were like that!\" It's a cleverly written plot.Some of the cut scenes are brilliantly done and can give you shock from time to time. Even subtle things happened in the game and the appearance of enemies can make you shiver too. It's a game best played with lights off to feel the tension. The vibration function works really well as whenever the controller vibrates, you have to think whether it's an enemy or just an event to record. That puts further tension in the gameplay.In all, Project Zero 3 / Fatal Frame 3 is a game well worth to check out and spend your time on. You will find finishing the game very rewarding and satisfying.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2005"}

Martin","summary":"Highly Disappointing.","reviewText":"This game seems to consist of ~60 hours of wandering around large open areas while being unable to carry much of any of the loot you pick up on these absurdly lengthy journeys you need to go on to find any of the locations before you can 'fast travel' to them. This is what Fallout 3 fans might call 'exploring.' I.e. wandering around deserted subway tunnels, wide open desolate areas, etc - sparsely populated with the same 3-5 kinds of 'bad guys,' slowly accumulating resources, leveling up your character, and getting better and better weapons.Often this 'exploration' takes place at the behest of a handful of other completely uninteresting NPC characters in the name of furthering their oh-so-interesting goals such as... writing a book. Wow, tell me more! Sounds exciting already, doesn't it? Such Earth-shatteringly fascinating plots give me goosebumps on a regular basis. I just can't wait to think about them some more!I would never have imagined a post-apocalyptic nuclear role playing game could be so thoroughly boring. After being errand boy for boring NPCs in order to achieve what were typically boring quest objectives, ferreting through garbage to find valuables to sell, wandering through mazes of tunnels to nowhere trying to complete these boring quests, and shooting the same 2-5 types of \"bad guys\" that sparsely populate an enormous wasteland for about ~60 hours, I've had enough.I stuck with the game this long (to the conclusion) because I had naively hoped that the sci-fi themed artistic appeal of the box and game art would translate into the game having a thoughtful and well-developed storyline, and that if I just kept at it a while longer a thought-provoking overarching story would present itself to make things more interesting, as is the case with most decent games.Having stuck with it this long and discovering that there was actually not too much more to discover in \"the wasteland\" as it's called, I wish I could get all those hours of my life back so I could play something more interesting and exciting that actually has a cohesive and interesting overarching story/plot, such as one of the Mass Effect games.In terms of game performance, there is some good and bad news. On the positive side of things, the game has great controller support for the 360 controller for Windows and appears to have run well enough on my 1920x1200 resolution HD monitor. Unfortunately, it is also plagued with an unusually high rate of game crashing relative to other games of the last 5 years or so. Updating my drivers helped substantially, but there were still some areas of the game that were highly unstable for me. If you don't update your drivers, the game runs worse than Bioshock. With a driver update, the game runs more or less similarly well, which really doesn't speak well for it.Fallout 3 seems to lack a powerful, cohesive, overarching story/plot. I felt like it was an interesting game at first with some great sci-fi appeal, but that it never really ran with this and used it to tell much of a story. In place of having a decent story/plot to follow, the game is populated with repetitive combat and exploration that, in the absence of a quality story, lacks meaning and quickly becomes dull. Overall, this is probably a good game to skip, unless you're a die-hard RPG-shooter fan. Even if that's the case, there are many other games such as Mass Effect which have similar qualities along with a superior story.-------EDIT (And Possible SPOILERS)... SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS FOR FALLOUT 3-------1) Shrink the world.-Don't put so much empty space between quest objectives. You just shouldn't need to spend so much time going from point A to point B for mundane reasons, and waste time killing the same basic types of bad guys you've been killing the last 10 hours or so. There's only so many times you can shoot Radscorpions before it starts getting boring/tedious.2) Add more story-driven content.-Much of the game's combat would be more interesting if there was a greater purpose to it than simply running to the next area (city) you are going to. Including more content associated with important plot-related factions like the Brotherhood or the Enclave would be a good start, as I detail in #4 of this list.3) Add more cities, and city-related content.-Cities are really the most interesting aspect of gameplay, because the wasteland is... a wasteland. It's a big, relatively empty area filled with copy-pasted burning houses you generally can't interact with... and the same basic 3-5 types of bad guys spread across like 20 miles of game area. The wasteland needs to have more variability, or else it gets boring. Cities have variability, and that's why they're more interesting. Therefore, either include more cities per in-game square kilometer, or improve the variability and interactivity of the wasteland to make things more interesting.4) Allow the player to interact more with the Brotherhood of Steel and the Enclave in various ways, and increase the overall presence of these (and other similar) game factions.-When I first started the game, I happened across an Enclave or Brotherhood trooper marching along with a robot on some deserted road. Immediately, seeing the advanced technologies of his armor and energy weaponry, I was like \"OH YEAH, NOW THINGS GET INTERESTING! A GAME FACTION!\" Unfortunately for me, I had about 20 more hours of shooting raiders and supermutants before I would get to hear anything particularly interesting about the Enclave or the Brotherhood. When the game finally got more in depth about what these factions were, they didn't really do much of anything with it... I feel like there should have been more depth to the story they give you than was given, and it should have been a more story-content rich experience. I want to see less day-to-day badguysbetweencities combat content, and more STORY-RELATED engagements in the game, particularly involving FACTIONS. Fallout 3 has an interesting universe and could have done interesting things with it to craft more detailed subplots between factions, but in my view they stopped short ... choosing to fill the game with unrelated filler content and boring travel/exploration time instead.6) Improve VATS Combat System Speed.-VATS is nice because it enables you to play a game like an FPS even when you're at a disadvantage due to using a 360 controller rather than a mouse. The problem is that VATS is way too slow, and sometimes the camera angle or whatever screws up so you don't even get to see what you're shooting at get shot, despite hearing the gunshots while in VATS. They should have an OPTION to just get rid of the slow-motion aspect of VATS, and should also fix the bugs that occur when the camera doesn't give you sight of what you're shooting at in VATS while you're shooting at it.7) As part of increasing faction activity, and city/town-related activity, make cities 'change' with the in-game world.-It often seems like Fallout 3 is caught in a time-bubble where things never change and time has slowed or stopped. This is because cities which are frequently visited never change. When you go back to a certain area, such as Bigtown, the townsfolk there are always walking around in the same scripted walking patterns, they never seem to acquire much of any new weapons, technology, armor, or armaments/defenses, and their population always seems to stay static, never varying, despite the dangers of nearby slavers and super mutants and the passage of in-game time. This problem becomes particularly irritating with longer games.  The solution isn't particularly complicated... just make these areas and their inhabitants more variable. Maybe the guard watching the bridge should get a new weapon now and then, or a new suit of armor he gets from a dead slaver. Maybe the town residents will learn to reprogram some security robots from a nearby factory for town defense. Maybe they'll improve the fortifications. Maybe they'll acquire new citizens. Maybe they'll build some new buildings. Maybe with these changes, more merchants will choose to settle in the area. Maybe we should be able to donate weapons to the citizens. Maybe more supermutant and or slaver raiding parties should be raiding at random intervals to add more variety and make things more generally interesting. In any case, across the span of a full ~60 hour playthrough of Fallout 3, they should be doing SOMETHING more than what they are doing (which is essentially nothing as things currently are).8) Add more faction involvement (and thus variety and story-related content) to random encounters.-Raider interaction in particular seems very predictable. They ALWAYS attack on sight, regardless of whether you're sporting a tough, shiny suit of power armor, and one of those laser-miniguns. Perhaps instead, some raiders would use their brains, and realize that they will get completely slaughtered... and decide to interact with the player in non-combat roles - or do things in a more organized fashion with greater numbers of raiders to make things more interesting. Maybe they could instead make a demand of you for some valuables like highwaymen instead of simply ALWAYS attacking like mindless zombies, regardless of any situational factors.9) VEHICLES!-There are HUGE amounts of vehicles spread across the wasteland. Why not allow the player to interact more with them? Who knows, some might even be in decent working condition, or be repairable. Maybe you could strike a deal with a FACTION like the Enclave to purchase some transportation, when your character reaches a certain level? This would also help cut down on boring travel-time between cities and mindlessly repetitive encounters with super-mutants. I know I for one would be interested in getting my hands on some nice pieces of aviation technology of the Fallout universe :).10) Greater variety in random encounters.-There should be more than 5-6 basic types of bad guys in the game. The wasteland might be less boring if I could expect some random encounters from things other than ghouls, supermutants, radroaches, radscorpions, etc. It might also be more interesting if some of these random encounters had greater variability - like instead of randomly spotting a supermutant, maybe instead I'd get ambushed by a TRIBE of supermutants, given I'm of an appropriate level to engage such threats.11) Do something with the new factions introduced with Mothership Zeta. Not going to say anything more due to spoiler concerns, but only saying that it'd be nice to see more game content involving this faction.Let me also add, in retrospect when I consider my original review many months later, Fallout 3 had some interesting game content ideas, and I felt like they could have done some interesting things with this universe in terms of a story and plot, but I felt like they just didn't do enough of that, and furthermore that what was there fell a little bit short.That said, what IS there IS pretty interesting (the Enclave, the Brotherhood, \"the Institute,\" the Commonwealth, etc), and is not 2-star game content. I wish they'd have fleshed out the story-oriented aspects of the game a bit more so I could give this game a more solid rating, but they simply didn't. The game's NPC characters have large numbers of quests, and few of them seem connected in any serious way. What's the point? You help some woman write a book. You save 1-2 people from becoming supermutant soup. You improve the defenses of some refugee population in some random area a bit. You help free a bunch of slaves. What now? So what? Why is this interesting?I almost feel like the game creators layed out a FRAMEWORK for an interesting story/plot - created a universe of interesting factions, technologies, potential, and sci-fi appeal ... but then left it that way and didn't DO ANYTHING with it. They just loaded it up with a bunch of subquests that lack serious depth, and don't really GO anywhere. (You do one, then you move on to the next. And the next. And the next..).. The game has an interesting setting... an interesting game-universe that doesn't go anywhere or do anything particularly substantial, and doesn't seem to have much of an overall point. Where's the story? Where's the depth? What's the point? Why is the game so long if it doesn't really have anything more to say? Bioshock told an interesting story that made me think, and it did it in less than ~30 hours. I feel like the amount of story-related content that was delivered to me via Fallout 3 would be appropriate for a ~15 hour game, maybe. Instead, it was ~60 hours.Fallout 3 is a perfect example of wasted game potential, and a waste of time (mine). If they could flesh out the story, and tell it in a more CONCISE format (reduce exploration time by shrinking the overall size of the world and maybe including vehicles), it would be worth playing. As is, the tiny little bits of story you get out of the game require FAR too much hack and slashing to reach, too much exploration of copy-pasted areas, smashing of copy-pasted bad-guys who all look the same, and overall it just is not worth the time. It's a 15-hour story stretched out into a 60-hour game.Waste of time.//As a brief aside, if you're considering playing Fallout 3, I personally feel like the game's pace dramatically improves if you adjust (increase) your character's running speed using game cheats. This works wonders to cut down the amount of time you'll waste running around between cities/destinations.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2010"}

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists.

I've played it through on the 360 and it was great. But on the Xbox One, I'm stuck with a game ending bug. I cannot play through again since the bug could easily occur again so there's no point...I backed out of the game when it was idle and it has corrupted a save.

Square Enix forums, Xbox forums all seem to know about the bug...When it's fixed, I'll update again...Update: I contacted the Square Enix tech support folks and they are supposedly taking gamertags of those affected. It took a couple of complaint emails -- their first responses are idiotic (please adjust the sound in the sound settings - how the hell would I do that if I can't even press any button whatsover - and who actually believes adjusting the sound would unfreeze a game - absolutely moronic response).There are a few current crazy theories on how to fix this error. 1 way involves using 2 xbox's (you recover the gamesave to the new xbox (not sure if the 2nd one should or shouldn't be patched). another involves trying to pull down your save via cloud but disrupting it so it doesn't work, then creating a new game, playing to one of the cutscenes, then going back to the old save.

{"product_name":"B00000DMAT","description":"GoldenEye 007has been a huge success for Rareware, and it's easy to see why. More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"unknown indenity","summary":"THIS IS THE BEST N64 GAME!","reviewText":"This game may not have a lot of flashy features like sound, or simulant multiplayer, but who cares?
