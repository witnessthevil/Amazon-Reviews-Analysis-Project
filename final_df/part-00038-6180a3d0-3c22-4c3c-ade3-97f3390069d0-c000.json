Willard","summary":"Bethesda drops the ball - Unfinished","reviewText":"It appears to be an unfinished game that needed a follow up and DLC that it never got.This is obviously a great attempt at a game that has graphics issues that as of Nov 2012, still are not fixed. The game would be great if it wasn't plagued with flashes of random jagged images that ruin your view on a regular basis. I am able to play games like Batman Gotham City, Skyrim, Fallout NV and other games on high detail with no problems.Also, the way the game renders is aweful. If you are looking forward and remain still, it is clear as day and is very detailed. As soon as you look right or left, it must re-render the terrain that you are looking at from scratch. If you look back to the front, it must re-render it all over again. It's very annoying.Another reason that I dropped my score is that when you are driving vehicles, you can't look around at all. So if you are taking fire, the only way to know where it's coming from is to get out or off the vehicle and look around. This will play into the linear style of gameplay and the unnecessary reasons for free roaming exploration. What I mean is, when you are driving around, if you think you saw something off to the right, there is no point to get out and explore since you can't look left or right unless you stop and get out. Also, if there is a building, they are all locked until you are specifically sent there. There is zero reason to get out and enjoy the scenery.There isn't a lot of reason to roam the map and look for many items. They are all on the way to your next destination (Linear gameplay). Just look around the immediate area that you are already required to go to. If you decide to go off on the map and explore, it's pretty pointless.If you ever decide to take on the armed buggies outside town, they will just respawn and take all your ammo. Ignore them. Trust me.If I want to play a racing game, I will buy a racing game. Make it an option to race and not a requirement in order to continue the game. 4-5 hours into gameplay you are told you can't have the supplies unless you arm your buggy. You must go to some jerk at a garage to arm your vehicle. You have $$ but that is useless. He says that you MUST take part in races to earn credits that will be used later to arm your buggy with guns. Then and ony then will the sheriff give you medical supplies. (What does a sheriff care if I race my buggy and arm it with guns and what does that have to do with medical supplies?) Also, why is a sheriff giving out medical supplies? Isn't there a supply store? Yes there is but you can't buy the supplies.Serious loopholes and requirements drag the game out and bore the player. I will finish it since I paid for it but I will most likely uninstall it once I am done. Very little replay value here.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2012"}

After all, almost all the games I have for my Vita are digital.Disgaea 3: Absence of Detention,Mortal Kombat, The Pinball Arcade, Zen Pinball 2, Motorstorm RC and Foosball 2012 are all digital. OnlyUltimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3is in cart form. So for someone like myself, this HORI case is pretty much useless. One game does not require a case of this magnitude. There's also only a single slot for a memory card and considering there is no internal save for the Vita, it might have been a better sell had this package been say, nine games and three memory cards or an even more even ratio. Still, with a price tag of only $6.99, this isn't a bad deal, especially when there is a better selection of Vita titles out there.  WithPersona 4 Golden,Ragnarok Odysseyand umm..maybe something else will be coming out eventually that interests me, I'll get more use out of a Game Case for this system, but until then, it just kind of sits waiting for the Vita to get an infusion of quality. It's hardly the case's fault though. it's well made, solid and easily protects the games. It just doesn't have a practial use at the moment.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000QUYHIK","reviewerName":"GarionOrb","summary":"Too similar and inherently flawed","reviewText":"I loved the first Brain Age, but this sequel is lacking severely.  The games are a little more involved, but they don't seem quite as \"smart\" as in the first game.  It's as if the game creators were searching for just about anything they could use to fill this game.  The gameplay is identical to the first one, so in that respect it doesn't feel \"new\".  Almost as if you paid to play a game you already own.The innovative voice-regonition Stroop test is replaced with Paper, Rock, Scissors (huh???).  Only this time, the voice-recognition doesn't work.  No matter how close or far you are from the mic, in understands you 25% of the time.  It shouldn't have been released like this, but I'm sure they wanted to rush the game out the door.  Also, the word mix-up game is fun, until you get a combination of letters that can make multiple words.  Since the game is only expecting a specific answer, it counts it wrong if you input a different word (when in reality, you came up with a word, and that's the point of the game!)  The music game is fun (I personally play the piano), but it can be agonizing to someone who is not musically inclined (I've witnessed the frustration).All-in-all, this is a very disappointing game.  Too bad you can't rent DS games.  At least it's only $20.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2007"}

This game is very linear and takes place in the mines of Mars, so it's dark and well... it's not red-dirt.  But I would take a good linear game over a mediocre open-world game any day, and that's the case here.  My problem with RF:G is that the side missions were more distracting and lacking in any personality than anything else.  Here, you have to follow a certain path, but it makes for a much quicker-paced game.Also (and this is huge for me) the effectiveness of weaponry is much greater in this game than its predecessor.  There's a decent variety of weapons and powers that give you a chance to mix it up, and your opponents put up a decent challenge.  All in all, unless you are married to the idea of open-world, this is a big improvement.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2014"}

One thing is certain, in this city, you will learn how to run.","reviewerName":"A. Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Run for it","reviewText":"Don't be fooled by the relatively low sale price. Mirror's Edge is one of the better PS3 games - my view, of course. Definitely worth trying at least as a rental if not an outright buy.There was a time when I thought a first person platformer could not be done. If you have ever had the same thought and wish you were proved wrong, then Mirrors Edge is for you. You play as a messenger girl named Faith trying to do your job in an oppressed city. The only way for a secret messenger to travel  is by running at the top of the city which is rarely monitored.  It's intense in a way few other games deliver.You often feel like you are the main character ducking, jumping, and running across an entire city. The movements allow you a great variety of options in using whatever technique you want in order to get to a goal. Something I personally like is the fact that you can combine platforming techniques in combat. While platforming is immersive, combat can be repetitive as you will be doing much of the same move. It is possible to play the game without killing anyone but that can be frustrating at times because shooting your enemies is the only way to complete an area without spending hours on it.Everything in the game is beautifully detailed from the rooftops you run on to the glove on your hand.  It is strangely easy to integrate yourself into the game's universe and feel like you are the runner in the game. A very nice addition to the game is runnervision which is added to the easy and medium difficulties of the game. This option helps you see which objects to interact with, and really make you feel like a pro.Multiplayer is not that impressive but...  Most of what it is, is trying to beat another's time at running a certain area. I find it very challenging, because most of the time a fraction of a second is the difference between victory, and defeat.Like I said, definitely worthy of a rental but at this (low) price, I'd buy it.

{"product_name":"B00005RD71","description":"The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowindis an epic, open-ended single-player game where you create and play any kind of character you can imagine. Be the hero embarking on an epic quest or a thief rising to leadership of his guild. Be a sorcerer developing the ultimate spell of destruction or a healer searching for the cure to a plague. Your actions define your character, and your gameplay changes and evolves in response to your actions. Confront the assassins' guild, and they take out a contract on you; impress them, and they try to recruit you instead. No two sagas are the same in the world of Morrowind.Players can choose to follow the intriguing main story line or set off to explore the province of Morrowind and the many interesting people and exotic locations it contains. Vast cities and remote villages dot the landscape, each with its own unique look and feel. Hundreds of quests and adventures await as you interact with characters and learn more. Regardless of whether you play a murdering assassin or a noble knight, the game holds endless possibilities and allows you to revisit the main story line at any time.With Morrowind, the Elder Scrolls character system is coupled with an increase in the world's richness of detail. Utilizing advanced 3-D technology, Morrowind features hyperrealistic textures and polygon counts, real-time shadows, vast landscapes, skeletal-based animation, and a complete weather system. Gameplay is further extended with the inclusion of The Elder Scrolls Construction Set, which allows players to modify and add to Morrowind in any way they see fit. Change character or creature attributes and skills, introduce new weapons or dungeons into the game, or create entire new worlds to explore.","reviewerName":"bayou_hannibal \"bayou_hannibal\"","summary":"Great role-playing game","reviewText":"\"Morrowind\" is a wonderful game.  Except for the mediocre combat, this game is everything that a role-playing experience should be.  There is no multiplayer game (thank goodness), which means that all of the attention goes into single player.  When I think of great RPG's, I think of \"Fallout\", \"Baldurs Gate 2\", and now \"Morrowind\".What makes this game so great is the huge world of Morrowind, and the unbelievable attention to detail.  There is a lot more to this game than just being beautiful to look at.  You could wander around in Morrowind forever, off of the path of the main quests in the game.  There are countless little side quests and miniature areas to kill monsters and pick up loot.  I spent probably 10-15 hours simply wandering around the first little town in the game before beginning the main quest.  Every room has a bunch of little objects in it that you can interact with.  If you want, you can pick up books off the shelves and read them, or you can pick up little knickknacks, like the silverware .  Most of the books are non-essential to the game itself, but they are entertaining to read, and they add depth and flavor to the game.  The NPC's have more to say than the usual computer game NPC's, although they do repeat themselves quite a bit (that happens in every game).The role-playing system for this game also presents endless variety.  There are a lot of different character classes to choose from, and many different character abilities.  You hone your skills by using them, or paying someone to train you, instead of the usual system of assigning skill points.  If you want to develop your character a certain way, you have to use those skills as often as possible, even if it means the risk of getting killed.  I played a character with a bow and a melee weapon, so I made sure to keep switching back and forth between the two weapons.  I also made sure to include magic and backstabbing, so that I could keep my magic and sneaking skills up to par.  Paying someone to train you is expensive, but you can make it cheaper by getting on their friendly side in some way.In the spirit of a true RPG, there are different ways to solve every problem.  \"Morrowind\" offers seemingly unlimited replayability.  In one example, I needed an expensive item from a shop to complete a quest.  So, I mixed up a telekinesis potion, and then stole the item off of a shelf from a distance so that I wouldn't get caught.The interface for this game is very good.  Pop-up tool tips provide information wherever you need it, and it only takes a few mouse clicks to get most tasks done.  The only problems with the interface are the tiny, microscopic inventory icons.  The inventory icons in this are game so puny that you can't tell what anything is without moving the mouse pointer over it.  A sword looks like a dagger, and a bow looks like a tiny stick.  A gauntlet or breastplate just looks like a little blob.  This is a neglected part of the game.So, that leaves us with combat -- the weakest part of this game.  One of the problems with combat is that there seem to be only about 10-15 different types of opponents to fight in the game.  The combat does have strategy built into it -- you have to fight with your character's strengths.  For instance, I had a weak melee character, so I got through tough battles by summoning beasts to fight, and then picking off the enemies from a distance.  However, the visual and sound effects stink.  The enemy has a health meter, but there is no indication of how many hit points of damage you are doing.  Your character simply pokes or hacks away at the enemy with little chops or stabs.  A hit doesn't look any different from a miss, except for the little red cloud that poofs up for a moment (I assume that's supposed to be blood?)  You don't see the weapon actually make contact with the enemy.  The only sounds that come from a hit are a cheesy \"smack\" sound and maybe a moan from the monster.  The hit sound sounds like something you would hear in a cartoon when someone gets hit with a pie in the face.Another downer with the game is the lack of voice-acted dialog lines.  The only voice acted parts of this game are greetings and battle taunts.  That's why there are no memorable NPC's in this game at all.In my opinion, this is a can't-miss, 5-Star game for those of you who just love role-playing games.  \"Morrowind\" is not a \"something for everyone\" game though, so if you are not a big RPG fan, then you might find it to be kind of dull.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2002"}

{"product_name":"B0007D4MVS","reviewerName":"Ryan H.","summary":"The perfect example of a DS game","reviewText":"WarioWare has been a small series that was created on the GBA to truly be a short game.  The first game wasn't expected to sell as much as it did, but now its on the DS.  All the games remain the same, you must play mini games that last for 5 seconds.  Sounds easy, right, well at first it starts out slow but then it gets extremely hard by speeding up and even making the games a little more challenging.  This installment is the easiest to pick up and play because it does not require any button touches but instead the use of the touch screen for random games.There are many categories to be unlocked and you get them fairly quickly.  That's another thing with the games in the series, they are very short.  Being a handheld game I expected it to be short, but the replay value is extremely high.  This time around you can unlock toys that allow you to utilize the DS software in the most bizarre ways.  For instance, one toy allows you to blow bubbles using the mic while another uses little creatures that follow the stylus and will even fall off the screen if you blow on the mic.This game is a must-have if you own the DS because it utilizes the touch screen and other features real well.  However, you might not like this game if you do not like short and unexplainable games.  People who enjoyed Feel the Magic XY/XX will like this game as well because it has the same feel but has more games.  This game is made for all ages, the story mode can be completed rather quickly but if you want more of a challenge you can try to get Gold Crowns for all the characters by scoring the high scores on the mini games.  Doing so unlocks more toys and stuff to play around with.Pros- Over 200 mini games- Challenges get harder as you progress- Very addictive gameplay- Very easy to learn how to play- Unique unlockables that utilize the DS technologyCons- If you don't like random games, you won't like this one- It can be completed rather quickly","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2005"}

Other than watching the \"Treehouse\" videos and searching out any other marketing material, I was not sure what to expect. But like many others, I eagerly awaited this release. So after playing two and a half days, I feel like I have enough grip on the game to post an honest review.Basically Animal Crossing is a game that is vaguely similar to games like Harvest Moon. That is a gross oversimplification, and while it's not fair to compare two different games in this manner, it's not hard to say that if you are used to the open-world \"do whatever you want\" types of world that HM brings, you'll probably feel quite comfortable with AC.I don't want to do a detailed game-play analysis for this review; there are other reviews (and web site) which cover those things. But over a period of roughly 50 hours since I've owned the game, I've logged at least 11 hours in the game, so I would take that as an indication that I am quite enjoying the game.

{"product_name":"B00000DMAX","description":"Mario Kart 64, one of the first games released for the Nintendo 64  platform, is an updated translation of the very popularSuper Mario Kartfor the  Super NES (SNES). And while the game clearly takes full advantage of the graphics  power and speed of the N64, a few components that made the original so compelling  have been left out of this release.Still, Nintendo's expertise at sucking players into the game world is strongly evident, andMario Kart 64offers enough challenges to keep players (especially casual  gamers) entertained. Placing a familiar Nintendo personality behind the wheel of a  sputtering kart powered by a 50, 100, or 150-cc engine, the game lets players race  computerized opponents or up to four other players on a variety of well-designed tracks.  Because karts lack the power and speed of race cars, drivers must focus on collecting  power-ups and nonlethal weapons rather than negotiating hairpin turns on two wheels.  Grabbing and using on-track items is the heart of the game's fun: a strategically-placed  banana peel sends the unlucky victim into a spin, nailing an opponent with a turtle shell  launches their vehicle skyward, and a rocket provides a quick boost to near-breakneck  speeds, if only for a moment.The multiplayer mode provides enormously chaotic fun for up to four players--flip it on  at a party and watch the guests congregate around the screen.--Eric TwelkerPros:Well-designed tracksSimple controlsStrong multiplayer appealCons:Computerized opponents sometimes pull off questionable feats","reviewerName":"ffootballguru27","summary":"One of the best racing games on the N64","reviewText":"Mario Kart 64, the sequel to the first Mario Kart game on the SNES is great. Nintendo got rid of some of the things that made the SNES title so much fun, but added a lot too. The gameplay is much more enhanced, the characters look much better and the individual go-karts are very realistic.Like the SNES version, this game includes 3 modes of play: GP (Grand Prix), Battle, and Time Trial. In GP you choose one of 8 characters: Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Wario, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, and Bowser in a large variety of courses in the Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup Star Cup, or Special Cup (which you unlike by getting gold trophies in each of the 3 basic courses) in 50cc, 100cc, or 150cc mode. 50cc is the easiest, but in 100cc and 150cc the computer gets much faster and more challenging. There are several items you can collect by driving through the question mark boxes which help you during each race. Lightning bolts (the rarest item to get) makes all of the other opponents small, mushrooms give you a speed burst, banana peels make one of your opponents crash if they slip on it, red shells are used to shoot directly at an opponent to get them off course, and green shells keep bouncing off the walls until it hits one of the racers. Unlike the SNES Mairo Kart game, there are several objects you need to avoid to stay on course. In different races there are trucks and cars that will make you crash if you hit them, snowmen that will blow up if you hit them, and many other obstacles in different courses.In Battle mode you and up to 3 others choose one of the 8 characters. You drive around a course trying to pop each other's 3 balloons. You can pop their balloons by shooting red or green shells at them or throwing banana peels at them to make them slip. You can also use the other items to avoid being hit by them. Once all of your balloons are popped you become a bomb which you can drive around the course trying to run in to the other players. This mode is a lot of fun, especially if you get tired of continually playing Grand Prix mode.In Time Trial mode you race in any of 15+ courses and try to set records for each lap and/or race.The controls for Mario Kart 64 are very simple and easy to master, and the music and sound effects are great as well.If you want a great racing game for your N64, I highly recommend that you check out Mario Kart 64.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2002"}

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Michael J. Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"Can a game be as good as a movie with the same setting?","reviewText":"Is it possible to have a game and a movie set in the same universe, and love the game more?In this case, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic harkens back to an era even earlier than the Star Wars movies. Thousands of years earlier to be exact.The Mandalorians (the originators of the armor that Boba and Jango Fett wear) were still in power then. Just as the Jedi were fending the Mandlorians off, a major upset in the balance of power took place when Darth Malak and Darth Revan turned on their allies and returned from the Mandalorian War with a Sith fleet. Only one Jedi's &quot;battle meditation&quot; saved the fleet and now the Jedi are in shambles, the Sith run rampant, and Mandalorian bandits abound. Your mission is to find the disparate &quot;Star Maps&quot; that will ultimately lead to a world crushing machine of Armageddon proportions: the Star Forge. You must beat Darth Malak before he uses the Star Forge to destroy the Republic.In this mix of high adventure are a host of characters (nine in total) range from Mandalorians to Wookies to druids, assassin and otherwise. Each character is carefully crafted and voiced by professional actors who do an excellent job with the material. And by professional, I mean movie talent: Ethan Phillips (Neelix of Star Trek: Voyager) and Ed Asner (uh...ask your parents). Given the number of possible responses in the dialogue, it's a truly massive task.The game system should seem familiar to many - it uses the d20 pen-and-paper role-playing game system of the Star Wars RPG, with tweaks to make it easier to use for a computer game. The abilities blend seamlessly with the game play itself. I never felt at any time that I was playing a pen-and-paper game on a computer. Additionally, the game system uses Bioware's ever-evolving game engine used in Neverwinter Nights, which makes everything easy to use.With multiple worlds that you can fly to at any moment, multiple characters (up to three active at one time), and a dizzying number of side quests, you simply can't get to them all. It doesn't matter though, because the metaplot rumbles along in the background every time you find another Star Map on another world.The graphics and sound are exceptional. Sun glare flares on the game's camera and darkens your character's shadow. The controller trembles when large beasts are afoot (or worse, in combat!). The sounds are all taken from the movies, so lightsabers sound like lightsabers, aliens speak in their native tongues, and starships roar just like their cinematic counterparts. This is about as close to playing a movie as it gets.The character development is worthy of mention. Your own character can be customized by body type, gender, and appearance. Your gender modifies the plot (males can fall in love with Bastila, the pretty Jedi mentor). All this uniqueness and yet the game never falters in dealing with it - your character's head never looks out of place in any of the cut scenes. Speaking of the cut scenes, they are all done with the same in-game animations, marinating the feel of the overall game play without stepping out of the action. And of course, your own character's background has a twist.The NPCs have their own range of personalities. Unlike the current crop of Star Wars movies, there is a careful balance between the elegantly serious Jedi and their adventuring counterparts. Bastila provides a dose of class in the group as the somewhat taciturn Jedi master, but Carth is her balance, a gravelly-voiced war veteran who believes in the power...of a good blaster, that is. My personal favorites include Canderous Ordo, a grizzled Mandalorian of too many wars who loves a good fight. And of course, everyone loves HK-47. Like AK-47, only with an &quot;H.&quot; That's right, HK-47 is an assassin druid with a mind of his own. HK-47 is fond of calling people &quot;meatbag,&quot; except for his master...when he remembers his place.There are plenty of old favorites too: Sand People, Banthas, Krayt Dragons, protocol druids, it's all here. If the characters don't remind you of Star Wars, the soundtrack will. It's true to the original score and in some cases, IS the original score. It's impossible for even the mildest Star Wars fan to resist.All that, and there's a good old-fashioned subplot involving romance and betrayal, Light Side and Dark Side. This is the story Lucas dreamed but never truly brought to life.The game is amazing in its flexibility. There are Light- and Dark Side choices in every conversation. You can solve puzzles or blast your way through plots, help NPCs or set them against each other. There are even logic puzzles that require the player to think, something I haven't been accustomed to doing in a long time.There are flaws, but they're minor. In one case, I ended up killing a major NPC twice. There are puzzles that result in instant death failure, a no-no in game development. And combat is turn based: the player doesn't really determine very swing of the lightsaber, but rather the battle freezes and resumes as the player provides real-time strategy. Also, the game uses the same engine as Neverwinter Nights, which means it involves a lot of walking around talking to people. A LOT.Still, this is one of the best computer role-playing games I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. I was thrilled when my character's romance with Bastila flourished, devastated when I saw a father-son argument between Carth and his son Dustil, and I laughed at loud at some of the spontaneous character interactions.Can a game be as good as a movie with the same setting? Nope.It's BETTER. I got far more bang for my buck playing Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic than I got after two hours of special effects in the movies. In this game, the special effects at least had a heart.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2004"}

DiSpirito \"mentored1\"","summary":"Fun Addition to Fantasy Strategy","reviewText":"Up-front: this game is not ground-breaking or earth-shattering in how it plays or what kind of game it is.  The genre of Real-Time strategy is well-established.  The game honestly doesn't offer anything new or unheard of; but the game does have some strong points, it does do some things right and refreshing:Graphics & Sound:- The visuals in this game, with the right PC hardware, are fabulous.  The terrain, the buildings, and the units are done very well.  Zoom in with the mouse wheel and take a close look: there is very intricate details on everything.  Nice touch.  The animations for battle are great - sometimes it's amusing just to watch orcs get trampled by the Riders of Rohan!- the soundtrack is great.  If you liked the music in the movies then you won't be disappointed: there are some differences but they are subtle.  The voice-overs are great and the sound effects are very well done.  If you play this game a lot it will get repetitive - as with any game.Gameplay:- There is a decent campaign that spans, in a roundabout way, the basic story of the movie.  The campaign offers a few choices but it is ultimately linear (the final outcome is one-way).  You can choose good or evil to start but the path to victory is more or less set in stone.  Depending on your skill this game can be very challenging or disappointingly easy.  If you excel at RTS games in general then this game will be very easy for you.- the skirmish (free battle) mode is fun.  After the umpteenth skirmish it can get a bit tiring - there is a multiplayer matching service included with the game so you can test your skills online if desired.  There weren't many options for customizing or configuring the game for skirmish mode.- The best part of the game for me was using the heroes.  There are many heroes from the movies in this game and each of them has unique powers and abilities.  The heroes are the key to the game and can turn the tide of battles single-handedly.  The visuals, sound, and abilities of the heroes were very well-done.Performance:- This game is a resource hog.  You should have plenty of hard disk space, free system memory, and a really good graphics card if you want to enjoy the visual details.  Turning up visual settings will radically reduce performance.  The sheer number of armies on the screen hits the system hard - if you have a mainstream PC be prepared for some serious lag / slowdowns in big battles.- Even with a high-end rig I found this game to be sluggish.  It was certainly good enough to play without issues but not as fast and responsive as, for instance, Rise of Nations.  Make sure your computer exceeds the minimum requirements by a comfortable margin or be prepared for slow performance and/or reduced graphics and sound quality.Overall this game is a fun time but it is nothing new.  The battles can get boring and the Lord of the Rings theme, though one of my favorites, doesn't make the game unstoppable.  There aren't a lot of options for army types, gameplay modes, etc...If you can find this at a decent price it's worth the fun it will bring.2 Stars for the game itself, 1 for the Lord of the Rings thematic elements, and 1 for the excellent adaption of Heroes in the gameplay.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2006"}

{"product_name":"B001AWIP68","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Intense but too familiar","reviewText":"The problem people see in the game industry is similar to what people complain about in the movies: too many sequels and copycats and yet they forget the important thing that it's what you do with what you have that makes all the difference. So we can look at the latest Call of Duty, subtitled World at War, and think \"oh lord, another World War 2 shooter, haven't played one of those in oh...2 weeks\" but what Treyarch did is oddly make one of the better ones recently. The best? Well I haven't played most of the Medal of Honor series or Call of Duty 2 but it's certainly one of the more intense ones.Story: World at War takes place through the eyes of 2 soldiers: Pvt. Miller of the United States Marines making their way into Japan while Pvt Petrenko is a Red Army soldier making their way towards Berlin. While the Infinity Ward-made Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare had a new story and could bring the twists in to spice up the narrative, we pretty much know how certain battles worked out so there's no real big surprise but it's still cool going through it. Getting ambushed with flares at night or having to defend a position against incoming tanks makes up for its shortcomings storyline-wise.Also it's hard to shake the feeling it's really just Modern Warfare with a WW2 skin: there's a sniper mission where you avoid detection, a gunship mission (though this one's cooler and more action-packed) and a finale done in slow motion, it feels as though Treyarch just took the body of Modern Warfare and just added WW2 clothes on, changed the name and scenery and booted it out the door.Graphics: Call of Duty IV had an incredibly effective engine behind it and was very successful at making you feel like you were in the middle of a large-scale battle whereas in most shooters, all the activity is just in front of you. World at War is no different with planes overhead being shot down, tanks exploding and gunfire happening everywhere, it's very immersive. Smoke effects are excellent, detail in the landscapes work well and character animation is alright but slightly stiff.Sound/Music: Sound is just as great as the graphics and everything from gunfire to that \"ping!\" a gun makes when the clip empties, explosions off in the distance, flybys and the like are well-integrated into everything. What was a little skeptic was the idea of a bit more unique approach to the soundtrack in having modern sounds and having even rock playing. Not a rock band per se but big drums and guitars and while on its own you might think \"...the hell?\", in-game it actually makes the battles seem more epic and intense. Voice acting really comes down to Keifer Sutherland, your \"Captain Price\" for the American side while a nearly unrecognizable Gary Oldman is your leader on the Russian and I preferred having them bark orders at me so that was cool.Gameplay: Nothing fundamental has changed though of course the weaponry is a lot different. Automatics aren't as fast in gunfire, weapons take longer to reload and flash grenades have been replaced by molotovs though there's some cool additions. Big one is the flamethrower which, to be subtle, charbroils your enemies realistically. Though you don't use it fairly often, it gives you a demented rush baking your enemies. Only problem with grenades is that enemies seem to love losing them so much and not only that, seem to be extremely skilled to the point where a grenade will literally kill you without even the indicator popping out to get out. Couple of times I spawned right on top of the thing and that will frequently get annoying. AI is somewhat inconsistent since like Resistance 2, enemies seem to love you especially and even a couple of times they'll just stand there in front of a squadmate who's not even firing, almost saying \"do you want to or shall I?\" Bah.People are still playing CoD 4 on multiplayer so how does this one stack up? Well it works and it doesn't since the perk and EXP gaining of before remains intact along with the various modes but there's only problem: the maps are too damn big. Whereas Infinity Ward made maps a lot more tight quarters and always kept you on your toes, Treyarch basically gave big maps of nothing all over the place making it easier to get sniped or in most cases, not even run into anyone for awhile. While it's still fun to Team Deathmatch, it gets a bit too bland and the spawn points are just horrid. Prestige is added where your perks and levels are removed for show-off medals and you start all over and air strikes and the like have been replaced by ravenous dogs (sic em, pooch!) but it's not really as exciting as Modern Warfare's multiplayer.Also included is co-op online and offline which makes certain missions great and you can either just play for fun or for bonuses and the most kills though some missions aren't done such as the gunship mission (I don't see why not, all the players just man the different guns and you shoot whichever comes onto your side) but it's nice to be able to get some help during the campaign during those cheap parts (like Heart of the Reich). The other major co-op mode is Nazi Zombie in which you and up to 4 players have barricaded themselves in a house and you have to fight off waves of zombies who get tougher with each round. Better guns and ammos can be purchased and barricades can be repaired and it's pretty fun though be prepared for some moronic players online and more often than not, someone ignores to do something they should've done already. It works like Horde mode from Gears of War 2 but whereas that one stopped at wave 50, Nazi Zombie is more like survival as long as possible since eventually, you will die.Is World at War worth a playthrough? I'd say so since I quite enjoyed the single player and multiplayer does get some fun but if you're a diehard fan of Call of Duty IV than this one might feel like most series: some are awesome, some are good while others are just awful. World at War is a good game but compared to Modern Warfare, it doesn't achieve complete awesomeness. This is the Return of the Jedi compared to IV's Empire Strikes Back.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00BGD6LMG","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Fulkerson","summary":"Solid GTA clone with a lame story","reviewText":"Watch Dogs gets a lot more things right than it does wrong.  It may be short on ideas and story lines, but it makes up for that by being just a fun game to sit down and get lost in.  Anyone who has ever played GTA will find a ton of similarities with Watch Dogs, from the look, to the driving, to the movements, to the camera, but at the end of the day, this game is an engrossing time suck that is well worth your time and efforts.The gameplay, while slightly uninspired, is more or less a complete rip-off from GTA, but that's no bad thing.  When you're running and driving through the city it's more or less JUST like GTA.  The movements, the weapon cycling, the chatter, and the cars crashing will leave you thinking a lot about GTA and what a unique game series THAT is.  While it leaves you with an unoriginal distaste for the lack of creativity, Watch Dogs is still pretty fun.  It models itself from the best, and they don't skimp on tight action and explosive gameplay.  One of the obvious attractions of this game is the hacking aspect which is actually pretty fun and easy to get into from the start.  You can zone in on cameras high above enemies, spy on them, and manipulate objects in order to distract and kill.  There are lots of situations where you'll need to sneak into an abandoned warehouse littered by thugs, and you can remotely hack into a camera and peer through it, and further find explosive devices to eliminate anything that may stand in your path at a later time.  If that's not your thing, you can use the radar to try and sneak past.  It makes for tense situations, and the game really does a nice job of giving you options as to progressing in the game.Something else I found fun is the ability to hack bridges, street lights, etc.  When you're evading the cops, it's always fun to fly over a bridge as it's opening on your command, leaving the police trailing your dusty wake.  There are lots of getaway possibilities available to you with a simple hack.  I also find it fun to hack into other players games, or get hacked by other players.  I was wandering around on a random crime mission, and all of a sudden a warning flashed across the screen telling me I had a minute to go find some punk who was hacking into my funds.  It's hilarious trying to catch these random players, and it gives the game another aspect of tension.  I also really enjoy how you can hack into people's bank accounts and profile them as you walk by them in the street.  When you're short on cash, you go to an ATM and take out the profiled characters money.  It's an original touch that works.Another plus are all the random side missions.  You won't get bored easily with this game as it literally has hours of stuff to do.  It's pretty wide open as far as how linear you wish your path to be.  It's not a overly huge world, and you won't feel even a smidgen of freedom you have in games like, say, Skyrim, but it definitely feels on par with GTA in terms of size.With all of these things going for it, it gets bogged down by the incredibly lame story, and stupid dialog and characters.  You play a guy who was betrayed, he's come back to avenge someone's death, blah blah blah.  We've all seen it 1,000 times before.  The main character has a dumb, monotone voice like every other dopey video game out there.  He says things like \"let's do this\", and \"the pain never goes away\", and \"you're going down\".  Really?  Is this the best the writers can do?  You just end up wanting the main character to shut his trap and stop talking so you can enjoy the game.  Also, the chatter from the NPC's is flat out dumb and irritating.  They say stupid, childish things, and it's one of the aspects that makes you miss what the GTA series does so well.  I walked by a character talking about beating up his girlfriend because she was annoying him.  No humor, no reason, he just said it.  Without any context it just ends up sounding like a bunch of immature meatheads got together and wrote the script for the game in two hours.  GTA deals with the same themes, but it does this by engaging characters, and most of all, humor.  It takes you out of the game when people are just wandering aimlessly saying dumb stuff.Watch Dogs has plenty of cool gameplay to keep you occupied for a while.  The hacking aspect is fun, and it's action packed.  The driving is easy and intuitive (I may be in the minority with this opinion), and fighting and missions are plentiful.  If it weren't for the dopey story and abysmal dialog, this would be a really fantastic game.  Amazon doesn't award half stars as I would normally give this game three and half, but I think it warrants a strong recommendation with four stars.  If you're up for some braindead fun and high-tech hacking, this game is for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2014"}

Sounds pretty decent, doesn't it?AitD struggles pretty much from the getgo with painful controls, a camera system that is great for filming movies, but deplorable for trying to play a game, and an inventory system that, while inventive and original, tries so hard that it forgets what it was trying to do in the first place.

And while you're strong enough to ignore bone deep wounds and cuts and bruises, you can't swing a flaming club around faster than a 4 year old trying to bat in the majors.The inventory controls suffer greatly as well, as its easy to pull stuff out and put it back, but it doesn't pause the game to stop the monsters from chewing half your face off. Also, there's no \"holster\" button, a standard staple from FPS time immemorial. So you can end up shooting half a clip while struggling to find the control to pull out your molotov to fight the monster that currently killing you.Its a sad letdown to something that's otherwise rather decent.

I never saw a single preview of it. Also, every site that I see just seems to describe it poorly, and I had no interest in it. Only after I saw a portion from Jess Chobot did I say that looks fairly interesting.This game is basically GTA meets Assasins Creed I and Wolfenstein. It is sandbox like GTA, you get to climb around and do stealth kills like ACI, and it is a FPS where you kill Nazi ala the great Wolfenstein.This is also a game where I dread Amazon's star system. Sure a 2.5 or 3.5 can be rounded up or down without much affect, but to me a 4.5 game is a 4.5 game. It is still a lot better than a 4, but not perfect like a 5.CONS:Music - There is virtually no sound track. You have one in your car and in the cabaret. That is it. It is also pretty poor music. At first I thought, \"Well, this does take place in the 40's, so it isn't like you can put Metallica in there.\" However, I absolutely loved Fallout 3's music, so that isn't really an excuse. I found myself singing the music to that game all the time when I was playing it.Voice - I have seen some complaints about the main character. Most people have a problem with his voice and that he is a stereotypical Irishman. Maybe they have never actually heard an irishman talk. It is pretty good. There are a couple french people that aren't that good though. Anyway, not bad enough to detract from the game unless you are just looking for something to complain about.Replay - Not really any replay value, but you do have a lot of extra goodies to pick up. There are over 1000. This would be a slight con.PROS:Fun - This game is fun fun fun. Main missions and side missions are all fun.Other - There are plenty of weapons and cars although you will find yourself just using one or two, so they could improve on this a bit. Plus all the cars you find laying around suck, so you have to use one of your own, but you can summon your own almost at anytime.Perks - These are \"achievment\" like items that give your character bonuses, almost like a leveling system for RPG. They actually added more to the game than I thought they would.Artistic Value - I can appreciate artisticness, but don't \"need\" it. When you start the game everything is black and white except for lights, and red. So, the nazi flags stand out. It is actually very beautiful. As you inspire the Parisians, those respective areas get their color back. It makes for a very beautiful and unique game. I actually enjoyed the black and white look. It also added to the time that this is in.Conclusion:I look forward to the second one. They definitely left it open for one. His last words are I'm just gettin started! I think with some improvement on the perks along with some more stealth features and maybe some fighting features would be great. Add some more good cars to be found on the streets. Maybe an extra weapon or two. I would like to see a slight bit more emphasis on stealth too. Basically, I think with a little work, this game could be perfect.Anyway, if you are looking for an absolute fun game to play, this is it. It is the best of most worlds game type. I have read a lot of reviews that it doesn't do this or that good. Well, it wasn't meant to be an FPS, so the weapons may be \"arcadish\", it isn't meant to be an RPG, so the leveling system isn't that complex. I will say that sometimes, climbing can be a chore. ACII is supposed to kill this on that aspect, but I thought it was pretty comparable to ACI. It also has a great storyline as well.This is a great gift to any gamer, and now that the prices are dropping, it is worth the price as well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000035Y4T","description":"The game that rocked the world and changed arcade-style fighting forever returns in all its splendor. Choose from eight unique characters (some familiar faces have returned from the original, but a few new combatants make for spiced-up action), as you try to pummel your computer-controlled opponents to death. Each character has special moves that only he or she can pull off, making the game full of plenty of surprises...and blood. As with the original, whichever character wins the battle gets the opportunity to complete a Fatality, which is every bit as violent as it sounds. There's a reason that this game was so overwhelmingly popular, and the cold-blooded, hand-to-hand combat is as fun today as it was when it first came out.","reviewerName":"SideshowBob","summary":"Great version of MKII","reviewText":"The SNES version of Mortal Kombat II was A WHOLE LOT better than the original Mortal Kombat on this system.It included the main thing that everybody missed in the first game....and that was the blood and the gore.This version still holds up as one of the best versions of MKII to own.The gameplay and graphics are fantastic.At the time,it was the closet thing to the arcade that you could possibly get.The only little flaw that I remember about this version is, when you are player one,and you pick Johnny Cage,his belt is red.The player two Johnny Cage has the blue belt.Which is how player one is supposed to look,and vice versa with player two having the red belt.That's how it was in the arcade and the rest of the versions of MKII.I found that to be a little strange.I don't think alot of people even noticed this.I mean,it's not a big deal or anything.I just thought that I would point this out....anyway.Overall,this is still a great version of one of the best video games of all time.I highly recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2012"}

Apparently they solved one of them a few days ago by adding a restart feature so you don't have to go back to the initial intersection to start an event again when you don't win it. Another thing that irked me was always having to find a Junk Yard in order to change to a different vehicle...Instantly being able to select another vehicle from a pulldown menu or instantly being able to visit the Junk Yard seems so incredibly sensible, that's probably why you're instead forced to drive around for 2 or 3 minutes until you locate a Junk Yard to change vehicles.Also, on certain Burning Routes, you get bum steers from the flashing turn signals that supposedly lead you on the correct route in order to beat the time. For example, the Burning Route for the V16 Revenge nearly drove me INSANE! It was my final Burning Route and I literally tried that thing AT LEAST 150 times over the course of 2 days, getting extremely frustrated in the process. I will say that our copy of BP is out-of-the-box, no online updates and it gives a turn signal to take Nelson Way (2nd right out of the tunnel). I watched a guy do this on youtube who drove against oncoming traffic and never took his thumb off the boost in order to beat this route taking Nelson Way. You have no idea how incredibly difficult that is to do without crashing at least once. What I didn't know is there was a much easier route where you take the first right turn (N Rouse Rd) after exiting the tunnel instead of following our copy's recommended route. I took the first right turn and completed the route on my first try with 20 sec to spare! I've seen video of the PC version with N Rouse Rd as the game's recommended turn, so it appears the PS3 port was intentionally changed to Nelson Way, at least when our version was produced. While I appreciate a gaming challenge (or I would've quickly given up on this one), I don't like being the butt of some inside joke by the developers. I had to find my own alternate route to win the GT500 burning route too.Also, because I simply drove off of one of the Super Jumps at a low speed, I never got credit for it and I crossed it off my list of potential Super Jumps...So I needlessly spent several hours cruising around the area looking for the final Super Jump. Another Super Jump can be made 2 different ways (without giving a spoiler away)...Do it one way and you don't get credit...Do it the other way and you get credit. These programming failures make no sense to me. Finally, the Stunt Runs were so incredibly difficult, that's the only part of the game I couldn't complete (out of choice). After winning 7 of them, I just stopped because they weren't fun. It was simply too hard to score points in the given time...So with all of those quirks and gripes out of the way, this really is a masterpiece of a game! Just playing offline should provide one with about 150 hours of gaming time before it reaches the point of diminishing returns. Not bad for 20 bucks! Play it enough and you might even find an easter egg-type bonus. For example, boost through the Angus Wharf fuel station (with Paradise Ferry on your right) and the Best Buy Oval Champ pops a wheelie as you exit. Pretty cool, but doesn't work going the other way.The game's graphics are truly STUNNING, even at speed. I recently purchased Motorstorm: Pacific Rift and was so disappointed in the vehicle controls and painfully slow graphics (after playing BP) that I couldn't even play it more than a couple of hours. This is an expanse of a game that will quickly ruin your left thumb if you're playing the stick without glove protection. It gets intense, then you can cruise at your leisure until you're ready for it to get intense once again. The sound effects are also so well done that you'll start to believe you're really driving the vehicle at times...The ultimate achievement for a game developer.Most of the vehicles are easy to master and you'll soon be doing jaw-dropping jumps and crashes right out of the box -- Just like I like em! One other curiosity is the DJ. He's Chatty Cathy at the start of the game throughout the soundtrack...Then someone shot him or something because you suddenly hear nothing else ever again from him throughout the rest of the game. Not that I missed him or anything, but he just went dead-air for the DJ with no explanation (unless I missed it). Overall, this is a near perfect PS3 racing/driving game...Too bad I played it before any of the others!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2009"}

Scott Heitman","summary":"Paradise, Indeed.","reviewText":"The Burnout franchise has never been content to simply re-release the same set of ideas as \"new\" games day in day out.  They finally hit it big with Burnout 3, but rather than milk the precise formula established there, they gave us a number of variations in Burnout Revenge and Burnout Dominator.  None of the changes in those games, however, matches the complete reworking that Paradise represents.The previous games were somewhat non-linear in the sense that you could choose from about 5 events at any one time.  Paradise, however, has the type of nonlinearity more akin to Grand Theft Auto games.  Rather than navigating menus to choose an event, you're navigating the Paradise City, itself, which hosts all of the events.  You can be headed off to do one thing only to get distracted by other things that pop up along the way.  Allow me to explain: There are events stationed at most every intersection (and the map is HUGE).  Some of these events require specific cars.  You may be getting to these events or heading to a junkyard to switch cars.  In come the distractions: There are 120 billboards that need smashing (some quite difficult to reach), over 400 shortcut gates to run through, and rival racers running through town- take them out and you've got a new car.  Basically, this is a game you can easily lose yourself in and not realize where the time has gone.Visually and aurally, the game is amazing.  The graphics and level of detail are superb while the soundtrack is lengthy and fun.  I was slightly disappointed to find some repeated tracks from previous games, but if you've only played some of the Burnout games, it will all seem new.  I've never been one of the people that was annoyed by DJ Atomica- I've always thought he brought a bit of fun and believable atmosphere to the game.  Either way, he doesn't say as much as he did in past games.The meat and potatos of the game remains largely the same: Races, Burning Laps, and Road Rages are still the order of the day.  What's new is an event called Marked Man- evade your pursuers to reach the finish line.  It's a fun variation that hasn't worn out yet for me (I'm about 4 hours in).  On a side note, racing now has the freedom introduced by other franchises such as Midnight Club.  Chart your own course to wipe the floor with your competitors- they don't often make driving mistakes, but they typically don't take the best route, either.And now to address the problems raised by others.  Some lament the lack of a retry function for events.  I'm okay with this because it means NO loading screens (something Burnout was always a bit bad with in the past) and, besides, you're never more than 10 seconds away from another event.The other thing that will disappoint fans of Burnout 3 is the continued lack of a true Crash mode.  The puzzle-like aspect they presented isn't really repeated here, but destruction afficionados will still find an able replacement in Showtime events.  On any street, you can hit a couple of buttons to seamlessly start smashing into other cars for points (there are, of course, records to beat).The one aspect of the game I've yet to try is the multiplayer aspect, but it promises to provide an interesting experience.  Apparently it makes getting into an online game easier than ever before.  Combine that with online-only challenges and...well, I'm off to try it right now.Burnout Paradise is an enormous game (with FREE downloadable expansions of the already gargantuan map announced), and its content is a great deal of fun.  Sign up here for your annual dose of adrenaline-fueled racing and other assorted automotive carnage.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2008"}

This is probably the most hilarious (and one of the few funny games) ever since Earthworm Jim on the snes. Unlike that game though I would recommend not playing this in front of your kids if you have them. The game while funny is very crude, violent, and there are sexual jokes but thats just how Deadpool is though as a character. The Voice acting in the game is amazing its probably the closet your gonna get to the real deadpool movie (Bryan reynolds is not the real deadpool more of a normal character). If you have played Uncharted the voice of Deadpool may sound familer as hes played by the same guy who voiced Nathan Drake from that game.As for the gameplay like I said before this isn't the god of war or arkham city killer. It kinda plays like a dumbed down version of god of war with arkham style combos, however with it being dumbed down it kinda feels more like a old school beat em up (double dragon, streets of rage) with the batman dodge mechanic then anything. There are also gun fights in the game as well which feel like a typical 3rd person shooter nothing special other than the crazy one liners but it does its job. As for the length of the game it really depends on what you start on if you start on easy you will probably have the game beat in about 3-5 hours but if you play on the hardest difficulty it will probably double the length. Which I would recommend playing threw the hardest mode first unless you don't play games much as its much more fun and challenging.Anyway this is a good game that deadpool and new deadpool fans will enjoy as long as your not expecting the Ryan Reynolds barakapool if your hard on cash or if your not sure if you want it wait tell the price comes down otherwise get the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2013"}

The thing that made him a cool character was his fourth-wall-breaking, psychotic and crazy routine along with his sarcastic and perverse humor. However, you never had to actually hear him (or the voices in his head) talk, just read the talk bubbles. In the game you don't have to just deal with a bad game in many areas, but you have to deal with him coming off as an ADHD ten-year-old child. He has his moments, but after a short time, it all gets stale.High Moon Studios' Deadpool is the merc with a mouth in his first ever video game and while he continuously breaks the fourth wall, he will never let you forget you are playing a video game, as if everything about the games mechanics doesn't do that already. Deadpool as a game comes off as kind of a parody of action games, which works for the character being Deadpool, but it constantly being thrown in your face gets annoying and old. Even when they use it to break up the game play, such as in one short part you are playing top down in 8-bit graphics like in the original Zelda game. Also he is constantly commenting on various video game tropes, the script for the game and now and then complaining about you the player.Being that I am not the biggest fan and don't have anything to do with Deadpool regularly, this is my first time dealing with him as an animated character with a voice, so maybe it is something I am not used to. However, some of the comics I have read have him dialed back a little compared to others and unfortunately High Moon has him cranked up to an eleven in this game. I am sure to those that absolutely love everything about him will see this as great stuff, but for the rest of us it doesn't work as well.It seems that High Moon used Deadpool to do crazy things with everything about the game and even maybe use the whole fourth wall stuff to hide technical problems with the game, such as loading screens that are put in place in areas where he runs into the game being unfinished. However, there is a few times that while running around a corner the game will freeze for a few seconds with a regular loading screen. It seems abrupt, so it is hard to say if the game all of a sudden needed to load in strange place or that part of the game was trying to be goofy. There are instances of technical problems that are clearly spotty work on the game, like constant texture pop-in issues. Almost every scene seems to take a few seconds before everything becomes clear. Also Deadpool likes to stick to things it seems. If he runs up against any kind of wall or other structure in an area, he will stick to it. This seems to happen mostly in combat situations or at least that is the most notable because you are trying to get away so his healing factor will kick in. The combat gets intense at times, so running into something and have it be a stumbling block gets very aggravating quickly. There is the teleport ability, but it is nothing grand at all. If you are up against a wall and teleport, you might just end up in the middle of all the baddies and take even more damage. You can only teleport a few steps at most and it rarely gets you out of trouble.What makes the sticking to walls and such even more annoying is the game play itself. The aiming feels off. There is a lock on, but if you so much as tap the right analog stick it stops being locked on to an enemy. This is alright, but when you are used to using both stick a lot to move around and kill it can be tough to keep it in mind not to touch that right stick at all. There is also the issue with the camera, you control it thankfully, but it still seems to box you in at times if you are not in a very open area. This is more harmful when as stated before, up against a wall that won't let you go and it means you are constantly being hit by something off screen. On top of the controls being clunky, the killing and murdering that makes Deadpool so cool is completely unsatisfying. All the enemies are fodder, with a few more challenging enemies here and there, but even those are unimpressive and never really giving you any feeling of dread. Most enemies you cut to pieces and the others you have to work a little harder or maybe have to use the lock on aim exclusively. It all makes all the action boring and repetitive.As Deadpool kills he gets DP points, why is it DP points? Because Deadpool. I do not understand why it isn't just money. Everything else in this game is pulled out of Deadpool's ass, so why not make money just appear as well? Makes sense to me. The DP not being money is nitpicking sure, but that is because everything else has problems. It is easy to nitpick something when everything else seems to be in bad shame. You use these DP points to unlock new weapons. You starts out with his trusty swords and pistols and you can upgrade those with DP points. You can also use these points to unlock new weapons like Sais, machine guns and bear traps. None of which helps the game from feeling repetitive and are just as average as the weapons you start out with, although the Sais so help build up your combo, which can help get you more DP points. So using the Sais seems like the best bet. You can also upgrade Deadpool as well with these points to have his healing factor kick in fast and some other abilities, but again, nothing great.High Moon trying to make Deadpool seem like a bad game as a joke comes out making the fact that it is a bad game that much worse. Maybe they will tell us \"hey, it was all just a big joke\" and play it off that way to try to make it seem very Meta, but I wouldn't believe them. The chugging issues, weird loading in the middle of running down a hallway, the boring game play, the annoyance of Deadpool, bad game mechanics and on and on makes this game not worth playing unless you are a die-hard fan or love trophies/achievements.

Finkel \"Jack of Trades\"","summary":"All About the Drums","reviewText":"I've only had Rock Band for XBox 360 one day, but I can easily recommend it to any and all.  This special edition comes with everything you need to play the game - a guitar, mic, drum set and the game.  There is a fourth instrument however - bass, which is played using the guitar.  If you want to play guitar and bass at the same time, a second guitar is needed.  Fortunately, the guitar hero guitars work well if you have them.  If not, I recommend buying Guitar Hero 3 bundle for xbox360, which comes with a wireless guitar.  The instruments for rock band are all wired (to USB ports on xbox 360), which can be annoying, but on the plus side, they don't require any batteries!Thanks to Karaoke Revolution and Guitar Hero, singing and playing faux-guitar are nothing new for video games.  They've been done, and done well.  In fact, you should check them out too.What hasn't been done before is the drum set.  The set you receive is made from mostly aluminum and hard molded plastic, extremely durable.  Gaming magazines have reported the drum set as taking tons of abuse without being worse for the wear. The 4 well-sized drum pads are on a ~30 tilt, are adjustable in height and have a good, rubbery spring to them.  The foot pedal is awkward at first and could be more responsive, but certainly does the job.  Everyone in the family will be eager to give it a try, and once won't be enough.  One word of caution - unless you're a percussionist, start off with Easy and expect to make plenty of mistakes.  It will probably take a LOT of practice to make it up to Hard, but then again, being a good drummer takes a lot of practice too.  And perhaps the best feature of Rock Band, unlike other music video games, is by the time you hit Expert, you'll actually be able to play drums.The special edition bundle may be pricey, but if you and/or your family are at all musically inclined, you'll get more than your money's worth.  Just one note of caution - although far from the volume or noise of a real drum set, between the drums and singing, you may want to set this one up in the basement.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2007"}

This title is a poorly made CGI movie with limited use of your PS3 pad. I am not sure you can call it a game. Great graphics can't compensate for wonky and limited controls, 3rd grade level puzzles and overplayed predictable story. Maybe I am jaded since I am still playing Skyrim and also just finished Portal 2. Those two titles are actual games where you are allowed to make liberal use the game pad. Portal 2 had amazing puzzles. Everything in UC3 just seemed tacked on to support one cut scene after the next or one more beautiful room with virtually no interactivity in it. Also, I can't believe after a 3rd iteration the gun play is even more wonky than the first two titles. How on earth did the game designers manage to do that?

(I've been playing video games in one form or another since the early 1970s.)2) The only aspect that interests me is the single player campaign. The last time I enjoyed multiplayer was Quake III on PC, around 10 years ago. None of my friends still game, and I soon learned the hard way that playing online w/ anonymous strangers is a pit of snakes that I have no desire to subject myself to.3) Halo 1 has been one of my all time favorite games since I first played it in June 2002. (My review from around that time is still there, if you care to dig for it...) For the record, my Bungie fandom began in 1995, when a co-worker gifted me with a copy of Marathon.4) I have enjoyed each of the Halo sequels, but felt that they all fell short of the greatness of Halo 1 in various ways.5) Halo 1 is still my favorite in the series and probably always will be, but of all of the subsequent entries, Reach comes the closest to matching its awesome radness. My expectations were sky high, and yet it managed to somehow exceed them. I've already played through the campaign at least four times and will play it many more times in years to come.

It features enhanced graphics and additional gameplay.I love the Ninja Gaiden series in general, and definitely wanted to play Ninja Gaiden Sigma. It features new areas and lets you play as Rachel.I like how they toss you right into the gameplay without a tedious tutorial forced-play. You're leaping up walls, vaulting over enemies, and slashing your way through tatami-filled rooms. It feels quite visceral and thrilling to be hacking away at ninja enemies while working your way towards your objective.The graphics are reasonably good, although certainly not perfect. There were ample times where I clipped through a wall or a body or blood stain did something not quite physically possible.The game ensures that you can't just button mash your way to victory. You have to be deft with your jumping, blocking, and different styles of attacks to make it past the enemies. Some of them are quite challenging. At times it seems like they have thousands of enemies hiding behind one single wall, just streaming out at you endlessly.I do have to give a special thumbs-down to their camera. Certainly complaining about bad cameras is almost a given in gaming reviews. Camera angles can be quite annoying. But even knowing how bad cameras have been in other games, Ninja Gaiden Sigma has serious faults here. There have been ample times that I *should* have won a combat sequence but the bizarre twist of the camera made it impossible to know what to do.The game also loves to mis-interpret your commands. You can be hacking away at an enemy and doing a near-perfect job of taking them down - but get too close to a chest and the game decides that this is the ideal time for you to sit down and read a complex scroll on how to do a new move. Ah, no. I had no intention of opening that chest. I was in the middle of fighting for my life.Still, the game is immensely fun. I enjoy the levels and the enemies. Well recommended to ninja-style fans who are up for a challenge.Rating: 8/10I purchased this game with my own funds in order to do this review.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2012"}

There are some great ways to kill bad guys but my favorite is chucking them off high buildings and watching them disappear into then night sky. Watching bodies scatter in slow motion after a perfectly-timed explosion is also a lot of fun.The DLC available from the PlayStation Network is great too and provides even more action, but I just wish there could have been more it, even if it was something as small as new costumes for Jack and Shadow, one new outfit just ain't enough.I'd love to see the Dead to Rights series continue.

{"product_name":"B0050SYZS0","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"An Entire Game Series Ruined by the Ending","reviewText":"This is the same review as the one I posted for the standard edition of the game. I will however add that with the Collector's Edition, one of the biggest benefits you receive is the new Prothean character that is really awesome, and it would cost 10 dollars to buy the DLC without buying the CE. Other extras in this edition include essentially useless in-game weapons and a robo-dog that just walks around in the Cargo Bay. You do however get a cool little art book, a mini comic book, an N7 patch, a post card, and a cool steel case with the special edition. I figure this is worth much more than the extra 20 dollar price increase from the standard edition. Now onto the review of the game:For those that haven't finished Mass Effect 3, the first part of my review will be spoiler free, but the second part must be rife with spoilers because the story and ending is the biggest problem of the game. I'll also preface this review by saying that the ME series had been probably my favorite gaming series of all times, and I beat the campaign of ME1 three times while I finished the campaign of ME2 four times. I had been incredibly excited about the game, and had been able to avoid practically every spoiler except for two smaller ones about EDI and the Prothean character. Even though the game is flawed, I loved pretty much 99% of the game, but the ending was so bad that it has ruined my entire Mass Effect experience. I was going to play the game again with my female character as I loved the voice over work of Jennifer Hale, but now I don't really want to. I was even going to start a new character in ME1 and play all three games in succession, but now it just isn't worth it.So, let's start with the gameplay, which in the Mass Effect series is split between the RPG aspects, and the third person cover shooting battle system. ME3 definitely has the best action gameplay of the entire series, and while it can still be clunky there are constantly amazing moments with dozens of different but equally awesome strategies you could employ. I just wish there were almost more buttons on the controller for this game. It's one of the most effective uses of a controller in any shooter, where you really have so many different attacks you could use at every moment. Most of the clunkiness once again resolves around the action button being the same as the sprint and cover button. I'm not sure if it would work, but it could be interesting if the action button was instead mapped to the select button, the only one that isn't used in the game.Now on to the RPG systems of the game, which is much improved from basic systems in ME2, for Mass Effect 3 they basically took most of what was in ME1 and stripped out the hassle of the massive inventory screen and the repetitive/annoying/time-consuming aspect of destroying/selling the multitude of useless items you received. This interesting new inventory management system works by all of the weapons having a weight, and if you go over a certain weight limit (which is dependent on your character class and certain upgrades you can choose) you can face severe power regeneration penalties. I love this idea, but it can become annoying when all of the good weapons have really high weight. It also ends up limiting the weapons you can bring along, even though I was a Vanguard that selected the increase weight capacity upgrade. There's a possible related result, where you can no longer carry any heavy weapons like in previous games, something that I always loved. Instead there are only four heavy weapons found at few certain points lying on the ground (flamethrower, rocket launcher, some Geth laser gun, and the mini-nuke) with very limited ammo. Back to the main weapons that are in this game, I loved that Bioware brought back the Role Playing elements present in ME1 guns, almost keeping the same names and level presentation. The concept is really smart, where you can purchase an upgrade up to level 5 for each weapon and each weapon add-on (that you can have two equipped on each gun). The only problems here is that I had enough money so that each time I got a new gun I promptly maxed out the upgrades, so the system wasn't as rewarding as it could have been. Also, with the level of each add-on upgrading when you find or buy a new one, while I love this, it was a little uneven where multiple times I upgraded ones I didn't use while I couldn't find the upgrades for the ones I did regularly use. This whole system could be improved with a few adjustments, which is possibly a higher level cut-off limit like in Multiplayer (could make it so that weapons that you like don't become useless because of their stats later in the game) and something that I liked in the first game but disappeared in the sequels. That is a weapon efficiency upgrade system where you could get experience points for every enemy you kill with each weapon type, I think this could really increase the RPG feel while keeping all of the action. One more thing with the weapons, there's an interesting section of the Spectre offices where you have a fire range to test your weapon load-out. I love this idea, especially with all of the different weapons, but it makes no sense to have it on the Citadel, instead it should be in the Normandy Cargo Bay. Too many times I would upgrade a new weapon only to find I didn't like the way it fired. Then there are weapons that I never tried out as their weight was really high and the stats weren't the best. So while I may have possibly liked the way they fired, now I'll never know as I didn't have an opportunity to test them out.I was pretty disappointed that no real changes (non-cosmetic) were made to the armor system. It's much too basic, almost exactly the same as ME2, and I wish there were more options to alter and upgrade your armor. I really kept the same armor for most of the game, even later I just made a few adjustments and all I cared about was getting the bonus percentages I wanted. The armor also looked all pretty similar, except for the helmets, which were mostly pretty goofy looking. Finally, for the different character classes, in this iteration they seem about the same, but some new abilities have been added. One of them that I really loved was the new Nova attack which was really useful when combined with the Biotic Charge, also I like that it's not perfect as it uses up your shields, creating an interesting cost versus benefit play choice.The next aspect of the game is one that has really defined to series up to this point, and that is the conversation system of ME3. I was very disappointed that the conversation options were much more limited in this iteration, where you basically only had the paragon or renegade choice. There was never a paragade response or something else like the sarcastic comments I loved making in Dragon Age 2, at this point in the series it felt like a step back. There was also an annoying amount of conversations that resembled your talks with the DLC characters Massani and Goto. I didn't mind this too much, but it was frustrating when multiple times I would accidently hit the A button one too many times and I would skip the conversation. I also had a few graphics glitches during the normal conversations with choices, where the character's framework was broken or glitched, and they'd be looking all over the place or the eyes would be tracking wrong, it was just really weird. Even stranger, this tended to happen earlier in the game (they either occurred with Liara or Ravik), I didn't really experience it too much later, I'm not sure why. Possibly relating to this, I didn't have any problems importing my character's face as some have, but I think that's because I played around with it in ME2 because I didn't love my Shepard's face.There were multiple times in conversations where there were great little inside joke comments that were only for my Shepard, but I was a little disappointed that there weren't more new in depth conversations with your crew. Even with the new character Vega, while I love the sparring match/conversation you had with him (One of my favorite crew member interactions in the whole series) you don't get to know him as much as you did the previous game's characters. I understand that with the possibility of almost every old character not being present in ME3, the developer didn't want to spend too much time and money on them, but conversely they didn't add many new characters. In total, not counting the DLC character, there are only four new crew members on the Normandy (all of whom are humans): the new playable jock character, a gay male pilot, a gay female communications officer, and a female reporter. I liked all of these new characters (though the reporter is a little generic and annoying) but consider something for a minute. If Garrus and Tali had died in your playthrough of ME2, for most of the game you would only have two playable characters, Vega and Liara. Later of course, you get Kaidan/Ashley and EDI, but it's amazing they didn't add new characters or make more of the characters from ME2 crew members. Even with all of the crew members possible, you don't get a representative from the Krogans and the Salarians, or any of the other non-council races. I expected to see all of the different species send someone onto the Normandy, but for some reason no one did. All we got was a Krogan leader (Wrex!), a Turian leader, and a Quarian leader in the War Room for a few missions. You'd think that if Bioware didn't want to waste time and money on possibly unpopular characters, they would have created more characters that every player would get to know. The only possible explanation for why they didn't do this is that they didn't think they had the time to establish multiple new interesting characters.Another annoying change to something I loved before, was how when you're in the hub-world listening to people's interesting conversations you have to leave the area and come back to hear the next part of the story. In ME2, you could just keep hitting the A button to listen to the rest of the conversation, which to me worked really well. This time, even though the stories are cool, I would lose interest in them as so much time could pass between each part of the telling, also at one point they glitched out and all of the conversations reset. I also had a problem that I figure has to be a glitch where at the last conversation with the Illusive Man, the Paragon and Renegade options were greyed out. With this Shepard I have always selected the blue conversation options in each Mass Effect game every time they appeared, and I also always explore every possible conversation option. I had off the charts amounts of Reputation and Paragon points and still I had a conversation option blocked, the first time this has ever happened to me (in the Mass Effect series and every other video game with a similar conversation system). I felt extremely confused and annoyed that somehow the best possible resolution to the Illusive Man conflict wasn't available to me for no apparent reason.Onto the locations and exploration of the different worlds, something that was one of my favorite parts of the previous games, but is almost non-existent in ME3. Here is where ME3 strikingly reminds me of the failure of Dragon Age 2. Similarly to Kirkwall, the Citadel acts as the only hub-world in the entire Mass Effect 3 game, while in ME2 there were four completely different hub-worlds. This would be okay, as most worlds are under attack from the Reapers, except for the fact that this version of the Citadel is the smallest and most basic of the entire Mass Effect trilogy. Then the Citadel only goes through a very minor cosmetic change halfway through the game, and they expect us, a society full of ADHD people, not to grow bored of the surroundings. We get to go to worlds we've always wanted to explore, like the Turian, Salarian, Quarian, Asari and Human home-worlds, but all of them are filled with waist high walls and they're all being blown up by Reapers and/or attacked by Cerberus. The missions are also relatively short, and we fail to really see anything unique about the planets. Further, ME3 has essentially eliminated the mini missions on random worlds, and the probe mechanic found in ME2. Instead, now you have to fly around each system evading the Reapers while you randomly scan for 2 or 3 of the interesting things, which are either small amounts of fuel or some random unexplained war asset on a planet. Then you get to play a few basic solo N7 missions on the limited number of Multiplayer maps. I understand that exploring Alien worlds isn't a priority in the middle of a war with a group of ancient synthetic/organic hybrid monster spaceships, but I missed this aspect that was hugely present in the previous games.Related to the locations and explorations, I'm going to talk a little bit about the further development of the alien species you encounter. Sadly, we see very little new aspects of the previously introduced alien species, and no new aliens. One thing we do see is our first Krogan female, who is a very cool character, though the time spent with her is short. Also, you don't see too much of the Krogan woman, but this kind of makes sense when you consider the Krogan society. Once again, every other species' females are non-existent, I guess Bioware believes the Asari provide enough females for everyone. Also, I can explain away why we don't see many of the other races' females (though we probably should see them as refugees or scientists), but I find it weird that we don't see any Turian females. From Garrus' previous stories, it has been established that females can serve in their military and can compete with the best of the males (also they're apparently very flexible but don't have much reach). The one new design that Bioware were extremely successful in creating was that of the Prothean. They succeeded in looking like the Collectors and were just extremely cool. I loved even more the reality of what their culture was in comparison to what everyone had believed. The only problem is that for some reason Bioware decided to make this important and awesome character first-day DLC.  Finally, the worst aspects of the new alien design in ME3 are the Quarians.I either wanted Bioware to keep the Quarians faces secret, or I wanted a beautiful scene to show off Tali's true face, they even had the perfect situation when they are on her home planet of Rannoch. Instead Bioware was lazy, and they just had Tali give a picture to Shepard that he could keep in his cabin. This picture showed a poorly photo-shopped stock photo of a cute human woman that probably took an hour or two to make. Every single piece of Tali fan art I've seen is a hundred times better than what Bioware chose. Since Turians and Quarians are so closely related (same amino acid structure) then they would probably look more similar to each other instead of being human (except for some tattoos and different hands). Of course, they would be also be different in many ways (the Turian world experienced a lot of radiation which caused them to develop the armor plates) and there was something about the Quarians where they have a symbiosis with the plant life on their world, and because of this their immune systems weren't fully developed (this was then made worse by years and years spent on sterile space ships). Even if Bioware wanted a mostly human design to appease Tali fans (which there is some precedent for as the eyes and nose appear human behind the mask) I've seen much better humanoid designs for Tali. I mean it's a little strange where fans are more talented and spend more time creating images of a very important design than the official developer.Here's where I'm going to stick a bunch of the random features in the game. I was a bit surprised by the complete elimination of mini-games in ME3, while they were all a little annoying before, instead of fixing them now they just removed them, and the doors/safes take a little longer to open, implying that you're automatically performing some type of hack or bypass. The reputation system is a much appreciated addition/adaptation, where you get standard reputation points for performing moral neutral actions, and every Paragon or Renegade point adds to your total. Because of this, players are no longer punished from not being an absolute character, and no matter you preference if you have enough reputation points both of the Paragon and Renegade conversation choices are unlocked. However, it is pretty goofy how the bar is filled up very early into the game, I was still getting lots of points, but there was no visual interpretation of the increase. I almost wish there was a bigger bar, or even a numerical presentation of all of your reputation points. Another new addition to this game is the War Assets and Effective Military Strength (EMS). I really liked this feature, as everything you've done in the Mass Effect series is represented here. However, once again the bar fills up incredibly early in the game. There's also some really disturbing about the EMS, and that's the aspect of Galactic Readiness, which can only be increased by playing multiplayer. So if you hate Co-op Multiplayer, or if you don't have enough money or the ability to have an Xbox Live Gold Membership, your Galactic Readiness is locked at 50%. This means that all of your War Assets will be halved for the EMF. So let's look at my level, I had 7245 points with a Galactic Readiness hovering around 100%. If I wouldn't have played Multiplayer, then I would have only had 3622 EMF points, which is enough to get the endings but is not enough to get the \"best\" ending. To put this in perspective, I played every mission available except for a few that glitched out on me. The only things that might have lowered my war assets, were that in ME1 I saved the Council, in ME2 I destroyed the Collector Base (even though for the story Cerberus still found most of it intact), and in ME3 I cured the Krogan Genophage which annoyed the Salarians. One other random thing, in ME3 you don't have someone like Kelly that will take care of your fish. The only option is to buy a crazy expensive Aquarium VI, and if you don't your fish will die, even if you feed them every chance you get. You'd think EDI would be able to monitor your fish tank for free, but I guess it'd be a little degrading considering her new role as a crew member on herself.Now onto the last aspect of the game that isn't the story, and that is the newly added Co-op Multiplayer. I was initially concerned about this aspect of the game, but I've had a lot of fun playing with it. I did have a lot of problems with the EA servers the first couple of days though, and this was exasperated by the fact that you only get experience and credits by either successfully completing the mission, or by dying. I wish that the game would save your experience after each wave, especially when any expendable items you use before you disconnect are lost forever. After this I also glitched out a couple times, once I got stuck in a wall, but I was actually still able to kill a bunch of the enemies while some of them were unable to get me. Another time I glitched out during multiplayer, it was much worse and much weirder, where the whole stage was shaking like I was in the middle of an earthquake. Then while I was running, I ended up floating in the air for a few feet before falling through the floor (I actually have a video of it but it's kind of crappy since I couldn't find my camera and used my iPod). Sadly or thankfully, my team members were a capable bunch (even though it was a silver Reaper mission) and were able to beat the 10 waves, though it took like 20 minutes where I just had to float there in nothingness and wait. The even weirder thing was that I could damage some of the enemies with biotic powers, and the enemies were able to kill me. However, once I died I would immediately come back to life. Looking past the glitches, I love leveling up the different characters, and with a group of capable players the missions can be very fun. However, after a while I grew a little bored playing the missions, they're all just too similar. Then I worked really hard on maxing out the Vanguard branch, but when I hit level 20, to get the achievement I promoted the soldiers. This is a cool idea, but I wish there was more of a reward for this, or possibly the ability to still use the high level characters when attempting a Gold level mission, or at the very least a new character plus where they get an extra bonus so you're not starting from the very beginning of the character. The biggest problem I have with the multiplayer though is that EA decided to for the first time in a AAA console game to include a freemium pricing structure for the locked characters, weapons and items. I actually find this kind of offensive, as I could play the multiplayer for hours and get a random pack someone else could get immediately by shilling out two dollars. I especially have a problem with this pricing as you could spend two dollars on a pack, and get nothing you could use. If you're going to charge for items others could get by just playing the game, I think you should be able to pick items, although of course it would make it even more unfair for people that don't want to be tricked into paying for items that are already in the game. I think that the Multiplayer could be saved with a patch, and possibly more game modes than the 10 waves that always feature the play modes capture the flag, secure the base, head-hunt certain enemies, and kill everything moving. As it currently stands, I can't see this multiplayer establishing a consistent faithful base for anything nearing long term.Now, I can finally get to the aspect of the game that had me the most upset/frustrated, and that is the story. From here on in, warning, there be major spoilers ahead. Right from the start of the game the story is goofy. A minute after our first look at the ME universe's Earth, the Reapers attack, not giving the player any time to acclimate to the game. Then a little later (after a goofy child's death that will haunt Shepard for the rest of the game) you are introduced to the game's one and only plot device, blueprints for an all-powerful weapon designed but not completed by the Protheans, called the Crucible. This is just so generic and out of the blue, it doesn't make any sense, but I was ok with playing along. You then have a mission involving each of the previous ME game's characters, some small and some large. The developers then proceed to kill off two of my favorite characters in these missions, Mordin and Thane. However, I can accept their deaths, especially since it was established previously that both of them were near death (old age and lung disease respectively) and both of them were done very well, they had good deaths. I admit that I felt serious emotion with both of them, and I may or may not have cried through the whole hospital scene.I have a lot of problems with the development of Cerberus as the main antagonist in a game about the Reapers. I understand that Bioware wanted to provide different enemies to face, and I admit that their AI and designs are excellent. However, I don't understand how Cerberus became so powerful. Every time you see them they're a step ahead of you, even when you kill hundreds or thousands of their heavily armed and trained troops. Later they kind of explain this by establishing that they created a refugee Sanctuary that was actually a Human harvesting and indoctrination factory, but it still doesn't quite add up. I didn't love Cerberus in ME2, and things they've done had always been on the border of indecency and terrorism, but it usually seemed to be in Humanity's best interest. However, in ME3 they're all crazy and doing absolutely horrible incomprehensible things, Bioware tries to say it's all because TIM has been slowly indoctrinated and he's now under control of the Reapers, but I never really thought they successfully established this. Probably the goofiest Cerberus plot line is the coup of the Citadel, which made absolutely zero sense. They somehow gained control of Udina (who while being a douche bag didn't have any connections to Cerberus and had no reason to betray the rest of the Council) and managed to infiltrate the Citadel which is supposed to be the safest and most guarded place in the Galaxy (they even again said they upgraded the security). Then they for some reason wanted to assassinate the entire council, for reasons that are never explained.Up until around halfway through the game, I didn't love the story, but I was in love with the game and having a lot of fun playing it. I mean the actual story for ME2 was pretty basic and goofy, but I still absolutely loved the game. Then, after the previously mentioned Cerberus coup of the Citadel, I received the first realization that Bioware might not care about their fans, or that they might possibly even hate us. Previously in the Citadel, you met up and talked to Kelly Chambers in the refugee camp. There was a great little scene where after asking if she wants to rejoin the Normandy, she describes the horror she experienced on the Collector ship, and that she can't be on the Normandy as it reminds her of what she faced. Instead, she's helping the refugees coming into the Citadel. I loved this little interaction, and I thought it was great fan service for people that liked Kelly. Then after the coup, when walking around the refugee camp you hear two people talking and they basically say \"Have you seen that red headed woman who was helping out so much?\" \"You didn't hear? A Cerberus soldier came up asking if she was Kelly Chambers, and after she said yes he just shot her in the head.\" \"Huh, I guess if Cerberus asks you if you're someone, you should just say no.\" \"Hah hah hah.\"  This was a character I spent the whole of ME2 talking to and growing to care about, and Bioware decided to kill her off so disrespectfully and unnecessarily, I was just absolutely horrified. I wished I could have never heard that conversation, but no, it will now always be in my brain.After this point, everything was ok, not perfect but I pretty much enjoyed all of the events and there were some truly awesome kickass scenes (I loved the fight where you called on the mother of all Thresher Maws and the brokering of peace between the Quarians and Geth), until the final battle to retake Earth. The whole strategy for retaking Earth was a little goofy, but I didn't mind it too much. There was also a great area where before the final battle you walk around the camp and talk to all of your party members, and you can even call and talk to the previous game's characters that aren't playable in ME3. The conversations are a little short, but I enjoyed all of them. Then after fighting for a while, you get to the beam to take you to the Citadel (Which was overtaken by the Reapers without any explanation of how & you can assume billions of people were killed) and everything breaks apart in a million pieces. You know the developer did something wrong when fan created explanations/interpretations make more sense than what we were actually given (The most logical being that the whole Citadel sequence was an indoctrinated dream). Other people have more succinctly examined and explained all of the different problems and plot holes, so I won't go too in depth here. Nevertheless, you are apparently hit by the Reaper's laser beam that destroys everything it touches, but here you only get some melted armor and a beat up face. You also receive a very powerful heavy pistol with unlimited ammo that you use to kill the Reaper creations between you and the teleportation beam. When you get to the beam and are transported to the Citadel, somehow both the Illusive Man and Anderson beat you to the main room. There's this whole thing where somehow TIM is able to control your body and make you shoot Anderson, but you are able to break control and kill TIM.After ascending the elevator to the merged Crucible and Citadel console, a God-like AI in the form of the dead child from Earth appears. Here, Bioware for some reason decides to give you more questions instead of providing the player with any answers. The God-child says that the Reapers are his answer to the problem that Synthetic life (pure order) will eventually completely wipe out all Organic life (pure chaos). Basically, the Reapers were created to save Organic life from Synthetics by murdering and harvesting every developed race each 50,000 years (A synthetic being created hybrids to kill organics to save them from being killed by synthetics). Through this whole interaction, Shepard acts completely subjugated and accepts everything the child says as absolute truth. You are finally given three options, you can control the Reapers (presented as the blue or Paragon choice even though it was represented by TIM, who was at least a Renegade character), you could destroy the Reapers along with all synthetic life (presented as the red or Renegade choice even though it was represented by Anderson, who was absolutely a Paragon character), or you could take the third option which would merge all organic and synthetic life (presented by no one, but this is obviously the choice that the God-child AI wants). Then, no matter what choice you make, as long as your war assets are beyond a very small level, Shepard dies, the Reapers leave Earth or are destroyed, every Mass Relay is destroyed (hopefully in a way different than what was seen in the Arrival DLC or entire systems might have been wiped out of existence), and the Normandy (After Joker apparently flees the battle on Earth) just barely escapes the blast and crash lands on an Eden-like planet, with characters that were just with you rushing the beam somehow being magically transported to the Normandy.Then that's it, the game is over except for a ridiculous conversation featuring a star-child and an old man taking place in a forest that resembles the one in Shepard's dream (and a flash of Shepard taking a breath if you had enough EMS and chose to destroy the Reapers). Oh, also there's an insulting message telling you to buy the future DLC Bioware releases, and you're set up back on the Normandy before the raid on the Cerberus base. I literally walked all around the Normandy trying to talk to everyone, and it felt like I was in a different dimension, it was just so weird and awkward. The only real difference between the three endings is the color of the beam the Crucible emits and the explosion that follows. When faced with the choice, I watched each ending on Youtube, and decided on the Green/Synthesis ending. Partly because it was the weirdest, but mostly because Edi and Joker embrace in that end, and if I had to die & the universe had to be irreversibly changed (most likely leading to many of the stranded races on Earth dying of starvation and never seeing their homes or loved ones) at least someone could find some happiness in this ending.So why am I and almost every Mass Effect fan outraged at the ending\"s\" Bioware gave us? (In one poll found on the official Mass Effect forums 91% of around 60,000 fans hated the ending and wants Bioware to change it completely, and 6% still wanted the ending slightly adjusted). First and foremost, the ending is so bleak and depressing, that there is no opportunity for happiness or even a sense of accomplishment that should come with beating a video game. I've never before played a game that punished me for beating it. Then there are so many plot holes with weird and abrupt revelations that make no sense. However, the biggest problem with the ending is that no choice that you made in all three games has any bearing on the outcome. As long as your Shepard didn't die in ME2 and you have the minimum amount of war assets or EMS in ME3 you get the same ending as someone that worked hard in each Mass Effect game and created their perfect Shepard story, maxing out all of the meters, doing all of the missions. I wouldn't have liked any ending where Shepard dies, but I could have accepted it if it was well done and provided closure, instead of just appearing to be the crumpled pieces of paper that a writer with any talent would have thrown into the trash.The prevailing sense of hopelessness despair and depression was never before found in the Mass Effect games. Even though you faced suicide missions, if you did everything right only one of your","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2012"}

Haven't we been here before? I have little doubt that Sony is going to release a Vita Slim in about a year with a few minor tweaks. The Vita is, without a doubt, an impressive system. However, it's also a costly one. The $250 price tag is just the start. Then you must buy a memory card (minimum of $20), a case, and the very expensive games (up to $50 each). I think Sony is pricing itself out of the market, especially when you can buy a Kindle Fire for $200 and be able to play games, browse the web, and check e-mail. This price point didn't work for the Nintendo 3DS, and that was with less expensive games and not having to buy a memory card. Also irritating is that Sony created yet another memory card format, so you can't use anything you already have. In retrospect, I probably would have waited a while to purchase to see if the price will drop. The Vita has not been selling well in Japan, and I was a little surprised when I stopped at Target after work today to pick up some games and discovered that they had several Vitas still in stock.The initial lineup of games is not particularly impressive. Some are titles that have been previously released on other platforms, which makes you wonder why they're still commanding a premium price. All the games seem overpriced.With a price drop and more reasonable game pricing, this could be a successful system.

You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or braving it solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support.Multiple Controller SupportMonster Hunter Trifeatures a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes.

Monster Hunter has a more serious tone and is much more difficult.  It has a learning curve, but it's worth every minute you put into it.  Single player is fun and multiplayer is a blast!  It works with Wii Speak.  You can send text messages with the controller or a USB keyboard.  The controller method is horrendous (they have a funky keyboard displayed on screen making it hard to text efficiently).  It works great using the keyboard though and most USB keyboards will work.  I originally thought I had to buy a Wii specific keyboard, but tried the old one that I had lying around and it worked!I am one person that the font appears more fuzzy.  I can read it, but it's not always easy.  I have my Wii connected to a HD widescreen television and all the settings proper on the wii...others say that theirs looks great though.  It does not take away from the fun though.  Speaking of screen...the graphics are great for a Wii game...they definitely don't match my PS3 or 360, but outstanding for a Wii game.About the Controller.  I got the bundle that included the controller and have not tried to play without it.  I really like the controller and having easy access to all buttons which you won't have with the nunchuck / wii remote.  It feels similar to a PS3 controller...only negative with it is the weight...it feels light and cheap, but it works great.About Wii Speak.  Two things to note:1) You do NOT have to exchange Wii console or friend codes.  You do have to send a message to the player online and request them to be a friend within the monster hunter game.  Once both accept, then it works like a champ.  Other players who do not have Wii Speak cannot hear you talking though :(2) Do yourself a favor and get headphones to listen to the game and speech if you are using Wii Speak.  The echo is bad otherwise.  The Wii Speak quality is already not good so the echo makes it even worse.  Besides, if you get the headphones, you will get a more surround sound experience and can turn up the audio as loud as you want when family members are sleeping (believe me it makes a big difference for me)The Online community is awesome.  There are always plenty of people online and most are very friendly...they are willing to help you even if you are a much lower rank than others.They also put special online only \"events\" and \"Arena\" missions that you get to do each week.  Some give you special tickets to allow you to get a special weapon that you can't get any other way.

The only let-down maybe after months of this game you think to yourself you played this too mcuh and now none of your achievements matter....BUT BUY THIS FOR ONE OF THE MOST INVOLVING GAM EXPERIENCES AROUND","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2002"}

However, you definitely are getting what you pay for. Simply put, the PSP is an amazing device - it has crystal clear clarity for movies, flash memory for MP3s, and a large assortment of FUN games (as opposed to the DS - but I will touch more on that later). Really, what more could you want?I don't mean to trash the Nintendo DS ( I have them both), but they clearly are not in same league. This is probably partially by design - the Nintendo DS (Judging by its assortment of games) is designed for kids under the age of 12. With the exception of Super Mario 64 - I have yet to find one game that I enjoy. The PSP already has a much better selection of games, and games that adults actually want to play - notice there is not a \"Madagascar\" for the PSP. The PSP is designed to be a total entertainment device.Here are some comparisons and pros and cons-Graphics-PSP 5 out of 5 - really they are as good as you could ever expectDS- 5 out of 5 - maybe a shade worse than the PSP- but still very goodSound -PSP - 4 out of 5 Has issues with volume (you almost have to wear the headphones) - but plenty of options for tweaking the set-upDS - 4 out 5 also a little problem with volume , but not badLoad TImesPSP-  2.5 out 5 - clearly this is where the PSP underperforms the DS. The Nintendo DS uses a flash type memory compared to the PSP's optical read. There is a large difference between the two.DS-  5 out of 5 - The Flash memory is much fasterGames -PSP-  4 out of 5 - an already large selection and growing by the day. HUGE advantage over the DSDS- 1.5 out of 5 in my opinion- it only has 1 good game. Supposedely there will be a metroid game released, but I have been waiting for 8 months.Features-PSP- Another HUGE advantage over the DS... here is a list of thing you can do on the PSP that you can NOT do on the DS-  Watch/rent movies-  Listen to MP3s off of a flash media card (Much like an ipod)-  view pictures off of your digital camera (or Sony Digital camera at least)Things you can do on the DS that you can NOT do on the PSP- draw pictures using a stylusADVANTAGE - PSPTip: Be VERY careful of the PSP screen not to get it scratched. I can see no easy way of replacing it, and to severely scratch it would be horrible. My advice is (until you can buy the \"Real\" screen cover) trim a piece of plastic wrap around the screen. The static electricity will cause the plastic wrap to stick and thus protect your screen.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2005"}

{"product_name":"B001E8VB3C","reviewerName":"M. DiSpirito \"mentored1\"","summary":"Who are you? I'M BATMAN!","reviewText":"Finally, a game based on a popular comic hero that is fun to play and true to form.  Arkham Asylum is one of those rare games that is worth paying $50+ for (something I rarely do).  Do not worry about wasting money on this title.  If you're concerned about value, wait until it's $30 and you'll be blown away at how great the game is for the price.  However, if you want some information read on...+ Graphics: the visuals are fantastic.  Character models are realistic and detailed.  There are some close-ups of Batman and Joker that make you do a double-take (\"Am I watching a movie?\").  The environments are awe-inspiring--dark, gritty, detailed, and realistic.  The art team at Rocksteady hit a home-run with the visual design of this game.  It is true to the shadowy, dark world of Batman.  Every area is interesting and detailed.  Near the top for any 360 game out right now.+ Sound: Creepy, engrossing, inspiring... It runs the gamut.  The sound effects are top-notch and sound very realistic--rain, thunder, combat, grapple-lines, batarangs, etc all sound fantastic.  The music is phenomenal.  If you like the music from the Batman movies, there are some tunes in this game that carry the same spirit but are even better.  During an encounter with Scarecrow, I felt my heart pounding from the music and sound effects alone...+ Gameplay: Rocksteady studios created a very simple, but very effective control system.  The typical double-stick move and look from most games is in place and works perfectly.  Ducking is simply holding a trigger and cover is utilized with one button (like Gears of War).  Batman can move on the ground, below the ground (tunnels, grates, etc), and above the ground (ledges, walkways, rooftops, statues, et al) with ease.  Grappling is as simple as looking at where you want to go and hitting a button.  The game gives you a heads-up with the proper areas marked with available actions.  In a nutshell, the controls are so simple that you'll be sucked into the game without much of a learning curve.+ Combat: fast-paced, action-packed, and easy to accomplish--what else do we need?  Batman's primary attack is a single button, but the primary attack can be combined with batarangs, counter-moves, dodging, and other Batman-unique moves.  When you're fighting multiple enemies, the simple system really shines.  Combat isn't button-mashing, as it might sound, but it is tactical: counter an incoming kick, grab his leg, throw him into another attack, backflip from a guy swinging a lead pipe, somersault towards him and kick him in the jaw... you get the picture.  There is a whole suite of moves for ground combat, stealth takedowns, and aerial takedowns; but every type of combat is laid it in simple, easy-to-use button controls.+ Challenge: Not only will you face some of Batman's key enemies (Joker, Scarecrow, Zsasz, Croc, Harley Quinn, Bane, etc), but you'll face puzzles set up by the Riddler throughout Arkham.  Key allies will be taken hostage (Gordon, Arkham doctors, etc) and you'll need to save them--alive.  Sometimes remaining unseen is the challenge, as the lunatics will kill their hostage if they see you.  The default difficulty is fairly challenging (there are three levels of difficulty) and this is further compounded by the fact that Batman is not a superhero!  Only a few bullets will end your game; a group of thugs kicking, punching, and wielding pipes will end your adventure right quick.  Be smart, use the environment, use your gadgets, and you might survive Joker's trap.+ Perks: As you complete challenges and defeat enemies, you'll gain Experience that allows you to choose from a broad and interesting selection of upgrades.  You can power-up your combat techniques (open new moves, increase damage or speed, etc), or enhance your gadgets (multiple batarangs, explosive gel, etc).  As an example, the game starts with a single batarang toss (you have unlimited batarangs) that stuns a foe, but after a few upgrades I am able to throw three batarangs at three different enemies that all knock the foe down.  There are a lot of different combinations of upgrades to experiment with...+ Extras: you'll unlock character biographies in the game as you encounter people.  To a nerd like me, these were very intriguing: each biography has a comic artwork page, a background story, a vital statistic, and a skill set about the character.  Reading the history of people in Batman's world is very intriguing and sometimes helps to understand the motivations in the game.  Also, you'll unlock character trophies, which are 3-D models of characters, vehicles, and locations in the game; while not really important, it is interesting if you're a nerd.  And the best of the extras: Challenge mode.  As you defeat enemies and complete levels, you'll open up a challenge match: a single level that can be played apart from the main story where you'll have to take out various enemies in specific types of moves or conditions (don't be seen, don't get hit, etc).  The first one to be unlocked has Batman in a small prison area fighting an increasing number of goons with each successive wave.- Cons: some minor clipping issues--character arms, legs, or heads can go into a wall; it's not a game-breaker, it just looks bad.  Not much else...+/- Story: the story is fantastic and incredibly compelling, but some folks may not like the constraints imposed.  Joker is in control of Arkham, so there are certain areas that Batman can't get to unless Joker allows him to--it feels linear, and it is, but it's part of the story.  Also, Batman acts out dialogue without user input; it may irk some gamers looking for more freedom, but it's Batman--he is who he is.  Also, as Batman, you cannot use guns or kill people (it will end the game and cause you to restart from the last save); it is true to Batman's character, so I find it part of the experience, but I just wanted to let you know.Conclusion: I'M BATMAN!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2009"}
{"product_name":"B007TYC8MI","description":"","reviewerName":"GarionOrb","summary":"Yes, it's more God of War.  But it's still incredible!","reviewText":"God of War: Ascension has it tough.  Despite being only the second current-generation God of War game released, it (understandably) has a really hard time convincing gamers that they have to play it.  This is because Sony is so in love with the success of the franchise, it re-released both PS2 and both PSP games on the PS3 platform.  A single package, God of War Saga, was even released that includes all five games.  A daunting package which contains approximately 40-50 hours of what is, and let's face it, identical gameplay.  Sure some games have small combat mechanics that others don't, but in the end, it's the same linear path, the same well-made cutscenes, and the same quick-time events.  That's not to say they're bad games.  Far from it.  The God of War saga are games every gamer should play.  God of War I in particular stands out as one of the finest video games ever created.  Its sequel, God of War II, is just as spectacular.  God of War III ends the trilogy well, and the two PSP titles are good, but not 100% necessary.  So what about Ascension...is it worth your time?  Is it worth full price?  I have to say...the answer is `absolutely' to both questions.Chronologically, Ascension takes place before any of the other games.  Yeah yeah, it's another prequel, and as such the story isn't quite as strong as that of the main trilogy.  It revolves around Kratos being imprisoned by the Furies as a result of breaking his blood oath to Ares, the god of war.  In order to fully break the oath, he must destroy the Furies.  The story, interestingly, is told somewhat out of order.  You start at one point in time, then it flashes back to what happened prior to that.  This happens a couple of times, and may feel a little jarring, but it's nothing that detracts from the game.  The gameplay is instantly familiar to anyone who's played any of the games, but we knew that going in.  The thing is, Ascension delivers in every single way that you'd expect any AAA game to deliver.  It is by far the most strikingly gorgeous-looking God of War game to date.  Sometimes, it's hard to believe this is still the PS3 and not the upcoming PS4.  Also, the gameplay is even more refined than it was in God of War III (the last PS3 game in the series), and you'll have no problem going back to executing killer combos and feeling like super powerful.  And speaking of powerful, this game's new approach to magic and weapons is absolutely phenomenal.  At first, when you realize the only weapon in the game is the Blades of Chaos, you may feel put off that there isn't more variety.  But fairly early in the game, you get powers from the gods: lightning, fire, ice and Hades' souls.  Each one gives a different attribute to your blades, and being able to switch between them on the fly and execute their \"Rage\" moves and magic attacks lends itself to some pretty intense battles.  The magic powers in particular are quite powerful and look so intense you can't help the feeling of satisfaction.The game's only real weakness would be the level design.  It's not *bad*...just a little run-of-the-mill.  The locales are interesting, but the series has gone to more interesting places before.  However, as you near the end of the game, things get much more interesting.  The section titled \"The Trial of Archimedes\" is fantastic.  One particular battle sequence has an unfortunate difficulty spike the likes of which God of War has never seen, but it's not impossible (and, sadly, is due to be patched by the developers to lower that difficulty spike).New to the God of War series with Ascension is a multiplayer mode.  Early in the game, Kratos frees a prisoner held in the Hecatonchires who quickly gets teleported...somewhere.  That somewhere turns out to be an arena of the gods.  As that prisoner, you choose which god to align yourself with (each grants different attributes), go through a quick tutorial, and off you go.  There's a good 4 vs. 4 arena mode, and other modes with deathmatch and capture-the-flag-type gameplay.  The maps are laid out like any other God of War level.  Fully third person like you're playing the single-player portion, complete with special battle combos and attacks.  It's something I personally have never played before, and it's loads of fun!  After each round, you get experience points and skill points, which you can use to spruce up your warrior.  It's surprisingly deep, and while my first inclination upon hearing about God of War multiplayer was to roll my eyes, I'm finding myself loving it.  It's a great little add-on to the epic single-player portion of the game, and serves to add some good replayability to this game.So yeah, the gameplay is familiar, and there is nothing in God of War: Ascension that you haven't seen before in the other God of War games.  But there is honestly nothing wrong with that!  This game has a worthwhile story, some tight and well-implemented gameplay, amazing powers, unbelievable graphics and just overall immaculate presentation.  It is a game that shouldn't be passed up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2013"}

But that has also been to the extremes in its handheld DS as well. For the past 5 years, the Nintendo DS has taken over the portable handheld game system market by storm, and shows that Nintendo has made its joy to gamers young and old alike, and doesn't show any sign of stopping soon. When Nintendo launched the DS Lite, they also changed the scope of the system by making it lighter, but keeping the gameplay the same as was before when the DS launched in 2004. Now, Nintendo is set to make the DS go to the next generation, with music, photos, and gameplay of new kinds of audiences.The new Nintendo DSi, is the latest incarnation to Nintendo's DS handheld empire and shows a delivering appeal to young and old gamers alike. It expands what made the hard core system had delivered for the past 5 years, and takes it to new snapshots and gamers delights' of all kinds. The device is sleeker than the original DS, and DS Lite alone, and includes a lot of new great features here, including the ability to download new video games, surf the internet on the go, playback music,  take photos wherever you please with a delightful digital camera. It has a lot of great features here that work very well, and make it more convient for DS owners. Not only can you play nearly all your favorite DS games, you can now have improved features here like a shorter recharging time than the DS Lite, and you can also have a long battery too that works just as well. Nintendo also shows that it has expanded the system and borrows some of its features from the success of the Wii, into not just a easy to use main menu that works nicely with a simple touch of the DS stylus, but with new features here too.The added features here are also nice including the new Nintendo DSi Shop, where just like the Wii Shop Channel for the Wii, you can download new exclusive and great games exclusively for the DSi including new versions of Wario Ware, and a new Brain Age Express: Math, a new smaller version of the wildly-addictive puzzle game, that not only is adjusted to math, but brings in a loads of fun. Another new game called Birds & Beans brings in a classic gameplay action, where you can stretch a tongue by collecting beans falling from the sky. Using the DS stylus, the harder the bean to catch, the more points you can score.The digital camera is also a huge bonus here. The new extension here is the replacement for the retired Game Boy Advanced slot from the previous DS systems. You can take great photos of all kinds, and store them on a simple SD card, on in the DSi's internal memory. The camera is a great treat for gamers and those who've never owned a digital camera before either. You can take loads of great pictures here, and change the background and photo itself too, whether you can alter the image of the pictures' color or distorting the image of the photo, and making the photo have a mirror-image too.Yet, with all of the great features here, there actually are a couple of casualties on the new Nintendo DSi that might come as a surprise for the eyes, and the snaphots. The first big disadvantage is the fact that the Game Boy Advanced Slot has been removed here. While it does show that Nintendo has moved on from its GBA days, it does leave a few DS casualties here itself as well. It also is a disadvantage for DS gamers from before too. Not only can you not be able to play GBA games, but you also will not be able to use some DS accessories that worked from that same GBA slot too. If you have the DS Rumble Pak, you won't be able to use it with games compatable with the device like Metroid Prime Pinball and recent DS games like Moon and Need For Speed: Undercover. Not only that, but if you own either of the Guitar Hero: On tour titles, you also won't be able to play them on the DSi either, because the guitar accessory that came with the game, that plugged in the GBA slot on the previous DS systems, is a big casualty on this system.The second disadvantage is the music playback here. While I love the idea that you actually can record classic phrases and music snippets here, they are in the lesser-known AAC format. The music playback is sadly also in the lesser-known format. Unlike Sony's PSP, where you can playback music in the more popular MP3 and Windows Media formats, it is a tougher sell here. But hopefully, Nintendo could make the music playback fit down the road to suit those MP3 music needs.All in all, despite those few faults, the new Nintendo DSi is still a great delight, and expands beautifully for those hard core gamers young and old alike who want more for their DS needs. I really love the new system, and I think it is a great buy for all your new gaming needs. If you still have the earlier Nintendo DS system, you'll definitely want to take a great picture of this into your mind, as a delightful joy and a great deal of fun for all your favorites' in gaming.Graphics: ASound: AControl: AFun & Enjoyment: B+Price: B+Overall: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2009"}

I read an article that this is a thriller and could be scary.  Not a horror movie fan myself, I hesitated.I tried anyway and see what the deal is.  At first you do get a sense of \"in the movie\".  The dreaded feeling of walking down a dark forest is real, for the first few scenes.  After a chapter, that feeling is gone.This game is good and fun.  There are several letdowns.  For one thing, you will know what to expect in each corner.  The \"dark\" souls were scary at first.  After a few kills, you will know how to get rid of them - they are predictable.  Second, the game is very linear - you cannot do something that the game designer does not want you to do.  Third, the game is very short.  I completed the game in under 6 hours.  There is no replay value in this game that I could think of.  Finally, the ending is very disappointing.  You shoot 3 shots of flare gun in the dark vortex and it is over.  There is a box full supply of flare gun that I never get to use.I am giving this 4 starts because I think this game is fun, the concept is different.  I wish it was a little longer.  The game came with a download, \"follow the signal\".  I think it was an after thought to increase playability of the game.  I haven't finished it, but I can tell that it is very much the same as the main game.  Shoot, run, and light vs. dark.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2011"}

Whitecotton","summary":"Over hyped, over sold, lacks key features of games with similar budgets","reviewText":"-- NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE PC VERSION, BUT MANY THINGS STILL APPLY TO CONSOLES --Before down rating or saying this review was not helpful, please read the entire review. If you have not played the game, don't just say it wasn't helpful because I'm giving the game 1 star. If you have played the game, I'm sure you'll agree with most of the points. Some may not agree with the multiplayer point, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion.I'll just start out with one of the most disappointing aspects of the game: without multiplayer, Skyrim just seems boring. I'd be more interested in grouping up with friends/family to do some quests and take on beasts. I'd like to do things as a group, send people things, sell some stuff I made, have an auction house, do things that require multiplayer functionality. In this day and age, I cannot fathom WHY they wouldn't include multiplayer functionality. With as much hype as it had, and as much money as they will surely make off this game.. they could have made it multiplayer. I'm sure fan boys will come up with a thousand excuses, like \"the game focuses on YOU, it's a solo game\".. that works for Dragon Age and DA2, and heck even The Witcher 2 was simply amazing. But Skyrim is simply boring - and I've played through the Dragonslayer storyline and put 66 hours into this game.The closest you get to multiplayer is having a NPC \"follow\" you. Problem is, the follower isn't intelligent and the following distance makes no sense. Your follower will stop in the middle of the doorway, making it impossible for you to get out. You have to go backwards and run forwards into them a few times before they'll move.. but sometimes they WONT move. You have to go to the farthest corner of the room and hope they will follow you into the room a little further. The more I played the game, the more I found this annoying! As another example, I called down Odahviing and lured him into the trap, gone and talked to guard to release him, and for some moronic reason my \"follower\" attacks him as soon as he was released! I had listened to all Odahviing's spill, etc, and it hadn't saved anything. I had to go back and do all that again - just a huge nuisance. Your follower will attack anything, even if you set them to Wait. I even dismissed my follower and they said \"You know where to find me if you need me\", and I proceeded to attack a mob and my follower (which at this point should no longer be assisting me) joined in and started killing other trash. Seriously, come on.There's also the issue of trying to sell your loot you've acquired. Good luck finding an NPC (non playable character) that will take it. In most games, you can go to any merchant and dump your items. NOT SO IN SKYRIM! Each merchant has their own specific categories of items they will buy from you, and also a 48hour (in game time) limit on how much gold they have to buy your goods. So one vendor might only buy your food. One might buy your ingredients and potions. One might buy your armor but not weapons. So you gotta run around EVERYWHERE just to dump your loot. And also, when you collect books, they typically weigh 1lb each, and seeing as how you start with a carrying capacity of 300lb, you can QUICKLY get overburdened if you like to collect every book you see. Now I dont even both keeping books. Even as the game wears on, potions weigh .5 each and you could carry 50lb of potions easily.As for graphics, the game is dull, mostly with various shades of black/white/grey/tans. Come on. There is the rare pink or faded red, but for a game that boasts really great graphics (like mountains that come into view) who cares if there's no color. I want VIVID colors. If its snowing, that's fine, but give me some damn color. The most positive thing I can say, is they made the graphics look really detailed and gave great depth to even small items, but I would prefer more color over trying to be so realistic. the real world is colorful, not just detailed.Another issue is the late game leveling and skill trees. As for the skill trees, Dragonplate armor is not the best heavy armor you can make. Yes, it requires 100/100 skill. But Daedric heavy armor is better and requires 90/100. What the heck?! The whole game is about DRAGONS, you are a DRAGONBORN and your entire purpose is to defeat Alduin so that he cannot consume the world. The Daedric quests/storylines are not even INTERTWINED! They're entirely separate and the different Daedric princes dont even seem to know or care about each other, much less the quests you've already done for them. And yet Daedric heavy armor is better.. I will admit it looks better, but I was surprised as heck when comparing the stats. Light armor, the Dragonscale armor is the best but seriously why would wear to worse armor in a solo game, you need the best protection available.For leveling, I'm referring to how leveling \"levels off\" after about lvl 35. You really start to progress a lot slower, and your skill points in your different spec trees are IMMOVABLE. You can't reset them, so the choices you made early on are STUCK. Some of the points you spent not really understanding their impact on game-play, are there forever. What a PAIN. I know I don't use 2H weapons, but I can't do anything to move those points around. I guess I shouldn't have expected such modular functionality in a game like Skyrim, where attention to custom gameplay details is NOT in the details.As far as bugs/glitches/crashes go, this game comes with a ton (crashes specifically for the PC version). Some glitches are trivial, such as when I'm jumping, it seems I wont jump ON TOP of things. It jumps \"into\" things. I'll be inside a table, and you cant jump twice.. once you're in you gotta kinda glitch off. Also, I will half way \"jump\" up the side of a railing or curb, but can't get on top of it.. The glitches and random crashes just run rampant. I've got two watercooled GeForce GTX 580 FTW Hydro Copper 2's in SLI, as well as a oc'd 980X and 12GB ram - there is simply no hardware limitation that would be causing the random crashes. I've read plenty of websites detailing some 2GB memory limitation in Skyrim, perhaps there is and that's why its crashing. It seems to crash at the most inopportune times as well.. you know, like after you've cleared a bunch of trash in a dungeon.. and it crashes and you restart it and you realize you've got 10 minutes of trash clearing to do again. The PC version, at least, comes with plenty of annoyances, such as the STEAL key default to the same key as the INTERACT key. So I go to buy something from a vendor.. press E.. Bam! You're getting interrogated by a guard and you're thrown in jail or paying a fine.Overall, I played 66 hours of Skyrim for ONE reason - I paid $60 for the game over Steam and they have a NO REFUND policy. I figured since I spent my hard earned cash on the game, and I couldn't return it, I would at least play through the key storyline and do some of the side quests. It was utterly boring, tons of annoyances with the glitches, and I'm just glad to not have to play it anymore. I don't feel as guilt about paying $1 per hour of gameplay, but when comparing it to the hundreds of hours of gameplay you could get multiplayer games like Rift and WoW, or BF3 if you're into FSP and like driving tanks/flying planes.. anyway, this game just doesn't make the cake. I give it 1 out of 5 stars, it's overpriced, over hyped, and under developed.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2011"}
{"product_name":"B005IMVP0O","description":"","reviewerName":"Bobby Shornock","summary":"The Successor to the PSP is a very good system, but.....","reviewText":"DO NOT GET RID OF YOUR PSP's....YET, you cannot download or play any Playstation 1 game onto the Vita, you cannot download most of your PSP games(Even if you have them digitally downloaded), hell, you can't even download the mini Angry Birds yet.  Some things will probably never be supported on the Playstation Vita, making the PSP currently an entirely different handheld for the budget gamer($99-$129 with cheaper Lexar and Sandisk Memory PRO DUO cards as well as micro SD to PRO DUO adapters)Here's my take on the Playstation Vita, it's a very good system capable of a lot of things.  I will go over each item in detail.A lot of people will complain about certain areas of LiveArea, however, I feel that it simplified the interface and also made it better.  The only thing I wish for is sorting of games into a new LiveArea Window.  For example:  PSVita, PSP, PSOne, PS2, PS3/PSN(For thedual platform games), Mini's, NeoGeo.  The applications and settings however are very well done.  Friends, Party, PS Store, near, Settings, Group Messaging, Trophies, Network Operator(For At&T; 3G setup), Content Manager(For connecting the Vita to your PS3 or PC to transfer data, game saves, movies, pictures, games from the PC, etc),  Give it a try and you will find it makes sense after an hour or less.Remote Play currently only works for Mini's and PSOne games(But will not directly play PSOne games), it is very easy to set up(Register your Vita to your PS3 via Remote Play Settings, using my Skyrim Dynamic Theme on the Vita's remote play, there is a little big of lag unfortunatly, but I'm not sure if that is wifi related or what, every video played from your PS3 is playable on your Vita, and the quality is amazing.  One thing about Vita Video playback though is that you cannot use the arrow keys to 1.5x, 10x, 30x, 120x with non-remote play, however, if you tap the screen a menu comes up, you can either drag your green circle to wherever you want the video to play, you can jump back 15 seconds, you can fast forward 15 seconds, or go to the beginning.  I like this feature overall.  The Videos screen allows you to choose between All, or Rented, I am not sure if other options open up based on how you obtain videos.One interesting thing to note is that there are multiple windows you can keep open, just like an Android phone and just like Microsoft Windows.  This is what makes LiveArea really good.  Also if you hit the PS Button, in the top right corner you can check your notifications, and it tells you a LOT, your download progression, if you have a new message, people that are playing in Near, any pictures, videos, or music you download from the web(Yes you can save images), when applications install, you are told.  Any trophies you earn, any parties you join or leave, all the notifications are sorted by ALL, NOTIFICATIONS, or DOWNLOADS for easier navigating.Touch the Livearea right or left, you can switch between applications, Friends, Movies, Playstation Store Trophies, even your most recent game, all of that is able to run at the same time and more, making it very multitasker friendly.  Those same windows can be closed by swiping the screen in the motion you are removing a window, or waking up your Vita from the powered off state.Party, this feature is AWESOME and should be adapted to the PS3 already like Xbox already has!  You can create your own parties, or join an existing party, you can also save favorite parties to join people's easier.  You can invite people from both PS3 and PSVita, however as of this review, I am unsure if PS3 users can join Parties.  There is also text based chat, as well as voice chat, which sounds really good.The Playstation Store looks different than on a PS3/PSP.  Game, Video, and Search still exist as main features.  There are tabs for Features, New Releases, Top Downloads, and All.  If you click the ... in the bottom right, you have additional options, Redeem Codes, Download List(Be warned, most will not work on your PSVita, out of my 900 maybe 20 work at the time of this writing), Services List(Limited Editions, Saints Row Season Pass, Music Unlimited, Playstation Home stuff, etc), and Transaction Management(Add Funds to Wallet, Transaction History, Security, Subscription Settings, Billing Information)The Prices of all Playstation Store Vita Games as of 2/16/12:  Hot Shots Golf World Invitational:  $35.99(With an Online Pass), ModNation Racers:  Road Trip:  $26.99, Uncharted:  Golden Abyss:  $44.99, Wipeouts 2048:  $35.99(Online Pass if you buy USED), Super Stardust Delta:  $9.99, Escape Plan:  $14.99, Little Deviants:  $26.99, Asphalt Injection:  $26.99, BlazBlue Continuum Shift EXTEND:  $34.99, EA Sports Fifa Soccer:  $39.99, Dungeon Hunter Alliance:  $35.99, F1 2011:  $39.99, Lumines Electronic Symphony:  $35.99, Michael Jackson The Experience:  $35.99, Rayman Origins:  $35.99, Ultimate Marvel Vs Capcom 3:  $39.99, Virtua Tennis 4:  World Tour Edition:  $34.99, Super Stardust Delta Interstellar Bundle:  $14.99, Modnation Racers:  Road Trip - Unlock All Content:  $5.99, Super Stardust Delta Blast Pack:  $7.99, Protection Plans for 1 and 2 years(1 year $29.99, 1 year AD $44.99, 2 year $39.99, 2 year AD $69.99)Near is a very cool feature as it gives you progression, purchases, or other feats, kinda like a Facebook wall.  It also shows you how far people are that are playing from you, within a 10km radius.  It also keeps track of how far you travel with your Playstation Vita(Driving), Friends activities(Achievements, milestones, games played, when you play a game for the first time, any trophies obtained, and anything purchased.  Using the service is optional, if you make your information public, people can see what you are doing(And that's always fun, to me anyways), the game also tracks your Discoveries, I have not gotten one yet so no idea how it works.Group Messaging is an interesting feature, it's android style text messaging, you can even share camera images from the Vita.  The touchscreen works very well.  If you own a Playstation 3, be warned, this WILL spam your messages folder, so you will get every notification on your PS3 as well as your Vita.  Would be a nice thing to turn off, unless there was something important you wanted to save.  Still it makes messaging very easy, say you're at work and can't play a game, but you can text people.  You can also refresh the messages.Trohpies are on the Vita!  Broken up into two categories, PSVita System alone, and Playstation Network.  It would be cool if they added a third option for filtering, Playstation 3 Trophies.  When in Playstation Network filtering, you can compare your trohpies with one friend at a time, which works well since the images for the trophy information is big.  You can compare trophies by your Friends, Shared Play History(I assume like Recent Friends played with on the PS3).  What I really like about trophy comparing is the sort options, you can sort by last updated, Format(PS3/PSVita), Name of the Game(Classic PS3 style), Progress(BShornock), or the other person, with the option to refresh.  If you are like me and have over 100 games with Trophies, seeing every game will take a couple minutes, however, you are not forced to sit on the Syncing with Server menu like you are on the Playstation 3.The Browser will not allow you to play Facebook games, as the version of flash is not able to run it, so the hackers will be working on that I am sure.  But other than that it works pretty well.The worst feature currently has to be everything 3G related, the Maps feature is very slow, but it does show streets well, however it is terrible with distance.  And setting up your DataConnect Pass is a pain, I tried 3 times and couldn't register.  Do yourselves a favor and stick with Wifi.The second worst feature has to be the price point and the price of memory cards, but that does not take away from the quality of the system, which is top notch.The battery to me is very good, a full charge is roughly 4-5 hours, and that's while using the brightest settings and wifi.  The extra 2 years will serve to be very helpful if you ever need to have your battery replaced by Sony, or for accidental damage, so I recommend buying that, especially if you have kids that like to play with things and have no idea what they are doing when they throw your vita on the ground shattering the screen.Little Deviants is very Underrated, people said that the game is horrible, but like a lot of SONY Playstation Move games, it captures the touch features in a way that is innovative and fun!  Shame on those who rated it down.  Go try the demo if you don't believe me.And the 4GB stick is plenty if you don't plan on downloading demos, PSP games, full PSVita games, or put a lot of your music or videos on your device.  Your mileage will vary.The Limited Edition case is a hard plastic case that is very durable, and made well.  The zipper has the Playstation word on it, and like the PSP, this case has a pouch for your Peripherals, and 4 of your games, however, you can always sandwich bag your games to fit more in the pouch, you can fit headphones, you can probably even fit a card case snugly.  Don't try shoving your cradle in here however it's too thick to fit.  The Starter Kit Vita case only holds the PSVita, no games, no accessories.There will be people that will wait for a $149/$199 price point, and that's fine, but you might be missing out on a great handheld gaming experience that is beautiful to look at and play with.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2012"}

They were so annoying I forgot their names. There were a few parts of the story that was good, like the dream or Flashback Luna had and the ending was decent if you saw the whole thing. There were 2 things in the game you had too do in order to get the complete ending. If you didn't do those 2 things, the ending in my opinion wouldn't have been good.

Garrelts","summary":"Fun at First...","reviewText":"So I finally got around to playing and beating Assassin's Creed. I kept putting it off time and again because I had been warned that the game was overrated and extremely repetitive by some friends. To a large extent they were spot-on correct. Had I written a review for Assassin's Creed in the first 2 or 3 hours that I played it I would've given the game 5-stars. Now after beating the game, I'm genuinely glad it's over and feel that at best it's a 2-star game.First, the plot of AC isn't at all what I was expecting. The game is actually set in the near future not during the Crusades. Although you'll be spending most of your time in the year 1191. Confused? Yep, well the story will start to make more sense as you play along. Suffice to say that a shadowy group in the year 2012 has kidnapped Desmond - your character - and holding him hostage. Desmond is then forced to use a machine called the \"Animus\" to relive memories of his Assassin ancestors that are somehow imprinted on his DNA. It's far fetched but interesting.Your enter your first memory as Altair - an arrogant and reckless Assassin - on a mission to recover an artifact from the Crusaders. The first mission goes terribly wrong and Altair is to blame. The leader of the Assassins, Al Mualim strips Altair of his rank and prestige and sets Altair about regaining his lost honor. Al Mualim gives Altair the task of killing 9 individuals in order to set things right. With that you're released to explore the world around you and kill your first mark in Damascus.The world consists of 4 cities - Maysaf, Damascus, Jerusalem and Acre. Maysaf serves as the Assassin's hub and the other 3 cities are where you'll find your marks. Each city consists of 3 zones - Wealthy, Middle Class and Poor districts. At first only one zone in each city is available; as the story progresses more zones open up.This is where the first problems really creep in. As soon as you arrive in Damascus to find your first mark you'll be locked into a very rigid mission structure. Regardless of how open the game claims to be it is actually the exact opposite. You first arrive outside the city gates, sneak into the city via some scholarly assistance and find yourself again confined to whatever zone you're in. The next task is to find a tower to climb in order to \"sync\" your map. Essentially you climb towers to reveal the locations of important story-related activities.Each zone has a predetermined amount of towers to climb. That reveals citizens who need assistance from thugs, eavesdropping events, pickpocketing locations and other assassins that either need help or are testing you. At first this seems rather rewarding and somewhat addicting. Saving citizens from thugs garners you support of mobs that you can use to avoid city guards. Eavesdropping on certain conversations grants you a key piece of information about your target. So an and so forth. The objective is to reveal as much of the map as possible, collect pertinent information on your mark and report back to the local Assassin's office to prepare for the assassination.While this is initially rewarding, the fact that you have to repeat the exact same actions again and again - 9 times total by games end - will leave you groaning in boredom and tediousness. After dutifully climbing each tower, saving each citizen and completing every other tedious task set forth for about 3 marks I'd had enough. You'll quickly realize that most, if not all of the tasks aren't essential to complete the mission. You can completely ignore the citizens in peril, find 3 pickpocketing or eavesdropping events which garner you the required 3 key pieces of information and then simply report to the Assassin's office in whatever city you're visiting. Then it's just a matter of tracking down your mark, killing him and then losing your pursuers. It's really that simple. Though by games end you'll likely be numb from the tedium.Combat too starts out interestingly enough but soon becomes all to repetitive. Altair gains more abilities and improved weapons as the game goes on. At some point you gain the ability to counter enemy attacks and this is where the game really becomes simple. In essence just tapping a button at the correct moment is all you need in order to defeat every enemy in the game.The scale and the graphics of Assassin's Creed are clearly the standout. I played through the game a full year after it was released and it is still impressive. The cities are genuinely beautifully rendered, although the luster will most certainly fade once you realize just how similar each city really is.Assassin's Creed is definitely worth playing. Though I can't honestly recommend anyone purchase the game. Without the useless fetch quests what's left can easily be completed in a few hours. Stick with a rental.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2009"}

It's probably the best Kinect game next to Dance Central. The game is easy for anyone to jump into. My 7yo learned everything it had to offer in about an hours time. She has never been so addicted to a game before. It gets them off the couch, and is a very active game. Lots of kicking, rolling, running and jumping. Considering it's a launch game, I was very impressed how in depth and how much the player was able to do. Besides the kinect motions itself, what really impressed me was how great this game looks. It's obviously the best looking pet game in existence and kids will fall in love with these furry funny felines as soon as the game starts. It's a good mesh of taking care of your pet and setting off a big adventure with your pet on this tropical island. I myself find myself playing it a little bit and I was amazed how much I enjoyed it.The only down side with the game is that the controls can be frustrating for little ones and patience is the key. The kicking of the ball and throwing balls and toys at targets can be challenging. But it takes some patience and adjusting to the controls to get it down. The game also has voice recognition for your pet and sometimes it doesn't seem to always respond to your orders or tricks when called out. But overall, it seemed pretty consistent.This is a must have game if you have the Kinect, and if you have children, it's a no brainer. Just make sure your kids do their homework before they play this one, because they won't want to quit!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002I0F5M8","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"The Dark Knight Returns","reviewText":"When the original Arkham Asylum came out in 2009 it more or less took the gaming world by storm.  It did so for two reasons.  The first was that before Arkham Asylum most of us couldn't remember the last time Batman was actually given a good game.  The second was that it was a very well put together game.  A game that, for the most part, is hard to follow up.  Arkham City does the original justice.  It's bigger (definitely) but most of all it retains much of the same charm.The story here is actually amusing in some ways.  The game is set one year after the events of Arkham Asylum where Warden Sharp is now the mayor.  After the events of Arkham Asylum he has moved the prisoners to a new bigger place dubbed Arkham City.  Here, the villains run around in a place where anarchy pretty much rules and somehow Batman finds himself in this madhouse.  There are a ton of villains and a ton of story to undertake.  There is a lot going on, but it's hard to say the story is quite as focused as the original game.  It's a great story and all, but one of the things you'll notice about Arkham City right off the bat is that the game just might be a little too big to handle.  It's stuffed to the brim with villains, most of whom don't get much screen time.  This makes for less development of the villains but with a cast this big, going above and beyond in character development is harder.  Some familiar faces return from Arkham Asylum as well.  Nevertheless, though the villains may not have much development they are still strangely interesting because some of them are presented to us so well.When you are traversing through the story, however, it's very well presented.  Without a doubt one of Arkham City's finest achievements is the visual spectacle of it all.  Everything is dark and gritty.  Every last detail begs you to look at it.  If there's one thing we can definitely say about Arkham City it's that it definitely pulls you into its fictional world with is amusing aesthetics and visual design.  This is made better by the voice acting throughout the story.  Certainly the game doesn't focus a little too much on the villains because there are a lot, but when you run into them they're voiced very well and the dialog is also very well written.  Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill return to reprise their roles of Batman and the Joker respectively.  If you enjoyed the animated television series of the 90's you're more likely to enjoy Arkham City's overall presentation and story.Batman Arkham City doesn't play too terribly different from Arkham Asylum.  When in combat it can, at times feel like a button masher.  You'll be able to string together long combos along with performing takedowns or counters to deliver the pain on your enemies.  You'll also gain experience which you can use to level up and learn skills.  If it were all about button mashing to get through the game, however, it wouldn't be quite as engaging in other ways.Like Arkham Asylum before it, you can put on detective mode to learn more about your enemies in the area.  This will allow you to see through walls, pinpoint enemies holding weapons or those who may be panicked... or even just using the mechanic to find secrets.  And it is very easy to be sidetracked in Arkham City because not only is there the main story, but there are also side quests, Riddler tropies and riddles to solve as well.  It is very possible to go through Arkham City and still have a lot of the game left to explore.  The only real downside to detective mode is that you won't be able to admire the games visual presentation if you keep it on throughout the experience.  And most players will find that detective mode is a very useful way to play the game as is.There are, of course, other ways you can feel like Batman.  As you go through the game you'll also find several gadgets, but more importantly certain areas have other means to go about them.  Like Asylum, you can perform glide kicks, stealth takedowns and zipline across the level or use your grapple.  There's a lot you can do but the way it all comes together is simple enough so that the player doesn't feel overwhelmed.  There are even moments where the game puts a large emphasis on a strategic takedown of your enemies as opposed to always just dropping in and kicking butt.  So even if you saw Arkham City as a button masher, it isn't likely to get you through the game anyway in areas where say... all the bad guys are using guns.  Thanks to these moments as well as the gadgets and various amounts of villains there is a lot of variety here.  The boss encounters you find yourself in are among the most unique in the game.  For example, the encounter with Mr. Freeze puts you in the position of finding out various takedowns for him... but the same one will rarely work twice because he learns from his mistakes.  Arkham City isn't exactly an easy game either.  If you somehow manage to mess up, the game is always willing to provide you hints and help you out.Arkham Asylum was a hard game to follow up.  Mostly because it showed us how a Batman game should be done.  Batman Arkham City is just as good.  In some ways it's better.  It's a lot of fun to play, has an amusing story, but most of all there's just a lot to do.  Many a gamer will no doubt stumble through Arkham City and still leave a lot of ground uncovered.  There's a lot of replay here... and a lot of exploring to do.  The game is bigger and better but in a careful manner.  It primarily keeps true to the things which worked so well in Arkham Asylum.  If you played Arkham Asylum and enjoyed it, then Arkham City really does prove to be a worthy follow up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2011"}

Roman","summary":"The best Skylanders to date.","reviewText":"THE SKYLANDERS CAN FINALLY JUMP!...sorry, I'm just still excited over them finally being able to do such a simple action. It only took three games!Skylanders Swap Force initially didn't seem like a full game to me. Giants had only been out for a while, and from the first couple of gameplay videos I saw, it looked like a big expansion pack with a few new characters and a new mechanic rather than a full fledged sequel. Fortunately for everyone, Swap Force may be the best Skylanders game yet. Not only can you finally jump(!) but the swap mechanic is actually fun and adds a bit of depth to the game with how your character plays. There are tons of different combinations you can make with the characters here, so much to the point where I actually tried every combination with the figures that we have. If you were a little underwhelmed by Giants, Swap Force may be just what you need.The game plays a lot like the previous games. It's the same style of action game where you collect treasures, blast enemies and try to stop Kaos. You can upgrade abilities and attacks, though now with the Swap Force characters, you can upgrade the top and bottom portions individually! The game may be designed for kids, but it's great to see a developer putting time and effort into making a game of this quality for the age group. Here I was just talking about that in the Smurfs 2 game review I did a few weeks ago- many games for kids (or all-ages) are dumbed down and too basic. The Skylanders games don't fall into that category. Level design in this installment is much more diverse than we're used to. As you, the Portal Master, level up, new features and options are unlocked. Basically, everything that was fun in the first two games is back, just spruced up. Secret items and areas can be very tricky to find this time around too. If you're the kind of person who enjoys finding everything in a game, you'll be pretty busy with Swap Force.Important things to keep in mind before purchasing:-ONLY the Swap Force Skylanders can use the swap ability-your old Portal of Power can't read the Swap Force Skylanders-all your old Skylanders and Skylanders Giants figures DO work with this game and its new Portal-you can kiss your money good bye if...no, -when- your kids really get into it!The visuals, music and voice acting are top notch. I'm constantly impressed by the soundtrack for these games. While it may not be anything to put on a 'greatest game soundtracks' list, it's definitely memorable.What more needs to be said? Fans of the franchise will love this game. I just hope that in the next one, a run/dash ability for all Skylanders is implemented. That and we get a huge world to explore with double the length of this one. Still, Swap Force is a hit!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2013"}

Jeanclerc \"Reader, Listener & Obsessive...","summary":"An Innovative Sequel to the Familiar Skylanders Blueprint for Fun","reviewText":"When the Skylanders reincarnation of Spyro legend surfaced a few years back, it introduced a new concept in gaming - a series of collectible character action figures that drop into the game when placed on a &#34;portal&#34; that plugs into your console.  Each character had unique strengths depending on whether they were water-, fire-, magic-based, etc. Sure, you could play the game with only one or two characters, but you'd find that certain areas of the map were restricted to only certain classes of characters and that some challenges would be very much so without possessing the right mix of attributes. The cynical complained that this was just the latest ploy to further monetize your game purchase, somewhere between enticing and requiring you to buy more  and more of these action figures at $10 - 15 each.Skip ahead to today, and that cynicism may be proving to be true.  The original Skylanders was followed up with the Giants sequel (with larger action figures and in-game characters).  And now the latest version is SWAP Force, with action figures that separate in the middle (via magnets) so that the top and bottom halves of different characters can be combined to create new powerful combinations to use in the game.  Completists will be about knee-deep in Skylander action figures at this point!Much more so than the Giants sequel, SWAP Force provides some real innovation.  The ability to combine different attributes really increases the players' versatility in how to solve in-game puzzles or to defeat previously insurmountable bosses.  It's also humorous fun, particularly for kids who enjoy seeing their Frankensteinian creations come to life on the screen.  Note that your older action figures will work with the SWAP Force game (although obviously can't be part of the mix-and-match fun).The game itself will be familiar to anyone who's played any other game in the series:  chapter-based 3D platforming with puzzles to solve, mini-games to play, tons of Easter eggs to find, and button mashing combat.  The fighting is all bloodless and no one ever visibly dies - bad guys typically evaporate into some magical flashes when defeated; if your character takes too much damage, he/she will need to be exchanged for another action figure (with an on-screen message that he/she needs to &#34;rest&#34; for a while until you can join him/her back into the game).  The overall mental and dexterity requirements of the game are best for 10 and up, but even younger kids could play when teamed up with an older player.  Teamwork is emphasized throughout, with many of the puzzles and mazes being more easily solved when two players work together.  The SWAP Force game also provides some overdue fixes to the Skylanders formula, with smoother, easier, more intuitive controls (they can finally jump!).If you're on the fence about whether or not your family would enjoy the world of Skylanders, note that you can now find the earlier games and their figures on pretty good sale.  However, you'll be missing out on the fun of mixing and creating new characters with the SWAP Force capabilities.  This is a series that continues to improve upon its proven formula while also providing creative innovations in the right places.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2013"}

He has been recognized as one of the most beloved characters of all time. That has been true with so many different games. Since the Mario Party games debuted back in 1998, it has taken the feeling of interactive board games to a whole new level. While many companies have tried to catch that same bug like Hasbro and the CD-ROM versions of the classics, to Sony trying a Crash Bandicoot knockoff, Mario Party has remained king. With the status for the Nintendo Gamecube, the series has still stood tall, and number 5 is just that peachy as well.Mario Party 5, the fifth installment for the Nintendo Gamecube, is a real delight for any group that wants to bring those game faces on. The game offers 60 different and challenging mini-games for you to test your skills with, including Bus Buffers, Coney Island, and so many others. The game also increases the challenge by adding a story mode through 5 challenging dream boards, where Bowser and his cloned Bowser Jr. kids want to hold complete control over the Mario World. The graphics are simplistic, just like the prequel, and the new Mario Party 6. The control is also very easy to pick up on with all the mini-games and a little practice as well.All in all, Mario Party 5 is a good game for the Nintendo Gamecube for all ages. Unfortunately, you have a better chance of getting this one used currently than in new condition. For those, they may just consider Mario Party 6, or the upcoming Mario Party 7.

If you liked God of War series then you'll absolutely enjoy it.  If your new, you won't have to play from the beginning to catch up.  The story constantly explains to you that Kratos killed the God of War because he killed his own family by mistake.  He later becomes the new God of War, but had a falling out with Zeus and the other Greek Gods due to his constant guilt Kratos can't live with.(It's been years and it's in the description of the game so, NOT A SPOILER)3.  Puzzles are easy with the exception of one.4.  Quick-time events are simple and are seperate from the normal cut-scenes where you can just sit back and enjoy.5.  The story is short.  To add to the game are the basic behind-the-scenes stuff and a chance to play the game on different difficulty as well as play with a different Kratos.  After finishing the game, I thought I'd get to use the weapons I've obtained in the beginning, but no... so I'm not playing it again.  Their are some challenges and a combat arena, but I didn't play them.6.  Yes the graphics are great and so is the music.7.  The best in the hack-and-slash genre.  I've played Dante's Inferno, Darksiders and Bayonetta with Darksiders being the best of the three, but God of War 3 in the market, you'd have a better time with God of War 3.Thanks all.Another one?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2010"}

Not much to someone who spent $400-$500 on a video game system.  A few dollars won't make or break most people looking to purchase a game.  However, looking at this from purely an entertainment standpoint, the value just isn't there with this \"demo\".  I highly recommend waiting a month or two for the price to drop before buying this product.I am an avid fan of this series, going back to 1987, and I do truly enjoy this latest release.  I have collected all the trophies and have achieved a 100% completion.  This took me about a week to accomplish.  Even still, I cannot recommend this game at its current price.  This is essentially a demo game under the guise of a \"prologue\" to the main game expected to come out sometime in early 2015.The game play itself is excellent.  But, the main story can be completed in about 2 hours even by gamers new to this franchise.  There are some unlockable content and additional missions available.  They are fun to play, but playing side quests and fetching optional goodies shouldn't be sold as a game experience.  They're just easter eggs and should be treated as such.If you're a hard-core fan of the series, spending a few extra dollars won't sway your decision to purchase this game.

{"product_name":"B000KLNLV4","reviewerName":"Joey Joe Joe Jr S. \"high flyer\"","summary":"Dark Sector Review","reviewText":"Dark Sector is most definitely a diamond in the rough, however this diamond could have used a bit more polishing prior to release. First allow me to highlight the games strengths. Most obvious are Dark Sectors environments, textures, lighting(!), and graphics; they are superb. The game is set in a decaying, industrialized not to distant future that takes equal cues from biotech-anime and the recent film \"Children of Men\". When the game is flowing along I felt myself quite immersed in the hauntingly beautiful atmosphere of this game. Whoever directed this game obviously worked hard to ensure that the camera highlighted the excellent environments. Similar to a film, shot composition/camera orientation wise this game rivals that of an actual movie. Though not affecting game play, the water/lighting effects may be the best I have seen on the 360. Next, the mechanics of game play/combat are for the most part solid. Combat wise the \"glaive\" (i.e. the supped up ninja star, krull, boomerang)is actually quite fun to use. It is especially rewarding when targeting multiple foes along the same \"line\" then watch it soar through the air and watch limbs from multiple enemies go a flying. Very cool. The \"glaive\" can also be controlled mid flight, where the camera tracks its trajectory and you can steer its course to take out as many enemies as possible, a unique and rewarding experience. You can also use the \"glaive\" to pick up weapons from fallen enemies at a distance, which you can only use for about 30 seconds then the weapon self destructs, this timed element of using your enemies weapons is very strategic and requires some thought when in a heated fire fight. By the 4th chapter you can purchase a secondary weapon (shotgun/assault rifle) while convenient, as there is less need for depending on your fallen enemies weapons, I would have preferred the strategic element of artfully utilizing/acquiring weapons. The combat itself varies from \"cover based\" (Mass Effect, Gears of War) and \"walk based\" (Resident Evil, Deep Space). The shift between these two combat types provides some nice variety, and for the most part they are well executed. The enemy A.I. is \"smart enough\", they flank, they run from grenades, they change positions. Now Dark Sectors flaws. Similar to other games of this type it is easy to be confused as to where to go next, without the help of a walkthrough/strategy guide you will get stuck. Paths of progression are not linear, often times you will have to figure out how to simply move on in the game, can be a headache. You can not crouch, though not a deal breaker this does hinder the efficiency of combat and how you use cover. Melee is weak and often times misses target when they are certainly within striking range. Similar to Resident Evil you have to run to a safe distance and then engage.  The story is vague and suffers from a muddled plot. Though this is not much of an issue to me, as thankfully none of the cut scenes are very long and you are quickly back into the game. Overall Dark Sector is an excellent \"slept on\" title that action fans should find rewarding. If you are even somewhat interested in this game I suggest you check it out, and at the bargain price of btw $10-$20 new it offers excellent \"bang for your buck\". Three and a half stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2009"}

Superb CRPG","reviewText":"Bioware's latest addition to the CRPG genre, in the vein of the Baldur's Gate style of game, is a fantastic masterpiece of CRPG gaming.  Bioware has leveraged its own storytelling penchant and style to create a gaming experience that is truly immersive and wide in scope.  Endless storylines and dialogue await the curious player, coupled with a deep lore set, and the ability to cultivate long-term relationships with other NPCs (as we have seen in other Bioware titles such as Jade Empire).The combat system is a hybrid between turn-based and real-time, and allows the player to adjust on the fly depending on the encounter and situation -- if you like, you can control each character's every move in an encounter, or you can set tactics to allow them to follow a script without being micromanaged, depending on your playstyle preference and the difficulty of the encounter.  The result is a satisfying, customizable experience which allows players to scale their approach to combat depending on context.The game will likely not appeal to fans of the Diablo style of RPG, because this, as a Bioware game, is heavily based on storyline and dialogue -- probably more than any other Bioware game to date.  But for fans of Bioware's approach to the genre, this title is an instant classic.  Easily 60 hours or so on a first playthrough, with replayability based on different character archetypes and origin stories (hence the reference in the title), and a few downloadable content additions as well, this game will appeal to anyone who liked Bioware's previous titles, such as KOTOR or Jade Empire.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2009"}

Armed with a variety of occult powers suited for stealth and an arsenal of weaponry, you set out to clear your name and bring the conspirators to justice.  This is a linear story-driven game with levels, but there are usually 10 different ways to creatively complete each mission.  You can kill every enemy you encounter or you can complete the entire mission without spilling a drop of blood and without anyone even knowing that you were there.  How you play is up to you.  But there are two different endings, and the chaos you create on your mission will spread throughout the empire.  If you want the `good ending,' try to be as stealthy as possible.  If you want the bad ending, kill everyone, set off all the alarms and cause as much damage as you can.Concept:  9/10The Gameplay of Thief, the storytelling of BioShock, the World Structure of Rage, and a unique steampunk setting all work together to create a memorable experience.  If you haven't played those games, I'll explain.  In Dishonored, your main purpose is to stealthily complete mission objectives in levels.  You can play any way you like and you are greatly encouraged to use stealth and knock out enemies instead of killing them.  As you are sneaking around the levels, there's plenty of treasure and items to find.  As you complete the mission, you can upgrade your gear or buy consumables like health potions or arrows.  The bulk of the story is told through character dialogue, but there's a library of information within the game.  Hidden books and recordings add more detail to the world itself.  After each Mission, you return to a 'friendly town' where the resistance is located.  This is similar to the settlements in Rage.  You can walk around and talk to your allies, get quests, or buy gear from the mechanic.  It's rare that a game will let you creatively complete missions, so Dishonored is a treat.Story:  8/10The empress is killed and you are framed, and you must rescue the heir and \"remove\" all of the key political figures of the old regime.  You can do this violently or non-violently.  It's completely up to you.  There's a good ending and a bad ending, complete with modules about all of the NPC's that you've helped... or slain.World:  8/10The world is kind of an electric / steam punk / whaler city / that's suffering from a plague that turns people into zombies.  It's not even a nice place to visit, but the sounds, game fiction, technology, and art come together nicely to bring this world to life.  Is it an amazing world like in Final Fantasy or Mass Effect?  No, but all of the pieces blend together and it feels like a real place.Graphics:  8/10The graphics are pretty good and the coloring is similar to water colors.  The character designs are a bit cartoonish, but they all do their parts.  There's quite a bit of attention to detail on the buildings and machinery in the game as well.Gameplay:  8/10The Gameplay is Very Fun!  Most of the gameplay involves sneaking past enemies and assassinating your targets.  You can use magic to see through walls, possess an enemy, slow time, stop time, teleport, perform brutal kills, summon swarms of rats, and knock enemies down with a burst of wind.  Your arsenal includes a blade, a pistol, a crossbow with lethal ammo and sleep darts, mines, rewiring tools, and grenades.  With these powers and weapons, you can see how many ways you can sneak past or eliminate a curious guard.  Possess him and make him jump off of a cliff.  Rewire a tesla coil to attack enemies.  Place a landmine on the ground and make some noise.  Freeze time, catch an enemy grenade, and throw it back.  Teleport behind a guard on a rooftop and backstab him.  How you complete the missions are completely up to you.Levels:  9/10The levels were meticulously designed to give you as many options as possible to get to your target.  You can climb drain pipes to get to the roof.  You can possess an enemy and walk right in.  You can battle your way through the guards.  Every Mission will accommodate every play style.  And when you reach your target, there is usually a violent or non-violent way to dispose of them.Player Feedback:  FAILDishonored has one HUGE FLAW.  It fails to inform the Player how much Chaos they are creating as they are playing.  This determines the ending of the game, so if you are into stories, this is the most important information.  All you get is a progress report at the end of each level saying:  Chaos Level:  Low, Medium, or High.  If it is Low, you have some leeway, if it is High, you'd better lay off killing for a while.  But this isn't enough information and you only get it after the mission is over.  As a result, you're actually afraid to kill too many enemies and mostly rely on teleporting and sleep darts.  This could have easily been fixed with a gauge or bar, that lets the Player know that they can kill lots of enemies and still get the good ending.  It would have also been great if you knew how many guys you could kill before the mission starts, so you can adjust your play style.  There were a few times in the game where I was cornered by guards and I let them kill me because I wasn't sure I could fight back without getting the bad ending.  Suicide should never be a strategy in games.  It breaks immersion and limits tactics.In the game's defense, it does do a good job at informing you what your powers do when you upgrade them and there's even a paragraph on how best to use those powers.  The mission objectives are also very clear and you can see checkpoints through the walls with a meter indicator.  If you see Emily 50m, you know that Emily is 50 meters in that direction.  So, you never really get lost.Sound:  9/10The dialogue and creepy sound effects are good as you're hiding in the shadows and planning your next move.Maturity:  M or Older TeensThere's swearing and gore, and some mild suggestive themes.  The story is political and is based on revenge.Replay Value: 5/10There are 9 missions and each one will take 1-2 hours depending on your play style.  If you want to be stealthy and explore, each level will take twice as long.  If you want to attack the enemies, you'll get through the game much faster.  There are multiple endings and once you've finished the game, you can quickly get through it again if you want to see the different endings.Overall:  8/10This is a very fun game that encourages the Player to be clever.  But it discourages them from using their weapons and powers because there's the \"fear of the bad ending\" always hanging over their heads.  If you want a fun, stealth, level based fantasy assassin game, then you should pick this one up.  You might want to wait until it's $39.99.Buy this game if you love being creative as you get past obstacles.Buy this game if you love stealth games.Buy this game if you like revenge stories.Avoid this game if you just want to attack enemies head on and destroy them.Avoid this game if you have little or no patience.Avoid this game if you like open ended worlds.If you liked the stealth elements of this game, check out Batman Arkham Asylum,  Batman Arkham City, or Splinter Cell.  If you liked the creative weaponry, check out Deus Ex or Bioshock 1 and 2.  And if you love assassinations, you'll enjoy the Assassin's Creed series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2012"}

Battle your way across Europe as your troops make intuitive use of the terrain and buildings for cover and mount attacks on an equally intelligent enemy. Your Mission. Your Men. Your Decisions.","reviewerName":"JD","summary":"Fun, but still an RTS","reviewText":"Company of Heroes is a fun mix of old RTS games with upgraded graphics and a new trick here and there.  I don't think it is anything that will set the RTS world on its head nor do I think it brings anything to the table that could be considered revolutionary.The Campaign mode puts you in command of limited US forces in small variations of real battles in WW2 around the invasion of Normandy.  The Campaign mode is strictly United States (the Germans are available in the Skirmish mode but not the Campaign).  The Soviets, Italians, Brits, etc. are not represented in this game.  In addition to the limited countries you can play (mainly the US) the units available have also been somewhat downplayed.  This is not necessarily a bad thing as your resources are limited and you only want to bring to bear what is necessary to win the map.  So you won't see Lee's and Stuart's on the battlefield, the only tank available to the US is the Sherman (in a couple variants).  Sure, you can spend resources on the M10 Tank Destroyer but given its limited use and the fact that the Sherman in this game can go toe-to-toe with Tigers it isn't necessary.  Also, you can spend your command points to unlock the Pershing tank (so it is there if you are willing to get to it).To help make less feel like more CoH has done two things.  First, they've added the ability to specialize your army in one of the three ways (Infantry, Airborne or Armor) that will change the way you fight slightly and may add an additional unit here and there or alter the way an existing unit functions as you unlock new features.  For example, if you spend your points specializing in Infantry your units can now lay sandbags, you get access to mean tank-killing Rangers and eventually (if you can save up enough resources) you can send for resupply that delivers to your base a random assortment of units.  Airborne, as the name implies, specializes in airborne drops of infantry and AT guns and later heavy weapon supplies like machine guns and motors that can be manned by nearby units.  Armor will eventually unlock access to the heavy Pershing tank.  And secondly, they've tried to add upgrades to units to help them maintain their effectiveness throughout the game (as stated earlier, your unit cap is fairly low in comparison to traditional RTS games).  The Sherman tank can be upgraded with a 50-cal machine gun on top to help its effectiveness against infantry while Riflemen can be upgraded to use Grenades, Sticky-bombs and BAR's.  Essential each unit has at least one upgrade available to it.  This means you may not have to sacrifice your existing riflemen to make room for a tank when the option to build one becomes available.  Both of these items help flesh out the game but they don't entirely get rid of the feeling that for an RTS game you are limited in your choices.So how do the units you field behave? Well, this is a mixed bag.  Sometimes they do things that make you smile at their intelligence (diving for cover, supporting each other, etc.) but for the most part they are as stupid (if not more so) than units from previous RTS games.  Tanks and other heavy weapons will still stand on the sidelines while a Riflemen squad gets chewed up rather than move up and engage.  When Tanks do engage they not only move up to within range of their weapons (which has been cut significantly in this game to keep them from firing all the way across the maps) but they drive right up against the enemy unit until they are actually running into the enemy tank.  What is up with that? If more than one mechanized unit has to move over the same stretch of ground they spend more time banging into each other and moving back and forth than actually covering ground - often the units you were sending them to support will be dead before the mechanized units can organize themselves into a column and drive there.  When they do get there you have to manually reorient them so that their weaker rear-armor is facing away from the enemy (something that they are not smart enough to do themselves).  You also have to make sure they are positioned so that they have a clear line of fire on the target or they will continue to put round after round into a berm (or some other minor obstruction) indefinitely and never make contact with the enemy unit.  When you order a tank to move you should do so in a small series of steps as you carefully work to navigate them one at a time out of your base or they will drive right over the top of your defenses (sandbags, walls, barb wire, etc.) destroying them.  Needless to say, path finding in this game is the worst I have seen in an RTS to date with the exception of most of the infantry units which can find their way around but have their own unique quirks which include the inability to jump low walls or swim shallow rivers.Path-finding and unit variety out of the way, the real selling point for CoH is its awesome graphics and richly detailed environments that can be destroyed.  The graphics are superior to any other RTS that I have played and the ability to control the camera, using it to zoom in for an over the shoulder view akin to a FPS if you so choose, is something all RTS games of the future should include.  For most of the game you will probably be zoomed all the way out (as I was) and even wishing that you could zoom out further to make keeping an eye on all the action at once a little easier.The environment is richly detailed with lots of terrain types and plenty of things to blow up or hide behind.  Buildings can be leveled and holes can be blown into the earth.  The ground will become black and scarred the longer you fight over it until it is just a mess of blackened holes with no trees, fences or buildings left standing.The last item I bring up may or may not be an issue for you depending on the level of realism you like bundled with your RTS.  Personally, I like a lot, and so in that area CoH really falls short.  While the units look like they are supposed to they don't behave that way nor are they really balanced against their real-life counterparts.  For example, an AT gun can absorb several hits from the main gun on the tanks, as can armored cars which take several hits to bring down.  The Sherman can go toe-to-toe with the Tiger tank and all vehicles have a very severe limit on their weapon ranges.  In addition there is some luck mechanic working in the background because you can take two identical enemy units and take down one without issue and the second just seems to be absorbing all damage you are sending its way.  When your units get hurt bad enough just hit the retreat button and they will flee at warp speed back to your headquarters (they get an armor boost to match that speed boost) where they can be pumped back up to full strength.  It is especially annoying fighting a unit only to get it worn down at last, then it retreats and later you have to fight it again when its back to full strength.Anyway, CoH is a game with its fair share of flaws and it brings very little innovative advancements to the table.  Under the polished finish it is the same old RTS game at work.  But it is flashy and in the end it is still fun.EDIT:  I should have pointed out that the profanity is over the top at times, even for a war game.  The units don't need to swear every time you give them an order.  Anyway, the swearing isn't a big issue for me, but no way to turn it off (that I saw) makes the game unsuitable to be played with the volume up in mixed company.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000SSPH3E","description":"","reviewerName":"RPGee Wiz \"MondoJohnny\"","summary":"This job was a complete success... This job was a complete failure...","reviewText":"Final Fantasy Tactics is one of my favorite games of all time. I have logged thousands of hours on this game obsessively level building every character, mastering every skill, and finding every weapon through multiple play throughs over the years. Imagine my surprise then when a complete remake of the game came out, for the PSP. As a great fan of the PSP system, and its freeing portable qualities, I was thrilled to say the least when I heard the news. Unfortunately the reality is less pleasing. The game has several major flaws ranging from a hammey and self indulgent new script to a plain lazy lag problem.Now the first one I am prepared to give a pass on for the most part. Any fan of the original Final Fantasy Tactics will tell you that the dialogue was a bit off. Some of the translations in particular were laughable, but I never minded. In fact I thought some of the awful dialogue in the game made it more charming.The lag problems however are completely inexcusable to me. As a former video game tester, I am somewhat aware of the general bug testing process, and it is clear to me that this bug was just lazily and sloppily allowed to be in the final version of the game. There is literally no way I can see that they would not have seen this problem. It happens with a 100% frequency every time any graphical effect such as a spell is triggered. The bug is very bad, and very hard to get over when playing through the game. In fact I would say that this one problem took the game from a 5 star rating to a 3 for me. However I will go into that more later.Graphic:The graphics of Final Fantasy Tactics were never anything to write home about. At the same time they were always adequate. Unlike some older games, Final Fantasy Tactics had an art style which allowed it to age well. This is especially apparent when set beside contemporary titles such as Final Fantasy VII which looks very blocky by today's standards. The remake does not add any noticeable improvement to the graphics department, but because the game is on the higher res PSP the graphics appear sharper and rough pixelated sprites are much less noticable.For those who have not played Final Fantasy Tactics before, you can expect a unique graphical style when compared to other Final Fantasy titles. The characters are all uniquely designed, and the battle terrain in particular is very detailed. Bafflingly none of the characters in the game have noses, but I chalk this up to a stylistic choice. All of the spells and effects have been preserved, with the addition of a few new graphics for the new classes. All in all, no complaints here. Everything has been preserved the way I would have wanted it to be. One of the few times when the Square crew doesn't try to fix things that aren't broken. Good job fellas!Sound:The sound of Final Fantasy Tactics, has always been one of its most unique and most well done features. There is a constant backdrop of moody classical music which is largely responsible for setting the pace of the entire game. The music does for this game what John Williams's score did for Star Wars, which is to unobtrusively lubricate the story line, and help make events come off appropriately. Though you hear the same melodies repeatedly throughout the game,they are composed in such a meandering and seemless fashion that you will be able to listen to them for hours without being annoyed. Very important in a game where a single battle can take half an hour.The remake preserves the same music, and does it well for the most part but there is a problem. The sound effects in the game are its biggest Achilles heel. The minor problem is that many of the sound effects are slightly different from the original. I consider this a minor problem because it is one that most people probably will not even notice. I must admit that I only did because I have spent what is most definitely an unhealthy amount of time playing the old PS title! However, in some cases the effects sound duller, and sometimes a bit tinny. I am tempted to say that this is purely a result of the speakers on the PSP, and it really doesn't ruin the game so I can let it go.The big problem is that the sound effects do not cue up properly with the graphics. In nearly every situations where an attack animation occurs, the sound effect is horrendously off cue! This unforgivable problem will likely plague you throughout the game. I played through the whole thing and was simply not able to get past it. Every time one of my characters cast a spell or used a special attack I would wince and grit my teeth. Someone should be punched for allowing this bug to remain in the final version of the game. This is the entire reason a company has bug testers, and there is simply no way I will believe they missed this problem considering how unavoidable it is.Gameplay:The gameplay is mostly the same as it was before, and that is a good thing considering that the gameplay is the most important and most defining part of Final Fantasy Tactics. The original game was based off a similar title for playstation called Tactics Ogre. For anyone who hasn't played a tactics game before, they can be compared to a much larger scale version of chess. The player takes command of a force of five warriors in this instance, and moves about a hex grid field combating an opposing force.This is a simplification of the system because the real complexit lies in the myriad customization options at the players fingertips. Each character can assume a characters class which will grant him access to unique skills and abilities. At the start of the game the player will only have access to a couple of classes but as the game progresses more become available. In fact every time a character makes a move in combat he will be awarded a standard experience point reward which will eventually allow him to level up, but he also is granted a certain number of job points or JP. JP will allow the character to purchase new skills and abilities for his character such as the ability to move an additional space in combat, equip two weapons instead of one, or even use a potion automatically when hit, just to name a few. This system is where much of the fun comes into play. The customization is deep, and depending on how it is done will significantly effect the difficulty of the game.The only new game play mechanics in this remake come in the form of a couple of new job classes. In theory this sounds great. Just what you want in a remake; the addition of more elements without taking any of the original content away. In general this is true. The new Dark Knight Job is not only cool but gives the main character Ramza the ability to stand shoulder to shoulder with the likes of Agrias, Meliadoul, and T.G. Cid who all use devistating sword skills. The downside is that the class creates something of an imbalance in the games difficulty. Veteran players know that when T.G. Cid joins the party, the game becomes a virtual cakewalk due to his massive power. The Dark Knight gives a character access to arguably even more ludicrously overpowered moves, and if combined with the right support skills, you will not likely see him fall in combat. On the upside the requirements to unlock this class are by far the stiffest of any in the game, and unless you are specifically training a character to unlock it, you will not likely see it for some time. I started the game knowing how to unlock the class and it still took me until early chapter 3 to unlock the class for Ramza.Characters&Story;:This is what its all about in the world of Final Fantasy in general. The character development and interaction in a FF game has always been the glue that holds the whole thing together. Final Fantasy Tactics delivers on this front. There are some major changes in this department ranging from name changes for the majority of the characters to a completely new script. Now this is a point where I am stubbornly biased to the detriment of the game and I will own up to it. I really liked the old text of the game. For all its imperfections, it has a marked surreal quality. Who can forget such gems as \"Surrender now or die in obscurity!\" and \"If you had lived an honest life you wouldn't have died this way!\" From Ramza, or Agrias's poignant; \"Evanesence. What a sad word...\" It was nonsensical sometimes, but I still miss it. They also removed all of the exclamations that would sporadically pop up when a character used a spell or special attack. Some of these were great too, though I will admit most of them were inscrutible nonsense along the lines of; \"Live! Know! Become a toad!:\" and \"Life is short. Bury! Steady Sword!\" They could have at least retranslated these for the game, but they just took them all out instead.In addition they stripped away every letter of original dialogue from the game and replaced with the hammiest community theatre calibre quasi-shakespeare I have ever seen. This quality will likely be a splash of cold water to veterans as it was with me, but after awhile it does seem a little more like it belongs, and admittedly it does make more sense than the other. Ironically the new old-english sounding dialoge actually makes certain characters and events even more difficult to take seriously, with enough \"thy\" and \"thee\" flying around to make the bard himself blush.  Some of the name changes are welcome and others I was sad to see get changes such as the character Algus who gets a name change to Argath. I just think Algus sounds better! If we always went with the direct Japanese translation we would have characters named Butts saving the world! Moving right along.Cut Scenes & Voice acting:These are a completely new addition to the game. The original game had nothing in the way of cutscenes, unless you count the opening which contains some knights riding chocobos towards Orbonne Monastery. The new cutscenes are not just good, they are breath taking. they have a very appealing cell shaded quality and the color pallette is perfect for the game. The voice acting is only in the cutscenes but it is very well done. The characters speak in a very subdued but believable conversational style and it fits perfectly with the mood of the game. The choices in voice are also very well done. My only complaint, and its a trifling one is that there aren't enough of these scenes. It would have been nice to get to see and hear a few more of the main storyline characters in these scenes. As it stands you really only get to see Ramza and Delita most of the time. Perhaps that's just me being greedy however, so I can't really hold that against it.New Content:In a remake new content is very important. This game is not a port after all, and so it is expected to have a few new treats for the fans of the series. The choices made are for the most part good ones. I think every returning player has wished that they could have access to a character with the Black Knight Gaffgarion's abilities for instance. In the original, only Cid had access to the awesome life draining abilities he possessed, but in the new game Dark Knight is an unlockable class that any character can learn if he earns it.The Onion Knight class is appropriate in that it is a mainstay of the Final Fantasy Universe. In past games this class was sort of the basic \"Vanilla\" job for the main characters. its only advantages were that it could equip any piece of equipment. In the remake the class has access to all equipment, but cannot have any skills equipped. Normally this would never be a good trade off but the Onion Knight class allows a character to gain significantly better stat boosts when leveling up than any of the other classes, and so its more a strategic element for the obsessive level builder who wants to have the best stats possible. Why not! Part of the fun of these games is building your force from a rag tag bunch of wimps to an unstoppable juggernaut of destruction.The New characters arrive in the form of two main players from major Final Fantasy Titles. The first is the character Luso from the Final Fantasy Tactics Advance 2 game, which I am not a fan of. The character however is very handy to have around as he has a built in ability that lets him poach any monster he defeats. Poaching was one of those skills that you needed to get some of the rarest items in the game, but never wanted to waste one of your skill slots on, so having a character with an automatic version is a nice little feature without creating too much imbalance in the game.The other new character however could not be more imbalanced. Balthier is a secret character that has access to all weapons and armor, all the thief stealing skills, all of Mustadio's gunner skills, and comes with a unique and powerful set of body armor and gun. Unlike Cloud from FFVII who also is in the game, Balthier is incredibly powerful. He has a unique shooting skill that lets him fire four times with his gun, and can basically do everything that Mustadio can do only better. The bad thing is that this nullifies any reason whatsoever to use Mustadio and thats a shame because he is one of the major characters in the story. It is nice to have a main character than can steal, as you never know when you will need to pilfer some rare weapon or armor off an enemy, but I feel they went a bit overboard on his other abilities.As a final overview, I would like to state that although this game had a lot of potential to be one of the best remakes ever, its unforgivable lagging and sound bugs make it hard to get through. Unfortunate, because otherwise its a flat improvement over the original otherwise. After playing it all the way through to the end, I found myself not loving the current experience, but rather feeling sadly nostalgic for the original with all its bizzare dialoge and strange characterizations. Luckily for us change fearing old school gamers, Sony has seen fit to release a direct port of the old game available to download directly to your PSP from their store. For me it was well worth doing. So I shelved the War of the Lions, and loaded the original up instead, and the first time I had Agrias Stasis Sword some poor chump it all went smoothly, and it felt good...I hope this review helped but if it didn't \"Don't blame me! Blame yourself... or God!\"","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2010"}

Just when we thought racing couldn't get any better than Gran Turismo 4 for the PS2 back in 2005 Gran Turismo 5 rolls along on the PS3.As the title suggests this is just a preview, or an over glorified demo, of that is to come in the full game coming out this year. While the game was released almost 2 years ago it still looks amazing today and the realism is so close to real life you can taste it. Everything you know about Gran Turismo has had a face lift and this includes the menu. Instead of all those icons on a map you are treated to your car being displayed in different countries in the background along with an even calendar and some new icons. The first thing you will notice is the fully fledged online play with up to 12 players. Second is the GT TV which lets you purchase episodes of car shows for the die-hard car fanatics (I completely skipped this), but it's there. You have your regular events and single races instead of the standard simulation and arcade modes. You can go to the dealerships and pick your cars and jump into the events.Some problems do pop up right from the start when buying a car since there are frequent loading screens between screens and the car info isn't displayed right. It scrolls across the bottom and you can only view the car if you click on it and have it load. There is no full detail spec sheet mainly due to the fact that you can't upgrade your cars. Yeah guys sorry. In the \"demo\" version of Gran Turismo 5 you just buy your cars and race as is. I have no idea is Polyphony is completely stripping this idea since it is also missing in the PSP Gran Turismo as well.Once you buy your car (there are about 80 or so cars if you get the free Spec III update) you can go into your garage and sell cars from here as well as viewing them. Gone is the whole car wash thing, for now, but some sort of virtual tour of the car would have been nice as well as being able to use all the items in the car (c'mon you want ultra realism right?) Once you get into the event menu you can see the requirements for entering and these are limited to certain types of cars. Once you start racing you should get third or better to earn credits to buy more cars, rinse and ad infinitum. While this sounds dull each car handles surprisingly different and the AI s a real nice challenge. However, the usual time limits are set WAY to tight and is almost impossible to beat even when driving with the guide line and not crashing.When you actually start driving you'll notice just how tight the controls are. You really like your turning a wheel thanks to the great analog stick of the DualShock 3 and the great vibration feature. Every car also sounds the same and the amazing in dash cockpit view (the first time in Gran Turismo) is beautiful, but I just wish you could turn the driver's head around. There aren't too many tracks to drive on, but there are a lot of familiar ones all the way back to the first game 12 years ago.If you want to talk about aesthetics the game looks stunningly real. You can't really tell the car apart from something i real life and the tracks all look amazing, but I know i can look better and I hope the graphics engine i boosted a little for the final release.While there are many flaws, and things missing, such as the driving tests, upgrades; there are a lot of things not improved like the super strict time limits, plus some times the game just is too real to be fun. Other than that for about $25 you can really have a good racer that will last you awhile or if you are a die-hard Gran Turismo fan this will tide you over until the final release.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Among other things, the Dunia Engine delivers realistic, interactive environments, special effects, real-time night-and-day cycles, and smart enemy AI.Expansive, Realistic EnvironmentFar Cry 2 is set in a fictional region of Africa where you are caught between two rival factions at war. The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah. Wild animals such as zebras, buffalo, gazelle are encountered during the game, with both players and enemies allowed to interact with them.Far Cry 2 features an incredible level of detail and realism, with a minimal in-game interface to detract from immersion. For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game. To fulfill your mission, you need to play the enemies against each other, using both strategy and skill.Huge Range of Weapons and VehiclesFar Cry 2 offers gamers a wide range of weapons, from a machete for hand-to-hand combat, to a sniper rifle that can stealthily pluck off enemies from afar. As weapons disintegrate over time, they might jam or even explode in your hand.There are also a large range of vehicles such as gliders, trucks, cars, and boats that will let you fly, drive, slide, and hover over the open landscapes.Multiplayer Options for up to 16 PlayersFar Cry 2 supports up to 16 players and has four gameplay modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond, and Uprising. Players can choose from six different classes in multiplayer, each with its own set of pros and cons.

{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"Brian Forrester \"Brian Forrester, Noblesville IN\"","summary":"Mixed Review","reviewText":"I've played the GTA games since the top-down, 2D PC games from the mid 90's.  Each game has fixed problems of the previous.  GTAII made the biggest leap into the 3D realm.  Vice City added activities, boating, flight, properties and business you could own.  It was also the first to allow you inside the building interiors, in select buildings.  San Andreas, my personal favorite, fixed the oil-and-water mixture your character had with water.  That used to drive me crazy in VC...drowning.  It also added a whole host of activities to do between missions.  Dating was introduced, along with weightlifting (if you chose to do it) and character customization.  There was really too much to do to list.  From gambling to mountain bike races on a mountain, there was no lack of things to do when you were bored with missions...GTA IV, not so much.  Be sure, there are a wide host of improvements in this iteration.  The graphics are MUCH improved.  One of the biggest irritants in the GTA III trilogy (III, VC, and SA), the targeting system, has been fixed to satisfaction.  You can now take cover and switch your aiming targets much easier.  Yeah, it'll still lock-on to the occasional civillian during unfortunate moments, it's nowhere near as bad as the previous entries.The Good:Greatly improved graphics.  The GPS is awesome for finding your way around the city and to your des.  Lots of radio options, though the music is a bit more obscure than in past games.  Typical GTA humor, notably the fun it picked at right-wing politics in the U.S. post-9-11.  The targeting system is great, as is the hand to hand fighting.  The physics system is actually somewhat realistic.  You'll fly through your car's windshield in bad head-on collisions!  I've also been killed by traffic while a pedestrian.  Cell phone orgainization of your friends, mission contacts, and appointments is nice.  Relationships with NPCs, dating, minigames like darts, bowling, pool, watching television, taking in shows, and getting drunk (more annoying than fun, surprisingly).  The main Story is another great GTA story, making you want to complete missions to move it along.  Using the police computer in police vehicles is a cool addition.The Bad:Just not as much to do to kill time.  This game is more realistic in what you can do than past GTAs.  Doing goofy stuff like tooling around in a jet pack, or jacking a train isn't an option.  An example of the realism harming gameplay is motorbikes.  In San Andreas, your skill on a bike improved, making accidents less severe (and nearly putting a stop to them when you were skilled enough).  This made the 2 wheeler the ideal vehicle to whip around traffic, small and nimble.  Bike accidents are pretty sever in GTA IV.  T-bone a car in an intersection on a bike now is almost like a guaranteed death.  While realistic and 'better' in a sense, it kind of hurt the motorcycle's practicality in GTA IV.  I liked being able to play a couple of hands of blackjack between missions in Venturas.  It's kind of hard to find weapons and armor lying around, but it's nice to have guns available at the dial of your phone.  The relationships are fun, but become something of a chore over time, keeping everyone happy.  The verticality of the city kind of has me put off where exploration is concerned.  There's just too much to explore.  The game is also MUCH easier.  This is good and bad.  You won't have nearly as many missions or car chases that have you wanting to chuck your controller.  That's good.  What's bad is where your 'find' missions like car thefts being dumbed down.  I had fun trying to find the vehicles you had to steal.  That made you explore, which was half the fun of GTA.  Now, you don't have much incentive to explore.  The replay value just isn't there for me.Conclusion:I still love this game.  It hasn't sucked me in to 6 hour gaming sessions like the first three 3D games.  The story is great and it has that familiar GTA feel.  My hope is that this is like the GTAIII of the previous generation.  My hope is that with each new title, they raise the bar as they did from III through San Andreas.  Variety is the spice of life, and there just isn't as much variety in GTA IV.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2008"}

Jackson's voice booming in your ear is controlling the character as it all happens. And now you can, with Afro Samurai for the Xbox 360. Based on the popular anime series, Afro Samurai will finally let gamers control their favorite samurai as he violently slashes through an eclectic lineup of assassins, ninjas, and robotic thugs..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }The voice acting is done by Samuel L.

Afro has set out to try and avenge his father's murder by a man named Justice. Justice murdered Afro's father to claim the 'Number One' headband, giving himself the chance to rule the worldAfro Samurai is based on the popular and stylistic anime of the same name.View larger.with powers akin to a god. The only one allowed to challenge Number One is the person with the 'Number Two' headband, but unfortunately for Afro, the current owner of the headband, anybody and everybody can, and does, challenge Number Two. But never fear, as this new title includes brand new material and background for fans of the series and newcomers alike to enjoy.Loads of Stylized ActionAfro Samurai brings gamers a balanced experienced, with stylistic combat and acrobatic platforming combined with the ability to dynamically slice and dismember enemies in unending ways. While gamers can hack and slash their way through many foes by combining heavy and light attacks with just two buttons, accomplished players will master moves like the Deep Throat Killer, where they pierce their opponent's neck and rip everything loose in a crimson splash.Players will also need to learn the Focus maneuver with its bullet-time effect. This allows the user to slow down time and designate a specific strike zone, which with the right timing and skill can allow Afro to cleave an enemy in two or slice a limb completely off. And since characters are not pre-rendered you don't just get a canned scene when you cut through your enemy, giving you endless ways and means to cut your enemies down to size. This ethos is applied game-wide, as Afro is allowed to interact with anything and everything in his environment to help him on his journey.Star-Studded Supporting CastSamuel L. Jackson reprises his role as both Afro and Ninja in the game, and the same striking art style that made the anime series so popular provides the unique look and feel across beautifully animated open environments. And for those of you who are wondering, developers Namco Bandai let Jackson ad-lib a lot, so be prepared for his branded vulgarity and the M rating it helps the game earn.Meanwhile, Ron Pearlman and Kelly Hu continue on in their roles as Justice and Okiku, while RZA of Wu-Tang Clan fame has created all new tracks for the hip-hop inspired soundtrack. And thanks to an innovative gameplay system, the enemy AI and tone of the game are affected by the beat of the musical score, for a truly immersing experience.With its visual stunning graphics, and fluid and graceful movements, Afro Samurai will provide hours of entertaining, balletic action. Add to this ground-breaking elements like health that is represented by the blood on your clothes, or your enemies', and you have a game that simply can not be passed up.Slice and dice your enemies in a glorious number of different ways.","reviewerName":"N8online","summary":"Artful Game, Somewhere between a 3 or 4 rating","reviewText":"I enjoyed playing this game for the most part.  I am a big fan of the series.  I own both season's series on DVD.  This game will make your jaw drop in good ways & bad ways.  My only 2 gripes were the camera and the checkpoints.  The camera was \"okay\" for the most part.  Some parts the camera will piss you off!  The check points just flat out sucked.  I would make it all the way to the edge of the level, and have to start ALL the way over again.  I would stare at the screen in disbelief wanting to turn the game off, but I kept playing.  There were more good things than bad from my perspective.  The art was crsip, clean, and beautiful.  There are some parts where you can't believe that you are playing a video game.  This was personally the best soundtrack I have heard in any game. It's all a matter of taste. I had to crank the volume up during several fight scenes.  The boss fights were really fun and challenging.  It's definitely an \"M\" rated game for the language, gore, and partial nudity.

I say this because you will probably be shot about twenty to thirty times during the fifteen minute beach fight. It's not a problem though, because all you need to do is pick up medical kits and \"poof\" you're healed instantly. You don't even need a medic.The game does have a LOT of HUGE levels which are beautifully rendered. You walk by hundreds of French houses, churches, etc. You battle against German soldiers, cooks, secret police, tanks, etc. While doing so you will be shot CONSTANTLY! Almost every level has at least two or three enemy snipers who shoot at you from very far away. It takes at least a few seconds to locate them in the gloom. All the while they are taking pot-shots at you and your health is dwindling. I found the game much more enjoyable with the invincible code on.Despite the constant irritation of being shot, it is fun to go through the levels and shoot all of the enemies. I found the controls difficult to work with at times, especially in very close combat. You have a disadvantage against an opponent who is less than five feet away because you're getting punched or shot and it's disorienting enough without fumbling with your controller.The game also could have used a multi-player mode. I'm very disappointed that it didn't. It was fun enough to play through once, but I'm not sure how long I'll have to wait to play through it again.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2002"}
{"product_name":"B0028ZNX68","reviewerName":"Stephen M. Lerch","summary":"OK musical mash ups with mostly familiar game play style","reviewText":"To provide disclosure, I am a member of the Vine program and the bundle provided to all Vine members was 1) free 2) a demo disc was provided, not the full game and 3) a wired turntable was provided.For those that aren't aware, DJ Hero is Activision's attempt to bring the Guitar Hero style game play to the turntable/DJ career. From the demo I've played, I have to say the results are mixed at best.For the review I will cover a the turntable hardware itself and then also review the game proper.Hardware:The provided turntable on the demo I received was wired. The one that comes with the full version of the game is wireless. As such, this controller is actually just the wireless controller with a wire sticking out of the side that connects via USB on your 360. There is even a battery compartment at the bottom of the unit despite not being the wireless controller.The complete turntable controller seems pretty sturdy. It consists of what is known as the slider and effect controls on one side and the turn table itself, along with 3 colored buttons on the other. The slider side includes the slider, the Euphoria button (more later) and the effects knob. Beneath a concealed compartment sits a cross pad along with the start, back and XYAB buttons so you can choose options in the menus and choose what version you would like to play.The turntable spins endlessly in any direction you would wish to spin it.One thing to note is that the turntable can be separated from the slider section using a lock switch on the bottom of the controller. This allows you to go from lefty to righty style. One major complaint I have is that the controller is rather small. Given how close your hands seem to need to be together, you're bound to get cramps during any marathon sessions you might pick up. Too bad you can't split the controller and place the 2 pieces anywhere that is comfortable for you.The buttons on the turntable are green, red and blue, similar to Guitar Hero color buttons.Overall the turntable is pretty nice for plastic instrument. Quality seems to be about the same as the standard Guitar Hero instruments.The Game:Overall I am underwhelmed by the game proper.The choice of music in a game like this is key. For the demo we are given:Another One Bites the Dust (Queen) / Da Funk (Daft Punk) for the tutorialand for the three tracks for the single player/double turntable set list:I Heard it Through the Grapevine (Marvin Gaye) / Feel Good Inc. (Gorillaz)Hollaback Girl (Gwen Stefani) / Give it to Me Baby (Rick James)Boom Boom Pow (Black Eyed Peas) / Satisfaction (Benny Benassi)For the DJ + Guitar mix you have:Monkey Wrench (Foo Fighters) / Sabotage (Beastie Boys)The game play should be familiar to anyone who has played any of the previous \"Hero\" games (or Rock Band).Grandmaster Funk is on hand to give you a run through the basics in the tutorial, which I recommend even for \"Hero\" veterans. Grandmaster either lends cred to the game or is a sell out, depending on your point of view. I can't help you form an opinion there.Game play consists of pushing the colored buttons on the turntable, \"scratching\" by pressing the corresponding color and moving the turntable back and forth when you have arrows appear on the track instead of the standard colored buttons that just require you to press the corresponding colored button in. For the red color you also have sections that require you to press the red button, scratch and use the knob to change \"effects.\" The effects range from sirens to \"laser pistol\" sounds. For some sections you must use the \"slider\" to slide between 3 positions (left, center and right) to keep the beats pumping. The slider is only used for the green and blue colors, not the red. I've found the slide option takes some getting used to as it's very easy to over throw when trying to return to center. Probably just need more practice.As you successfully hit \"notes,\" slides and scratches, you build Star Power which allows you to use what is now known as \"Euphoria\" instead of Star Power. Euphoria is activated by pressing the flashing \"Euphoria\" button which resides above the cross fader. While Euphoria is enabled, your score is increased via multipliers (2x and so on). The better you do, the higher the multiplier.A rather unique feature added to the game is the ability to \"rewind.\" This is enabled by hitting a 4x multiplier and keeping it for a short time. To activate \"rewind\" you turn the turntable one full circle backwards (can also be done with just a quarter spin). One thing I've found is that it can be difficult to recover from the rewind spin fast enough to enable you to keep the multiplier up and keep the beat since unless you keep your fingers on the button or spin with your fingers JUST above the buttons and use them to stop the turntable, you have the potential for over/under spin and also depending on when you actually hit the turntable, your hands could be in quite uncomfortable positions. The only purpose of rewind is to rack up a higher score.One thing that will puzzle some Hero veterans is that there is NO FAIL on every song. Every track plays through from beginning to end and no matter how poorly you perform, the song keeps going. I think this was done to open it up a little to those that are just starting out. It's not bad, since if you're doing really poorly you can still pause the game, restart and/or change the difficulty as you do in the Hero games.Since I don't have a second turntable, I cannot accurately rate the multiplayer \"twin table\" mode. I can, however, give a short review to the DJ + Guitar game play, since I do have a supported guitar controller.Basically one person hits the turntable controller, the other the guitar and game play on the guitar is just what you've come to expect in Guitar Hero games. It's not revolutionary but it is a nice addition for those who don't put down all the money required for 2 turntables.For a title like this, the mash ups will either make the game for you or break it. If you look at the final set list, decide if these are tracks you actually want to hear mixing it up. I found some of the tracks worked well for me while others left me scratching... my head instead.Graphically I found DJ Hero, in a word, UGLY. You have your chosen character at the front of a dancing crowd while lighting effects play out as you'd expectOver all it's an OK game with an OK controller. Does it beat Beat Mania? I think it's a little easier to get a handle and slightly more fun, but die hard \"Bemani\" fans will probably always pick Bemani over DJ Hero on principal alone.If you're looking for a great party game to play with friends, pick up Guitar Hero or Rock Band. Why? Because multiplayer on this title consists of playing with only one other person which isn't much of a party.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2009"}

Daneker","summary":"Okay, but not worth it for the single player campain","reviewText":"Okay, but not worth it for the single player campaignI don't play online, but I enjoyed Halo for what it was, as short as it was and really wanted to see where it was going. The answer, nowhere, really.Halo 2 is more of a re-hash than a sequel. The computer voice admits it at the end \"yeah, sounds familiar, I know\" she says telling you how you are going to once again blow up the enemy by overloading something. Yea! Great?What Halo 2 does do is offer some tighter controls (the vehicle improvements are vast if not perfect) though you drive and aim with the same movement, so you are always flying or driving towards your target, but you feel at least some control as you kamikaze! What I really hate is the zoom - aim feature, because if you take a hit it un-zooms and you have to zoom back, it's very annoying if you play like me and try to take out as many bad-guys as possible before moving in.There's some issues with the dual-play feature as well, you are both Master Chief and some alien called Arbiter whom Master Chief defeated in the first Halo. The problem with Arbiter is that he plays just like Master Chief, so you don't care that it's different, his stats are purple, MC's are Blue! The issue is I keep forgetting who to shoot at and keep killing Arbiter's allies out of habit. Since he fights just like MC, why play as him at all?The cut scenes are rendered to cinematic levels, but the actual graphics range from slick to badly pixilated and blurry. Too often I felt claustrophobic and ended up having no idea which way was up, or out.As for the Campaign, I have no idea what online play is like, but if you don't play online borrow, do not buy this game for $50.00. This game will take a maximum of 8hrs for  a novice player. You never go back more than a few minutes when you die, which is great, but that there are no puzzles, no searching, no tactics to work out here, just point, shoot, collect, move! The game forces you in each direction, you never have anywhere to go but where you have to. There are no extra areas to explore, no secrets to find, no hidden treasures or mysteries.The end, once again, is uneventful. Worse, it's a cliffhanger! I felt like the game barely began and it was over and unresolved. What a massive disappointment.I have to wait for H3 to come out on PC because I am not buying an Xbox360. Oh, well. If they combine the three games into one, it might be worth $50.00.As to technical issues, I had none. I'm running a HP PV9000 custom laptop. Vista Ultimate 64, 2gig ram, 100 & 150gig sata hard drives, 2gig ready boost SD card, with a AMD 64 Turion x2 @1.8ghz. I had to use 1280 X 768 resolution because the full 1680 X 1050 my screen uses made the mouse move too slow. The game ran fine at all settings to max but the mouse movement was too slow even at level 10 speed, lowering the resolution made no difference in how the game looked, none, so it didn't matter at all.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2007"}

Each animal has a unique mode of operating, which means that the two interconnected narratives behind this game each offer their own distinctive challenges to conquer.As the armored, action-oriented scorpion, you'll string together stinging blows into deadly combo moves that culminate in cinematic finishes and decimate your opponents. Playing as the sneaky tarantula requires a little more finesse--you'll find yourself leaping from above onto your nemesis, throw out neatly aimed shots of webbing to paralyze your prey, and finishing creatures off with your devastating fangs.Wild Enemies and a Sinister Back StoryIt takes skill and composure to master the moves the scorpion and tarantula have at their disposal. And, even after you think you've got every move down, you'll find you need to learn methods, since these life-and-death struggles take place between you and a huge array of vicious, hazardous creatures, including wolf spiders, rattlesnakes, Gila Monsters, Tarantula Wasps, black widows, mantises, enemies of your own species, rats, and even humans.Beyond the immediacy of fighting for survival, this game features a story of greed and betrayal in the human world. Slowly unveiled from the disparate perspectives of the two headline creatures, this evolving storyline helps keep even advanced players engaged and guessing at the implications of their own actions.Explore Brutal, Unforgiving EnvironmentsWhichever creature you're playing as, you'll have 360-degree access to a wide range of 3D environments based in the harsh Sonoran Desert. You'll explore a gloomy maze of thorny brambles, forgotten underground tunnels filled with rusting pipes, an above ground wasteland packed with people's garbage, and even a desolate gas station. Each arena promises to challenge your skills as a hunter and a survivor in its own way, while unique angles and a sense of scale that turns small, familiar objects into major obstacles help make these environs especially prickly.","reviewerName":"Benjamin M.

I remember my old FF II SNES cartridge very fondly, though I never had the chance to play Chrono Trigger until this reissue.  I enjoyed these classic RPG's very much - now for more detailed reviews of the games:Final Fantasy IV was originally released as Final Fantasy II here in the USA, since Square chose not to release the NES games of Final Fantasy II and III here at that time, and they changed the numbering of the game to avoid confusion here.  The story follows the adventures of Cecil, commander of the famed Red Wings squadron of airships and a Dark Knight in the service of the King of Baron.  The King, formerly a benevolent ruler, has recently begun to exhibit changed and disturbing behavior.  When he sends Cecil and the Red Wings on a mission to assault the hapless mages of Mysidia and steal their Crystal, Cecil begins to seriously question his actions.  When he brings his concerns to the King, he is rewarded by being stripped of his command and sent to deliver a package to the nearby Village of Mist along with his friend, Kain the Dragoon.  And so the adventure begins...Those who have mostly played the later Final Fantasies, especially VII, VIII, and X, will find the character creation system in this game to be different.  As the game progresses, you will be joined by several different characters who rotate in and out of your party, and each has his or her own unique abilities.  For example, Rosa, Cecil's lady love, is strictly a White Magic user, with a small offensive capability, whereas Cecil and Kain are strictly designed around being offensive powerhouses.  So, there is not a lot of room for character customization.Final Fantasy IV also introduced the Active Time Battle (ATB) system to the series.  Basically, in this game, each character has a time bar that fills up according to the character's Speed stat.  When the bar fills up, the character is able to take an action.  The enemies have ATB bars also, but you can't see them. So you will need to plan your strategies carefully, but yet think fast, because while you are debating on what spell to have Rosa or Rydia cast, the enemies will continue to attack.In addition, those who had previously played this game on the SNES will be pleasantly surprised to see that the game has been completely re-translated, resulting in a storyline that makes a little more sense and is a little easier to understand (and the infamous \"Spoony Bard\" line is still there).  Also, there are many more items and abilities in the game that were left out of the original SNES version.As to Chrono Trigger, this game is not part of the Final Fantasy series, though it is from the same company that produced those games.  Many other reviewers have commented on the long loading times for this game.  I found that the load times were on the order of 5 seconds or so for most battles and menu screens.  Saving the game takes a little longer.  It didin't bother me too much, but I can see how others, particularly those who played the SNES version, could be annoyed.Chrono Trigger follows the story of Chrono, a young man who is good friends with Lucca, the local inventor.  One day during the local town festival, they encounter a mysterious young girl named Marle.  While looking at Lucca's latest invention, Marle suddenly disappears, leaving only her pendant behind.  Chrono and Lucca follow her...CT is different from most RPGs in that instead of traversing a large world to discover new places, this world is much smaller and the new discoveries come in the form of time travel.  There are several different eras that you will visit in the course of playing this game, ranging from the mists of prehistory to the far future.As in FFIV, each character in the game has his or her own unique abilities, with certain characters being more \"Tank\" types and others leaning more towards magic use.  However, in this game, you have a little more control over who is in your party at one time.  Also, each character has certain \"Tech\" abilities.  Different characters can create powerful Double or Triple Tech attacks when working as a team, thus allowing for many different attacking strategies, depending on the party's composition.Another cool thing about CT is the fact that, depending on your actions in the game, you will get one of a dozen or so different endings.  The different endings enhance the replayability of this game quite a bit.  The Chronicles version also contains several new anime cutscenes that were created by the same person who drew the Dragonball anime series.  Anyone who has ever watched any episodes of Dragonball Z will see the resemblance immediately.Overall, this is a truly excellent game, with a lot of nice surprises and features even for those who own the original SNES cartridges.  Although the load times are noticeable, they really aren't that bad and shouldn't turn someone off this game.  Highly, highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2004"}

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"S.L.J.C.O.A.A.A.T.R. \"SCOTTY\"","summary":"KINDOM OF WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?","reviewText":"WHEN I FIRST GOT THIS GAME I WAS LIKE WHAT THE HECK?I DIDN'T KNOW THEY COULD COMBINE VIDEO GAMES!THIS IS #1 ON YHE MUST HAVE LIST IF YOU ASK ME!EACH LEVEL IS ANOTHER WORLD FROM A FAMOUS AND POPULAR DISNEY MOVIE/GAME SERIES.IN EACH WORLD YOU HAVE DIFFERENT PARTNEERS TO HELP YOU FIGHT THE EVIL HEARTLESS,SEAL THE KEYHOLE AND COMPLETE CHALLENGES TO PROVE THAT YOU'RE A HERO IN TRAINING.IN SOME WORLDS YOUR ON YOUR ON YOUR OWN TO SEE IF YOU'RE STRONG ENOUGH TO DESTROY THE HEARTLESS ONCE AND FOR ALL.GOOD LUCK WITH THIS.IT'S TOUGH YET TONS OF FUN.YOU HAVE TO GET IT!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2005"}

Positively shocking.","reviewText":"Hands-down one of the best Bond games I've ever played. Now that's not saying much, because the only other high-quality Bond game out there is the original Goldeneye for N64. But overall, this game is great (especially at the new reduced price). The gameplay is approaching greatness, but I often found myself struggling with the cover system. The controls seem clunky here, with Bond often stepping out of cover and taking direct fire when you attempt to move from one cover area to another, or failing to dive for cover when you (desperately) need him to. Cover is a major part of the game, so this is no small frustration. For some reason he also doesn't like to sprint when you need him to, despite the fact that the control mechanism for this is very easy in theory (just press/hold L3 button). Another overly difficult control feature is driving. Right off I knew I hated the driving missions, and subsequent missions/vehicles only added to my distaste. Every so often you pick up a new vehicle (Aston Martins new and old, a boat, a wrecker, etc.) and need to chase someone through a level of arbitrary obstacles while dodging fire. These levels seemed uneven and forced, and required memorization of obstacle locations (through trial and error) for successful navigation of them. Take one wrong turn, hit another car, barrier, etc. and you're unlikely to recover quick enough to maintain proper distance from your target vehicle. Given the tightness of the distance required to keep the mission running, I was surprised by how incredibly difficult it was to drive each vehicle. It felt more like pushing a shopping cart full of cinder blocks with one broken wheel. Very tough to turn without slamming into walls, nearly impossible to get moving again once you hit something and stop, and overall a very annoying diversion from the primary mission objectives. I enjoyed them less and less as they popped up again and again. Now that said, everything else about the game was quite enjoyable. The story was great, the gameplay mostly intuitive, and the audio/video quality was decent. Overall I'm giving the game 4 stars, especially at the current half-price point. 007 will not be disappointed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2011"}

Reviewers pointed out that Sonic's previous games were miles ahead better and I find nostalgia can help make a game's success. After all, that one game that critics hated at the time might've been one of your favorites but looking at it now you go \"wow did that game have issues\". Therein lies the major issue/fun with the Ultimate Genesis Collection: does the bulk of these games stand the test of time? Some definately do while others will probably get barely a few minutes before you decide it's awful but there's a lot of work to be done here if you get this.One of the most important and influential game series that kickstarted the Sega Genesis was Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega's answer to Nintendo's Mario and included is a truckload of Sonic games: 1, 2, 3, Sonic and Knuckles, 3D Blast, Pinball and to a degree, Dr. Beatnik's Mean Bean Machine, a puzzle game akin to Dr. Wario, Yoshi's Cookie and Super Puzzle Fighter II. The first 4 are great and well worth the purchase while 3D Blast controls awkwardly, Pinball is decent but not stellar and Mean Bean Machine is good though later stages work a bit too damn fast for my tastes.Another group featured is the side scroller platformer which run the gamut from Ristar to Kid Chameleon (woo!) to Decap Attack to E-Swat (big eh) to 2 Vectorman games. Beat-em-ups like Streets of Rage and Golden Axe are included and for RPG fans: all 4 Phantasy Stars. It's safe to say that nearly every kind of game is available on here from long drawn-out games to quicker arcade-y stuff but be warned: some of these games are...kind of hard. Not in that underpowered \"everyone's better than you\" way like a Ninja Gaiden but rather many times in the games you won't even get continues so if you die, boom, Game Over and you're sent back to the title screen which is really disheartening and I'm surprised I don't remember getting more furious when I was younger.Now of course any collection from greatest hits to game collections is bound to have some stuff missing or curious additions. Fatal Labyrinth well...sucks, the Ecco games are familiar but playing through them, they're surprisingly boring and Super Thunder Blade is too easy to die in. But then, most likely because of dual releases on the Super Nintendo we're missing some other favorites: Battletoads, Toe Jam and Earl, the awesome WWF games, Maximum Carnage, any of the Road Rashes and to be honest, I quite liked the Aero the Acro-Bat games. Most of these games you probably wouldn't give the time of day too while other ones like Ristar and Comix Zone actually surprised me.Naturally like all Xbox 360 games, there's achievements and these aren't just simply beat game, beat game kind but rather objective based so for example one of Golden Axe's achievements is to use magic a certain amount of times. Easy right? Every time you get a magic ability, use it and eventually, there we go. And thanks to the ability to save games anywhere you want but pressing the Back button, some achievements like the ones for Mean Bean Machine, Columns or Sonic Pinball can be done just by saving states after a certain time and loading save if you die. There's a couple like \"Yatta!\" that can potentially drive you crazy since it's more luck than anything while others are just simply \"Turn to easy, max lives, play\".Another disappointing factor is that the games don't have online play, whether co-op for Golden Axe or Streets of Rage or leaderboards. Imagine competing against somebody to see who can get the highest score in Columns or taking on enemies with other buddies but sadly none of it are implemented and it's strictly offline co-op. But there's quite a few unlockables from videos of the games' developers to additional games (while unlocking Shinobi is cool, Congo Bongo flat out sucks) but it's the games that are important and for completionists, having so much games to beat will surely keep you busy.The Ultimate Genesis Collection is tough to judge as a game because for every Sonic the Hedgehog or surprising gem like Ristar there's godawfulness from Fatal Labyrinth to Flicky to Bonanza Bros. However getting all Sonics, Phantasy Stars, Streets of Rage, and Golden Axes on one disc is reason enough to get it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2009"}

Finkel \"Jack of Trades\"","summary":"Best Genesis Collection Available","reviewText":"Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection finally delivers a comprehensive suite of Genesis games with all the right trimmings.  This is by far the best retro game collection available and an amazing value at it's bargain-title price.  It may not please graphics-hungry teens and some of the titles show their age worse than others, but easily a must-buy for anyone who grew up with a Sega Genesis or appreciates older games (especially side scrollers and RPGs).Selection of Games (5/5):With a library of hundreds of games, Genesis fans may not find all of their favorite games, but I was extremely impressed by the selection, which included most of my favorites.  Just the sheer amount of games was impressive, but even the ones I hadn't heard of were worth playing.  Including Outrun, Virtua Fighter, Virtua Racing, Eternal Champions, Columns III, and a few other games would have really been unbelievable, still my expecations were far exceeded. Shoyu gave an excellent rundown on the games, though I do think the Altered Beast (arcade version) unlockable deserves a much higher score.Production Quality (5/5):This is the slickest production I've seen for a retro games collection.  The menus are fast and easy to use.  You have stars next to each game so you can easily rate your favorites.  There is also a few paragraphs written about each game you can lookup.  The best part of the whole production is simply the conversion.  Each title looks even better than on the original hardware.  The sound and controls (despite the directional pad on the xbox) are spot on.  My favorite feature is the toggle for smoothing and widescreen, which is saved for each game individually.  Also worth a mention is the robust file saving, which allows several slots for each game and you can save at any time!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2009"}

Rool and his vast army of Kremlings. The incredible Advanced Computer Modeling (ACM) graphics in this game have been specially optimized for the Game Boy. If you play this game with the Super Game Boy accessory for the Super NES, you'll have access to specially selected color palettes and custom border graphics.As the story begins, K. Rool has kidnapped Donkey Kong, and he's demanding the entire Banana Hoard as ransom. It's up to Diddy Kong and Dixie Kong to rescue their kidnapped pal. A wild assortment of friendly animals like Rambi the Rhino, Squitter the Spider, Squawks the Parrot, Rattly the Rattlesnake, and Enguarde the Swordfish help the two little monkeys in their adventurous mission through over 40 levels. Each exciting area is filled with special traps, hidden items, and dastardly Kremlings.People who have playedDonkey Kong Country 2on the Super NES will recognize many of the elements of this game. For example, Diddy Kong can do his signature cartwheel, and Dixie Kong can do her helicopter hair spin. And, you'll need to collect Kremcoins to be able to pass Klubba's Kiosk and get on to the Lost World. But, unlike the game's Super NES counterpart, one character cannot throw the other, and it's only a one-player game. Of course, you can always pause the game and hand it to a friend if you want some two-player fun!","reviewerName":"potato_salad \"Marqus\"","summary":"BEST of the Greatest Series of All-Time","reviewText":"Concept: Take an incredibly fun game(Donkey Kong Country) and make it better by including better graphics, better music(my favorite soundtrack of all time), a better plot, new pals and more bad guys.Story: Donkey Kong gets kidnapped by King K. Rool and it is up to Diddy(sidekick on Donkey Kong Country) and Dixie to save him. Old pals aiding you in your questare Rambi the Rhino(brute strength), Enguarde the swordfish(defeat underwater foes), and Squawks the parrot(to fly). You also have new pals: Rattly the rattlesnake(mad hops), Squitter the spider(webs to reach higher goals), Clapper the seal(to freee water or cool it), and Glimmer the angler fish(to help see underwater).Graphics: Look at this game. You can tell me the pirate theme is not cool. The environments are incredible for being a SNES game. If you thought Donkey Kong Country looked good wait till you see this one.Best seen on Lost World levelsMusic: You'll love Diddy's monkey rap and Dixie's strumming the electric guitar. Thats just when you beat the level. You will find yourself humming the beat to yourself everywhere you go. The soundtrack is so amazing that I had to download it and put it on a cd so I could listen to it wherever I go.Best heard on the Krazy Kremland levelsDifficultly: The game puts up little resistance when trying to beat it but trying to master it(100% comletion) is extremely difficult. Some levels may be harder than others but there are a few trials in the game.Best examples on Gloomy Gulch levelsGameplay: You have some new moves in this one. You can team up and throw your partner to reach higher platforms of defeat enemies. You also can do a helicopter spin with Dixie for reach far away platforms.Overall: As I stated for the title, this is my favorite series of all time and all the Donkey Kong's for SNES are MASTERPIECES. It's a shame to see that Nintendo has been making spin-offs of Donkey Kong(Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, King of Swing, Donkey Konga 1 & 2, & Mario vs. Donkey Kong), while these games may or may not be good, we have yet to see a Donkey Kong platform game since Donkey Kong 64. Whether there is a reason I don't know, but I hope Nintendo will make one before the Revolution comes out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2005"}
{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait. You can't buy a much better game.--John CockingPros:A story to beat all storiesCharacters worth caring aboutHey--it's from SquareSoftStunning animationsCons:Too many random battlesCombat is, as always, turn-based and offers minimal excitementWeak souls might give up after two or three discs of play","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"Retro Review: Not the Best Final Fantasy But Worth Playing","reviewText":"I'll preface by saying that I'm a huge fan of RPGs and of the Final Fantasy series. Turn-based, action, Japanese or Western oriented RPGs - it makes no difference to me. A good game is a good game and I always try to completely experience a game before rendering judgment. That said, I first purchased Final Fantasy VIII shortly after it was released in 1999. However, for various reasons I never finished the game. Only recently did I decide to pick the game back up and finish what I had started so many years ago.For a game that is over ten years old the graphics in Final Fantasy still impress. Though I'll admit that graphics aren't really a top priority to me. Typical for a PS1 era game, FFVIII uses pre-rendered backgrounds with polygonal character models. The backgrounds look mostly great though the character models definitely show the games age. Still the models are a huge improvement over those used in FFVII. Square has always been known for their great CG movie sequences and FFVIII displays the developers masterful competence at creating short but moving CG sequences. Throughout the 4-disc adventure you'll be treated to a wide variety of jaw-dropping CG sequences that help move the story along.Gameplay is Final Fantasy's bread-n-butter. FFVIII features an incredibly deep and customizable system that I only now realize was far ahead of it's time. Characters don't gain the ability to use magic in the traditional level-grinding ways. Instead characters 'Draw' magic from enemies. In other words as you battle enemies you can siphon magic from the enemies own reserve. There's no limit on the amount of magic you can siphon from one enemy, however, generally speaking, the stronger the magic the less you can 'draw'. There is a lot more to the system including your character levels which directly impact the level of enemies and thus the magic they're carrying.The popular summons make a return though in altered form. In FFVIII summons are called Guardian Forces or GFs for short. The great thing about the GFs is that each must be defeated in battle before gaining the ability to use them. It's a fantastic design decision by Square that lends to a sense of accomplishment. GFs in FFVIII are similar to party members in that they have levels and experience points and can take damage in battle. Each GF also has a list of abilities that can be learned by earning 'AP' (ability points) in battle. The abilities include things like upgraded HP or increased attack power to very specific abilities that can be utilized by your characters.Each GF is attached to a character via the 'Junction' system. This system provides a deep customization mechanic where you can not only Junction a GF but also specific magic to each character trait. For example a powerful spell like 'Ultima' could be Junctioned to a characters HP thus rendering a large HP bonus. Or that same magic attached to a characters Strength for added physical damage to attacks. Status effect magic - bio, sleep, confuse, etc. - can be junctioned as well to a characters attack or defense rendering the ability to inflict status effects by attacking or gaining increased defense against those same attacks. Like I said, it's a very deep system.A memorable musical score is present in FFVIII and while it's not my favorite soundtrack the music is always fitting for the particular event in-game. As far as sidequests and extras go FFVIII is bursting at the seams. There is a full-fledged card-battle mini-game called Triple Triad that could have probably been released as a standalone title. There are plenty of optional GFs to collect including the most powerful GF of all - Eden. There are chocobo mini-games and many other Final Fantasy staples too. There is even an optional 'Weapon' battle for those familiar with the battle against Ruby & Emerald Weapons in FFVII. This time around the challenge has been turned all the way up for Omega Weapon!All that said, there is a lot to like about FFVIII. But there are a few areas where I felt the game was lacking. Mainly I feel that the story is somewhat disjointed. Not wanting to spoil anything here I'll keep out a lot of the details. But the basic story pits you as a \"SeeD\" - a sort of elite mercenary group created for the purpose of quelling the powerful Sorceresses that influence the land. It sounds great but I feel that Square never really delivered in making my party of teenagers a believable band of elite mercs. The basic motivation is there but it's presented in an awkward way. Often characters make the strangest decisions or say the goofiest things that can probably be attributed to some cultural differences between Japanese and American cultures. I think this game could have used some additional polish and time in localization. The ending in the game is just outright poor in my opinion.My last complaint is a bit more minor but still valid. Whereas past Final Fantasy titles felt like actual livable worlds with lots to see and explore, FFVIII's world is a bit more sterile. Most of the landscape is barren with little of interest. For the majority of the game there are only a few sporadic populated areas. It almost feels like the game is based on an almost extinct planet. It's a strange feeling that I couldn't shake the entire time I played the game.I'll stop short of comparing the game directly to other Final Fantasy titles. I firmly believe that this is a quality game and worth experiencing to any fan of the series or RPGs.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2010"}

Before 1987, many Nintendo licensed games were all sports, linear adventure games, third person shoot em' ups, and puzzles, but when The Legend of Zelda was released in the US, all that was about to change.  It was one of the first NES games that had a advanced chip that allowed us to use a file/save system, instead of complicated passwords (like Metroid and Kid Icarus).  The game is a maze, but its a fun maze with improved graphics for its time and fun RPG like gameplay.  The game also contains a few simple objectives; find 8 pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom that is hidden in 8 different castles (guarded by different creatures from a three headed dragon to and one eyed fire shooting spider), find the evil Gannon and defeat him to save Princess Zelda and the Triforce of Power.  Along the way, you will come across many wierd creatures that you must ward off with three different swords, find different items and weapons that will help you progress, and contantly visit fairy fountains that will increase your life because this game is still difficult. I can go on about how fun this game is and how to progress, but I will leave that to those to the novice players.  Those who never played this classic will not be dissappointed if they buy and try.

{"product_name":"B00178631E","description":"","reviewerName":"Kristin","summary":"Meh-x Payne.  It's okay, fun for a few hours, but most of the features are boring!","reviewText":"Good1. Amazing graphics, voice work, sound, etc.  The game looks really good.2. It has a good film noir feel to it.  That having been said, its a game not a film, too bad the creators didn't remember that.3. About halfway through the game Max starts to look a lot like Walter White.  Not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.4. Writing is kind of clever sometimes.  Some of the things that Max says in his voice overs are fun in a noir sort of way.Bad1. It's basically like watching a movie and every once in a while I'll actually get to play a little game.  The cutscenes go on and on for several minutes at a time.  Then you get a little squirt of action only to be interrupted by more cutscenes.  At least 3/4 of the cutscenes could have been done in an interactive manner by the player.  This is supposed to be an interactive video game, not a movie.  So when I was sitting there forced to watch cutscene after cutscene I was getting seriously bored and a little annoyed.  Moving the story along is fine but seriously, its a game!2. While I love how destructible the environment is, it doesn't really matter because I feel like you're always being pushed to keep going instead of giving you time to enjoy and explore your area.  So you never really feel like you can look around (say for useless clues or even more useless golden gun parts) or have a little fun by destroying everything in sight, not that the destruction makes any difference anyway.  So its all pretty useless and stupid.3. The story is muddled at best.  This is the first Max Payne game I've played so I didn't come into this with any history or expectation.  But this story is uninspiring, kind of boring and a little all over the place thanks to poorly executed flashbacks.4. Bullet time seems like a neat concept, but I didn't get to use it much because like GTA, the game seems to be more cover and shoot based rather than being about slow mo leaping around shooting everyone in bullet time which seemed like a neat original way to play but it just doesn't work here.  You only have enough time to shoot a few guys if you're lucky and then you land totally exposed in the leap shoot mode thing, at which point you are generally riddled with holes.5. I also got the Rockstar Pass as part of the original purchase which included all the DLC's.  What I didn't know was that every DLC is for multi-player and unless you already have friends playing the game who you can hook up with, finding people to play in most of the multiplayer modes (except a couple) is very hit or miss, thus rendering that entire portion of the game completely useless along with every single DLC...lovely.  There were other reasons why multiplayer didn't work out well for me, but basically that's an huge component of the game it seems.6. To be honest, I didn't feel anything for any of the characters.  I didn't feel the caring or urgency to WANT to save the people Max was protecting because frankly, the little bit that we learned about then was that they weren't very likable and they certainly weren't particularly interesting either.  Beyond that, we really don't know much about them so how then can we feel something when something happens to them?  We don't and in this regard the game fails.  If you look at other games like Dragon Age Origins, Tomb Raider (2013), etc they do a wonderful job of character development so that you actually care about what happens to them and you become more invested in the game.  That doesn't happen here.  Even the story wasn't that interesting.  I had it pegged pretty early on, so the rest was predictable.7. I don't speak Portuguese and I was thinking that maybe I was missing a sub-title toggle or something.  They speak a lot of Portuguese in the game and you sit there wondering what they're saying.  I suppose from the perspective of Max Payne who also doesn't speak Portuguese it's reasonable to think this would be his view of things as well, but you know, it is a game and it would be nice to know what they heck these people are saying most of the time.8. Not a ton of game-play really.  You shoot through the story pretty quick and then you're done.  I think I wrapped this one in 22 hours including a few explorations into arcade mode and multi-player, both of which fell short for me.  Sure you can do multiplayer if you can find someone to play with and arcade mode is good for a few minutes until you get bored, I got really bored with arcade mode really fast, but its not like there's a lot of missions or an open world to explore.  You're really locked into a track and there's nothing outside of that.9. When you go to quit instead of just saying quit or cancel it does these oddly worded choices which I guess are supposed to be in keeping with the noir theme but for me it was just confusing the first couple of times.  I had to just figure out that the first one meant quit and the 2nd meant cancel.10. The game is really hard, even on medium it seemed much harder than most games on a medium setting.  That having been said, the game does take pity on you by giving you more and more pills and ammo if you continue to die in the same place over and over again.  To the point in which a semi-retarded cocker spaniel could probably clear the checkpoint.  So there is that.11. I found arcade mode to be really boring.  You're just playing over the same action scenes and there's no point in playing against the leader-board because the cheaters have basically put up unrealistic numbers that you'll never come close to if you play it honestly, so there wasn't much value in arcade mode for me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

Unreal is incredibly fast-paced and fun. There are alternate games like &quot;Double Domination&quot; and classics like &quot;Capture the Flag,&quot; but don't kid yourself...

{"product_name":"B002I0J6DC","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"An epic adventure","reviewText":"Judging from the reviews it seems like there are strong opinions on this game from both sides.  I for one personally loved this game and very glad I finally decided to give this game a chance.I grew up in the 80's/90's so I am very familiar with many of the old school games like Metroid, Zelda, and Castlevania; probably my three favorite franchises of all time.  Though I never played every Castlevania game, I did like Castlevania 64 which many people hated.  I was on the fence with this one but decided to take my chances a few months after the original release.I found the graphics amazing.  From pressing through the misty swamps to hiking through the crumbling ruins of past civilizations I felt as if I were actually there.  I can tell by the sheer amount of detail in each level that the graphics team obviously spent a lot of time in getting these environments just right.  In addition to the beautiful scenery, the bosses and NPC's also were done very well.  Some of the smaller enemies are not as well done, but that doesn't take away from the overall look of the game.The sounds are great as well.  The voice acting is spot on and the background music goes very well with the gameplay and the background story.  It is quite reminiscent of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and many times I found myself thinking of that movie while I played through the game especially since this game seems to play as a movie itself.Gameplay is good and the controls are very smooth and responsive.  At first I was overwhelmed by the sheer amount of combo moves and powers you could purchase, but after a while I was pretty used to them and while I eventually ended up buying all the combos I only used a handful of them on a regular basis.  Speaking of combos, you will need to learn some of them because while some of the weaker enemies can easily be taken down by just mashing buttons some of the stronger and smarter foes require strategic attacks and defensive maneuvers to advance or you will find yourself dying often (i.e. Greater Lycans). One small complaint I have about the combat is the QTE which requires you to press a button (any button), before 3 on screen circles converge.  It was cool the first few times, but after a while it gets pretty monotonous.  I would have liked to see a God of War type QTE which required a specific rotation of your thumb stick.One thing I absolutely loved about this game was the many puzzles.  While I was able to solve all the puzzles without the help of a guide I did enjoy the challenge and more importantly I found them fun especially after I solved them.  Unlike some other games that either make the puzzles way too easy or just bombards you with puzzles the entire game, this game has a good balance of puzzles and difficulty to challenge you just enough to get your creative juices flowing.  Of course if you REALLY don't want to be bothered with the puzzles then you can always just unlock the solution, but you lose the puzzle solving bonus as well as the pleasure of figuring it out yourself.  The favorite puzzle for me has to be the music box puzzle which you encounter later in the game followed by the chess-like Vampire War game that occurs earlier.  The puzzles add a nice touch to the game and without them I probably would have felt that the game was missing something.The difficulty of this game may be a bit harder than many video games these days, but honestly after playing it and keeping at it, I didn't find it as difficult as I originally did as I got further in the game.  For comparison, its not as hard of the original God of War and I would say it's probably right on par with God of War III in terms of difficulty. If I were to play through it again on the same difficulty I probably could easily zoom through it, so if I do end up playing it again it will be on a harder difficulty.Also different from many games these days is the sheer length of this game.  I don't know how many game hours I spent playing this game to completion, but I started playing in March and didn't finish until a couple of days before I wrote this review.  That is nearly 3 months of playing on an off.  Now keep in mind I spent a lot of time backtracking to pick up missed items so I could get 100%, but still it's a long game even if you don't go back.  I got this game for half of the original price but even at the full price I would say this game is one of the few games that warrant such a high price tag.The storyline while not that original was greatly told and narrated by Patrick Stewart.  Basically we have Gabrielle Belmont looking to avenge the death of his wife and seeks the power to bring her back from the dead.  While this story is nothing new, the path Gabrielle goes on to achieve his goals and the many different people he meets during his quest makes the story very enjoyable.  The final moments of the game before during and after the final boss fight was brilliantly done, I don't want to spoil it, so all I will say is that I was staring at the screen in amazement as I watched the final events unfold. Hopefully this is just a start of the story and I will be very interested in seeing how things continue from here.All in all a great game all across the board, there are some few issues with not being able to control the camera, but it did not affect me much during the game.  Many of the times I fell to my death is because I mistimed a jump or purposely jumped down from a ledge because I wanted to see if a secret was down there, but this had nothing to do with the camera.If you are one that is used to easier games, then you may find this game a little frustrating at first, but if you stick to it I really believe you will find it enjoyable the more and more you progress.  I have beaten the game and already find myself wanting more.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2011"}

It was underpowered (again) and the whole tablet/gamepad thing seemed like a pointless gimmick. Then there were no games for the longest time and I just forgot about it. I'm on a budget though and I've waited for about 9 months to see if the PS4 would get anything I absolutely had to have.Everything I wanted for PS4 though seemed to be coming out on  PC though. I'll always take a Steam game on holiday sale that I can install on any computer I want, anywhere I want and play with any controller/keyboard & mouse setup I want before I'll pay a premium to be tied to a controller and a TV.I'm glad I reconsidered the Wii U thoughProsFar from being a gimmick the game pad's proved incredibly handy. I do wish it had better range but even as it is it solves just about everything I couldn't stand about the PS3- lack of split-screen, typing messages and URL's, inability to continue  playing while others are watching TV, the list goes on. I wish they'd taken it a bit further though.choice of controls- a lot of games seem to give you a choice of motion, traditional or a combo. You can use the wii remote or the gamepad or pro controller. This is great for me because using motion to steer in Mario Kart gives me a lot  tighter control. I also enjoy swinging the Wii remote around - it really enhances the experience to standup and jump and doge in real time when facing off against a boss in Skyward Sword. You can always switch over to the regular old pro controller too though if you're too used to joysticks. Personally I'm bored to death of classic controllers and carpal tunnel is starting to be a bit of a problem with both controllers and Keyboard and mouse schemes.Backlog of awesome games- There's a ton of stuff I never got to play on not only the old Wii but on the N64. I missed Skyward Sword, for instance, and also Okami, smash bro's, Mario Galaxies, Xenoblade- the list of awesome games now available at rock-bottom prices is just massive- if you can deal with a little pixelation. Don't forget about other classic Nintendo titles. I've always wanted to play Super Mario 64 and Starfox 64 but was too busy with Goldeneye and Conker's bad fur day and too poor as a kid on an allowance to get to them at the time. Wii U plays them all.Beautiful art styles. Just now getting to Skyward Sword I find the painterly art style has aged a lot better than the hyper-realistic games like Skyrim. I've been playing Skyrim off and on since it came out in 2011. Skyward Sword came out the same month and looking at them side by side now I can feel Skyrim's age. A little pixelation aside Skyward Sword looks like it could have been released last week.The only party console. All the community building in the world won't give Xbone or PS4 the same group entertainment value as Mario Kart and a case of beer.The best games are yet to come. Xenoblade X, Hyrule Warriors, Smash Bro's , and an awesome looking new original Zelda with true open world gameplay are all on the way through 2015. You've got 2 years worth of awesome original slated for release at this point.Price: I picked up a 32GB console on Craigslist like new, with pro controller, a couple wii motion plus remotes, and extra HDMI cable and a game for $175.Same discount levels as Steam on downloaded titles. Right now Ubisoft has games 75% off in the Nintendo eStore and the Mario Kart 8 deal will get you another free game through the end of July (in my case 2 free games because the first disk didn't work and I had to exchange it. Gamestop let me keep the first registration code.)Online is coming together.Cons:Still a small Wii U library. that's changing though. Nintendo's recognized they've screwed up with the lack of software and they're working to fix it.Resistive touch screen on gamepad.  A touch screen at all is a great improvement over traditional controllers but the ubiquity of capacitive screens makes resistive anything a little annoying. This is the best resistive screen i've used yet- far better than I was expecting.A lack of 3'rd party titles. Again, not a problem for me since I prefer all the power, modding, price cuts and a choice of controller that PC affords.  I will miss Naughty Dog and Kojima titles though.A lack of blood and gore. Again not a problem for me- PCa lack of edginess in storylines. It's unfortunate but I don't see the same visceral cinematic experience seen in Last of Us coming to Wii U any time soon.The game pad needs to go further with at least a capacitive screen and a better range.I'd highly recommend the Wii U for any PC gamer, anyone with kids, or anyone who wants to have fun with friends in the same room.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2014"}
{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"Redmond Jackson \"Redmond Original\"","summary":"It's awful","reviewText":"Here's a list of many things that are wrong with the Wii U:- The ports of games from 360/PS3 play and look worse on the Wii U. Some are much worse- Every single game requires about a 200 meg update to function with Miiverse. It's a problem because:- Download speeds from Nintendo's servers are awful. The very first thing you need to do is download a system update that's well over 1 gig in size. It took me 2.5 hours to get  it. After that every single game you play requires an update.- Games/demos/apps have to be downloaded, which takes forever, but then they have to be installed, which also takes forever, and then they require updates which take forever. It's just terrible. I bought NSMBU from the Eshop. It's 1.8 gig in size. The download took 2 hours (keep in mind that 2 gig games take under 30 minutes on my other consoles). The subsequent install of the game took another 15-20 minutes. That's ridiculous.- Nintendo finally have accounts so that your purchases are tied to you instead of to your hardware, but they tied your account to the hardware. In other words you can't log into someone else's Wii U and play your own games that you paid for. Terrible, Nintendo. Just terrible.- The entire OS and UI is slow. Want to go to settings? 15 seconds. Want to visit Miiverse? Another 15 seconds. Want to click on a message in Miiverse? Yep, another 15 seconds. Everything is dreadfully slow.- If you use HDMI, you can't use audio from the other AV port on the Wii U. So be prepared for that. If you want HDMI video, you're forced to also use that audio stream. There is no Optical Out on the Wii U. There's also no Ethernet Port.- Nintendo used a Bluray drive, but refused to pay the licensing fee so we can't watch Bluray movies on our Wii Us. Cheap, Nintendo. Real cheap.- Load times for all games is ridiculously bad. Even games installed to the drive.There's so many other issues that I don't have time to list.My advice is buy one if you absolutely must have Nintendo's exclusives. Do NOT buy one if you're expecting to play better versions of 360/PS3 games. You wont get that.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00005ME8S","description":"Originally released in 1998, the PC version ofHalf-Lifechanged  first-person shooters forever by proving that a compelling story can be told within  the genre. Prior to the game's release, first-person shooters were mindless  action games.Half-Life, while containing its fair share of action, also  contained plenty of exploration, puzzle, and story elements. Now released as a  PlayStation2 game,Half-Lifehas never looked or played better. This  version contains the outstanding single-player story mode, as well as a few new  ones. While the new additions aren't so great, the story mode is one of the best  escapades available on the PS2.The game follows the adventures of Gordon Freeman, a young research associate at  the Black Mesa Federal Research Facility. A typical day at the office goes  completely awry as numerous alien life forms invade the facility. The fate of  the facility, and quite possibly the world, is in the hands of an unlikely hero.The graphics here trump the original's (understandable, as more than three years  have passed). The character models have four times as many polygons, as well as  smoother textures and animations. The sound is also very good, with some of the  funniest voice acting yet heard in a game. Of course, the single-player gameplay  is excellent, thanks to some very well-developed enemy artificial intelligence.Unfortunately, the new modes aren't nearly as brilliant. Decay, the new  cooperative mode, seems like an afterthought and pales in comparison to the  cooperative modes inPerfect DarkandHalo. Deathmatches only  support two players, which is incredibly lame considering many PS2 first-person  shooters support four. Despite these flawed modes, the single-player story is so  superb that it totally warrants a purchase.--Raymond M.

It's only about the single player campaign.The COD MW2 storyline is very weak.  The missions are disjointed. On most missions, I don't know why I'm doing the mission...and some of the missions don't seem to relate to other missions (so, why do them? ...just because they are the next mission and you need to do them to get through the game).The objectives are simple: go here, kill people, go there, kill people, open a door, kill people, go upstairs, kill people, shoot everything, etc.  Run, gun, take cover, run gun take cover...boring.  It's amazing how many bad guys there are in some missions...sometimes it feels like your fighting an army, when it's really just thugs in a slum.COD MW2 is about war with Russia.  Old news.  Modern warfare?  I don't think so.  Leave Russia alone.  Want an enemy?  Then go with Iran or North Korea.The graphics are well done.The sound is good, except you can't lower/turn-off the music.The controls are fine.They do make it easy throughout the game by indicating on-screen what keys to hit for special situations/actions...that was helpful.I found myself bored with the game. One-third through the game, I changed it to \"recruit\" level and used god mode...just to get through the missions to get through the game.The only unique mission (a mission that is more than just go here, kill people, etc.) is the Cliffhanger mission.  I may replay that mission some day. It includes ice climbing and snowmobiling. The only reason I finished the game was to see if there were other unique missions like Cliffhanger.  There weren't.The last mission (Endgame) with the Zodiac boat chase was okay.The \"No Russian\" mission (the mission you can skip) was bad.  It made no sense, and it didn't add anything to the game.  In past COD games, you are the good guy.  In this mission, you are the terrorist, slaughtering 100s of civilians in a Russian airport.  There is no point to it at all, and it can be skipped without any impact to the game play or the story (what story?).On some missions, you are fighting Russians in Washington DC.  If the Russians want DC, then let them have it.  My guess is that they don't want the dysfunction.  They'd rather have Yellowstone Park or Yosemite Park...must nicer places.The fighting from residential house to residential house in DC was ridiculous.You don't just play the character \"Soap\".  In this COD, you play several different roles (but you don't get to pick the roles).The last few missions continue the weak/lame story. All of sudden, you are fighting other American soldiers. Conspiracy. Exciting?  No.  Nothing new here.I paid 10 bucks for this game (downloaded from Steam during one of their sales). I can't imagine paying full price for it.  With the exception of the Cliffhanger mission, MW2 is so much like MW1 that it's not worth buying both of them (my vote is MW1). The game is rated for \"language\", not strong language; I didn't notice the language much in the game, but I also kept the volume low...repetitive shooting/explosions get boring after a short while.The best Call of Duty games were the WWII games. The modern warfare games have better graphics, but little or no story. This will be my last COD purchase.  I really don't care to waste my time/money with similar weak plots and run/gun in future modern warfare releases.

As a little kid, I did, however, watch the show pretty much every time it was on and enjoyed it. Now, I'm guessing about 6 years later, my interests have completely changed. And, yes, my favorite superhero is now Spider-Man :). But, having the love of action/RPG/Adventure games, I added this to my Christmas list, and, sure enough, I recieved it. The levels can be complex; some more than others. In the first level, you start out as the Dark Knight on what seems to be a normal nightly patrol. But, as you go deeper into the story, you realize he is looking for someone. As you continue his search, you must adjust your eyes to the dark (and sometimes ANNOYINGLY dark) setting around you, climb ladders, glide from building to building, and do many other things, just like you do in pretty much every level. At the end of the level, you stumble upon a bound & gagged woman. As you walk up to untie her, a silent muffle comes from beneath her taped-shut mouth. You pull the tape off, and a shrill scream cries, \"IT'S A TRAP!!\". You grab the girl and get out of there as fast as you can, and, after that, Batman's new journey begins.This game is just like the old series, \"Batman: The Animated Series\", complete with Batgirl, the butler (forget his name), The Joker, Mr. Freeze, and many, many others, though, strangely, no \"Boy Wonder\" Robin. Too bad. It would've been cool if you could switch characters every other level or something like that, but, moving on.

Molina \"Superior Combatant\"","summary":"CoD Veteran Blown Away","reviewText":"I have been playing Call of Duty since CoD4: Modern Warfare and have been turned off by each sequel. I really enjoyed world at War and Modern Warfare 2, but started to get bored by Black Ops. Last year I purchased both MW3 and Battlefield 3 and was so disappointed with MW3 that I got rid of it. I was hesitant to purchase Black Ops 2 due to the sameness of the game and lost my love for the series. After getting talked into it by my brother, I went with him to to the Midnight release. I can say I found my love again. This game feels like BF3, MW2, and Black Ops had a baby. This is what every other Call of Duty 4 sequel should have been. I went in it thinking it was call of Duty and boy was I wrong.The gameplay, mechanics, and elements are different. The Graphics are the best period. Every other call of Duty looked the same but the graphics in this one look like frostbite 2 engine. I spent up to an hour just trying to get around create a class and all the menus. Thats how different this is.In conclusion, if your a Call of Duty fan just get it don't even wait. If your just a gamer this is the best shooter out by far.

Or if it's already there, they need to enjoy a quick replay of it and stop complaining for a few hours.  When it was released it was breath of fresh air to both the action/adventure genre and the survival horror genre (enough with the Resident Evil for a little while, okay?).  This is one of the most unique, interesting and captivating game worlds I've ever seen in action.  The actual gameplay isn't completely without obvious influences, but it's smoothe and enjoyable to say the least.I don't normally gush about a game (with aFewNoteworthyExceptions) but i can't help it.  Dead Space is such a special kind of success that I'm hardly going to bother saying anything negative at all - which may make this among the most boring things I've ever written... so... sorry about that.If you read no further than this, just know that, if you're a fan of scary games, well paced games, or games with solid action and exceptional atmosphere, this one is a must play.Okay?So, I'm a sucker for a good story, and here we've got an obvious and successful throwback to some of the best monster movies of the 80's - specifically works of John Carpenter and anything designed by Stan Winston.  Which I am SUCH A SUCKER FOR!!  I grew up on those, man!  So, here we are on a derelict space station, empty and addrift, in control of an unlikely and ill-prepared protagonist (our poor, ill-fated mechanic Isaac).  The story moves along with a skin-tingling, deliberate pace, punctuated by satisfying moments of the old ultra-violence.  And the monsters - oh, the monsters!  What's a horror movie without a good monster!  The \"necromorphs\" are incredibly satisfying, imaginative and terrifying in equal turns.  I won't go into detail at all, because I want the nine people who haven't played this game yet to experience them without too much warning, but they are frightening and relentless - just like a horror monster should be!  They're an excellent take on the typical \"zombie\" we've all come to know and love and grow sick of, and a real worthy foe.The game is all about combat and, except for a few terrifying moments early on, you never go unamred.  The weapons are cleverly disuised as futuristic mining and maintenance tools (rivet guns and table saws and what have you)... except for the machine gun, which is just a machine gun, for some reason.  It's a clever artistic choice and makes the game continue to feel like something very new.  The combat itself is not flawless, but is far more hit than miss.  The weapons you find or buy (and later upgrade in fun ways) have their own feel and, while some are more useful than others, it's worth the effort to experiment with each one's primary and secondary functions to help you conserve ammo and better survive on higher difficutly levels.  It's only in close combat situations that the clunkyness of Isaac becomes an issues.  He swings with such reckless abandon that be becomes a bumbling, uselss meat target for a few second - long enough to be reduced to little pieces (literally) by your HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE enemies.  But it's rarely enough to take you out of the game.  And, hell, the brutal, dismembering deaths are worth checking out anyway!And every game designer ever can take a page here about atomsphere and, even more so, sound design.  Clicking claws, heavy breathing, voices IN MY MIND, the absolute silence of a vacuum... it's enough to give you nightmares and makes the Dead Space series something truly, truly unique.  It's a success in every sense of the word.Dead Space is a triumph of imaginiation, a champion of atmosphere, and a good solid stand-alone title in terms of story telling and gameplay.  It's a true gem and an excellent departure from some of the more prevelant and over-used gameplay elements.  A must play for any gamer and a must own for any horror fan.So pick it up and stop complaining about a lack of imagination in the industry!  Enjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2012"}

Stock car racing is for adults, for example, and paintball isn't intended for 6 year olds. In the same manner, Grand Theft Auto 3 isn't meant for your 4 year old niece. It's a game deliberately geared towards the millions of adult gamers who make up a large segment of the gaming population.The game taps into the current love of shows like The Sopranos and movies like The Godfather and Goodfellas. Sure, we know that the mob causes harm. But we still love to watch and read about them, and we can feel understanding as they fight to maintain their own style of honor and family while other groups try to muscle in.You start out as a bank robber who was betrayed by his girlfriend. Sprung out of a police convoy through a lucky situation, you and your new friend, \"8-Ball\", are starting out in the world of crime. A member of the local mafia asks you for some simple help ferrying a girl around. Taxi service, really. But when you do a good job, the requests get more complex ... and more rewarding.This game is impressive on many levels. First, there's the basic graphics. It's a fully immersive world that you can walk around on, much like EverQuest. But instead of forests and glades, it's a fully realized city, complete with bridges, subways, pedestrians, cars, vans, even police helicopters. Everything is interactive. Jump in a car, drive down a few blocks, hop out, walk on the pedestrian walkway. Your world is huge, and each area (Chinatown, etc) has its own character.The vehicles have different models, the world cycles from dawn to day to dusk to night. Street lights come on, signs glow. Traffic lights cycle green to red, and you have to pay attention to what you're doing. Other drivers aren't always paying attention to the lights, especially when they're in the middle of a chase. So defensive driving is definitely the order of the day.There are many different gangs that the mafia are bumping up against - the Columbians, the Yakuza, and many more. Each have their own turf, their own preferred cars, their own radio stations they tend to listen to! The missions you take on start to get you involved with the different gangs as well as other small-time hoods.Sure, this game isn't about helping elderly widows walk to church each Sunday through a grassy lane. It's about taking on jobs to bring entertainment to the cops for their Policeman's Ball as quickly as possible. It's picking up a double-crosser so the boss can talk with him. But one of the pleasures of gaming, just like any other form of entertainment, is that it lets you imagine worlds that you don't normally enter.In Dungeon Keeper you played the part of the \"nasty\" overlord, out to stop those goody-goody elves and paladins from stealing your treasure. In the various Command & Conquer games you could choose to be the good guys, or you could choose to be the bad guys. In games of Cops & Robbers, someone is always the Robber. Grand Theft Auto 3 is a Cops & Robbers for adults, and it delivers gameplay that's not easily matched elsewhere.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2002"}

Note that this is a review of only the single player part of the game.Short Review-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gameplay 8/10 - New physics engine adds life to the races, tires play a larger role, weight is much more noticeable and the game is generally more realisticGraphics 8/10 - astonishing detail, interior view, beautiful new tracks set in the mountains, mirroring and reflections are a step up; but maybe not as good as GT5Features 8/10 - a few new difficulty settings (autobrake, manual w/clutch) more car classes, racing season added, auto upgrade feature, loads of new camera angles for replay; ability to buy tuning setups and create art for the vinylRaces and Tracks 7/10 - new, real tracks  add to the simulation and much more variation between tracks, but somewhat redundant racing in the event list, far too many \"repeat races\" and low level racesCars 9/10 - realism trumps any racing game I've played if not any video game I've played, the look, the feel and the tuning of these cars makes this a true simulatorSound 9/10 - engine sounds are very accurate from the four cylinders to the V-12 engines, each has a distinctive note, superchargers and turbos can be heard as well as crashes and tires gripping, very believable--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gameplay 8 of 10Let me begin by saying that the racing in Forza 3 is not so much revolutionary as it is evolutionary; as you might expect with two games on the same console. The physics worked well for Forza 2 and they've added realism here as opposed to reinventing the wheel, no pun intended. You do essentially the same thing as you would have done in Forza 2. The racing hasn't changed. The cars and tracks have.There are a few essential things that have been changed which directly effect gameplay in Forza 3. Not the least of which is the rewind button (or whatever it is being called). It is exactly what you think - you can rewind the race many times throughout the race in five second intervals. It's very handy if you happen to be racing an endurance race and you accidentally forget to make a turn on the last lap. The second major piece of the change in gameplay is the physics system. As you might guess, it's improved. Cars now have the ability to flip over completely (multiple times even), driving is much more dependent on weight, tires can lose grip while the car shifts from side to side or on sharp turns and racing seems to be based much more on the tuning of the suspension.I've heard complaints about cars being able to flip on the game. First, if you don't believe a car will flip at even low speeds go on your favorite video website and search for car accidents. Secondly, the driving elements in determining if a car will flip are: mass (really rotational inertia) and velocity. Put those together and you get momentum. There are many other forces in play for sure, but can be considered negligible. In other words, a heavy thing going fast gives high momentum and energy and the energy HAS to go somewhere. If it happens to run into another relatively heavy thing going fast, the cars could flip. And if flipping is possible, everything else is just not as difficult to believe.The physics system is amazing, but it was already really good for Forza 2. It's been said that with all the assists off, even the slow cars are fun to drive because you really notice the difference between them. This is true to a certain extent, but I'd have to disagree with the idea that the slow cars are fun. I found much of the early races in the Event List to be repetitive and more like driving on a highway.The AI is pretty impressive. I honestly can't say just how good they are because I normally am far ahead of the pack by the end of the first lap. But, they certainly do react to you. If you try to take the inside corner, sometimes they'll cut you off or sometimes they won't if it could cause an accident. If you try to hit them or make them spin out, the AI will fight back and adjust to stay straight. They're pretty good at it. And when you play on hard, they'll manage to complete perfect laps while avoiding you. If you own the game and aren't getting enough of a challenge, turn off just the ABS, use manual shifting and put the opponent difficulty on hard. You won't believe how much skill it takes to manage braking while at high speeds without an anti-lock brake system.Graphics: 8 of 10Visuals are considerably improved in pretty much every aspect. I will admit however, you really do need to own an HDTV to notice a substantial difference. Instead of describing the cars, I'll explain the differences between the two games. In Forza 2 the cars were all dimensionally correct; details down to the brake calipers and slotted rotors were shown; cars had a reflective quality where you could see the sky in the paint. But generally they looked too \"CGI-ish.\" In Forza 3 Turn 10 went to mind-boggling levels of clarity and detail. Now there is a new view inside the car where the interior can be seen in great detail; the headlight show clear 3-D aspects.The headlights, in fact reflect light differently than the metal which is just like a real car. In fact if you're really observant you can see the design on the tire sidewall. Paint looks like real car paint as the sheen changes depending on where you see it from. Chrome just looks amazing, it's hard to even describe how close to reality they came on this. This is the first game I've ever played that I think even I could confuse with reality if just taking a glance at it. The new tracks are gorgeous, especially \"Camino Viejo De Montserratt,\" which is a track set on the side of a mountain overlooking a serene lake. The artists even took the time to put in small outcroppings of grass sticking up from the ground.  One of the most unbelievable parts about the visuals is that the game runs at 60 frames per second which gives an ultra smooth animation to the action.To the dissenters of the graphics, I won't discredit your opinion because it's all subjective. However, if you don't see a noticeable change, I'd recommend playing it on a proper HDTV with an HD connection. I'm doubtful the game will strike you as impressive if you're running it with anything less than component cables. And if that doesn't work, you might need glasses.Features: 7 of 10The number of features has gone up to a certain extent. Something new on the difficulty setting called an autobrake allows even the most casual or driving challenged people to be competitive. Another really interesting part of the difficulty is the manual with clutch shifting arrangement, which is on the advanced racer end of the spectrum. Just like in a real car you need to let off the gas, press in the clutch and then get the revs to match the next gear. Sounds difficult on a game controller doesn't it? It is. Unfortunately it's almost useless without a racing wheel that has a clutch because you can easily ruin your powertrain by not shifting properly. It doesn't get much more realistic than this.The player's storefront is a really nice aspect of the game. Gamers can take photos of their car, videos of races and even create art to sell for credits. Advanced racers can help out others by selling their tuning setups for certain cars. All of the features from Forza 2 are here with quite a few new ones. What impresses me most is that the game caters to essentially all types of racers. If you're more of an arcade racer, turn on autobrake and the full racing line and just gas it. If you're a super serious simulator, turn off all the assists and you really get to feel the essence of the car, the weight, the acceleration.Another of the less looked upon parts is the presentation. It is a lot cleaner looking and is somewhat easier to use. The appearance and even the sounds resemble Gran Turismo 4's interface. Another feature for the more casual racing enthusiast allows a class upgrade or downgrade. Here's how it works: let's say you want to enter a class B race and your car is an class E; you can have the automated Forza 3 tuner to pick out all your parts and bring it up to the class you need so that it is competitive (which of course costs money) or you can have it downgrade your car so you can race in one of the more restrictive races. It is a pretty ingenious idea. Instead of spending 5-10 minutes picking out parts and then maybe another hour tuning your car, you can just race right away. This is another one of those things that I don't use myself, but would be great for many.Races and Tracks 7 of 10Unfortunately this is the Achilles' heel of the game and was with Forza 2. Turn 10 did a wonderful job trying to integrate as many types of cars as possible in so that you not only get a feel for the slower cars first, but so that the vast majority of the cars in the game are used. The setup is very similar to Forza 2, however the hitch is the restrictions put on the races. Many of the lower class races have restrictions such as \"only stock\" or car must be F class or less than 200 hp for example.One of the earlier races is a Yaris race. For those who don't know what a Yaris is; it's a very small Japanese economy car. I don't know about anybody else, but I don't consider this a race car or even a sports car. In fact there are at least 10-15 cars I think shouldn't be in the game. And if you want to totally finish the game, you or your hired driver will have to race at least six races in this car. Another problem is there is just flat out too many low class and \"repeat\" races. There must be 15 events (sets of races) which include F class cars or F class Euro cars. This makes the beginning of the game incredibly boring. And if you're a little OCD like me, you'll want to finish the earlier parts of the game first. I don't care how you spin it. F class cars are boring to drive.New tracks and track setups have really added more intrigue to the game. Now there are about 20 track locations and each location has multiple track maps making for around 100 different tracks. They've also added ,  and 1 mile drag strips and a ton of new speed rings. Most of the old tracks are back with a few new ones - Motegi, Sedona, Rally Di Positano, Amalfi Coast. There is still no Monaco Gran Prix, which is the one I was hoping for. And as I had feared, they removed even more of the imaginary tracks that were really fun to drive. Overall, I think the tracks have improved but with the downside of losing some of the fun-to-drive fake locations.Cars 9 of 10The cars in Forza 3 are by far the most realistic entity I've yet seen in a game; from the graphics to the tiny little details these are a marvel of computer programming and dedication to accuracy. Each car is so close to the actual car in so many ways. Light cars brake more easily. Rear wheel drive cars spin out. But each spins out in a different way. A muscle car loses complete control, whereas a Maza Miata  will spin out usually at a really high speed. No two cars are alike - literally.You might notice when your car rolls up to the start line at the beginning of the race that the front end dips just a tad because of the forward momentum. Every minute detail of a car was enlisted into the game. A lot of these things many will never notice, but the people at Turn 10 took the time to bring a level of authenticity I've not seen before in a game.My only issue with the cars is: I'm pretty sure there was some \"quid pro quo\" going on with the car manufacturers. In other words, after talking with the car manufacturers there was most likely some conversations that went like this \"we'll let you use car X if you agree to also put in car Y.\" Because of this, in the game there are boring economy cars which don't even belong in a racing simulator much less be given the honor of having their own race.Sound 9 of 10Considering this games focuses on ultra-realism, sounds definitely need to be accurate and they really are spot on with this game. Most of the cars sound very similar to their real life counterpart. They managed to get a true V8 sound and not just one version. Anybody who knows anything about V8s is that no two sound alike. A BMW V8 from their E92 M3 will not sound like a 426 Hemi on a Challenger. Six cylinder engines sound very good from what I can surmise. Even the four cylinders have a different tone for each car. This just harkens back to the idea of no two cars being the same, even from the same manufacturer. Tire squeals, crashes, blow off valves, superchargers and even shifting noises are all present in Forza 3. If you listen really carefully, you can hear the click of the gear lever changing gears, which shows an incredible attention to detail. The sounds from the game are realistic, seem accurate and take you one step closer to being on the track.In conclusion, this game is the best racing simulator out right now and is possibly the most realistic game I've ever played. Unfortunately, that means it isn't necessarily the most fun I've had in a game. But if you're a car enthusiast or a racing fan, I doubt you'll be disappointed. Forza doesn't just do cars well; it does just about everything well which is why I'd rate it a 9 out of 10 overall.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2009"}

What amazes me most about the growing catalog of Lego games is how creative and diverse they are are becoming.  The Lego Marvel version has a lot of freeplay options and a great world to explore.  I love the fact that you can swing around NYC with Spiderman or smash cars with Hulk.  There's a consistent balance of fun, story, exploration, and achievement with these games and this one is no different.The story isn't super involved, really.  Mainly you're just trying to save the world like you would with any super hero.  The fact you eventually get to play the good guys and the bad guys and you need all their little skills to complete the game and collect items and you can do it in co-op mode or single player makes the game a bit more exciting.  If I had to complain, it's what most people have been saying: the flight mechanics are, and always seem to be with Lego games for some reason, sub-par.  Getting to 100% completion is not easy with this game because of some of the races being hard to access easily and hard to complete.Lego Marvel is definitely one of those games you don't have to worry about the kids loving.  Even when they're trying to Hulk Smash each other, it's all in good fun and the brand heritage.  There are nods to all kinds of Marvel related products and some Lego related products for the adults to enjoy.  And, my personal favorite part:  the side missions that Deadpool narrates.  They nailed a sarcastic but still kid-friendly version of my all-time fave mutant and made him a (eventually) playable character by connecting him to the red bricks found in various side missions you unlock by collecting gold bricks.  Great game that's fun and mostly safe for the whole fam.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2014"}

This game has the same dumb level up  mechanics as many others.  When you level up so do the enemies.  Thus making it all  a matter of playing with statistics for no good reason.  Why be bad if the enemy will always be badder.It also has the same flaws as many others in that things meld or fuse with other things thus becoming stuck.  Even the \"bunker\" ship gets stuck on some invisible object.  Things floating in the air after death and sometimes alive and stuck in the air.Also like so many others the map system is not perfectly useful.  Mostly when the level changes.The rest of my complaints would sound like I am being a sissy, so I won't bother to mention how hard the game is to win.And just like so many others, the maker refuses to fix anything.  Don't ask me how they expect to get more sales from downloadable content that way.On the other hand I can see why they don't want us to be able to resell our games.

The graphics are great and unique. Of course, the whole cell-shading aspect only carries the game so far. After a few levels, you won't even notice it anymore.The game has a lot of good content presentation going though. The way it shows important scenes in &quot;picture in picture&quot; boxes makes sense to me even beyond the comic-book look and feel. Some of the gameplay however is pretty unique due to the comic-style presentation. For instance, you can see that guards are about to walk around a corner, because you can see little &quot;tap tap tap&quot; indicators on the screen. This adds a nice spin.So why only 3 stars? Because of the damn save game mechanism. I mean: Why even allow to save anywhere, if you can only start over at the beginning ov levels?!? This completely ruins the game for me. And I mean, c'mon! Every game magazine criticises this! At every Game Developer Conference, everyone keeps repeating &quot;the user must be able to save anywhere!&quot;, yet people still keep messing this up! And in this game this is particularily annoying, because the parts that have to be re-played are relatively lengthy, and (worst of all), one has to watch the same cut-scenes again and again, and there is no way to skip them.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2003"}

Jury \"dsunglasses\"","summary":"Not everyone's cut out to be a ghostbuster","reviewText":"Most movies based on video games suck. Likewise, most video games based on movies suck. This one is an exception. It has a lot to do with the fact that Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd co-wrote the script for the game. The graphics are good and original characters are all well rendered with good voice acting. Better still, the original actors return to voice all four ghostbusters, even the token black one Winston. The original actress returns to voice the secretary, although she looks younger and hotter in the game. They even got the original actor to voice, Peck, their annoying antagonist. Bill Murray's brother voices the mayor and he looks like himself. You play a generic fifth rookie ghostbuster, who doesn't get a name or a voice. You are referred to as rookie and cadet most of the game.The game play, sound effects and graphics are pretty good. You get a small variety of weapons, and have the ability to upgrade them somewhat. You acquire money throughout the game for capturing or destroying ghosts, and can use that money for your upgrades. You should be able to purchase all your upgrades well before the game is over, after which money is useless.The game features the original theme music though not the whole cord, and not the song (no lyrics).This game can be enjoyed by kids and adults, and features a fair amount of humor. You will chuckle more then actually laugh. Difficulty on the normal setting is actually pretty challenging. However, the difficulty of certain parts is really sporadic, as most of the boss fights I found easy, where as some supposedly simple parts proved very difficult and took repeated tries. The hardest part of the game is near the end by a gate, and is ridiculously difficult.Fortunately the game saves your progress automatically at check points and there are many. Unfortunately you can't have saved games to just replay your favorite parts, and the although the checkpoints are usually well placed, some of them require you to go back through boring stuff you already did.The game is very linear and there are no choices to be made. At several points in the game you have the ability to wander around the station before going on your next mission. It's interesting the first time, but there is nothing to do there, and it's absolutely pointless. I get the feeling they wanted to add something else to do there, and ran out of time or money.Some jokes, ghosts and places are rehashed from the movies. All things considered this was pretty good for a games based on a movie, and most fans of the movies will probably enjoy this","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2009"}

Between Halo, Gears of War, Skyrim, Saints Row, Grand Theft Auto, and others it appears as though it's almost impossible to find a decent non-\"M\" rated game to play.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, I just like old-fashioned fun, clean games that do not hold a film-inspired game title as such things can become tedious and problematic if you're a concerned parent.When I had the opportunity to review Rayman Legends, I kinda scoffed at the idea until a friend of mine, who played the demo, urged me to try it.  I was not disappointed in the least bit and give my first 5-star review on a game in a very long time.  I'm not terribly familiar with the franchise as I'd heard about it a few times during the golden ear of gaming that was the Playstation 1 and 2 and dismissed them as just another platform game.  I cannot really comment on previous installments and their evolution up until this point, but I can say that I'm very impressed with the game's overall quality and presentation.Legends is a complex side-scrolling platform game with a simplistic controller interface.  You get from A-B but try to rescue captures friends along the way and collect little lantern things for points.  Now, unlike other platform games I've played recently (just forced myself through Smurfs 2... it was awful) those points do matter as they unlock characters and levels that affect the actual game itself and are not just some asinine number like Drew Carey's points system on Whose Line is it Anyway?  You traverse across a very hostile terrain that is beautifully rendered, if not hand drawn like Dust: An Elysian Tail, and complete quick-thinking maneuvering across an ever-increasing difficult game.  One thing I do know about the Rayman franchise is that they are, typically, known for being particularly challenging as the obstacles get more abstract and require faster reaction times.  I can recall one 4-skull level (1-5 skulls scale of increasing difficulty) and had to repeat a section over a dozen times before getting it right.  Thank GOD for checkpoints being as frequent as they are!The game does get difficult, and sometimes frustrating, but there is plenty to do if you get stuck or fed up with a certain part of it.  You can select, literally, over a dozen levels at many given times including daily online challenges and classic levels once you unlock them.  The nice thing is that you're not following a linear path of progression and you can access several episodes at any given time once you've completed the tutorial missions.  This gives the player a lot more freedom to work with as nothing is more frustrating than patronizing linear progression.  There were a few times where I rage-quit a level, but kept the game on and played another level instead.  THIS is the way platform gaming should be.The music and graphics are a definite plus as they are beautifully done but not distracting.  They mix in well to complete the recipe and not be the recipe as many games focus on graphics and forget everything else.As for the story.... meh, I saw the intro sequence and that was all I got but this game doesn't need a complex story or intricate character development as all you need is a fun experience.  This is very rarely the case in gaming, but Ubisoft pulled it off this round.All in all, I had few complaints about Legends other than it's weird soccer component... could never get that part right, but there's plenty more to do!A very worthy game for parents, hardcore gamers, and the general audience alike!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2013"}

NOW.","reviewText":"In my review of Rayman Origins, I stated that it was one of the best platformers I've ever played, right alongside one of my other favorite games of all time: Super Mario World. Well, for my birthday today, this was the game I received as a present. It was all I needed! And I was still able to say that after playing it. THIS is THE best platformer I've ever gotten my hands on, PERIOD - Super Mario World has finally been kicked off the throne for my personal favorite game of all time. No game has ever made me smile throughout the long period of time I played a game for, until this masterpiece came along!The gameplay is almost identical to that of Rayman Origins - You jump, you punch/kick, you collect Lums, you do whatever it takes to go and rescue the trapped Teensies. However, as simple as it sounds, it is amazingly executed. Rayman and friends already feel very fluid and fun to play with, but the game constantly introduces new things and keeps everything fresh, even considering the fact that you start out with moves that you would have to unlock back in Origins! The level design is equally brilliant and contains all sorts of fun platforming elements and interactivity with the environments such as swinging on vines, using wind gusts to fly, using Murfy to assist you in some areas, and the list goes ON.Speaking of level design, the game throws in a cute bonus package of levels lifted straight from its predecessor! The levels have been untouched (with the exception of the Teensies' placements), but they are still great to hop and bop around.There are also levels in which you need to keep your pace as you zip through them without slowing down! It shouldn't be a major turn-off for those that ache from such things since they only contain 3 Teensies each as opposed to 10 in normal levels (Teensies are more-or-less required to unlock various things including other levels and worlds anyway). And keep in mind there's 700 of them in total!Now how are the graphics here......JUST LOOK AT IT! You don't even NEED to see video footage here to be amazed at how lovingly crafted the game looks and IS! This time, it just takes a single GAZE at a SCREENSHOT to realize how amazingly crafted the game is! I said in my Rayman Origins review that that was the finest 2D graphics could go. The lovelies at Ubisoft Montpelier begged to differ, according to this unbelievably colorful and lively atmosphere the entire game is provided with!The soundtrack is, of course, also phenomenal. Each soundtrack as a whole is extremely diverse and contains songs of pretty much every instrumental genre out there, from rock to orchestrated to even Rayman-y remixes of licensed music!If there's one thing I feel like I need to note, though, is that when I played the Wii U version of Rayman Legends, there was just one issue I had with it: Murfy. Don't put up your torches please! Lemme explain!I completely understand that Legends was gonna be Wii U-exclusive until Ubisoft made a bonehead move to delay it to the same month as Grand Theft Auto V, resulting in how it wouldn't sell well like its predecessor hadn't. However, when playing the Wii U version, I felt that the touch screen control for Murfy, while nice, interrupted the game's flow, something I felt was very jarring considering the quality in literally everything else. Here in the Xbox 360 version, you just press/hold the B button for Murfy's actions, which is something you can do almost instantly, enabling you to keep the pace. Therefore, I believe this edition of the game is slightly superior.Overall...Just, what else can I say? This game is as close to flawless as it can get, and I didn't even mentioned the other goodies the game has in stock (Including unlockable costumes for characters, various challenges you can participate in, and even a minigame titled Kung Foot)! I have no clue how much higher I can praise this masterpiece, and I already said that it beat out Super Mario World as my all-time favorite game!No matter what console you own, you NEED to buy this game!

Weir","summary":"Redemption indeed: From the overrated GTA4 to this Masterpiece","reviewText":"Rockstar's finest open world game to date, Red Dead Redemption takes place at the turn of the 20th century (1911) to be exact.  If you're expecting to blast Native Americans from the tops of their unsaddled horses maybe you should look elsewhere. These are the last days of the unlawful old west. Electricity lines stretch into the horizon, high above railroad tracks. The fictional world is on the brink of industrialization.For starters, more so than any other open world game I've ever played, you don't play this game, you experience it. You live in the world. You are John Marston.The story of RDR isn't top notch but it's interesting enough to keep you going along, and includes touches of timeline contextual social commentary regarding politics, religion, suffrage, social status, the effects of technology on man and more. And it's worth playing to the end as the story culminates in one of the most unexpected and original ways to end a game I think I've ever seen. You just have to experience it for yourself to truly understand what I mean.The graphics and sound are very well done. Voice acting is ranges from average to well done which is on par for a RockStar game. Ambient sound effects are really effective in setting the tone and immersing the player into the game, be you nervously dismounting your horse to skin an elk because you hear the growl of a grizzly bear nearby, or hearing the footsteps of your boots on the wooden floor of a rowdy saloon, an upbeat piano song playing in the background. Steam powered trains chug their way through the land, cougars scream as they maul you and the eerie cry of foxes at night will leave you feeling unsettled as you travel through dark moonlit forests where wolves and vastly more dangerous mammals could be lurking. Pistols and rifles sound loud and hefty (there's a good-sized roster of firearms in the game if you're wondering), and causing an explosion inside a cave results in a loud muffled explosion that will have you reaching for the volume controls.Graphics wise, player models and textures are just merely passable, but the environment you live in for 20-30 hours is where the beauty of this game lies (I spent just over 40 hours but did 100% of the single player content). The world is really the star of this game. Riding through Armadillo at night, with rain pouring down and spalshing in muddy puddles, the occasional bolt of lightning brightening the cloudy sky in the horizon was a surreal experience. There were times I'd just be riding around and I would marvel at the beautiful landscape before me: The orange and yellow sunset peeking through the evergreens of Tall Trees, contrasting the bright white snow underfoot, for example. Sunsets and sunrises were particularly stunning, as were the moonlit desert environments, the bright stars twinkling in the sky high above, not yet obscured by the pollution of modern industrialization. Truly an immersive world. If you're sporting a nice, big high definition display you will be rewarded with some jaw-dropping views that will make you wish you could capture screenshots and save them for later.Yes, there are a ton of mini games and side quests to keep you busy, but they are completely optional. As you ride around you'll be approached by strangers begging you assist them with things ranging from helping them get back their horse that was just stolen, to assisting a friend who is about to be unlawfully hung by a group of thugs. It's up to you. Ignoring them won't effect your reputation in a negative way, but helping them will give you a little extra spending cash and sometimes a bump to your reputation. You'll be challenged by gunslinging duelists who wish to make a name for themselves. Accept their challenge, or ride away. Again, optional. The stuff is there for your entertainment, and to flesh out the world, but it's up to you what you do with it. Then there are mini-games like playing games of horseshoe, blackjack, poker, five-finger fillet, etc. Unless you're going for 100% completion, all these things are optional. That's the beauty of such a well crafted open world game: The option to choose.And as with all open world games Red Dead Redemption has it's fair share of bugs and glitches. Nothing game breaking ever happened to me (game breaking meaning a quest bugged and wouldn't let me finish it, or any freezes or crashes - nothing like that ever occurred during my playthrough) but I encountered a few bugs that were at least amusing to behold. No video game is perfect and RDR is not an exception to that rule. Expect chugging framerates in heavily populated areas (Blackwood city being the worst offender), at last on the PS3. If you're a fan of Westerns and you have, like me, become jaded with the GTA series after, what in my mind, was a disappointing GTA IV, you owe it to yourself to check this game out. This title has restored my faith in RockStar open world games. Multiplayer is decent so far..I've only invested a couple hours but I'll probably move on to another game rather than try to reach the level cap of 50. Looking forward to more single player DLC, which was announced recently.Gems like this are few and far between. Red Dead Redemption is my Game of the Year for 2010....so far. Give it a shot, bucko!JULY 30 Edit - PS3 VS 360 version: I just learned that, graphically and frame rate wise, the 360 version is superior to the PS3 version. While the 360 version is rendered in true 720p, the PS3 version only runs at 1152x640 - a whopping 20% decrease in resolution. So if you have both consoles I would recommend getting the 360 version. It's a beautiful game regardless, but the 360 version has a more stable frame rate and higher resolution. But don't take my word for it. Google \"digitalfoundry red dead redemption face off\" and read about it yourself. I played the PS3 version and I loved this game so much I'm going to pick up a used copy for the 360 and play it again!AUGUST 24 Edit - I have now completed the game on both PS3 and 360. Having played both I can indeed confirm that the 360 version looks superior to the PS3 version. The higher resolution on the 360 is immediately apparent, as are the higher number of plants/bushes/shrubs rendered at any one time. Both versions are beautiful, and both have frame rate issues in populated areas and the occasional sudden texture pop-in. In both playthroughs I only encountered one minor game-breaking bug: In Blackwater I shot a seagull which landed on a dock there. When I went to collect its feather the character glitched through the floor geometry and fell in the water below, killing him (he can't swim).I would like to add that a lot of people are calling this Grand Theft Auto in the old west. There are a lot of similarities between the two games but I've enjoyed RDR moreso than any other 3D GTA game, of which I own them all.  In my opinion it's easy, but unfair, to simplify Read Dead Redemption as 'Grand Theft Auto Old West'. It's so much more than that. If you look beyond the similar mini-map and user interface, there's a game with so much more soul than any GTA game I've ever played.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2010"}

They built an awesome world for you to explore, but little to no incentive to actually do so. Money is a joke since you don't actually need anything they sell.  The sidequests are worthless unless you get off on alternate outfits. There is almost no reason to get new guns since you can kill everything with the weapons you start with (or are automatically given to you). I thought I could get past all that and enjoy the story, but they manage to utterly destroy the pacing in the last 20% of the game. The main character is really good, but the side characters are paper thin, at best.I go into more detail below:1.  Money! - ok so this is the main motivation for doing almost everything in the game.  The problem is they fail to provide you with anything interesting to buy. This removes \"in-game\" motivations and put the burdon of benift on the story. Here are some examples- You can buy guns.  ok.. except the guns you get automatically in the story are strong enough to do any mission with ease.- You can buy horses. The horses you find are just fine.  I almost never needed extreeme speed anyway. There is like one racing mission and it's really easy.- You can buy ammo.  This might have meant somthing except I almost always had maxed out ammo by taking it off dead bodies.- You can buy stagecoach rides to fast travel.  Wow awesome. I don't ned to ride my horse for 20 min to get to my next lame mission...oh wait I can fast travel for free at any time. oh well... another pointless thing to add to the game.- You can buy safe houses. totally and utterly pointless. You can save almost anytime by clicking camp mode from the menu. The only time you can't camp is in towns and it will take you just as long to run out of town as it will for you to go to your house.- You can buy maps - heck yes, finally somthing that will lead me to somthing interesting...oh wait...no.2. Pacing - holy granola bars! this was a disaster.  Like many modern games you start by doing lame tutorial missions. I have come to accept this as have most gamers. Over the course of the game the missions get slowly more interesting (kind of). When you get to the last 10 missions it kicks you back into the ultra borring missions, except makes them a lot longer. For example hearding cattle a very long distance.  This is extreemly easy and utterly mind numbing. What were they thinking when they pulled this stunt. If anything the last few hours of the game just feel tacked on and utterly boring.3. The story is terrible. I might add the premise is good, but the execution of said premise is poor.  This has a lot to do with the pacing of the last 10 missions or so and how they play into the plot.  The main character is excelent and feels very real. The rest of the cast feel cartoonish and cliche. I can think of several easy ways they could have saved the story. I don't want to spoil anything so let's leave it at that. I was counting on the story to be the saving grace, alas no such luck.2. Great world, but little motivation to explore. I won't lie, the world they created is amazing. Unfortunately the effect wares off and you are left with a patchwork quilt of a failed game. In many games players often go off the rails to explore.  this can be rewarding in many ways, but it's most rewarding when it leads to some in-game benifit. For example: a rare weapon, a secret boss, rare character upgrades...etc. Red dead does not have these things, so beyond doing the pointless side missions to aquire pointless money, to buy nothing is not enough.3. But what about side quests?:  yes there are side quests, but they are pointless for almost every reason you can think of:- Boring- Easy- Lack of in game benift4. But you earn money right? Yes, but money is useless...see point one.5. But your honor and fame will increase.  Play the main quest and they max out anyway. Plus those things are basically pointless.I am not sure how anyone can look at this game and not realize the terrible design choices that ultimately destroyed what should have been an amazing experience.The only people I can recommend this game to are ones who want a real casual game with a cool western backdrop. I guess also people who like boring stuff like herding cattle. So much potential missed in this one. I have like 30 ps3 games and this is easily in the bottom 2.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2011"}

As Always, I don't care about multi-player)NOTE TO VIDEOGAME DEVELOPERS: If you want to lessen piracy, and make more money, then make more games like this one.I just finished playing this game on the XBOX 360 system, and I have to say.... WOW! Now if only it would be released on PC for better graphics to make the immersion even better.This is a long game, and worth every penny! I do NOT feel ripped off in any way like a lot of single-player games have done recently with short 4 or 5 hour campaigns put in just to sell to people that don't like the multi-player aspect, and scam them out of their hard earned money (or in the case of a large amount of console players, mom and dads money)... There were at least 5 parts in this game that I thought it was the end of the game, only to be surprised that it kept on going. This game is a great escape from reality and I love that!The scenery is beautiful, and on a nice big HD TV, it is quite engrossing. There were many times I would stop playing just to look at a sunset, or a thunder storm off in the distance. It really felt like a proper western game. Taking place in 1911, I could \"feel\" the changes coming about in that particular time. It gave this great feeling of the end of an era; Rockstar clearly did their research with this game.This game did NOT get boring for me, as there are tons of things to do besides just missions. I am a huge fan of non-linear games and this one delivers in nearly every way. From bounty missions, to hunting, to playing all manner of gambling and old west games, to stranger quests and challenges, to riding around and exploring for treasure or new places, just to name a few. If there is something you saw in a western movie, there is a good chance you can do it in this game... From robbing a train to a stage coach or protecting them... Getting into quick draw shootouts. Jumping from a balcony right onto your horse saddle and riding off... Jumping from your horse to a moving train... Climbing up a mountain pass overlooking a camp full of bad guys and then taking pot shots from above... And many more things. The game gives you a choice between being a good guy or bad guy and a few RPG like choices in the game that will affect other parts later on. so the REPLAY value is downright awesome.This is NOT a game that I will play just once and forget about it. This is definitely a keeper! It even has some awesome single player cheat codes that can make it quite silly and fun and even less annoying in some situations. Nothing like a good old invincibility, and infinite ammo code to make for some interesting times in any game. ^_^ Though using cheat codes disables achievements for that particular save, but achievements on XBOX 360 aren't good for anything anyway so it's no big loss. The most recent patch now allows you to save and progress the story even with cheats enabled, so that is why I waited so long to buy it, even though I played through the first time without cheats.The voice acting and writing in this game are top notch. You actually feel a bond with the characters in Red Dead and want to see their stories unfold. It is a truly immersive game, and that is not something a lot of recent games can lay claim to.The controls took a little getting used to. This is where one of my only gripes comes up... Aiming is a pain and the vehicle/horse controls needed some work. There were plenty of times where I would try to aim at one target and end up locking onto a totally different one, sometimes accidentally shooting some random guy off in the distance instead of the skunk or coyote I was trying to hunt... Next thing I know is the coyote got away and now I have a bounty on my head and a posse trying to kill me for the guy I accidentally shot. Or many times I would want to free-aim at some object and instead lock onto a random person instead and end up getting a bounty or shot for pointing a gun at someone. To get a horse going you have to constantly hit the A button, but to stop you have to hold the RB shoulder button, and aiming while trying to follow a road while on a horse is nearly impossible, even though during the tutorial it said while aiming that the horse would follow the road, I found that to be a bit far from the truth. But that is all I can really complain about in this game. Oh! There needed to be BAR FIGHTS! That was the one western movie staple I haven't seen yet.I had to post a review for Red Dead Redemption because, recently, very few games released truly make my jaw drop and get me to play the game in awe. It is a long game with hundreds, if not thousands, of things to do and a 100% replay value, at least for me. The atmosphere, graphics, physics, and effects are wonderfully done even if it is on an outdated console system (by PC standards). The characters are VERY memorable and well done. The writing and voice acting were spot on! This did not feel like a rushed game. I would have to say that Red Dead Redemption will go on as one of the greats in the videogame world.Because of this game, I am now on a Western Movie kick. Ah Nostalgia.---BOTTOM LINE---Just buy the game already! I'm kicking myself for not getting it sooner!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2011"}

For the first time ever, Capcom has released a collection of the classic Mega Man titles. Although the entire X series are not included in this collection, Mega Man Anniversary Collection, is every Mega Man fan's dream come true.In this collection, you get the following:Mega Man (NES)Mega Man 2 (NES)Mega Man 3 (NES)Mega Man 4 (NES)Mega Man 5 (NES)Mega Man 6 (NES)Mega Man 7 (SNES)Mega Man 8 (PSX)Mega Man: The Power Battle (Arcade)Mega Man: The Power Fighters (Arcade)Sadly, the two arcade games are unlockable. But I'm not gonna take one star down because of that.GRAPHICS:If you've seen the graphics on all the Mega Man games, then that's exactly how they'll look like. No changes, no overhauls...just pure original vintage graphics. The only difference is that theres no slowdown or any errors like on the original NES carts. Capcom did a great job fixing all those slowdowns and errors.AUDIO:Once again...the same thing ! However I dislike the voice acting in Mega Man 8. That's the only thing that annoys me.CONTROLS:All the Mega Man games play exactly the same way as they should be. The only real change is that \"B\" is jump and \"A\" is fire. Plus the \"Y\" button enables you to do rapid fire. Now I've read a few reviews saying that the controls bite, and in result, they gave it one star. I have to disagree with them. The controls are actually pretty good, once you get the hang of it. And the slight changes are nothing to get mad about. At first, I didn't like the controls. But after a few minutes, I got used to it. These controls are actually pretty good.GAMEPLAY/VARIETY:You get to do more than just play all the Mega Man games. You can also unlock a gripload of extras, such as remixed music inspired by the series, the two Mega Man arcade games, picture galleries, and lots lots more. Although it's kinda frustrating to try to unlock the arcade games (I'm guessing you have to beat all eight of the games to get them), it's always good to play through all the games...well in my opinion at least.FINAL OPINION:I don't care what other people say about this collection. This is far by one of the best compilations I have ever owned ! Finally I get to play all Mega Man games without going through the trouble of buying a good conditioned NES and all the games, which is probably a LOT of money. You get all these games for $29.99...sweet deal ! This is a good way to celebrate Mega Man's 15th anniversary. Old school all the way !If you're a longtime fan of the Mega Man series, or never tried some of the Mega Man games that you've been wanting to try, this compilation won't disappoint.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2004"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXX88","description":"","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"Immersive and Gripping Adventure","reviewText":"I've been slowly working down my backlog of games and recently played and beat Far Cry 3 for the PS3. For someone who is new to the Far Cry series, outside of playing FC2 on the PS3 and deciding it wasn't for me, FC3 represents an incredible accomplishment on Ubisoft's part. FC3 is equal parts story, adventure, and discovery and most definitely worth a gamers time.--------------------Plot:The main protagonist in FC3 is a young man named Jason Brody that is vacationing with his brother, girlfriend and some friends in Thailand when the group decide to go on a skydiving trip and land on a pirate controlled island somewhere in the Andaman Sea or Gulf of Thailand or thereabouts. The group is captured by pirates led by a particularly nasty egomaniac named Vaas who fills the role of FC3's main antagonist. Jason and his older brother Grant manage to escape captivity and set about freeing their other friends when Grant is killed and Jason barely escapes with his life. It's up to Jason to see his friends are freed after that and where the adventure really begins.--------------------Graphics:I'm a gamer and own and regularly play consoles dating back to the 1980's so nice, beautiful graphics are definitely appreciated but not make or break for me. That said FC3 really shines on the PS3. Yes, this game on a PC (I later purchased FC3 for my gaming PC) is hands down better looking. The PS3 version however, is no slouch in the visuals department. The island around you is teeming with life - animals, vegetation, humans - some friendly and some not. The environments are tropical; think jungle giving way to flowing rivers and teal blue oceanic waters. The main area in FC3 is really broken out over two distinct islands that are very similar in appearance. Spread across the island are small towns, enemy strongholds, ruins from another time and even some derelict military equipment from World War II. Exploring the islands and stumbling across an overgrown Japanese Zero aircraft or a beautiful waterfall is one of the highlights of this game. The game additionally features a full day-night cycle and weather that ranges from intense rain storms to clear, sunny days.--------------------Gameplay:FC3 is a first-person-shooter so you'll see all of the aforementioned visuals from the eyes of Jason Brody. The interesting thing that Ubisoft has done is implement a number of tweaks and tight controls to really elevate your character into a very aggressive and agile character. A lot of FPS games feature very sluggish character movement but that is not at all the case here. You can run, jump, slide, hide, parachute, glide and more all with ease and agility with a character mapping that is very natural feeling. A lot of work went into the controls for FC3 and it truly shows. In your adventure you'll be armed to the teeth with weapons you can buy or take off dead pirates along the way. Weapons vary from simple handguns to sub-machineguns, to assault rifles, a bow and arrow, RPG and more.On the topic of weapons, each weapon can be customized to include things like sound-suppressors, extended magazines, paint schemes, sights/scopes and the like. Similarly all of Jason's main attributes can be upgraded from his health bar, running and swimming capabilities. Additionally by hunting animals Jason can upgrade the amount of items he can carry including ammunition for his weapons, grenades, quivers and inventory items. There are several role-playing-game elements that are implemented very well in FC3.The environment in FC3 is absolutely massive and along the way Jason has a variety of vehicles at his disposal. From very quick and nimble Jeep's to fast moving jet-ski's and larger more lumbering vehicles and boats. FC3 thankfully has a fast travel system that uses captured enemy strongholds as your hubs. By the end of the game you can quickly move from area to area with ease.--------------------Sound:This is another area that really shines in FC3. Playing with a surround sound or upgraded sound system will really make the game shine. The slight rustling of plants as a tiger stalks you from a blind-spot is unforgettable. Gunshots, knife attacks are all crisp and clear and very satisfying.--------------------Multiplayer:This is the area that I spent very little time playing. For the most part I enjoy multiplayer gaming but as a second to a single player experience. The multiplayer aspect of FC3 features a simple story and a series of missions that you can attempt with friends and strangers alike. The multiplayer has its own weapon upgrade system separate from the single player story. While I found the mode somewhat interesting I spent only a few short hours here. The bottomline is that I think the Far Cry series is first and foremost a single player adventure. So take that for what it's worth.--------------------Weak spots:So far my review has been overwhelmingly positive but there are some weak moments worth mentioning:(-) The story in spots can get very ridiculous. Particularly when Jason meets up with the island natives and goes on several hallucinogenic vision quests. I'll leave it at that but I felt that these moments were very over the top.(-) While the game is great fun it can get repetitive. There are something like 40 enemy strongholds, a large number of radio towers (disabling these opens up the map) and tons of enemies that you'll encounter. Eventually some of this gets a little long in the tooth but the great news is that enemies don't constantly respawn once an area has been liberated. And you can find other activities to vary up the gameplay.(-) The &#34;boss battles&#34; if they can be called that are mostly QTE (quick-time-events) and require pushing a series of button combinations. They're very easy and very boring. Such a disappointment for an otherwise incredible game. For reference on a &#34;good&#34; boss battle in a game that Ubisoft could've used as inspiration see Metal Gear Solid 3's fight with the character known as 'The End'.--------------------Conclusion:This is a really excellent game that will easily gobble up 30+ hours of your time or more depending on your willingness to hunt down collectibles and multiplayer gaming. At the discounted price currently offered on Amazon this is a no-brainer, must buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"PS2 Bruce","summary":"Absolutely Amazing","reviewText":"After seeing many positive reviews about this game, I decided to pick it up yesterday, this will probably be my last game purchase until GTA IV comes out next year; I have been picking up the recent big titles to have some things to keep me busy till then. Besides now I have all the big games, and don't have to deal with Black Friday and the stupid xmas shopping season.Anyway this game is absolutely one of the most amazing things I have ever seen, after more than 15 years of gaming-from the PC (Doom, Sim City,Quake), PS2 (GTA, Gran Turismo) XBOX (Forza Motorsport, Fable, KOTR,) and, finally 360 (Saints Row, Rainbow Six series, GRAW, Oblivion, etc), I have never before seen any game like this.****Possible Spoilers**** (But I don't want to give away too much)When the game begins you can either start with the \"default\" Commander Shepard (male or female) or create your own character, either by making a couple of clicks on a template, or going deep into setting the size of the forehead, jaw, skin tone, eye color, hair style, color, etc, a la Oblivion-there are six classes from pure soldiers to techs, \"adepts\" who have telekentic type abilities, and several combinations that give you for example the skills of a soldier and hacking/decrypting abilities of a tech; you can also be a pure tech, adept, and so forth. You can set your characters attributes-I set up my Commander Shepard as a Female/Soldier/Earthborn/Ruthless.Once your character is finalized the story starts-your character is seen looking regretful as some voice overs that sound like Keith David (Julius from \"Saints Row\" and William Shatner talking about some galactic threat, the best person for the job is Shepard, etc-then you're aboard some sort of galaxy class starship heading somewhere on a (up to this point) secret mission. This is the first time you use the 'dialog tree' and it's amazing-if you've played KOTR or Oblivion, you've seen the parts where a character says something, then, your character is given choices on what to say, but the amazing  thing is, this game fleshes the replies out, for example, one reply choice at the end of a tree would be \"goodbye,\" but your character doesnt just say \"goodbye\" like in Oblivion, she'll say \"I have to get moving,\" or \"Ill look into it,\" something that's in context with the conversation. The first few times you see this, it's amazing, and it always makes sense.The controls take some getting used to-there is a brief manual but to learn the controls and the interface basically you have to use it. You will get the hang of using the main computer, map, swithching weapons, ordering your squad, etc, after awhile. The combat is pretty good-one interesting thing about the game was rather then squirming throught the cutscenes and itching to get to the next combat level it was the opposite, I was trying to get the combat over and get back to the \"movie.\" (LOL). And really that's in large part what this game is, an interactive sci fi movie, and a very well made one.A few things are frustrating once you're on a planet-as I said the controls take some getting used to, the AI is not the sharpest some times (but still better in most \"shooter\" games), the targeting system is not the best (but does work once you master it) and my least favorite weapon is the sniper rifle. (It's much too unsteady) So far I've used cover, got up close enough to problem enemies, then either grenade them or killed them with the assault rife which IS a pretty good weapon. There are some glitches here and there both with the AI, (sometimes youre squad will not follow your commands, or enemies will break cover and walk straight for you, making them easy to kill), or you or one of your squad will get \"stuck\" and can't walk from the spot they're on (be careful not to get to close to cliff edges; I got stuck three times there). But the few glitches are minor, and rare.One thing I LOVE about this game is you can SAVE WHEN YOU WANT (except when enemies are active). You have autosaves, too but it's GREAT to be able to start exploring a level, then SAVE, then in case you get killed, you don't have to \"resume\" (i.e. go back to the start of the level), but you can bring up the menu and \"load\" your last save. I wish more \"next gen\" games had this.I don't want to say too much because, really you have to experience this game for yourself. I almost never give anything 5 stars (recently only COD4 has received 5 stars from me), but if I could I would give this game 10 stars. This is one of literally 4 or 5 games that I would tell you, if you have a 360 you must buy this. It is absolutely astounding unlike any game you have ever seen before.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2007"}

The other characters respond to general orders, however, and have descent enough AI to help you out from time to time.As for the RPG aspects of the game, you're given choices of how to respond to dialogs during conversations and depending upon your answer it can push your towards the dark side or the light side... err I mean a renegade or a paragon (very similar to Knights of the Old Republic; same dialog system). Leveling is also very similar where you only need concern yourself with leveling up one character because the others get the experience regardless. This is nice because you don't want to waste time leveling up certain characters but at the same time it trivializes the whole idea of an experience system.There are some huge flaws which I think this game has (some who play may agree or not here but personally these killed a lot of my enjoyment). The biggest being that while there are tons of side quests and planets to explore... There are barely any enemies on any of the planets. You'll find yourself spending hours in the stupid land rover trying to climb up mountains to get to your destination but never having to fight one living creature most of the time. It's just a huge waste to have a full planet to explore and yet never bumping into any form of life.The next annoyance is the fact that whenever you want to take an elevator (and the game is loaded with these) you have to spend at least 30 seconds on it each time. Forcing the user to sit and wait to go anywhere. Perhaps this is realistic but it's a trivial and useless thing that just wastes the users time and the developers should have given an easy way to skip these.That said, you spend a lot of the side quest time driving around or waiting in elevators so it becomes a bit of a hassle and unless you're a completionist you probably will get bored of the lot of them quickly and give up on the side quests altogether.The main quest, however, is luckily filled with fighting and even the land rover scenes do have a good supply of enemies to fight. The only drawback to the main quest itself is how short it really is. Each main quest area is decent enough but if you remove all the side quests (and the time spent in the elevators) you could finish the game in under a day.That said, it's worth buying if you're into the Action RPG genre and likely will have some fun with the game. You can always ignore the side quests or complete them over time as needed.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2008"}

The game is just what the gamecube gamers were waiting for.  The game is in no way Dissapointing.  It's much more challenging the the original prime'.  The challenge isn't hard or insainly hard but it will take a few times to get use too.  Something that was really great is the new \"Dark world, Light World\" story which made me fall in love with this masterpiece.  The game will get REALLY CONFUSING once you start going into alot of light world, dark world, areas and solving the puzzles arn't easy, did I mention some of the boss battles we put you in some frustraiting.  Like the oh so famous \"boss with no save station near it\" part..which has been complained by alot of gamers, yes it's not fair but you'll get use to it......Retro has also added something to the challenge...CONSERVING YOUR AMMO..Yes now Samus can run of ammo for both \"Light world, Dark world\" weapons but the combos you earn and new moves you get are oh so wonderul...Great job retro.  The enemies are much more rough then PrimeS enemies like the DARK WORLD SPACE PIRATE, yes they are even harder then the original pirates...Other then Conserving ammo, new gameplay elements and visors, this is one of the best looking gamecube games available, it's just so fluid and pretty to look at..Metroid Prime 2 is also a fairly long game, for a game like that I give credit for Retro.  The game takes about 25 to 30 hours of gameplay IF you want to get 100% on it(my time was about 20 hours and 23 minutes).  Sadly there was one thing that I was slightly dissapointed with..the boss battles.  Metroid Prime had some amazing and very memerable boss battles and they were all place at great moments.  Sadly Prime 2's bosses just felt uneven, seriously they did.  The only true boss battle that was great was the giant Dark world boss that you fight at the end of the game, I won't spoil it for you...lets get to it..The good-Great Visuals-Controls are great-Lots of places to explore-another great addition to the metroid Series-just as good as the original-Story is superb, loved it-The music in the game is amazing, very memerable-Long game, should take about 25 hour or longer depending on how good you are-The new weapons and visors are awesome!!-Breathtaking cutscenesThe bad-Multiplayer?...ok, I could care less for that..-Some people will be turned off by the game seeing how its like Completley different compared to prime 1, mainly because alot of people didn't like the story for prime 2..-Some people will not like the fact that most areas are small and seem claustaphobicOverall Metroid Prime 2 on the Nintendo GCN is a fantastic follow up and stays true to the original, I can't say not more then the fact that is just plain..BETTER then Prime 1, I give it a fantabulous5 out of 5 stars..Lates","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2005"}
{"product_name":"B003O6EBRA","reviewerName":"Patrick","summary":"Yet another mediocre game from Square Enix","reviewText":"The only good thing I can say aboout this game is the graphics and charcters look great.  Otherwise its a mediocre game with a poorly told story, rehased enemies and a terrible battle system. They streamlined the way you level up so you can only see the next skill available and it doesn't show what benefits you get from levels.  You have to keep revisting areas over and over to complete it.  The bosses all look the same and the story is terrible so you have no interest in whats going on.  In order to progress you have to level and farm to find monsters to fill your party which means fighting boring battles in a small area for an hour or 2 in each area.  Dont level and the boss will literally kick your butt.  After 10 hours I was so bored and tired of leveling that I tabled the game indefinitely. If the battle system wasn't so restrictive and let you pause instead of being active at all times it had potential.  Instead you have to create set party trees each with a handull of skills.  This hampers you into being only a healer etc and limits your fun.  I prefer to be able to attack and heal when needed not have to open a menu to change my set all the while the enemie is still tearing my team to shreds. This and the lack of interesting characters beyond the eye candy concept makes for a bad game. The games not worth $60 wait till it hits the bargain bin.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2012"}

Developed by one of my favorite game devlepers, Michel Ancel (Rayman, Beyond Good and Evil), it was a bunch of minigames centered around some diabolical yet adorable rabbit-looking creatures.  Unfortunately, the lack of multiplayer games and the quality of them made it a game that collected dust more than anything.  Now that we have the Kinect, this type of game seems perfect.  Alive & Kicking has 34 Quick Play games, 3 party games and some additional features.  The games are meant to be played mostly with 1-4 players, though the party games can have up to 16.The games run the gamut of smacking rabbids, avoiding projectiles or other obstacles, stomp on Rabbids, and basically just act silly.  With adults, this game can be fun at parties (especially when you introduce adult beverages and cameras to the mix) but the kids seem to enjoy it a lot more.

{"product_name":"B002I0KOSI","description":"","reviewerName":"Thomas Riccardi","summary":"Take to the skies of Arcadia!","reviewText":"I have been playing first person shooters since the days of Wolfenstein 3D all the way up to Crysis 3. But there has been no game that has left a lasting impression as the original Bioshock. With an engaging storyline, great graphics and customizable gameplay it was a wonder to play and explore the underwater city of Rapture. The sequel was to me a bit too short but introduced multiplayer but it left me feeling unsatisfied at the end of it. Now Irrational Games has taken the reins of bioshock to introduce Bioshock Infinite. But is this one city you are wanting to visit or should you let it float on by.Instead of taking place in the 1960's this game takes place almost a fifty years earlier and in the skies over America. Your journey starts in an ocean as you are nearing an island with a lighthouse in the middle of a storm. As Booker DeWitt you are hired to bring back a girl named Elizabeth from a city known as Columbia. As you make your way deeper into the lighthouse you come across a contraption that shoots you upwards into the city that floats in the sky.The game is similar to the previous Bioshock games but instead of plasmids you now have vigors that do things such as cast gouts of flame or summon a flock of crows. But the similarities end there as you will be able to travel fast around on the Skyline.This is not just useful for travel but you can use it in combat to try to outflank and outwit your opponents. Also this girl that you have rescued is not useless as she can drag things out of the void. She can provide cover, more ammo and even turrets in some parts of the game. So in this game you can play this game even more the way you want! Think of it this way you can hop on the skyway rail , get to a point and then drag out a sniper rifle to pick off foes from afar.There is also more going on in the story that I do not want to give away but this starts off as just to rescue the girl but you get drawn into an all out struggle for the city of Columbia. The game looks gorgeous as it looks as if you are transported into a hybrid steampunk / colonial city with awesome weapons and fearsome foes. If you are a fan of FPS'es, Steampunk or Bioshock games run out and get this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}

Carl left his home of Los Santos (loosely based on Los Angeles) and moved to Liberty City five years earlier. He receives a phone call from his brother, \"Sweet\", informing him of his mother's murder. After arriving in Los Santos, Carl is picked up by Officer Tenpenny, a corrupt cop. Tenpenny has recently murdered another cop and frames Carl for the murder and blackmails him into working for him. Eventually Carl is cleared, but Sweet is arrested and Carl spends much of the rest of the game completing various jobs and mission in San Fierro (San Francisco) and Las Venturas (Las Vegas) before ultimately returning to Los Santos.GRAND THEFT AUTO: SAN ANDREAS is a massive game. There are miles and miles and miles of ground between one place and another. Sometimes it can take several minutes just to get from one area to another. In the beginning this is fun. However, as you progress in the game it becomes frustrating. The game only automatically saves at the end or beginning of a mission and you can't try to manually save your game during the middle of a mission. So, there are sometimes missions that take nearly 30 minutes to complete and if you die, you have to start all over again.Make no mistake, this is an adult game. Drugs and violence are critical elements in the game. Foul language is a regular part of the character's dialogue. There's also a few missions that require some sexual activities.In terms of story and gameplay, GRAND THEFT AUTO: SAN ANDREAS offers a great deal. You can steal a cop car and perform cop missions. Enter a fire truck and you can do fire department mission. Take an ambulance and you can perform rescue missions. You get to drive a tank, fly a jet, and use a jet pack. You can also steal a pimpmobile and work as a pimp. Carl starts and ends gang wars and takes over a mafia casino in Las Venturas. Then there are the cars he steals to get around. You can spend a couple of months just exploring the terrain and doing side missions as you work your way through the main plot.One thing I was impressed about was the game's music. There are several different radio stations in the vehicles you drive and they play different music that's not just in a constant loop.You can change the channel and hear different songs or you can shut the whole radio off. It makes for a more realistic feel.The biggest drawback of the game is the lack of save points. When completing a mission it's either do or die.Overall, GRAND THEFT AUTO: SAN ANDREAS is an addictive game. It's adult content makes it a game not suitable for children or adults who are offended by such content. However, it's not difficult to see why GRAND THEFT AUTO: SAN ANDREAS is one of PlayStation 2's Greatest Hits.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2014"}

I found it near impossible to find on the NES, and while Nintendo released the first three Dragon Warrior games for Game Boy Color, it seemed we would never get an American re-release for this game.  It was my first console RPG, and the first video game I ever loved - and for those reasons, it will always be among my all-time favorites.I love the chapter structure - one of the many elements that, IMO, elevates it above the first three Dragon Quest/Warrior games.  You spend the first four chapters playing through the story and leveling up a variety of characters that, when you hit chapter five, your own character will then spend the first part of the chapter gathering up.  It's a wonderful way of bringing together of what turns out to be a really fantastic storyline - it makes it much more than the simple good protagonist vs. evil overlord, as it gives much depth and appreciation to the people that will eventually become members of your party.There are many little details I love in the changes that have been made here.  Not just in the use of the dual screens - where towns and dungeons are visually spread across the two - and the fact that you can use the left and right shoulder buttons to turn the camera; but also in other things, like the fact that, when in the overworld, the top screen becomes a map that slowly unravels itself as you gradually make your away across it.  And the fact that the top screen is utilized elsewhere, giving added info and stats during combat.  And the menu system is significantly easier and less arduous to navigate.  The only other version I've played was the NES, and every one of these is a huge improvement over the original.It doesn't utilize the touch screen at all, but it really doesn't need to.  This isn't so much about bringing a game to the DS, as it is remaking a classic that hasn't found its way to the US very much.  And there are changes to be seen - in character names, and the fact that they try to give a specific nationality to each of the different countries (for example, Alena's country is now Russian-influenced, and she's here referred to as Tsarevna Alena...though the downside being that in Alena's country in particular, the dialogue, I suspect, was meant to be as if they were a Russian people speaking trans-literally in English, and the unfortunate effect is that much of it is unintentionally funny), and also in monster names.  And there are some minor geographical differences, but they are few and far between.  Overall, the very fundamentals of the game are exactly what they were in the original.The greatest criticism of the game is really in the combat; it still goes back to the early days of console RPGs that overuses a turn-based combat system that is heavily enforced, with frequent encounters, and as a result, the process tends to become tedious.  The AI can also be infuriating at times, if you're ill-prepared, and the chance encounter can be overused at the wrong moments, with near-success of a task going all to pieces thanks to one random encounter that manages to wipe out your entire party.  But if you can grit your teeth and get through the tedium, the story is very much worth the experience.If you've played this game on the NES and enjoyed it at all, this is a must-have.  If you're a fan of the later Dragon Quest games and have never tried the early classics, this one in particular comes highly recommend.  If you're an RPG fan and somehow missed out on the Dragon Quest franchise all-together, you must give it a try.  Dragon Quest, IMO, allows for more freedom and slightly more customization than the Final Fantasy Series, and I've found it allows me to enjoy the overall experience to a greater degree.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2008"}

Helm \"THROW?\"","summary":"Some good, but mostly bad","reviewText":"First some background. Just skip to get to Madden 10 review.Ok, so I will start out saying that I bought every madden up until 06. That year I bought 2. One for the xbox, and one for the 360.They changed the audible from Y, your player, route, to b, b, b, b, until you get to your player, then your route. On the xbox, I could changed 5 guys routes in a couple of seconds, then on the 360 for the exact same stupid game, it would take like 10. So, now I just rent each madden until I realize that they didn't do anything new, and the few things they did do are stupid. Player weapons and smart weapons anyone? So, this week, I am going to tell my HB to be fast, and next week, I will tell him to be agile. So, KUDOS EA for getting rid of that turd! So, I have been renting ever since. I play one season, and take it back. Good job EA! Instead of $240 in game purchase, I have spent 10 bucks in rentals.Cons:Why in superstar mode do I have to deal with being forced with the stupid camera angles and not being able to manipulate any other people on offense or D?The protak just sucks. Your guys still bounce off of a ballcarrier. Nothing like watching your ROLB grabbing a HB and then you bring your FS up to finish him off only to watch your FS bounce off both of them and then the HB shed your LB.As always, a little running back will plow over your D-line and MLB while a your FB will get clobbered by a corner. I actually had a kicker level my HB on a return.Why do people add worthless crap like the Extra Point show. Who the heck cares about league scores. Heck, who cares to see the current game highlights, I just played it. Sure it was cool in game 1, but by game 2 you just want it to stop.Let's Measure this one! Really! I HAVE to watch the officials measure the ball! I HAVE to watch them discuss if it was a TD or not. I really CAN'T skip any of this.I got called for a holding 3 times in a row on a FG until I was out of range. I also got called for holding at the end of 2 seperate games when kicking a FG for the win, so time expired and I lost. I only got called for holding one other time. So, 5 out of 6 times just happened to be at inopportune moments.Somehow, the return team always knows if you are kicking left or right. HMMMMMMMMMMMMMIf you kick onside and they are in a normal return, they audible to an onside and you have to wait. If they kick an onside, you can audible and they kick right away.Your O-Line throws some awesome lookout blocks.Audibles. I can't swap my run to the left or right, only my entire play. Of course my WR on the left and right are to stupid to run each others routes, they have to slowly jog to the other side of the field so i get a Delay of Game penalty.I can't hit up or down on the right stick to jump a run or pass.Why can't I play franchise with my own created player (not in superstar mode). I don't have to be able to play with him online, but it would be nice if me and my buddy could play each other with our own players, or even if I could do it myself.It is sad how the play select works. I have 12 buttons on my 360 controller including the L and R clicks. Take out start for menu and B to get back, and I can select between 10 plays at once. Why oh why do I have to look at 3 at a time.Lead Blocker. This was an awesome tool, however, it shouldn't have been. Why can't anybody freaking block in this game. Just b/c I have it on madden doesn't mean that my line, TE, and FB can't block now, does it? Sick of watching my O run right by guys and not even slowing down to get in their way. On a screen, your guys will run straight to the sideline past the most outside D player. REALLY MADDEN!!!!! YOU CAN'T FIX THIS, BUT YOU CAN GIVE US THE EXTRA POINT SHOW!There are more things, but hopefully that drives the point home.Pros:As stated in my background, I do like that the audible system isn't as atrocious as it used to be, and they have been in for a while, but the smart routes feature is great.If you just want to play some football and haven't played madden before, you will probably like it. If you have played madden before, you will wonder why it (GAMEPLAY) really hasn't changed in a decade.In summary:EA and all other companies.No one cares about graphics and neato frito junk if you are sacrificing gameplay!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2009"}

You're hackin', you're shootin' stuff! Then blam. Loading~86% (sunuvagun shoots right up like an iPhone battery then takes forever to finish). Leave your PS4 running... you've been warned.But back to the cinema, the opening's beautiful. The digital cloud conceptualized. Data flows everywhere we go and Watch Dogs expresses that in their art. Which... peeps into our lives very deeply. You know that super server in Utah? You know, the one~you guessed it! That the NSA built? Yup, that's the one I'm talking about. Watch Dogs be watching the feds, because Ubisoft's put a miniature version of those computers all over Chicago (yes, the Chi-town-graphics are great... we will see better in the future though) and use it all over the god dang city. Biometric scanning. Security feeds. Hacking-ception.Ubisoft crafted the 'masterpiece' series Assassino! Watch Dogs challenges the concepts that AC first presented to us with... moar Templars (the NSA). You're the lulzy group DedSec that challenges this global conspiracy. You shoot someone, a person will call the police. Then the cameras start automatically scanning the area for your face. Data taken in from these cameras are pretty much 3D (like the body scans at the airport, but more detailed).Watching it all put together by Ubisoft Montreal excites me as a gamer. If you care about gaming, then support new intellectual properties. Don't buy used: Watch Game Stop crash and burn for committing the sin of \"buying back\" $60/like-new games for $5. Either way, get your hands on this game. If you've spent $XXX on a console, then you might as hit up Redbox for some DVDs/Blu-Rays/Games.It's a new generation. Finally video games can be considered part of mainstream, along with movies.Edit:Some more examples of CTOS (cough, Kinect) scanning technologies I've seen in Watch Dawgs:Trash scanning. Yes, f-ing trash scanning. As some of you may know, (public) trash is considered \"open property,\" meaning it has no 4th Amendment protections. So, in Watch Dawgs they installed cameras inside the trash cans to scan for drug/cash/etc. drop offs/exchanges. Some guy dropped a sack of drugs in the trash can, they scanned it, and blam, drug deal busted. How's that for a mind blowing concept?Here another mind blowing concept: plant pattern scanning. A Chicago citizen was cultivating my state's legal herb. The camera scanned the pot leaf's outline and matched it to the illegal substance Cannabis Sativa.

The second game introduces characters wich will appear in MGS4 and have very important roles in both games, and the gameplay is much more smoohter than the first. But the best of all is MGS3 wich explains the origins of Metal Gear, and the story has twist plots at every corner, so besides getting nervous during game the cutscenes with the story are OSCAR winning perfomances. The game play is superb, you get to change you camouflage as you need it get to different weapons, and have to use every corner to evade the enemy.So, in conclussion, if you are a new player in the MGS series like me, I highly recomend this set, for the gameplay, story and value of all 3 games.PLAY ON!!!!!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2008"}

{"product_name":"B004ASOLLM","reviewerName":"James Skemp \"JamesRSkemp.com\"","summary":"External speaker is key","reviewText":"I've tried two different microphones before this headset: the one that came with Warhawk and the PlayStation 3 camera, and since I rarely play multiplayer games, and PlayStation players are less likely to have microphones that Xbox 360 players, both were just fine.But when I saw this available on Amazon Vine, and had just started a Borderlands 2 campaign with 3 other people (I was planning on, and had used for one session already, my PS camera), it seemed like fate.I've now used this in three 3 to 4 hour sessions and I'm completely sold. Unlike Warhawk's headset this one features a very nice external speaker. This means that instead of resting inside my ear a bit, it sits completely outside of it, resting against the ear. This is by far the best feature of this headset. Maybe others include this, but since it's new to me, it's an eye-opener.The piece that wraps around the ear is also fixed, which I initially thought was going to be an issue, but actually works rather well.The mute button is easy to trigger, and emits a pleasant tone when it's activated. I'm not sure what I think about the volume buttons yet, since touching them seems a little off, but it's not a big issue.I also had to turn up the volume of the microphone on my PlayStation 3 itself as it was mentioned I was a little quiet. However, I'm generally that way in real-life, so that's probably me, and not a big deal since it only had to be set once.The inclusion of different headsets is rather nice, but I haven't felt the need to change the one it already had on. Overall, I'm completely sold with my almost 4 weeks of use, and would definitely recommend the PlayStation 3 EX-02 Next Gen Bluetooth Headset to anyone that needs one for the PlayStation 3. 5 of 5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2014"}

I fronted the money to a friend at gamestop so he could buy the game, so he let me borrow the single player disc in return.

I've decided to review each level, breaking things down a bit.SEMPER FIDELISPointless, really. A 3 minute level that is supposed to be a prologue, which you end up replaying in the last level.OPERATION SWORDBREAKEROne of the better levels in the game, this is the one from the E3 demo and I enjoyed it a lot. Was about 40 minutes long so overall this was an excellent level.UPRISINGDark, and boring. About 25 minutes long and not too much fun to be had here. A lot of linear corridor shooting, not enough story, and no destruction at all.. Disappointing.GOING HUNTINGStupid. Just stupid. Give us a level where we can CONTROL the vehicle, not sit and shoot at targets for 20 minutes.. One of the worst levels in the game, by far.OPERATION GUILLOTINEMediocre level. About 35 minutes long, just a bunch of fighting with nothing spectacular here. Again, with my HDTV and even though I don't have the HD content installed it is still dark and boring.COMRADESOne of the best levels in the game. Fast paced action, good story, and full of surprises. Only about 25 minutes long, unfortunately.THUNDER RUNTanks. Horrible, extremely boring and repetitive. 30 minutes of my time wasted.FEAR NO EVILWhy is this level here? It gives a little story but it is only 10 minutes long... Just another tank garbage level.NIGHT SHIFTDefinitely the best level in the game. Stealth gameplay and support gameplay from afar while the marines attack down below. There should have been more of these levels. 40 minutes long, thankfully.ROCK AND A HARD PLACEAlrighty level. Reminded me of the Bad Company series with the openness of the level, not that you could go anywhere outside the combat zone. About 30 minutes long.KAFFAROVAnother great level, thankfully. About 45 minutes long with plenty of action and even more surprises involved. Well done.THE GREAT DESTROYERA short, 15 minute level with the first level thrown in it. Why does the first level exist if it is in here? Oh well.. And also a horrible ending too, made no sense.OverallA measly 5/10.

The game was not nearly as big of a success as other titles of the year such as Halo or Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, but it quickly seized hold of an enormous cult following that became very emotionally attached to the game.  The game was so beloved and so much of a success that when Bioshock 2 came out a year later it couldn't have hoped to be as beloved.  After all, the original Bioshock was groundbreaking from a narrative standpoint.  A game that reached so high any game which followed it couldn't hope to come within an arms length of its legacy.  Nevertheless, Bioshock Infinite is here and it reaches.  In some regards, perhaps even higher than the one that started it all.You play as Booker Dewitt.  He's got some debts to settle and believes he can do so.  He must first venture to the floating city of Columbia.  There he must rescue a young woman named Elizabeth.  But it will not be easy.  Columbia is a city ruled under the watchful eye of Father Comstock, a prophet who can supposedly see the future.  It isn't long before Booker realizes that rescuing Elizabeth and escaping the city of Columbia will be much more difficult than he imagined.  Quickly branded as a false prophet, Booker comes under attack.Like the first game, Bioshock Infinite is a very thematically ambitious game.  One that begins to elevate storytelling in gaming.  There will surely be a lot of discussion to follow with this one.  There's a lot of care taken with the world in which it takes place in, as well as with some of the themes it handles.  And Bioshock Infinite opts to hold very little back.  Here you'll be tackling themes such as racism, religion, false prophets, gender roles, even moments that will test your own morals.  It's got a lot to say.  The story and the world also come to life in the same way that Rapture does.  While Columbia is not as dazzling as the trip into the underwater world, it does have a pulse just the same.  You'll find Voxphones scattered throughout.  These, like the original Bioshocks audio diaries, add a lot more to the tale at hand.  They add to the story, the world and the atmosphere.  To ignore them is to miss out on a considerable portion of the game.  For those very curious about the world they're playing in, they will most certainly want to pick these up.From the outset it doesn't seem as though there is much which separates Bioshock Infinite from it's predecessor.  Indeed, it takes a moment to get there.  Many aspects will be familiar to you from the outset.  Instead of Plasmids, for example, you have Vigors.  These allow you to do things such as possess machines and make them attack your enemies, or hurl explosive fireballs at your foes.  If there are crows an area you can even turn them against your foes.  There's a lot variety with the vigors, as well as many different ways to use them.  There is a limit, of course, you need salts to be able to use them.  Like the original there are also vending machines around where you can use currency to buy upgrades for your vigors or guns.  You can also restore health.Unlike the original, however, you don't stock up on health packs that will be used immediately when your life reaches zero.  Rather you have one life gauge that doesn't recharge at all.  You must find food or other means of sustenance to restore your health.  There is, however, a shield you'll get early on that does recharge.  If you can find cover in the midst of a gun fight or keep from taking damage your shield will recharge and you'll be ready again.  This seems like it'll make the game particularly difficult at first, but Bioshock Infinite is not too challenging in and of itself.  Sometimes the enemies can come in large waves.  But should you bite the dust you are never punished too harshly.  You'll respawn really close to where you died and you'll be given some health and some ammo.  Your enemies will also have some of their health restored as well, so whatever killed you is usually still lurking.  The only downside is that there will be times when you respawn and you'll need to take time to adjust to your surroundings.  Though you never respawn far from where you've died, there are times when you'll feel disoriented and turned around when you do.There is also gear you can put on to help you out along the way.  These will enhance your abilities.  And if you mix and match things will change.  One piece of gear, for instance, allows you to run faster when your shield burst.  Another lets you set people on fire when you attack them.  This adds a layer of strategy and gives you a different means of approaching the bad guys.  Get enough variety of gear and you'll be able to create different \"builds\" for your character.  You might think of these builds as various job classes from an RPG.  This all provides many different ways to tackle many of the big firefights in Bioshock Infinite.Chances are you won't die too many times.  Bioshock Infinite's biggest change to gameplay is adding Elizabeth into the equation.  Elizabeth will accompany you throughout much of the experience and as such she is a companion.  This isn't some game where you'll have to babysit, though.  Elizabeth can't die.  Although she will supply you with ammunition and health if you need it.  This little tweak can make the game a bit easier than it has to be, but it won't make death impossible.  She also helps you unlock doors when you come across them, although it is just a tad bit strange that youWhat really helps Elizabeth along is how well realized of a character she is.  How she develops and her facial expressions give her a lot of life.  To say much more than that would be to spoil a lot of the fun of the game.  Booker is not a bad character, by any means, but the story quickly lets you know it isn't about him.  He's a man with a simple mission, but this is much more her story than his.  She is truly a loveable and charming character.  Not that Booker is bad, but he's primarily there to make sure you experience the story more so than to add a lot.  While he makes commentary and quips (that are mostly to provide hints of where to go) every now and then the game makes no illusions about who is the star of the show here.That being said, because of such a huge emphasis on its narrative and story, Bioshock Infinite often has a real clear path for you to go.  It's a very linear game where you'll rarely (if ever) find yourself lost.  That doesn't mean you can't explore.  There is plenty off the beaten path where you can go off track for a moment to find gear, vigors and sometimes even going so far as to find a sidequest or two.  If you ever find yourself exploring too much, a tap of a button will show the way to go in order to get back onto the right path.Most areas are not too big, but they are filled to the brim with a lot of details.  For the most part, Bioshock Infinite doesn't look that much different than the previous two games.  This is fine as they were gorgeous looking.  Here there is a lot of detail to the world.  One of the chief criticisms lodged at Bioshock 2 was that we'd already explored quite a bit of Rapture.  A return there wasn't exciting enough.  Columbia definitely is.  The tone is very similar, but the atmosphere is not.  Instead of going down dark corridors you're exploring a lot of open spaces.  Not everyone you meet is someone who has lost their mind either (and some do not even care to try to kill you).  Especially in the beginning moments of the game, you may come across citizens having idle conversation.  Likewise, where as the original Bioshock was pretty dark in its environment, Infinite is not afraid to let the sunshine in.  Many of its set piece moments stand in contrast to the original.The audio is just as good.  The sound effects are great.  But what is the most rewarding is listening to the voice acting.  All the performances are great.  Comstock, in some cases, can be downright haunting (particularly listening to him on Voxphone).  It helps to make a pretty engaging experience.  If there was anything about the presentation that might be a bit of a nuisance it might be that from time to time the frame rate can get a little choppy.Bioshock Infinite is not for the weak-hearted however.  It's a violent game with some pretty gruesome death moments.  Nothing to cringe worthy for those who have played the original Bioshock or other violent games.  What makes it more startling is that there is a much deeper context to much of it here.  As in, moments in which you'll see innocent people brutally murdered before your eyes or treated very poorly.  Much of this is put forth for thematic or story driven purposes.  It can be brutal, but it isn't here just for the sake of shock or as a means to see how far they can push the envelope.If there was anything about Bioshock Infinite that immediately sticks out like a sore thumb, it would be some of the \"choices\" and \"decisions.\"  Some moments you're able to make certain choices by pushing one trigger or another.  The problem is that the impact of these choices isn't really clear--if they even manage to change anything at all.  At the beginning of the game, for instance you can choose to throw a baseball at a couple or throw it at the MC on stage.  Regardless of your decision things will play out the same.  It isn't particularly obvious if this has any lasting impact.  It has short term effects, but nothing that really impacts the story in a major way.The PS3 version of Bioshock Infinite comes with a free copy of the original Bioshock.  For those who've yet to play through the game it's a nice treat.  For those who have already experienced Bioshock it may not actually be necessary, but it can serve as a nice reminder of the game in and of itself.  But you're free to take it or leave it.Bioshock Infinite isn't a perfect game, but it is a great one.  A thematically ambitious game with a well told story, Bioshock Infinite is sure to delight fans who fell in love with the original back in 2007.  It is a game that not only delivers well from a gameplay standpoint, but from a narrative one as well.  If you enjoyed exploring the world of Rapture in 2007, then you'll love going through the land of Columbia, here.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2013"}

Seems to be much longer than that yet, and the worlds are fun and detailed. I immediately remembered why Mario games are so loved, because the level of gameplay and attention to detail is off the charts.However, there's something wrong with this game when it's left in Sleep mode during the day. It drains the battery completely by the afternoon, even if I haven't played it along the day. Other games haven't done that in the past, so I'm pretty sure there's a big bug in this game that keeps the internals running at full speed even when the screen goes off. That's a big letdown for me, because I don't like to charge my console midday, only when I'm going back to sleep. So, go bark at a tree if you don't like what I said.

It had jaw-droppping graphics, superb gameplay, and excelent, diverese weapons. Unreal Tournament 2003 is going to be excelent. UT2003 is going to have BETTER graphics (and boy do I mean better), BETTER gameplay, and BETTER weapons (same weapons but some of them modified and others are totally new... They might even have grenades that you can through, unlike its predecessor).New graphics engines will come into play with UT2003. There will be a new physics engine and a new engine called Skeletal Animation, which animates every single different bone in your body, and not just the whole body itself. By that, I mean that instead of the body moving while running, the arms, legs, and whatever else needed to run will be animated. In most games, only the body is animated when running. In UT2003, we should see people's heads moving if they are looking behind their shoulders, or see their legs bend and fly before they jump.The new physics engine will be a great addition to the game. Almost like Soldier of Fortune, it has a great physics engine so that you never die the same way twice. If a rocket comes at your left leg, your leg gets blown off, and thats it. If you get shot by a plasma rifle, then you will go flying into a wall, and then fall down. If you get shot in the side by a sniper rifle, you will fall down to the side.I also have heard that if you fake your death (Please tell me alteast ONE MAJOR UT FAN KNOWS YOU CAN FAKE YOUR DEATH BY PRESSING THE &lt;F> KEY!), you can get stepped on, and if you get stepped on enough, you will lose all of your heatlth and die, a great new feature (haha).Well, UT2003 looks like it will suck me into senceless violence land again infront of my computer, just as UT did.

{"product_name":"B007W8S2MG","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"Best RPG in a long while!","reviewText":"I never played a persona game before, but since this one received such great reviews, I decided to give it a shot.  The first half hour of this game got me really worried but then I fell in love with it.******************************Pros**************************************-Very unique RPG game play: This game has two types of gameplay system. One you go to dungeons, fight monsters and bosses , collect treasures. Second, as a school boy you interact with your friends, family and others in your town. I knew I liked dungeon and fighting gameplay but I was surprised by how much I ended up social linking gameplay in this game.  While I was a bit worried at first about the social gameplay, it becomes very addictive as it boosts the experience of personas (your monsters) you create.-Strategic Battles: This game is turn based JRPG where you can control each of the characters (like FFX) or you can choose to control only main character and give basic commands to your team mate (like FFXIII?). Like typical RPGs enemies are weak and strong against elements, but figuring out which enemy is weak is where this game challenges you. In addition it has unique persona (monsters) gameplay.-Persona (Monster) Concept: This is the most unique thing about this game. You and your friends have &#8216;persona&#8217; (in simple words, monster that help you fight in the dungeons. Really liked how you can grow these personas by traditional RPG grinding tactics (leveling up in dungeons) as well as through social linking (spending time with the characters in the game).-Creating Strong and Unique Personas Experience: This is an art of its own in this game. You, unlike your buddies in the game can have multiple personas and by combining them you can create even more powerful and unique personas (monsters). This can make this experience very strategic as well as addicting.-Mysterious Main Story and Involving Sub-stories: Usually I find interacting with other characters (i.e going to them and talking to them) boring in most RPGs but in this game it is quite fun and useful. This game has a very mysterious and involving main story and each character you link with will lead you to sub-stories. So if you like story driven games, this is the game for you.-Great Animation: Really liked both the in game animation and anime cut scenes. Really wished there were more of the cutscenes. They were pretty amazing. Really loved how they show character expression (question mark, cloud, perspiration over the head etc.).-Mainly Innocent and yet at times Mature Humor: There are events in this game that made me laugh so hard (camping trip, club etc.) Definitely worth experiencing.-Music: It is very rare I praise music in a game. But loved different types of music played in the game. Really loved the dungeon final boss music in the &#8216;game world&#8217;.-Unlocking True Ending: I am happy I learned about this online otherwise I would have missed out a lot. Really loved it.******************************Cons**************************************-Slow and Somewhat Misleading Beginning: The first half or so hour of the game, I was worried as it was filled with story and no dungeon fights or anything. I was worried that this was not one of the social games where all you do is talk, but later on the game, I couldn&#8217;t get enough of the story. I would quickly finish dungeons to advance the main story and sub-stories with different characters.-Easily miss-ables: Unfortunately like many other RPGs , there are some great things you will miss out on if you don&#8217;t pay attention to all the instructions that are being given to you. Especially for me for the first half of the game I didn&#8217;t pay any attention to improving social links with Marie and Margaret. I am happy I bumped across an online discussion about true ending. Otherwise I would have missed out a lot.******************************Conclusion**************************************If you are an RPG lover and have a Vita, you must buy this game. I will even go far enough to say that if you are an RPG fan and don&#8217;t own Vita, buy one (or borrow from your friend) to play this game otherwise you will be missing out on one of the greatest RPG and storytelling experience ever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00005N7YR","reviewerName":"Chris Peters","summary":"I shudder to say it - This Game is Better Than Half-Life","reviewText":"Finally I have played a game that surpasses the Best Game of All Time, Half-Life.  Even your stubborn old Dad who hates video games will want to play this one, once he sees it.  Metal of Honor: Allied Assault (MoHAA) is 30 missions in Northern France and Europe that will take you through WW2 like you have only seen in movies.  MoHAA is beautiful, it is exciting, and it often reminded me of what my grandfathers went through.  Parts of the game are ripped straight out of great war movies like Saving Private Ryan, Das Boot, or even Schindler's List, with a little flavor of Indiana Jones mixed in there to temper the sometimes harsh events.MOHAA is intensely beautiful.  Every image I ever had of WWII is present - the U-boat facilities, the bombed french villages, the concentration camps, the bridge from the finale of Private Ryan, or the creme of the group - the invasion of Omaha Beach, D-Day, present in every tiny detail.  At times, there is so much action going on, so many soldiers rushing around me, there I just stopped to admire the detail (and promptly was shot into a thousand pieces).  I was often amazed how far video games have come, I saw so much progress in this game. The music is Hollywood-quality, and the sound effects deserve special mention, as I think the developers used actually weapons to create the very convincing sounds I heard.If only you had time to admire the scenery.  The enemy AI is outstanding, and will definitely keep you on your toes:  German soldiers fire from behind cover, or run to find a better position.  They hide in towers and dark corners and rush you from all directions.  One mission has you moving through a destroyed French town crawling with Nazi snipers, another has you creeping through the woods in the middle of dense fog, looking for a hint of the enemy between the trees.There are only a few minor problems, and I mean minor.  The game requires a very powerful computer, more than it's minimal requirements.  There are a few graphical glitches here and there, but nothing distracting or important.  The multiplayer portion isn't all that great, but who really cares?  You don't buy this game for the multiplay.A landmark game.  A piece of history.

If you have kids and can only afford one additional game for the Kinect, I recommend this one.Kinect sports offers you bowling, beach volleyball, table tennis, soccer, track & field and boxing.Boxing is my favorite.  Such a great workout and so much fun. It's a great way to get stress out of your system. I actually told my kids that from now on, if they start to argue about anything, I'm making them Kinect box it out until they're friends again.  When you get knocked out, you have to punch up at the \"stars\" your character sees in order to be back on your feet in the game.Track and field offers a variety of sports.  The trick (that took me a few times to master) is that the height of your knees = your speed.  Running in place with your feet down does little.  Picking up your knees gets your character moving the fastest.  Something to get used to but still fun.  The track portion includes hurdles and a sprint. The field portion includes javelin, discus and long jump.Bowling is fun!  My youngest two love this the most. It's funny because if you let the ball go too soon you hear the crowd scream.  My kids got a kick out of this.  They also like that they are able to hit pins and get strikes.  The bowling balls are fun colors and they love that.Soccer is pretty awesome.  My only complaint about it is that it doesn't register head shots or the goalie diving.  Once I got used to that, it's been fun.Table tennis is a tornado of fun.  I haven't quite mastered this one yet.  I'm still working on figuring out how to return those corner shots.I haven't played beach volleyball.  My husband and kids seem to like it but it's not a favorite. I think mostly because they love bowling and track and not because there is anything wrong with the volleyball portion of the disc.There are also about a dozen mini games on the disc. They feature skills from bowling, soccer, volleyball, table tennis & track & field.  They are short in length and, in my opinion, even more fun than the full length version.  An example is the target kicking game. The player has 30 seconds to get as many soccer balls past a goalie and to the target.  When xx number of targets are hit additional time is added to the clock.Overall this game offers quite a bit of variety.My kids are 3, 6 and 14. The younger two have no problem moving through the menus, shutting off the tutorials and getting to the games they want. When a child is out of range for the sensor, it's hard for a non-reader to know exactly which way to go, but the image makes them realize they need to do something to keep playing.When I pre-ordered, I needed to buy a game to get a promotional credit. I'm so glad I chose Kinect Sports.  It literally makes all 5 of us happy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2010"}

{"product_name":"B001NIP3EG","reviewerName":"CallMeZoidberg","summary":"Welcome back to Rapture, where a man chooses, and a slave obeys","reviewText":"Imagine an expansive, skyscraper laden underwater dystopia, underscored by a hauntingly art deco flair, called \"Rapture\", created by megalomaniac Andrew Ryan, who championed the individual. Then imagine that haunting sense of atmosphere as merely the backdrop of a finely, precisely crafted game that managed to excel in just about every way possible. It's not a stretch to imagine for those who played Irrational Games' highly lauded \"Game of the Year\" Bioshock. What is hard to imagine, however, is how 2K Marin, with some of the first game's staff, was going to try and get over a bar already set so high. Fortunately for fans, Bioshock 2 was at least match the effort put forth by its predecessor and even surpass it in some ways.Bioshock 2 puts the player in a new pair of shoes - heavy, metal ones. As opposed to playing as the previous ill-fated protagonist, Jack, the player dons the helmets and boots of a Big Daddy searching for a particular Little Sister, ten years after the events of the first game. A new antagonist has managed to take hold of Rapture in the form of Sofia Lamb, a collectivist striving for a Utopia where all act towards a singular goal, who acts as a foil to Ryan's belief in the determination of the individual.Nowhere near as captivating and arresting as Ryan himself, she serves admirably as an antagonist as the game focuses far more on the player's direct affects on his environment, as opposed to the first game which was much more about unraveling a storied past rife with conflict, philosophical oppositions, and other varying thematic elements. Rapture does lose some of its mystique the second time around, but the world still has plenty left over from the last time, while adding new locales augmented by a meticulous attention to detail to make sure the world feels just as alive, just as hauntingly distraught.Equally impressive is the use of sound, which follows the trend of the first game by offering the same subtle, chilling sound effects, produced in the innermost bowels of Rapture, echoing throughout the dilapidated halls of the city, making it, once more, feeling hauntingly alive. The voice work is also topnotch, with plenty of audio diaries to collect, further chronicling Ryan and Lamb's conflicts early on in Rapture, and adding incredibly depth to back-story.The meat of Bioshock 2, the gameplay, remains similar enough to the first for veterans to feel at home, yet adds in its own subtleties. Most notable is the character's ability to wield both plasmids - genetically-granted \"superpowers\" - and traditional weapons at the same time, while the weapons have increased in bulk to match the Big Daddy's style, with the melee-based wrench being replaced by an enormous drill-arm. As the game progresses, more plasmids become available for purchase, as well as weapon upgrades, new weapons, and tonics, which augment stats such as speed or health.Gone are the water-pipe hacking mini-games, unfortunately, replaced by a real-time, reaction-based system. The whole game flows a little more smoothly, narrative included, but at the very slight expense of charm or quirkiness, though it mostly remains intact. The first-person shooter controls remain similar to the first, with options for varying control schemes.Like the first, the game revolves around the character being set to accomplish certain tasks in the different locations of Rapture, all which open up the advancement of the main storyline. The Splicers - genetically defunct and violently insane civilians - return as the primary enemies, with additions such as the Brute Splicers, which can take more damage. Most notable, however, is the Big Sister - essentially a skinny, agile, and even more tenacious version of a Big Daddy - who adds another layer of intensity and variety to combat.As a Big Daddy, the player is also able to interact with the Little Sisters - small girls who wander around Rapture, protected by Big Daddies, sticking needles into bodies to drain and ingest genetic material called ADAM - in a new way. The player can \"adopt\" Little Sisters (after dispatching of their protective Bid Daddies, first) and search for bodies to drain ADAM from. This initiates a defense sequence where the player must protect the Little Sister from ravenous, ADAM-craving Splicers while she drains the bodies.The player is also presented with an option similar of the first game, allowing either the harvesting (essentially killing) or rescuing of the Little Sisters, the latter resulting in less ADAM for the player. It's among a variety of moral choices presented in Bioshock 2, made more poignant by the direct familial relationship that the player - now, as a Big Daddy - has with the little girls - a theme also furthered by Lamb's attempt to organize the reprehensibly, crazed denizens of Rapture into a sort of familial structure in line with her collectivist ideals.Bioshock 2 also features a surprisingly entertaining multiplayer component, with several game modes. Taking place 10 years prior to the events of the game, during the Civil War period of Rapture, the multiplayer also features tidbits of narrative, along with its very Call of Duty-like progression system. It's ultimately fun and surprisingly original, though it remains to be seen if it will have any staying power. The game also lacks dedicated servers, meaning that lag can be a legitimate issue at times, depending on the other players' connections.While undoubtedly now as fresh as it was three years ago, Bioshock 2 is a particularly refined title, improving in various ways over the original. The characters don't have the fascinating qualities as those from the first game, but they remain fairly complex - certainly more so than most offerings available today. Bioshock 2 still wrestles in the gray areas of the first, from the moral choices of the players to the philosophies and motives of the supporting cast to simply interesting character studies of some of gaming's more complex characters. Still, the game fails to innovate and capture the brilliance of the first title.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J9M0","description":"","reviewerName":"Julia","summary":"Really Great Game","reviewText":"This is a very nice sequel to the first one. The first was simple and cute, with quite a few little quirks. It is a nice game. I believe that this game should be played after the first one, and not before, because the first game is simple and allows you to learn the controls VERY well. I have never played such a long tutorial (although it didn't feel like a tutorial), and it is necessary to learn the physics of the game. In this one, they really expect you played the first one. Other than the destroyed ruins of the pictures of the moves that were present in the first game, there is no description. I can easily see it being very frustrating for people who never played the first one.I do love this sequel though. Even though (as one of the reviewers said) it doesn't have the sheer simplicity that made it shine like in the first game, I don't think it was possible to keep that simplicity unless they used a story that was not connected to the original game in any way (like, another laboratory and a different subject or something). I think that this game adds elements to the series that made it more complex and twisted. The first game was twisted in its own way, and the second game added some deeper elements of disturbing and, in some way, scariness that the would not have been possible otherwise.The surroundings are pretty (not large, but neither was the original), the characters are amusing, the story has a few unexpected events, and the puzzles are just as elaborate and amazingly engrossing as the original.I really love this series. I would say \"I love this game\" but this isn't just a game. It's a deep, intricate series. There should not be one game without the other.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2011"}

And even though I owned an Xbox and countless games, I regained my obession with Mario Kart, and played it more than any other game for weeks. I soon decided I HAD to get Double Dash. So I ordered a Gamecube, four controllers, Double Dash and some other games.When I first played Double Dash, it somewhat fell below my expectations, but as I continued, it became insanely fun, and extremely addictive and this is only in single player.The stages in Double Dash are nothing short of fantastic. The bright graphics, varied and interactive backgrounds are as much fun to look at as they are to play. The weapons and stages look alot cooler than the previous incarnation. The biggest problem however, is that this game is more of an upgrade than a new game altogether. There are no new weapons (actually there are less), except for the special weapons for each character and many of the stages are similar, just with drastically changed and improved surroundings. The added co-op play with two characters is innovative but not terribly exciting. There is quite a bit to unlock, but it most likely wouldn't take you very long to unlock everything. There are also numerous other parts of the game which could be improved or other features which could have been added. Essentially it is still Mario Kart 64 with a major upgrade. So even with all these disappointments, why am I still giving this game a five star rating? Well it is so incredibly fun, that it is still worth it. Bring this to a party with four controllers, or better yet, eight, and hook up a lan game, and it will be some of the most fun you could possibly have... period.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2003"}

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-Fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.Xbox LIVE support including LIVE Achievements.","reviewerName":"Rigo J.

The story was alright, I give it a 3.5/5 but it has other things that make up for that. Whether you're picking things up with your gravity power or freezing time with your blue time sphere it's a blast using TMD's. The graphics are about Call of Duty level, average.The bad guys range from Russian Spec Ops teams to mutant freaks to HUGE monsters that fill the screen. Getting up close & personal shooting limbs/heads off is a good time - especially in slow-mo with the soldier crying out. If you enjoy gory games, puzzle type games, games that have to do with physics, time traveling, going it alone down dark hallways, then I highly recommend this game.

But rather addictive- I never imagined a rock/papers/scissors game could be addictive (even for an \"older\" player)- The fighting is extraordinarily well done and really captures the essence of those old supernatural kungfu fights that used to be on TV in the early 70s.I am not sure if this game will have a lot of replay value after you get through most of the challenges.

So far, there are motorcycles, mopeds, choppertype motorcycles, cars, trucks, and now I found some boats to cruise around in as well as some sports cars.  I am hoping to be able to fly helicopters as well...assuming they are later in the game.  The in-game music barely cuts it though.  Just cruising around the islands are still enjoyable.

Peavey","summary":"Super Mario in Space","reviewText":"Super Mario Galaxy is one of the Nintendo Wii's good gamesStory/Plot: Shortly after Mario is invited to the centennial Star Festival by Princess Peach to celebrate the comet that passes overhead, Bowser invades the Mushroom Kingdom with a surprise attack in a fleet of airships. Summoning a giant flying saucer, Peach's entire castle is removed from its foundations and is lifted into outer space. After an unsuccessful rescue attempt, Mario is catapulted onto a small planet by one of Bowser's minions. On the planet, he meets an enchantress named Rosalina and her companions, the Lumas. Rosalina is a watcher of the stars, who uses the Comet Observatory to travel across the universe. However, Bowser has stolen all of the Power Stars that act as the Observatory's power source, rendering it immobile. Bestowed with the power to travel through space through one of the Lumas, Mario sets off on a journey across the universe to reclaim the Power Stars and restore power to Rosalina's observatory. Upon collecting enough Power Stars, the Comet Observatory regains the power to transform into a comet, and flies to the center of the universe, where Bowser is holding Peach captive. Confronting Bowser, Mario learns that Bowser's plan is to rule the entire universe with Peach at his side, using a newly constructed sun of his own via the power of the Grand Stars. Mario manages to defeat Bowser and free Peach; however, in doing so, Bowser's sun collapses into itself, becoming a supermassive black hole that begins consuming everything nearby. All of Rosalina's Lumas jump into the black hole to destroy it, but sacrifice themselves in the process. The black hole collapses into a singularity and explodes in a supernova. Rosalina appears to Mario as a giantess, stating that dying stars are later reborn as new stars. Mario awakens in the restored Mushroom Kingdom, full with all of the creatures he had met in the galaxies, alongside Peach and Bowser, celebrating the new galaxy that has emerged in the skies.Gameplay: The player's character is controlled via the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. While most of Mario's abilities are taken directly from Super Mario 64, such as the long jump, wall jumps, and a variety of somersaults, Mario is given new moves that take advantage of the Wii Remote's pointer and motion sensing. The most basic feature is the Star Pointer, which appears on-screen (as long as the remote is pointed at the screen) for the entire game and both marks the position of, and is controlled by, the Wii Remote. First and foremost, the Star Pointer is used to pick up special konpeito-shaped objects called &#34;Star Bits&#34;, which are then shot to stun enemies, manipulate obstacles, or feed Hungry Lumas. Secondly, the pointer can latch onto small blue objects called &#34;Pull Stars&#34; that gradually pull Mario through space. Thirdly, if the player becomes encased in a floating bubble, the Star Pointer is used to blow air at it in order to influence the direction and speed it moves. At one point, the pointer can be used to clear snow. Luigi controls identically to Mario, but he has both better jumping abilities and less traction, making some areas either less or more challenging when playing through the game the second time. The player gains a new ability early in the game, known as the &#34;Spin&#34; technique, which has previously appeared in varying forms since Super Mario Bros. 3. In Super Mario Galaxy, the Spin is primarily used for melee attacks, as it can stun enemies and shatter objects, and is used to trigger special propellers called &#34;Sling Stars&#34; or &#34;Launch Stars&#34; that launch Mario across large distances through space. The Spin is also used for climbing vines, ice-skating, unscrewing bolts, and for activating several power-ups. Other Wii Remote functions are available for smaller quests, such as surfing aboard a manta ray or balancing atop a large ball and rolling it through an obstacle course.Power Ups: Super Mario Galaxy featured the most power-ups and transformations of any 3D Mario game. Nine power-ups supply Mario with a special costume that grants him new abilities. For example, special Mushrooms bestow the player with a Bee, Boo, or Spring Suit. The Bee Suit allows Mario to temporarily hover through the air, climb special walls, and walk on clouds and flowers; the Boo Suit allows him to float through the air, as well as become transparent and move through certain obstacles; and the Spring Suit allows him to jump to high areas that would otherwise be inaccessible. The Fire Flower, which allows Mario to throw fireballs, makes its 3D debut, and the Ice Flower lets Mario create hexagonal tiles of ice to cover any liquid surface he walks on and allows him to skate across water and lava. The Rainbow Star grants Mario invincibility, allowing him to destroy any enemies that he touches, jump higher and run faster. The Red Star, which is an optional power-up only accessible after completing a certain mission, allows him to fly. Mario's health consists of a three-piece power meter, which is depleted by contact with enemies and hazards. When swimming underwater, Mario has an air supply meter, which quickly depletes his main power meter if it runs out. Mario's health can be restored by collecting coins and his air supply by touching bubbles or coins. When the power meter becomes empty, the player loses a life and must go back to a predetermined checkpoint. The power meter can be temporarily expanded to six units through the use of a Life Mushroom, with the maximum health returning to three units if the overall health falls to three units from enemy or hazard contact or if Mario suffers instant death. Instant death can occur by being swallowed by quicksand or dark matter; falling into bottomless pits, which either consist of black holes or leaving a planet's gravitational pull and falling into space; getting crushed between objects; losing a race against a non-player character; or other special challenges. The player can obtain extra lives by collecting 1-Up Mushrooms, 50 Coins without losing a life, or 50 Star Bits. Blue Hungry Lumas (known as &#34;Luma Shops&#34;) can also exchange 30 Star Bits for a 1-Up Mushroom or Life Mushroom in certain galaxies, usually before battling a boss.Music: The music is really good while providing new tunes it also reuses some familiar tracks from Super Mario 64.Story 5/5 Gameplay 4.5/5 Music 5/5 Overall 9.5/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2014"}

Easily one of the best games of its  genre on any video game console, this long-awaited follow-up toGoldenEye 007is a must-have for Nintendo 64 owners--and a damn  good reason to be one if you're not.The futuristicPerfect Darkcasts players as Joanna Dark, a  secret agent who becomes embroiled in a sinister conspiracy involving  aliens and an evil corporation. Gameplay is broken down into missions,  each with objectives that must be unerringly completed before  progressing to the next mission. This is not your typical kill-anything-that-moves  game: putting a bullet in the wrong person, not keeping the  right one alive, or perforating a seemingly unimportant inanimate object  can often result in mission failure.WhilePerfect Dark's solo missions play out much like those inGoldenEye 007, the game's fantastic multiplayer options are  another matter entirely. Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy. However, the real fun here is in  the highly customizable Combat Simulator, a one-to-four-player  simultaneous-play mode that features both free-for-alls and team-based  challenges and can include up to eight Simulants, computer-controlled  combatants of varying behavior.Although Simulants make for decent adversaries or teammates, you'll want  to grab a friend--and an Expansion Pak, as only 35 percent of the game  is available without one--to fully enjoyPerfect Dark.--Joe  HonPros:One of the best first-person shooters on any video game consoleOutstanding multiplayer game with huge replay valueBevy of game options, cheats, and secret featuresExcellent training mode with challenges all of its ownCons:Graphics get ugly when playing with more than two players","reviewerName":"nemesis","summary":"awe filled","reviewText":"Perfect Dark is a simply amazing game. I know... I'm writing this almost 5 years after the game came out, But I assure you i beat the game years ago. I was rummaging through some old games several hours ago when I rediscovered this gem. To think, I had almost forgotten how good this game was. Sure, compared to Games like Doom3, Half-Life 2, Halo 2, and Golden Eye Rouge Agent, this game has horrable graphics, but this is very easily overlooked. The story is engrossing, the weapons are fantasic, and the multiplayer is the best thing since online play. The controls take some getting used to (I've been spoiled by these controlers with two thumb sticks lol), and the N64 controls are a little too sensitive for this game (corrected by some auto-aiming functions), but you will get over this. The guy before me (who wrote his review 4 years ago...) isn't entirely right. Is the game difficult? yes. Is it impossible? no. I beat the whole thing on medium difficulty and got half way through hard before finially retiring the game (I hope to one day beat the whole game on hard though). The game will actually require you to practice if you want to beat those higher difficulties (thats why there are tons of training ops, and a combat simulator), and you will have to try missions over. The game is not nearly as hard as you may be led to believe (If you want it to be though, the game can be set on some insainly hard difficulties... we're talking about so difficult, that they could be concived as a cruel joke rather than a difficulty level... but thats only if you want to set the game this high.) The game offers so much variety, you will hardly get bored with single player, and enough customization options for multiplayer, that it rivals most modern games (which is pretty sad). From stealth, to hostage rescue, to defense, to assault, to reconance, to assassination, to infiltration, there are so many things you will do in single player. I some how get a feeling that this review will never be read, but if by some chance your wandering eyes glance over this review, and you are still the proud owner of an N64 with and expansion pack, then believe me when I say that if you find this one, you can't afford to not pick it up. This remains one of my all-time favorite games... don't miss it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall.

Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality.

{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","reviewerName":"Flea Returns: FF13","summary":"One of the better stories and character combinations in all of video games","reviewText":"The Last of Us is one of those games that I took a chance on. It's not normally in my wheelhouse of games I typically enjoy so it kind of went in with a strike already against it. Nonetheless, this game is unlike any game I have ever played. It grabs you from the start and simply refuses to let go. As always, this review will be split into three categories: Story, characters, and gameplay with story getting the most weight.Story: 10/10Simply, this story is just amazing. It's a story of a wounded man taking a young 14 year old girl across the country as a favor to a friend in a post-apocalyptic world that has been taken over by zombies. The man has some serious baggage and is simply not the best or easiest person to be around. But the girl endures and slowly their characters grow and change as they journey together.This story is extremely well written. It plays like a big budget film almost. And that's not a bad thing. The writing in this story and the details are just superb. The prologue is one of the better beginnings of a game that I have ever experienced. Simply it's well written. You are in a post apocalyptic world that has been ravaged by a fungus that changes people into zombies. You play as and interact with characters that have lost everything. The game continually reminds you, this is not a pleasant place anymore. It sprinkles in light hearted moments where for a few minutes you start to laugh or start thinking everything is going to be ok then it harshly reminds you, NO this is a world that has fallen apart...and there is no happy ending. The ending ends well and really provokes feelings to the player that few video games can do.Characters: 10/10As well as the story is written, the characters are equally well done. Joel is a deeply damaged man that has had his entire world ripped from him. He has lived a life of surviving and has paid the toll since the outbreak. Ellie is a typical young 14 year old girl but instead has been raised in a society that is in chaos. Whether you are defending yourself from infected zombies or humans that have turned on other humans to survive, these characters live in a unique world. The writers did a great job of letting you get attached to these characters but then harshly reminding you that they are damaged and they have their flaws. As the journey proceeds, you watch as Joel grows from a harsh, deeply damaged man with a ton of baggage to a man who accepts his past as his past and tries to move on and do the right thing. Ellie goes from the typical 14 year old naive little girl to an adult in a 14 year old's body.  The weaknesses of each character play off each other wonderfully. I simply have not seen character development or dialogue like this in any video game ever.Gameplay: 8/10If there is a weakness for me to this game it's the gameplay. But nonetheless, it is still a great gameplay. First the good. The detail in this gameplay is beyond spectacular. From upgrading your character with more health, or with less weapon sway, to collecting parts and upgrading your weapons. I thought overall the upgrading your character and weapons part of the game could have been better but just the fact that they included those elements really enriched the game. Probably the best part of the gameplay though was finding materials and crafting supplies like first aide kits and molotov cocktails. This really enriched the feeling that you are in a ravaged world and scraps of fabric can be the difference between life and death. The combat was also stellar. I loved the stealth feature that the game almost forced you to take in some areas. Sneaking around and shivving zombies in the neck and being able to take out an entire room full without being seen was awesome.Now, I'm probably a little more critical of the gameplay for this type of game (combat/shooter/adventure) than I normally would be as this is really not the type of games I normally enjoy. So keep that in mind. There really wasn't anything HUGE about the gameplay that detracted but there were several little things. For instance like the upgrading you character's abilities and your weapons. Those features were great but I felt there should have been more to them. Learning new combat moves, being able to make attachments for your weapons are just some examples that could have really enriched this part of the game. The load times when booting this game up were horrendous. HORRENDOUS. I also thought it would have been a nice touch if they could have added a few choices into the gameplay and story. I know that they had a story to tell and I wouldn't want it to have alternate endings or anything, but I really thought it would have been a good idea to give Joel options from time to time in what to say to help the player make Joel a little more or less personable depending on how the player wanted him to be. And I guess my biggest complaint about the gameplay were the collectibles. They were a nice touch but really served little purpose. Some of the notes were interesting and even sparked some dialogue between Joel and Ellie which was a nice touch. But really, other than trophy completion, the collectibles served little purpose.Overall 9.5/10Overall, this game is just fantastic. The story and the characters are some of the best written in all of video games. The characters were human in the most basic sense of the term and the story was a stark reminder of what humanity can be in it's darkest hour. The gameplay could have been sharpened a bit but it's hardly enough to detract from the utter brilliance of this game. If you enjoy a good story, and good characters, then really there is no reason to not play this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2014"}
{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","reviewerName":"JackLiberty \"Steven Smith Jr.\"","summary":"The Best PS3 Exclusive Ever, Even better than Uncharted 2","reviewText":"The Last of Us had instantly made Naughty Dog one of the greatest and most respected video game developers in the world. Ever since the first Crash Bandicoot game was released back in 1996, they haven&#8217;t had one bad game yet in their name. The Last of Us is no exception, it is simply a masterpiece.The player takes control of Joel who is living in a post-apocalyptic United States in the year 2033. He then has to escort a young girl by the name of Ellie to a resistance group called the &#8216;Fireflies&#8217; who they believe may be the key to finding a cure for the infection that has ravaged the world. The player must defend themselves against zombie-like creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. Apart from zombies; you also have to fight against armed hostile humans such as bandits and cannibals.The game uses a third person perspective similar to games like Resident Evil 4. You control Joel while Ellie is controlled by the AI. The combat is very well detailed and feels fluent and perfectly responsive. There is gun fighting, melee combat and a cover system that works perfectly. There are two ways to eliminate your targets, you can go smart by quietly sneaking up to enemies by choking them or stabbing them in the neck. The other tactic is to go loud and dumb by using your scarce ammo against them. The choice is yours, but sometimes you&#8217;ll have no choice to use either one of these tactics. The most innovative feature is you can find out where enemies are by hearing their sound. Since there&#8217;s no way for an actual TV to pinpoint the exact direction of where sound is coming from within the game, The Last of Us made an ingenious idea because in real life, you&#8217;d be able to tell which direction a footstep or voices are coming from.As you proceed with the game, you receive more weapons and items. Items include things from simple pistols, to more advanced weapons such as a bolt action rifle, shotguns, bows, flamethrowers and assault rifles. You can also use melee weapons that you can find throughout the environment such as metal pipes, planks, baseball bats, machetes and hatchets. These however will break after repeated use so it&#8217;s wise to use them sparingly. You can also pick up empty bottles and bricks off the ground and throw them which can be used to distract enemies so you can sneak by them, plan a sneak attack or they can be used as a simple melee weapon. This game requires both skill and brains.You also have a crafting system. You can create items by combining various other items you find along your journey. These ranges from first aid kits, Molotov cocktails, nail bombs and smoke bombs. You can even attach scissors to melee weapons to make them more powerful, but they won&#8217;t last forever. The idea is to plan each move carefully. Another thing about the crafting system is that using the system is based on real time, meaning that the game does not pause while crafting. So plan your decisions well or you leave yourself vulnerable to enemy attack.The player is also able to collect toolboxes and parts to help upgrade their weapons which again is similar to Resident Evil 4.Things you can improve are the number of weapons you can carry without going into your backpack to change them, the weapons fire rate, clip capacity, power, range and you can reduce the recoil. You also find training manuals along the way to increase your weapons even more so. These improvements include the durability of knives, the radius of Molotov&#8217;s and Nail Bombs and so on. You also find pills and plants along the journey which increase your maximum health, crafting speed, healing speed and so on.There are periods in the game where there is no fighting when everything is calm and the player can engage in conversations with other friendly characters. You can discuss the current situation with Ellie and she can even tell jokes.This game also has a bit of strategy in it where you&#8217;ll need to give Ellie boosts up to platforms you can&#8217;t reach. Ellie will then unlock doors from the other side, drop down ladders and so on. Unfortunately Ellie can&#8217;t swim so in order to get her across the water; you&#8217;ll need to find floatable planks to get her across.The story is also very well detailed and emotional. I won&#8217;t spoil anything though, you&#8217;ll have to play the game yourself if you want to know more about it. I will say Ellie is an awesome character. She isn&#8217;t like Ashley from Resident Evil 4 who couldn&#8217;t defend herself. Ellie is eventually given a gun and is very good at defending herself, even against big enemies and grown adults. She is just awesome.Is there anything I don&#8217;t like about it? Well there is this one glitch (which I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s been addressed yet) when you are running from a tank, the camera just moves out of control making that part of the game unplayable. Fortunately if you die, the camera is fixed. I also don&#8217;t like that this game isn&#8217;t as scary as other horror games like Silent Hill or Resident Evil. My biggest complaint is that you have checkpoints in the game which doesn&#8217;t make the game challenging or scary. In the original Resident Evil on PlayStation, if you die, you have to start over from where you last saved. But you were limited to how many times you can save so it made you more cautious when playing the game. But in The Last of Us, you aren&#8217;t really that cautious because the consequences of dying aren&#8217;t severe. My final complaint is the game doesn&#8217;t come with an instruction manual. It only comes with an online pass code that can only be used once and two Naughty Dog stickers. But some people claim that they didn&#8217;t receive stickers with their game, but I did though, I even put one of the stickers on the back of my laptop. The manual is built in the game itself, but the downside is that you have to leave the game completely and select the manual from the PS3 main menu. I hate games that do that, people who don&#8217;t make instruction manuals are just frickin&#8217; lazy and slackers.In conclusion, The Last of Us isn&#8217;t that scary, but it has awesome gameplay elements and a deep storyline that is well worthy of praise. I can honestly say that The Last of Us is the greatest PlayStation 3 exclusive I have ever played. This is a must play for any gamer, especially fans of survival horror which the current generation was lacking. The Last of Us is probably the greatest survival horror game of the seventh generation of video games and this will go down as a classic as more new consoles are released.FINAL RATING: 10 OUT OF 10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00009YEK6","description":"Kick your adrenaline into high gear as you waste opponents with your brutal Judo and Kick Boxing mastery. Sega's best-selling, 3D, fighting series has evolved into a freight train of hardcore martial-arts maneuvers featuring 15 competitors, some of whom can switch up their fighting style mid-fight. The new characters vying for a shot at winning the Worldwide Martial Arts Championship II Tournament are a trained assassin named Goh and Brad, an Italian Muay Thai champion Kick Boxer. They've joined the elite team to kick some serious butt on gorgeous new stages amidst snow, rain, sand, and beyond. There are over 1,500 options for customizing your characters' clothing and hairstyle, etc., so dress them up and watch them whittle through the competition. Once you make a name for yourself through a series of simulated arcade tournaments in the brand new Quest Mode, you'll qualify for the biggest fight of your career and show the world what you're really made of.Features:All 15 characters (two new) have their own brand of whoop ass with unique attacks, counters, and defense movesNewly optimized graphics for the PlayStation 2 eliminate jaggies and shimmerNew Quest Mode: hurl the hurt through several tournaments to become the world championTwice as many character customizing options as beforeThe aggressive A.I. opponents are modeled after the top players from the arcades of Japan","reviewerName":"flaviolius","summary":"Do The Evolution","reviewText":"When Sega-AM2 released Virtua Fighter 4 last year, many thought it the best 3D fighter in existence - Soul Calibur's equal, at the very least.  VF4 went on to become a PS2 Greatest Hits title.  Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution - also released as a GH - isn't so much a sequel, but rather a finely tuned, improved VF4 upgrade that is more than worth purchasing even if you've already played the original extensively.Cosmetically, the menus and soundtrack have changed, the importance of which is a matter of debate.  Less debatable is the fact that the game's graphics have been greatly improved.  The infamous \"jaggies\" have been all but eliminated, and certain arenas have been changed slightly.  The character models, which already sported some of the best animation in a modern fighter, have become even more fluid.  VF4: Evo seems to flow much better visually as a result - although the original certainly was no slouch.Two new characters have been added:  Goh, a Japanese judo master who looks like a goth reject, and Brad Burns, an Italian thrillseeker who specializes in kickboxing.  Both fit well into the VF universe, and each add a new layer of challenge to the gameplay.The biggest addition to Evo is Quest Mode.  This replaces Kumite Mode from last year's game, which was extremely addictive, but the difficulty quickly ramped up to the outer atmosphere.  Quest is basically a virtual tour of Japanese arcades.  You choose an arcade, perform qualifying events, and then enter into a tournament against AI characters based upon actual Japanese competitors.  Quest also offers distinct challenges aimed toward making you a better VF player, such as \"Escape five throws during a match\" or \"Use six down attacks\", etc.  As in Kumite, you gain cosmetic items to customize your fighter, and rise in rank as you succeed.  There are over 1500 specific items to use, ranging from clothing and jewelry to hair and eye color (which fade over time).  Some of the items are simply outrageous, and well worth the effort it takes to obtain them.  One slight disappointment is you cannot import a friend's customized fighter into your game, as in the original VF4, but the expanded item list is an attempt to make up for this.Training Mode is as complete as before, with the inclusion of replay matches between top-ranked real players, showing how the best use each character during tournaments - you can even slow matches down to frame-by-frame to study moves closely.  This mode itself can give anyone the tools needed to progress, and become a formidable player if so inclined.  You cannot create your own AI player as in the original VF4, but the expansions to Training Mode are more worthwhile and practical in the long run.The best thing about VF4:Evo is despite its \"evolutionary\" title, the brilliant gameplay remains largely unchanged.  A few characters have a couple of new moves, but even with the two new faces, the game's balance is as perfect as one could hope for.  VF4:Evo is the kind of game that satisfies on many levels, and rewards based upon the effort you put into it.  Its single-player game is incredibly deep and almost infinitely replayable, and holds a vast resource of information enabling you learn the intricate nature of arguably the best fighting-game engine to date.At a glance, it may seem like Sega is trying to cash in on the success of VF4, but Evo is a much improved and different game in many ways.  It could have been released at a higher price and still been worth it, but as a Greatest Hits title, VF4:Evo is one of the best deals you'll find anywhere.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2003"}

Now, us Nintendo 3DS owners have something to be excited about as Star Fox 64 3D is finally out for the system. To those of you new to the series or those that know of the series but have forgotten what it is about, the game centers around Fox McCloud and, with the help of his crew, he shoots his way through a series of levels to save the Lylat System from the evil Andross. Just like in the original game years ago, Star Fox 64 3D provides hours of challenging gaming as you pilot his Arwing across level after level.Like Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D before it, Star Fox 64 3D improves upon the original in many ways. First and foremost, graphically. The game looks absolutely gorgeous with plenty of detail. The game, itself, benefits from  the stereoscopic 3D of the Nintendo 3DS. I will say this game will help many make a decision on whether to get a N3DS or not. It's about the best example to date to showcase everything about the system. Everything looks phenomenal.Multiplayer is the only downside to things. This game doesn't support online play and that's a real bummer for those of who wanted that. It would've been nice to play against my friends with this game.Still, Star Fox 64 3D is as excellent as it was 14 years ago. Even though I played it back then, it wasn't until this version that I actually took an interest in the series, moreso, as a whole. One thing I've learned from playing this version of Star Fox 64 is that it's perfect for portable gaming. I'm pretty sure that others will agree with me on that respect.On a smaller note, playing this game makes me wish developers who made games for the N64 would remake them for this new system. Quake, Excitebike 64, Extreme-G, Space Station Silicon Valley, Wave Race and Pokemon Snap would benefit greatly with remakes on the system. Especially with AR incorporated into some of those games. I know I say it alot in my reviews that they ought to bring out certain games for the system but it is true. So, developers out there that are reading....please bring those classics out for us.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2011"}

The Soviets, for example, have armored attack bears, Allies have the Dolphin ship which can high jump and use a sonic attack, and the Empire of the Rising Sun features such quirky units as a giant transforming mecha and ninjas.

I'm a big fan of games from the 90's.  So being able to download NES,SNES, & Genesis games is awesome.  Although they need to increase the library, it's not very expansive.  But I hear they're going to be adding Chrono Trigger in 2011! :-D*Netflix.  Being able to stream movies through the Wii to the TV is great!  The picture quality is a lot better than i would have expected.  It looks flawless to me.  (BTW..I do own a PS3 ...and the picture quality & main page Layout are inferior compared to Wii)*Exclusive Titles.  I know PS3 & 360 outdue the wii by far with their variety of games.  But like i said before, i love the 90's games....so to be able to play games like Mario Galaxy, DKC Returns, kirby, ect is great.Glad i purchased the system.  My only complaint really is that the Virtual Console needs a lot more titles.  They're missing out on some easy revenue by keeping it limited to where it's at.  They'd bring in TONS of dough by releasing Earthbound alone!  Cmon nintnendo!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"W. Newberry \"agent_47\"","summary":"MASTERPIECE!","reviewText":"A franchise is born and its name is Bioshock! Games like this don't come along too often. At heart its a FPS ,but the added 'Bio' powers make this game truly shine. The first stage of the game is Linear somewhat a training session , then the levels open up into multiple pathways and areas to explore. There is a detective quality to this game if you wanna follow the story through audio diaries,PSA's, and generous bloody scribbles on the walls,or you can ignore them and simply kill everything in your way. This game gives you that option. But IMO the story makes this game top-notch , yeah sure its typical creepy fare, but hey its fun. With certain abilities (LT) you can set people on fire with your fingertips,use telekenesis ,and some others I won't spoil. Not to mention 2 endings worth a replay through or 2.There's not much I can say negative about this game other than it's about 20 hours long. Too short for my taste but its a rock solid 20 hours of fantastic gameplay. Aside from the widescreen fiasco , its in 16x9 widescreen at native 720p no stretching by the way. The games look beautiful and the camera is fully controllable like most FPS so for my HD LCDTV its looks fantastic .Im looking forward to Bioshock becoming a franchise with at least a sequel coming for it. This game is one heck of a joy-ride ,movie-like game experience. One that should not be missed. M rated lots of blood and gore not for the kiddies.

The twist at the opening is a touch hard to swallow, but at least they cover all the glaring plot holes, and it helps that you don't have to deal with the main character speaking with a hard to understand accent or using esoteric terminology. Which is extra good considering there are no subtitles. The storyline is straightforwad in the Assassins role. You fail to eliminate Sir Robert, a Kinghts Templar, while simulataneously failing to complete a vital mission.Your mission is saved by a fellow assassin, and you are demoted to Novice. To regain your standing, you must elimiate 9 men who're exacerbating the Crusades. Every one seems to be a monster... at first. While many have excuses and reasons that're glazes on something foul and inexcusable, some will manage to slither under your skin as to whether they were truly evil. The butcher doctor, who manages to save some while killing others, in the cause of advancing medical science so he can help all. The slaver, who captures some slaves solely in order that they may have food and shelter.Visuals/Audio: This is where they make their bank. The landscape is photorealistic in many places, and breathtakingly gorgeous. The houses are well done to the period and locations, as are the people. Motions and movements and realistic, which is much, much harder to do well than it sounds. The audio has some tiny drawbacks, mainly making it hard to hear voices over the background jumble.Gameplay: Combat is great, and well thought out. While it is somewhat repetitive, the basic enemies can put you down very quickly if your not careful. Some aspects are well done, if annoying. Walking through crowds can draw attention if you jostle too many people, and beggars will block your path constantly in poorer areas. One just annoying fact that they should've caught is some NPC's have an almost magnetic connection to you. The town crazies will constantly shove you, ignoring everyone else, unless you give them a wide berth, and the moment you're shoved you're exposed. But thats one drawback among an otherwise brilliantly put together setup.Sidequests are somewhat more annoying. The ones in the city are rinse and repeat. Save the citizen by killing 4 guards, pickpocket, eavesdrop, and interrogate sum them up in their entirety. A bit more variety breaking it up would've masked it perfectly. The assassinations themselves are challenging and very engaging. The extra sidequests are as bad if not worse. Find the flags and find the templars. While those sound plausible, and they are for the templars, considering they're much harder fights, the flags are infuriating. You'd think flags would be on buildings and with army encampments, and for the most part they are, but many are also hidden in high grass, down blind alleys, and in the middle of forests. I can not see how those quests can be completed without guides.Overall: The quests are the only reason this isn't 5 stars. It wouldn't have taken much thought, and little addiitional effort to come up with additional ideas. Aside from that one stain, this game is gorgeous and engaging. Despite how it might make you grind your teeth sometimes, it is one of those ones where you'll find yourself going \"Just one more flag.... Is it really 4 am?\" Even in retrospect, its worth the $[...] price tag.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2007"}

Wiles Parker","summary":"Awesome Open World Play","reviewText":"I don't quite get the \"repetive\" argument on this game because the open world gameplay makes it so that you can decide which things to do outside of the basics.  My guess is that the complainers just keep doing the main missions.But moving on.  The story is really different because you're essentially playing your \"ancestor\" with the occasional cut scene into the real world to ground things and differentiate between segments.  And there's a few things to do now and then like figure out what the people are really trying to get at while you're playing as your ancestorAs for the majority of the gameplay = awesome!  I love the free roam ability and how the character can get up and around.  Learning new abilities along the way is really helpful because then you don't get thrown into all of it at once even though it would be nice now and then to have a full arsenal of abilities like at the start, but that would make the game/story less interesting.The graphics are fun and feel authentic.  The ability to access the map and set coordinates is immensely helpful, especially when on the run from the bad guys.  And that's where the real challenge comes in because you can't always hide and have to fight your way out until finally getting to the right destination or finding the right objective.  Some of the battles are a little tricky and the controls don't always seem to work as you think, but it just adds to the fun of running around and taking out targets and Crusaders.Overall, a really solid game for anyone who doesn't like cut and dried storylines or go straight, jump, fight someone, go straight gaming.  A fantastic beginning entry into open world gaming.  Can't wait to get my hands on further games in the series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2010"}

I did enjoy Oblivion, so I thought I'd share my thoughts on Fallout 3 GOTY after playing it on the Xbox 360.The GOTY comes with several expansion packs. Operation Anchorage is worth playing because it gives you a special Winterized T-51b power armor and helmet that never needs to be repaired (and it is about the most powerful armor in the game), along with a Gauss Rifle that wears out but can't be repaired to 100% since there doesn't seem to be any other Gauss Rifles in the game. However, that is where Mothership Zeta comes into play. There is plenty of Alien Epoxy throughout the ship which can be used to repair the Gauss Rifle if you like that weapon.  The Pitt and Point Lookout weren't that great and quite frankly I thought they were a waste of time. Some of the perks are worth earning from the expansion packs. Broken Steel is essentially a continuation of the original story, with a level cap of 30 and new perks.There are several features of this game that stand out. The stats are sectioned and can be confusing at first. The SPECIAL attributes are important. Intelligence and Strength are very important at first, followed by Perception and Endurance. Don't max out any of these to 10, but try to stay above 6-7. Skills are modified after each level increase, make sure you get the Swift Learner perks (3 ranks available) to get a max of 23 skill points each time you level up.  Perks are available after each level increase and give you special bonuses.Bobbleheads are available to boost your SPECIAL stats and skills, so it is important to not max out your SPECIAL stats or skills early. Skill books are also available to increase your skills, so get the Comprehension perk early on.The game was extremely frustrating at first, until I got to about level 7. Then with some strategy, it was easier to survive and somewhat fun. At level 15, my character was able to kill enemies with ease. At level 20, my character is an absolute machine. I can lay waste to enemies with the greatest of ease, and my perks from the expansion packs almost makes him impervious to radiation poisoning and damage. The unique weapons are the items that you should try to find and use. They are special variants of common weapons with more damage, but can be repaired using the common weapons. The A3-21 Plasma Rifle, Xualon Assault Rifle, and Vengeance are just a few of these examples.This game is very very time consuming. There are a lot of mini quests to complete, and a lot of things to do. Most of the time is spent going from location to location, exploring, and role-playing game activities in general. Remember to save and save often, because I've had the game lock up on me about half a dozen times on Xbox 360.Overall: 5/5 stars, the best way to enjoy Fallout 3 is with the GOTY edition. Operation Anchorage, and Mothership Zeta have some very useful items.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2012"}

Supposedly your Pip-Boy 3000 has a built-in flashlight, but I wasn't able to find it or figure out how to turn it on- Plot was okay...but not great- There wasn't a whole lot of attachment to the characters...no buy-in factor on the emotional level (i.e. if someone dies, it doesn't really effect you at all)- There is a LOT of back and forth walking around, even when you fast-travel from place to placeAll-in-all, I don't regret buying the game as it has provided at least 45 hours of entertainment (and I don't even have 1/2 of the achievements, yet), but I still prefer the Mass Effect series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2011"}

It is your job to recreate stars (and some of the major constellations) to repopulate the sky.Sounds pretty unique, but it is the gameplay that gets you.  You push a \"katamari\" (Japanese for ball) around, and it picks up items that are smaller than it.

Need for Speed Hot Pursuit was one of my favorites because of the police pursuits.  Carbon takes that element to the next level.  Now this game features several unique features which make this game special.The storyline is rather unique and gives you a personality.  You are a character that you never talk or have a face.  It would have been nice if they allowed players to personalize that aspect more.  This game is not overly challenging and features well designed courses.  There are various race types that if one doesn't challenge you enough another will.  I seem to do pretty well it just about every race style.  Except for drift racing which is very challenging and requires great timing.  This game adds a new aspect called a wingman.  This character will help you in just about every race.  Whether it be to block another race or bring home first place.  As you progress in the game you can personalize your vehicles more and also earn newer faster vehicles.  That is not only important for career racing mode but also online play.  As I have noticed the competition out there is excellent.  The game also has added a card collecting goal.  This game gets you rewards for collecting four cards in each category.  The physics of this game is excellent and the speed is furious.  You really feel the speed of the cars out there are quickly understand the capabilities of the car you are driving.When it comes to graphics the 360 comes in first at least with this game.  The graphics are a little darker and muddier than its Microsoft predecessor.  Although that being said the graphics are still excellent.  By far these games continue to shine in creating beautiful environments.  The entire game takes place at night which may be a little disorienting to some.Overall I love this game.  From the great storyline to the music that seems to fit every environment perfectly.

I actually felt a little ripped-off because I never got the chance to play it before.  The cut-scenes are at a much higher resolution than the Chains of Olympus scenes.  The gameplay is great and I really enjoyed the final battle scenes.  It's hard to believe it began as a portable game.  There is no question that Ghost of Sparta is the better of the two games in terms of visuals, gameplay and story.Complaints would be that both games have some unskippable cut-scenes and sometimes if you die you have to watch the entire scene again before you can get another chance in the battle.If you consider yourself a fan of the God of War franchise and Kratos, you should definitely play these games!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2011"}

Well it is still awesome, but I was hoping a little more of something.  If you like the Tekken fighting controls, it is still there, and it is still tight.  They actually force you to play the Scenario/story mode which is pretty much Tekken Force in the past.  This is the only way you can unlock characters' ending animations.  Also another way of getting free custom upgrades.  Arcade mode is open to all characters and so is the online match.  As always the female characters are easy to pick up since they are so quick.  The big wrestlers are so slow and the power damages are about the same with the quicker characters, so there is a little unbalance there.Performance:The characters are very impressive, but the anti-aliasing jaggy edge is there.  This is one reason I knocked a star off.  Soul Caliber 4 was the smoothest looking models and characters I have seen and it came out a year before this and I also got that on the PS3. (Oddly when I turn off the motion blur option it were less jaggedness, but less cool effects)  The only thing I notice, the difference between the two is the background in Tekken 6 is more dynamic.  Things break apart, more animation in the background.  The snow, fog, sunlight and other environmental effects/ physic are cooler, compare to the plain and smooth SC4.  I haven't notice any major glitches at all.  The fighting is till fast.Online:The waiting is a tag longer compare to SC4, but I think they load everything more so I haven't experience any freezing, lagging or glitches like I did for SC4.  So basically it is a better has an online performance when you are actually fighting.CharactersI usually stick to Jin style, which Lars is a strong punching character too.  I have got a hang of Bob yet, kind of power of a faster Panda and quick leg combos.  Zafina is a like a hybrid of voldo and Anna W a little off balance style.  Haven't touch Miguel or Leo that much yet.  You can customized your characters by buying items and from the scenario mode (Tekken force), but you can't build a characters ground up like in SC4 which I thought was lacking.Overall for Tekken fan this is a worthy buy and shows enough special effects in the graphic department over Tekken 5.  The Tekken force controls and mode is much better this time around and is intergraded into the gameplay if you want to unlock something.  I wished Tekken bowling, or volleyball and even Gon was somehow brought back but didn't.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2009"}

Let's start it here.You're a stuntman. You get to follow orders from a director who demands you do some of the most stupidly rigorous tasks to complete stunts. Some of the stunts are cool, but the game gets hard at about the 4th level. The first movie you shoot is like a tutorial. I rented this game, and never beat it. The first level of the first real movie in which your basically like dukes of hazards is tremendously hard. You have to do things in split seconds, and the game is so hard that it is frustrating. The game has no good points that I can think of. On one of the first missions I didn't barrel roll and I still won it. Another time I was suppose to hit a  board and spin sideways near a garbage can, I barely did it and I won.But once you get to the dukes of hazards type movie, no. It's ridiculously stupid. There are cooling towers in random places falling on your car. Then you have to jump through a train at the start which is kinda luck. Anyways, the game could of gotten things right. For one, the game is fun when your not all stuntman. Right after you jump over a house, you get to cruise for like 30 seconds, which is fun considering the environment looks good. The game though doesn't lay out maps for you and doesn't give you any help. The director almost wants to make this thing as hard as possible because he never edits the movies(like normal directors and stunt coordinators do) and he never attempts to tell you where to go beforehand. You will be flipping left and right going up and down with no sence of direction. One second costs you the match...The game is terrible. There are some extras. Trailers or some crap. The map editor is terrible. You can put about 5 items in and that is it. I never figured out mechanical cars(I just decided to use cheats to unlock the editor stuff) and I never found out if there were any extra maps to unlock in the campaign. But this game offers nothing except frustration and crap. Honestly, I would like to see the creators beat their own game. If they could do that it would be great, beacause not many people can.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2003"}

You can be a warrior, scout or mage, adventuring and slaying enemies. You customize the color of your clothes, and you're off.Gameplay involves wading into a lot of enemy groups and button mashing. You can get chains of short or wide attacks going, and the animations are pretty smooth of the dancing swords. As you gain points, you level up, choosing to build your strength, health, magic power, or whatever else you wish to focus on. You also gather items to get better weapons, armor or magical boosts. You save at set shrines along the path.The graphics are rather impressive. The game goes for a cartooney yet realistic look. The game is rather obviously made with polygons, and sometimes the characters can look a bit \"angular\". The grasses wave as little \"grass units\" and the rocks look a little blocky. Still the overall impression is quite a nice one.It's really interesting how they designed some aspects of the landscape. For example, take a pool of water. It could be mirror smooth when you first see it. Have a fight in it, and soon it is sloshing as if a giant thunderstorm were hitting an ocean. Stand by it for a few minutes, though, and the water ripples begin to calm down slowly, bringing it back to a state of calm.The cut scenes are a mixed bag. Most of the cut scenes \"use\" regular characters for movement. That is, they aren't \"better\" animated cut scenes - they use the exact same graphics as the regular gameplay does. A few other cut scenes are done in a more brown-impressionist style.The sound? Well, really it's just slash-slash-slash-hiyaaah! The voice actors aren't great, but they aren't awful either. Sometimes the dialogue is rather silly, but that's not the actors faults. The Carmina Burana style background music can get a bit ponderous. I normally like that type of music, too!There's online gameplay where groups of up to 4 players can take on a given level, playing at a common difficulty level and slaying enemies together. This can be a fun way to explore the maps at a much more difficult level than you could normally take on by yourself.This isn't a huge, uber-complex RPG like Oblivion. It's more of a casual hack and slash a la Diablo. There isn't complex storytelling here. Your commander barely needs a few rumors to spur him into rebelling against his King. Lots of enemies seem to live in trees, to drop on your head.All in all, this is a fun, casual RPG that you can pick up for a few hours, play through an area, then put down again to do something else. It doesn't boast cutting edge graphics, but it's plenty fun to hack and slash your way through a few demons and make some progress.Well recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2011"}

All I can say is this game is just like the old ones, toned down in difficulty though. I really enjoy how they did not mess the game up I was kind of like I bet they will do something to destroy it. That is not the case here its the same play style and weird movments as the old ones and that to me is great because now days all games are about is graphics and new ways to play games. Twisted Metal came back from a 10 year break and has done a great job for all the fans. The online MP is sick you can really destroy kids who obviously never played the game before which is very satisfying. I however thought the campaign needed more although it was VERY FUN, I just wish it had more levels or just more characters to tell the stories because that is what made black so much fun as well as the previous games.Get the game if you ever played TM and enjoyed it, because its all the same as before with a few minor flaws. I give it a max score because I am a fan of the game and I am not as picky as others. Only one complaint is that vehicles get stuck sometimes more noticeably with the juggernaut semi but I think that is because the developers did not work out the kinks for that or something because I get stuck  A LOT.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2012"}

They face new enemies and make new friends in worlds they've never set foot in. If they successfully unlock seven Sleeping Keyholes and return to their own world, they will retrieve a great power and be deemed true Keyblade Masters.While I loved the last three portable Kingdom Heart games, I was really stoked about this game. Why? Well, as much as I loved those games, I was disappointed in the fact that they mostly took me back to worlds I'd already been to sometime before. With this game, however, there were new worlds to explore that I couldn't wait to get to(namely the Tron: Legacy world). Not only that KH3D introduced new play mechanics into the series, the Flowmotion combat(which allows players to utilize the environment to dodge enemies as well as execute special attacks) & the Drop system(which makes you switch between Sora and Riku's separate yet overlapping storylines after a certain amount of playtime has passed). This new system proves to be a welcome addition to the series. The Command Deck system(most of you know)from Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep makes a welcome return in this game, it allows players to collect and equip different abilities for easy access in battle.Hate to admit it, folks, but I believe this has to be my most favorite game of all out of the series. As always, the game looks absolutely stunning(but now in 3D). Course, the game still suffers from problems that plagued it in past games; such as a faulty camera, controlling how your character moves and, as always, the narrative(story) being confusing at times. Despite those quibbles, KH3D is still quite fun and enjoyable. The game meets, if not surpasses, the quality of the console games and everything that has come before it.Now, Square-Enix, bring on the next console entry before the PS3 gets too old, okay? Fans will appreciate it and you'll be glad you did for us($$$). ;)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2012"}

You don't have to worry about that with KH:3D because it fills you in and brings you up to speed from past to present. If you aren't a fan of Kingdom Hearts games, you might not like this (because its Kingdom Hearts), but if you are open to the adventure in a more portable form, give it a whirl. Its not like the DS versions where cut scenes were still images, there are cut scenes... just consider the adventure being continued from KH:2 on the PS2, along with some very cool additions.What additions you ask? Well, there is the obvious addition of 3D (which has a beautifully amazing intro, you have to see it), but there is the added element of Dream Eaters as well. I didn't know what role the dream eaters would play in the game, until I played the demo (there is a demo, so check it out, but it isn't a full world like the one in the game, and the build is structured for the demo).There are good & bad dream eaters, and of course you utilize the good ones, but you can also collect them via physical dream eater cards, or from crafting various elements in the game. Dream eaters are able to level up just like you, and you are able to enjoy various activities with them beyond the main adventure, one of which is a card game (called \"Flick Rush\") where you select 3 of your dream eaters to go into an area style battle versus other players or the CPU. You don't use the dream eaters at the same time.... think Pokemon, except its a bit more on the fast paced side of things.You will learn, that it's not all about being quick on the draw, you need strategy, and you literally need to pick and choose your attacks wisely because you have to defend at times too. I am a fan of strategy, so this adds to what KH:3D has, and its not predictable (especially with the ability to battle anyone willing to take you on).I would literally hold a tournament for that card battle aspect, because you use the dream eaters you've created and leveled up. You give them various items during creation to improve their attributes also, which can help a dream eater with a weakness improve its durability against such a weakness (for example). Its really interesting.On the adventure side, based on the way I've leveled up my dream eaters (and continue to level them up), they've pulled me out of some sticky situations, and I've literally learned to use them strategically where one provides health, while another provides a shield, etc. There is also a way for you to link up with your dream eaters, whether individually, or combine them together to either merge with you (the 3 of you together), or for you to ride upon as you pack a wallop with a stronger than average attack (I prefer some more than others, but I haven't experienced them all yet).Sound like there is a lot to the game? That's because there is, and you have your own techniques and attacks for your characters (you will play with 2 throughout the adventure), but I will let you check those out.Things that I haven't had the pleasure of enjoying yet are:* I have NOT played 2 player co-op or versus* Street Pass interaction* Circle Pad ProCons:Although it will likely not be a con to everyone, and isn't a con all the time....... swaps between characters will boost your sense of urgency to get something done asap. At times it can have you on the edge of your seat, and at times you don't want to be forced to switch to the other character because of the drop. It can be avoided temporarily by buying a certain item, or making certain moves successfully, but it merely increases your time before the inevitable drop (which puts you to sleep and goes back to the other character). What's good though is that you are not taken back to some sort of check point, you literally begin where you left off... whether its roaming one of the worlds for items, and treasure, kicking butt, or getting yours handed to you.You will likely get use to the drop though, and will become adjusted to continuing where you left off. Since the story intertwines things, you aren't sent off in two different directions wondering how in the world they connect, enjoy the story though so that you aren't scratching your head in regards to the story-line (skipping scenes, and other material is optional, so its your choice if you want to fly through your investment). I'm not a spoiler kind of guy so the review is coming to a close, but I consider it money well spent.- \"Nintendo-Demand\" (Facebook & Google+)P.S.- If you are unfamiliar with Kingdom Hearts games, play the demo.... this includes anyone that doesn't like Kingdom Hearts and is interested in trying KH:3D. Try it before you buy it, because if a game is good, makes no sense to bash it over the simple fact that its not exactly your type of game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2012"}

It's just that liked the original \"Dark Cloud\", and was a HUGE fan of \"Dark Cloud 2\", so naturally, I view this game (which surely is from the same developers, judging from the gameplay) with a more critical eye.Thankfully, though, \"Rogue Galaxy\" does deliver the goods, ultimately, although there are many flaws with the presentation and gameplay. If the option was present, I would rate it 3.5 stars overall, but I can't call it 4 stars, and I refuse to submit to grade inflation.Let's begin with the good, of which there is a healthy amount. First, \"RG\" is very nice to look at. I was skeptical of the cel-shading mixed with polygonal effects, and the initial game was less than stellar (the cel-shading look a bit out-of-place against the plain brown backdrop of the desert), but once the characters appear in cities, in jungles, etc., I love the look. The backgrounds are colorful and detailed, and the characters look pretty good against them, particularly when there is a lot going on.The fighting is standard \"Dark Cloud\" - characters bash on enemies until they are defeated, occasionally guarding against attacks. I was pleased with the addition of abilities (such as spells which hit all enemies - more on this later), and the enemies are of a pretty substantial difficulty (with some being out-of-this-world difficult). Guarding is more useless than in the previous \"DC\" games; you will still take fair damage, and your guard is broken often, many times resulting in combos which leave you...dead. But all in all, I enjoy the fighting, if only because the system is slightly broken.The game is long - if one goes through each of the subquests (of which there are many), you will easily reach 70 hours of gameplay, without including the massive levelling which is often necessary to progress. Some of the minigames are pretty fun - I enjoy the Insector Tournament (essentially, a cock-fighting tourney where you raise bugs to fight in an arena), although I dislike the \"Factory\" (read \"Item Creation\") mode - it is very tedious.Weapon advancement is...interesting. I'm not as much a fan as some of the reviewers here (as it pales to the weapon creation in \"DC2\", which was incredibly fun and extensive), but it's not bad. More fun is the \"Revelation\" map. Reminiscent of the sphere grid in Final Fantasy X, each character has a map which can be filled out to obtain bonuses and special attacks. The catch? One must find items to place in the \"Revelation\" map, and some of the items are difficult to obtain, to say the least. It is always fun after battle (or opening a treasure chest) to see if any of the obtained items will net a new ability in the grid.However, there is much bad about this game. First, the characters move much too slowly while walking. Many of the rooms/streets/towns are very large, and it is annoying to move like a tortoise through the streets. It isn't as much of a problem in combat (since so much of combat is up-close and personal), but it is a pain otherwise. Thankfully, the developers have instituted a GREAT teleport system. Cross a save point on a world, and you can teleport from there to any other save point on that world, and back. The save points are generously distributed, so travel isn't TOO much of a chore, but it is still slow.Another annoyance is the high encounter rate. In some areas (the lower levels of the mines of Vesan, anyone?), one fights enemies every couple of steps. Battles are often grueling, and party members are inept at guarding, resulting in many items used per battle. The developers definitely erred on the difficult side for these battles, and the results are less than stellar. Thankfully, the system is somewhat broken - the main character has some incredible attacking spells, which can destroy groups in a single blow, as well as allow him to snipe mimics (the worst enemies in the game) from afar. The spells are expensive, but thanks to the friendly teleport system, one can simply return to an item shop, stock up on AP-restoring items, and return to the heat of battle. The amount of money made is absurd, and the levels go up quickly. Is it cheating? Possibly, but otherwise, the game slows to a crawl. Utilize it to the fullest.When characters are walking, they will sometime make an exclamation (in the form of a voiceover, usually describing the characters thoughts on the situation at hand). Without a doubt, this is one of the biggest misfires in the game. Each character has about 4 thoughts on each situation, and the length of some quests assure that you'll hear these same thoughts, OVER AND OVER. To add insult to injury, if you decide to explore your surroundings, often you will hear another character say, \"Are we going the right way?!?\" I don't know about you, but an RPG that PUNISHES me for exploration  is one of the dumber ideas in existence. I don't know what the developers were thinking - the most annoying aspect of \"DC2\" was adding the voice module to the robot helper. However, you could always REMOVE the module. This is 10x worse.Another problem is the story. I love the idea of pirates searching the galaxy for treasure - why do I have to be bothered with the stale idea of \"evil corporation bent on ruling the galaxy!\"? I would have MUCH preferred a free exploration game based on the pirates themselves. When the game centers on the pirates, the story is nice. When it centers on the Daytron corporation, it bogs down. And boy does it BOG DOWN - the cut scenes are really boring as a rule, with people making insipid observations repeatedly - how many times does the character Jaster need to be told, \"Wear the power glove, and you'll be more powerful!\" Sheesh, do they need to feed him, too?).Anyway, that's my take. There is a hunter subquest, where you attempt to raise your hunter rank by defeating certain numbers of the same enemy, or hunting hard-to-kill marks, but I'm fairly indifferent toward it (I feel that FFXII system was significantly stronger, with its more-immediate rewards - this one feels like a cheap knockoff). In general, this game should NOT be compared to FFXII - although at times it feels like a synthesis between FFXII and Dark Cloud, it seems more like the latter (which is a good thing - the developers stuck with what they understood). In fact, this pretty much characterizes the game itself. When \"RG\" attempts to be like \"DC\" (such as its presentation, combat, and weapon synthesis mode), it is very strong. When it attempts to be a FF-like RPG, it falls short. But, I like this one overall...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000R39GPA","reviewerName":"SnS \"&#34;Those are my principles and if you ...","summary":"Great Game One Time Through, Maybe Twice","reviewText":"Star Wars; The Force Unleashed is a highly entertaining game.  Personally I enjoy the idea of being a bad guy, but the description that they release to go with the game are spin doctoring at the very best.  But first:  The Pros......The graphics are amazing on the PS3 and truly the main focus when they made this game.  The cinematics are quite sharp, right down to pores on the face.  The mouths look a little odd to me, especially in the close-ups; not a deal breaker since I am not in to graphics as much as I am gameplay and storyline.  The integrated RPG aspect is fun.  I enjoy building my character up and becoming more powerful and it does give that to you.  Maybe not in spades.....but maybe in diamonds.  The idea of combining force powers in to your combos is fun and relatively seamless.  And I do like the fact that there are variations of blade colors and styles.  However, after going through the game once and seeing what everyone else has you got to ask yourself, \"Where is MY unique lightsaber?  Why couldn't they give me a chance to have THAT one.\"  Even loading the Darth Maul skin leaves you with the same lightsaber you had before.  And finally, the storyline, while nothing spectacular, is engaging and fun to watch.Now the cons.......and really only one majorly hurt its score:And that one is the controls.  A hack and slash game is meant to be a hack and slash and really this game boils down to just that.  However, the controls CAN be rather annoying, especially on catwalks, ledges and anywhere else that can cause you an instant death.  To put in perspective, I died easily over 10 times going through the game and getting all the stuff.....NONE of it was from enemies killing me, but simply misjudging a jump or being mid combo near a ledge and slipping off.  At times, such a stupid thing can cause a LOT of frustration.  I might also add, there are parts of the game that can be EXTREMELY frustrating.....not \"challenging\" mind you.....just frustrating.  The feeling of \"OK, they wanted to make this hard, so they took the most annoying combination of items and just kept throwing them in to amp the difficulty up\", the end result leaves you wanting to tear your hair out instead of wanting to push through it.  And finally, I would have liked to see more variation in powers/story/outfits that are alignment based.  It claims that your decisions affect the outcome.  Really.....you are railroaded along your story until the very end, you make one choice, and are then railroaded in to the rest of the ending.  Some choices along the way would have given this game some MUCH needed replayability seeing it lacks ANY multiplay.  And the lack of additional powers makes for a \"been there, force pushed that\" feel.Ultimately, this is a good game, but if they were going to add RPG to it then a Knights of the Old Republic treament would have done wonders.  I look forward to future installations of these games, so long as they learn from their failures and build on the franchise.  Add some depth.  Add some replayability.  Hell, add some multiplay........  you DO know that not ALL Star Wars fans are friendless, zit-faced outcasts.  And even THEY have similar friends that they role play with.  Give us some meat, some innovation.  You have proven you can make a fun, beautiful game.  Now prove you can make a fun, beautiful game that won't end up being traded in after a month cause there is nothing left to do.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2009"}

My laptop weighs a TON, its a desktop replacement so anytime surfing with it in your lap leaves painful memories. So, I like to surf in bed (think of it as replacing reading a book in bed) with it next to me. Having an illuminated keyboard makes it much easier. Even with my laptop in my lap I sometimes struggle to find a key sometimes because I surf usually at night. Not anymore. The X6 is a nice sized keyboard with well spaced, full stroke keys. It seems well built and its cool how the numeric keyboard detaches and is held on with a magnet. Years ago I dropped a hundred bucks on aAdesso ILLUMINATED MULTIMEDIA KEYBOARD BLUE ELECTRO-LUMINESCENT PS/2  ( EL-9805PB )which to my dismay upon receiving turned out to have half stroke, small keys like an older laptop. The X6 is great because of the detachable keypad, illuminated keys that are springy and don't feel cheap and it also has  multimedia controls on it to control your default media player which in my case is iTunes. I know if I want to get back into gaming on the computer I am hooked up with the seemingly limitless customization options the X6 has. Great keyboard that is a must for anyone that who can't see their keys in the dark.EDIT: Still going strong over 2 years later. A couple of the letters have smeared, but there has been other issue.

I've haven't owned mine long and my game has frozen three times. I hate that paranoid feeling of \"Did I save?\"It's sad, though, because they really don't need to do anything to make Madden better, since they own sole rights to producing honest to life NFL games.

{"product_name":"B0053B5RGI","description":"The Next Evolution in Pokemon comes to Nintendo 3DS.","reviewerName":"Christopher Barrett \"Evil Corgi\"","summary":"A slight improvement over previous installments, but a step back in some areas ~","reviewText":"Wanted to play through the game before reviewing:Biggest backwards step?  Well... there are really two: Mega Evolution and Super Training.  First, the Mega Evolution seems WAY to easy to capitalize on.  There is really not a lot of difficulty in getting this power and exploiting it.  I was so unimpressed with the lack of challenge when you use a Mega Evolved Pokemon that I took those particular Pokemon out of my party (or if I do have them in, I won't use the power).  There is really not much of a limit on it, and you can easily trounce most opposing Pokemon, even Gym Leader's Pokemon, easily.Second is the Super Training.  I mean, Pokemon hasn't been too tough in the past (except Pokemon Conquest had decent challenge!), but this is getting ridiculous.  The Super Training basically allows you to complete overly easy challenges to gain additional stat bonuses.  First problem is that they don't really explain it well in the game or manual (had to read about it in the guide book), second is that you can seriously overpower your own Pokemon, thereby lowering the challenge immensely.The other backwards step is in the horde battles.  Every now and then you run into a horde of four to six low level Pokemon.  They are annoying.  Especially when I had Steelix against a bunch of the rock guys.  They used an ability to prevent me from changing Pokemon.  Then they overcharged their defense.  So I could only hit them for 1 dmg... and they could only hit me for 1 dmg... since I hadn't saved in awhile, I spent the better part of 20 minutes waiting for them to knock Steelix out so I could change my Pokemon.  Lovely...  The rewards for these battles are low.  Granted you can capture a low level of whatever you are facing, hence bringing it to higher levels yourself, hence higher stats... but totally not worth it.Now all my gripes aside, the game is still very good.  The biggest improvement is in the story and the dialogue.  Always before, Pokemon had very simple, yet humorous banter between secondary characters.  This has improved.  Granted, there is some really sappy stuff, but overall there is a lot of tongue in cheek humor.  I actually found that I enjoyed talking to the various NPCs around the towns.Battle has been tweaked, and the graphics combined with character animation are wonderful.  Granted, Pokemon isn't even close to the best game on 3DS graphically (my votes are SMT IV and Mario in 3D Land), but the graphics are clean and the color palette very well used.  Pokemon animations are very nice, and it helps the battles to go quicker.  Of course some attacks are rather basically animated, such as Tail Whip, but at least your Pokemon doesn't just circle around a few times!  But some animations, such as Golbat, are really quite neat.The challenge might be easier, but of course you do have a lot of kids playing the game... I only wish Game Freak would add a difficulty adjustment in the game.  There are several online blogs that have great ideas for enhancing the challenge for those who want to be tested.  Since you can save virtually at any time, there isn't much risk.  Plus, losing means you just black out and lose some money - not like Fire Emblem's crazy game over!But I will say this is one of the five must own games on the 3DS so far.  The bar is set high for this franchise, and I expect great fun every time I play - and it really is fun!  I haven't played GTA V once since I got Pokemon Y!  If you have a 3DS, you deserve to own this game!Pros:+ Clean, colorful graphics with fully animated battles.+ Witty, fun, clean dialogue - great for all ages+ Impressive list of hundreds of Pokemon in several regional Pokedex's.+ A truly enjoyable world to explore+ Reduced items of irritation (such as long backtracks or non-central berry farming)+ MUCH MUCH MUCH improved menu navigation - especially for items, TMs and HMs+ Improved musical score+ Faster, more streamlined battles+ In line skating and cycling!+ Changing character wardrobe, hair style, and eye color in game at nearly any Poke-center.+ Harder to acquire money, hence harder to overstock items and pokeballs.Cons:- Super training - fun side game, but overly powers up Pokemon- Pokemon Amie... I mean... what the what????  This isn't Nintendogs...- Mega Evolution - you get it too early and it really overpowers those who have it- Pokedex navigation - still a chore!- Horde battles - they're annoying... just run.- Walking around Lumiose city - seriously annoying with the camera movement","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2013"}
