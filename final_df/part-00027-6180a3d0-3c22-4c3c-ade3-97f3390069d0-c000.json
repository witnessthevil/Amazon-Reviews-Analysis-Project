As a fan of the pirate genre, I have seen many attempts at recreating that gem with all the new engines, and graphics bells and whistles that have come to the gaming world, but none have ever really been able to re-create that feeling.I have only had the game for a short while. And that can be deceptive. Assassin's Creed III initially hit me with a \"wow\" factor, but I guess I just got too side tracked and eventually forgot the story and just quit playing. Assassin's Creed II had sort of spoiled me.I promise to update over the next few days as I delve deeper...but already I am blown away. Sound is amazing, and the graphics pull you in. But I got this title for the Pirate theme...and so far I am NOT disappointed. I will update tonight, but if you are feeling the vibe I am trying to put across and wondering...\"DO I spend the bucks?\" SO far the answer is YES!So, after a day, the game has given me none of the frustration I felt with AC III. If anything, the fighting sequences feel more fluid. Perhaps I am just more used to the controls. However, this is a very open world! And the scenery is amazing. This is a game that I will probably become engrossed in for extended periods. I haven't even got to the real \"piratey\" stuff yet!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2013"}

The game is a was so original, i played it all the way through with great pleasure. On the regular tube TV i used back then the game looked great and it looked just like all the PS2 exclusives, very stellar. The gameplay is smooth as ever in the new revamped version and the 720p as it states on the box looks just as good as anything 1080p, no one would know the difference. Of course the graphics aren't going to look BETTER from a texture, anti aliasing standpoint, thats not what they went after. The games have all been remastered to make it look great on todays LCD, Plasma, and LED tv's. And it does. I picked this game up yesterday and just started the first sly, and its just like playing a real cartoon, the colors are crisp, the movements slick and the gameplay is still amazing as i remember.Another thing i like is that you can select any of the Sly games at anytime during your gameplay, thats great. The only things that are locked are the mini games, which i'm anxious to see what they are. I don't have(use) or want a playstation move, especially for a game like this. This is a classic revamped platformer made to enjoy, and for 40 bucks it can't be beat. The game seems kidish to people, but not to me, its a nice break from all the Call Of Duties, Bioshock, Mafia kill shoot mame type of games and i really think they should do more. The point was to bring this game to the masses in Hi def, so people could experience what a great series this really is, now i just can't wait to see Sly 4, whenever they get a street date for it.So don't be fooled BY fools, these games are just as they were and better. One thing you will notice is on the PS2 you would have just a little bit of lag in certain areas. That is all but gone and the frame rate smoothness is superb, very fast. I played Sly 2 and got about half way through it then ended up getting married and selling my old PS2 years ago, ha! Now i'm single and can play all i want without being bugged. So i'm pretty excited to play Sly 3 since i never have played it at all, and every single game just kept getting rated higher and higher so i can imagine how good it is. But its hard to improve on perfection, but they managed to. So these games are great, and very fun to play, there are so many things to do within the game other than just your main objective, like finding all the clues to open each vault at the end of levels. This is quite a challenge sometimes.So in concluding, i will say this is way worth the price and let me tell you i played Call Of Duty Black Ops and wow what a flop, i would play this any day over that. The old Call of Duties were 10 times better and i've read that i'm not the only one who feels that way. So if you want a good game where you sneak, climb, hang, and do a little fighting these games are for you. And your kids if you like. I really hope PS3 does more of these remastered PS2 game additions, they are great. This one is my all time favorite.Some other titles that need revamped in hi def-OR make them downloadable on PSN.Maximo's-though thats asking a lot since there were only 2.The Haunted Mansion-Yeah i know right, who would have thought of that, but what a great obscure game.Resident Evil 4-ITS WORTHY, i play it on pc and it still doesnt offer even 720p, sigh. That would be great.All the ATV Offroad series.Colossus is on its way i see, that should be sweet.Rygar-Make it a downloadAll the good castlevania's for PS2, make a pack or downloadable.So get Sly have fun and don't waste your money on some of the new way more expensive, less fun titles that came out. Be nostalgic and enjoy. Btw Nintendo needs to get its rear in gear and make games for the wii in HD, and even make the old titles HD as well. Epsecially the Donkey Kong Country series. Come on its 2010!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2010"}
{"product_name":"B006MBZZSI","description":"","reviewerName":"Alessandro Viani","summary":"Most Improved","reviewText":"I could barely get through the first one, due to the battle system. I really hated it, seemed overly complicated. There were also other things in the first that I didn't like. Well, they went and improved all those things in Mk2, and now it's one of my favorite games. You battle by moving around on the field and executing attacks. The battles are full turn based, with the order of the turns displayed at all times. Yes, the battles can be a little repetitive, and some dungeons are used over and over, but that shouldn't deter people from buying this. Especially since it's $10 less than a typical PS3 game. The graphics are what you'd expect in an anime show, even down to the episodic format complete with an announcer. Maybe it's the JRPG fanboy in me, but I do think that could stand up to an AAA title. I have about 32 hours in Kingdoms of Amalur, but I keep coming back to Neptunia; this game is just plain fun to play. It's a shame most people will never hear of this game. Hope this review helps anyone on the fence over this game. It definitively deserves a place either next to on in your PS3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0000A8VBZ","description":"They just killed Cash. Now, they want to kill him again. America is full of run down, broken rust-belt towns where nobody cares and anything goes. InManhunt's Carcer City, nothing matters anymore and all that's left are cheap thrills. The ultimate rush is the power to grant life and take it away, for sport. This time, James Earl Cash, you are the sport. They gave you your life back. Now, they are going to hunt you down. You awake to the sound of your own panicked breath. You must run, hide, and fight to survive. If you can stay alive long enough, you may find out who did this to you. This is a brutal blood sport.Continuing in Rockstar North's tradition of world-class gameplay with high production values and sardonic humor,Manhuntexplores the depths of human depravity in a vicious, sadistic tale of urban horror.","reviewerName":"Rogan Derrick","summary":"Great, but very violent.","reviewText":"I find that Rockstar Games has been the only game company that seems to take their games a little farther than other game designers. I'm talking about games like Grand Theft Auto, State of Emergency, etc... but none have ever crossed the line more than Manhunt. This game is one of the most violent, yet one of the funnest, I have ever laid my hands on.The game starts of in Carcer City, and there are gangs everywhere that want you dead. You are James Earl Cash, an inmate at the state penitentiary. You are executed, only to be brought back to life by the director (voiced by Brian Cox, who does a good job at it) and he has sent gangs and thugs on you to kill you again. It's your job to escape Carcer City. Since he wants you dead, what he says in Cash's earpiece won't help much. So you should ignore him most of the time.There are some pretty good things to like about Manhunt (notice the huge paragraph that you're reading right now). The graphics, for example, are even better than Grand Theft Auto and the animation looks almost realistic. The music and sounds are dreary to kinda add that urban-horror feel (they aren't bad, they're actually pretty good). Not only that, but the controls handle like butter, they are really smooth. The USB headset can be pretty fun to use because you can hear the director's comments in the earpiece and you can shout and cuss in the mouthpiece to call enemies toward you (there is no voice recognition, though). There is also a good selection of weapons to pick up from a simple garbage bag to a big chainsaw (I haven't beat the game yet so I don't know for a fact if you can get Piggsy's chainsaw). There are guns, too. Once you get one, the game gets more interesting. Rockstar also did a good job at the stealth part of Manhunt; you hold R1 to run and you can walk silently without the pressure of accidentally making a noise by running. Don't forget to use shadows for cover and hiding. Also, Stealth kills take place in a snuff film camera, where you horrifically kill a thug and blood gets on the lens (not that it's a good thing, I just wanted to point it out). Manhunt also has a good variety of missions to play and four bonus levels to unlock.While all of this may be good, there are also some downs that might or might not bother people. The enemy A.I. is not smart, nor are they dumb. They fall for the stealth kill thing every time, even though they just saw their friend get nailed by you. Not only that, but the difficulty level is a little high, even on Fetish mode (the easiest difficulty in the game), it's mainly trial and error until you get it right but in the end, it's worth it. But still, I can only imagine the frustration I'll have to put up with in Hardcore mode (the hardest difficulty). Repeating a level over and over gets so annoying so quickly. The game's pretty sadistic, too. It might drive some audiences away.Aside from these flaws, which are very few, Manhunt proves to be a very good game. It won't be a classic, but it sure as heck does NOT suck. This game is definitely worth your time if the sadism and the gruesome violence doesn't get to you. For those who get bothered by strong violence but want to play this anyway, don't say I didn't warn you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000NPOGWK","description":"When Final Fantasy II was released in 1989, it was seen as a triumph in gaming. One of the first games to be appeciated for both its incredible graphics and immersive gameplay, Final Fantasy II was a fully-developed game world, one that surpassed even the amazing Final Fantasy I. Now this remastered new version comes to your PSP, with updated graphics and new content.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Another Classic Reborn Again","reviewText":"A remake of Final Fantasy II is, like the remake of the first one, hard to review.  It's a good game for the time of it's release, but a lot of its elements just don't hold up well by todays standards by any means.Let's clarify one thing, however, the original Final Fantasy II you find on the Super Nintendo is actually Final Fantasy IV.  The real Final Fantasy II was not released until the Final Fantasy Origins on the Playstation, which it was then packaged with the first one.  The game was also released a second time on the GBA in a package called Dawn of Souls.  This is the third time the real Final Fantasy II was released in America.  The unfortunate thing is that even when it first came to the states in the Origins release, it was dated, and they didn't do much to it in Dawn of Souls and now we've already got a third release of the game, and they still haven't done much to update it.  In a sense you want to forgive the old gameplay mechanics.  When the game was originally released (in Japan) it was the standard for the time.  However, in some ways you wish that Square-Enix would've done more to update this thing.The game gets off to a fantastic start, at least.  It begins with an entire village being burned down as the Emperor continues to take over the world.  As the village is burned to the ground, four youngsters managed to escape and are then pursued by the Emperors knights.  They're far too weak to take him on and just barely escape death.  They're then given the chance to help a resistance group bent on stopping the emperor.  For those who played through the first Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy II is a big step  forward for the series.  Your characters, for one thing, actually have names and talk.  While the game doesn't focus too much on the storyline, it's nice that there's some exposition, as well as a sense of direction.  In the story department, Final Fantasy II is certainly not bad for the time in which the game was originally released.  Final Fantasy II's driving force (that either kept you there or drove you away) was the gameplay.Final Fantasy II was, much like the first one, entirely turn based.  That means battles are pretty long and slow.  Again, it's standard fare for the time, but it's actually not so bad even by today's standards.  It's completely simple, you enter in each characters command then watch them carry it out.  The battle system throws in some interesting (and somewhat annoying quirks).  For example, a character placed in the back row takes less damage can only damage the enemy with a bow or by using magic.  If a character in the back row is using a sword he/she will miss all the time.Final Fantasy II also breaks tradition.  While most RPGs have a level up system of some kind, Final Fantasy II has no such thing.  So how do you raise characters?  By using them in battle.  Depending on what they do, certain stats increase.  A character who keep using physical attacks for example, will eventually see an increase in his strength.  If you keep taking damage your defense and HP will increase.  If you keep using magic, your magic will increase.  The game will tell you when stats go up.  This system sounds like its awesome, but it has its drawbacks.  For one, when certain stats go up, other stats go down.  For example, when your strength increases, your magic might go down.  It's almost impossible to have a well balanced character if that's what you're going for.  It's also annoying because your stats don't increase that fast and it's sometimes hard to gauge just how much time you'll have to spend increasing your stats.Your weapons and magic have levels though.  Keep using a spell and it'll eventually level up.  Keep using a certain weapon type (swords for example) and it'll eventually level up.  The purpose is simple: A weapon at a high level will hit an enemy several times and the chances of missing become slimmer.  Once you give a certain weapon to a character however, you might as well keep them with it.  Weapons and magic, like your stats don't increase often or fast, and lower level weapon types often miss a lot.For some RPGers, this huge focus Final Fantasy II puts on increasing the stats of your characters while leveling up their magic and weapons spells fun.  However, at the same time, its dreadfully time consuming.  Final Fantasy II isn't a long game per se, but you'll spend a ton of time just wandering around and raising stats.  It's also to no consolation that the game is very challenging.  And when I say challenging I'm not kidding.  The random encounter rate here is ungodly high and its way too easy to get lost when going to your next destination.  The good news is you'll know when you get lost: the enemies are too much of a challenge and will often kill you in one shot.  The problem, however, is this completely takes the fun out of exploring.  Just going as little as five steps in the wrong direction on the world map could be fatal, and what's worse is that the game often doesn't tell you what direction to go.  So if you're not accustomed to losing in battle, prepare to do so here.  You could try running away, but even if you select for your entire party to flee, you'll often fail.  Likewise, most of your enemies will attack before you do.It's the gameplay that can make or break Final Fantasy II for you.  With the challenging difficulty and unbalanced character raising system, some gamers who were introduced to the series with later games (particularly the Playstation era games) will find themselves in frustration.  This may be on the PSP, but beneath the surface this is still an old school NES RPG complete with all the limitations and challenges.  So it isn't unrealistic to expect the same limitations and challenges, and this in and of itself could completely turn some gamers away.On the bright side, the PSP version is the best looking version yet.  It doesn't take the PSP to its limits, and it's still 2D but the artwork and designs of the monsters and towns is pretty good.  So it isn't an overhaul in graphics, but it still looks pretty.  Unfortunately, for some, this isn't enough to save the near 20 year old gameplay.  The game also sounds really really good, and the reworked soundtrack here sounds even better.  It's a fantastic piece of eye-candy on the whole.The problem with Final Fantasy II is that it's the third release here in the states and it really doesn't add a whole lot of new stuff that you can't get in the GBA version: Dawn of Souls.  The fact that you also have to buy this separately from Final Fantasy I doesn't help its situation any.In the end, if you haven't experienced Final Fantasy II and you absolutely have to, I highly suggest going to your local used game store and picking up a copy of Dawn of Souls on the GBA.  It may not be as pretty as the PSP version, but you get it for cheaper and you also get the first Final Fantasy included with it.Pros:+It's really pretty+Great sound+Not a bad story for the second Final Fantasy+Exhausting gameplay, there's a lot to doCons:-The character raising system makes it impossible to have a balanced character, and it's also very time consuming-The challenge may be a bit too steep for fans who began with later Final Fantasy games-If you've got the Dawn of Souls remake or even Final Fantasy Origins, the PSP version doesn't offer enough new content to justify another purchase, and even if you haven't played the game before, the GBA version is cheaper and includes two games","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2007"}

I've owned and used many headsets over the years (three Turtle Beach) and there always seems to be something new for PC, gaming consoles, mobile devices and DJing.  As I always enjoy testing out new headphones here are my thoughts on the Turtle Beach Titanfall Ear Force Atlas Official Xbox One Xbox 360 PC Gaming Headset;Pros+ Simple to plug on the X1 (adapter was immediately identified and was asked to update the controller, very simple process, took less than 2 minutes to update the controller).+ Nice sound, crisp treble, solid bass with nothing being too overwhelming.+ Includes Xbox One Audio Adapter ($25 individually).+ Multi-platform use (X1, Xbox 360 and other mobile devices.  They even work with my PS4 and PS Vita).+ Microfiber ear cups are comfortably padded, even for those of us who wear glasses.+ Sleek looking Titanfall decal design.+ Separate game and chat audio control options.+ Fantastic noise isolation.+ Lengthy main USB cord.+ Detachable mic.+ Officially licensed.+ Lightweight.Cons- Sounds better on the PC than on the X1.  I've noticed it doesn't seem to get as loud on the X1.- Headband tends to be a bit too tight after a while which is odd considering I have a smaller head than most.  It was not very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.  This would be problematic for someone with a larger head.- Crackling sound and sometimes microphone pop noise on the X1. (UPDATE - most recent X1 Update fixed these issues).- Control remote on the cable is a bit larger than it needs to be.  It's always falling off of my computer tower at the slightest pull even.- Amplifier not compatible with the X1.- Can be hard to plug the cable into the amplifier because of the rubber casing, had to make sure it was properly inserted, since it sounded like s*** before I rechecked the connection. It makes it hard if you want to switch on the fly between the PC and X1, since removing the cable from the amplifier that's connected to the PC.- Build quality of plastic and synthetic is a bit disappointing considering the price tag.- Steep list price of $150 which I feel is too much for what you're getting.- Ear cups only swivel 90 degrees one way and 45 degrees the other way.- Not wireless.At the $150 range, the Turtle Beach Titanfall Ear Force Atlas Official Xbox One Xbox 360 PC Gaming Headset unfortunately falls a bit short to justify the initial asking price.  On the plus side, the noise isolation is decent and the audio quality is quite good for both games and music.  The inclusion of the X1 adapter allows you to personalize your gaming audio to maximize your playstyle.  The majority of games I've played so far have had crisp and clear highs, mids and lows without ever sounding dull, distant or hollow.  I've been playing multiple games (Thief, Payday 2, Titanfall and Dark Souls II) with all resulting in quality sound.  However, I feel that the list price is too high for what you're getting in the end.  I feel that this headset would be a more worthy investment around the $100-$130 range.  Personally, I feel there are better headset choices on the market for the current asking price.  However, if you're a Titanfall fan and want to complete your collection then the Turtle Beach Titanfall Ear Force Atlas Official Xbox One Xbox 360 PC Gaming Headset might be for you.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2014"}

I've logged a few hours into it so far and right off the bat I know I'll like it.To break it down succinctly before I ramble, if you've played Morrowind and enjoyed it, even a little, you are doing yourself a great disservice by not picking this up right now.  If you were disappointed at Morrowind because it was too big that you felt listless and didn't know what to do, pick this game up.  If you loved how open and free Morrowind was, pick it up right now.  If you've never played Morrowind, well, read on.Right away, most of the complaints of Morrowind are addressed.  After spending a couple hours in the first dungeon/jail escape, you finally see the light of day and let me tell you, from then on, awe and excitement are around every corner.  But, unlike Morrowind, in controlled and, if you want them to be, small pieces.  Generally, there were two camps of people who played Morrowind: they loved it because it was so open/free that they could do anything they wanted; or, they hated it because they didn't know what to do because it was so open/free.Oblivion takes the best of Morrowind (the openness) and makes it more accessible.  If you want to focus on the main quest, right as soon as you leave the dungeon there's a red flag on your compass and on your map showing where you need to go.  In fact, you can click on that town and instantly warp there, should you want to.  In Morrowind, it took a bit for the main story to actually appear.  In Oblivion you are thrust into the main story right from the beginning.  And, if you want, the story can be started right away and has some pretty exciting moments right away.If you want to, instead, explore the world a bit, well go right ahead.  I did the second option, exploring a nearby fort that had catacombs filled with traps, skeletons and a ghost.  Tried my hand at pick-pocketing sleeping guards with unfortunate success.  Stumbled upon a bandit camp that didn't like me interrupting their probably nefarious deeds.It's setup so that if you want to, you can very easily pursue the main quest, never get lost and know what you're doing.  However, you can also just set out on your own, kingdom be damned and spend the next 100 hours seeing the sights, exploring the 200+ dungeons, and scaling all 17 or so square miles of the land.  As an example, one of my friends immediately began the main quest.  He's now a good chunk of quests ahead of me in the quests.  I took the explorer route and spent the time looking around, finding the ruins and dungeons, joining the guilds etc.  Two totally different approaches, both easy to get into and fun to mess around with.Character creation is similar to Morrowind.  There are a ton of races to choose from, about 21 classes (or you can create your own), 21 skill categories and a large handful of astral signs that give you bonuses.  For those who've played Morrowind, there's not much difference here.  Its all about choice.  How do you want to play.  Also included is a fantastic character editor where you can change different facets of your character to fit your desire.  Really cool.Choosing your \"class\" is important in that it will define how you want to play your character.  You have 7 major skills that you can assign any of the 21 skills to.  Each \"kind\" of character (melee, stealth, magic) have 7 skills to choose from.  Whatever you put in your major skills determines your \"class\" and how you level, while the remaining 14 become minor skills that can be leveled up (at a slower rate) and don't contribute to your leveling.  Races give bonuses to skills and attributes as does the sign you end up choosing.As you can tell, the game is about openness.  Do you want, be what you want.  To a lesser extent, Fable tried this with mixed results.  But not until this game have I seen so much openness and ability to do practically what you want.NPCs are on a 24/7 clock.  Each one of the 1,000 NPCs in the game have varying levels of needs, desires and goals.  They will carry these out without regard to you.  Guards will catch NPC criminals, people will go out and hunt.  I've seen a guard attack a wolf that was bothering a passerby.  It all feels natural and as realistic as any game right now.  Mostly.  There are some sore spots.  The combat AI for any partners you have can be a joke.  Sometimes, they will just barrel forward without regard for the other monsters around you.  That can lead to very difficult situations as the AI guards round up more than they can handle, die, and then you have a messy situation on your hands.Other sore spots include guards with ESP.  Apparently, if a person wakes up while being killed or isn't killed in one hit, the guard seemingly knows that murder is being committed.  And will rush right to where you are.  This has caused me a lot of consternation when I'm trying to finish a quest with guards who know not only that I'm a murderer but also exactly where I am.  And will continue to chase you forever.The interface has been retooled.  The journal and your inventory is now much much more user-friendly.  Quests show up in a log and you can easily select which quest you want as your active quest.  Doing so immediately pops up a red marker where you need to go.  You won't get lost.  I will say its sometimes a little disappointing when an arrow appears over a ruin that the quest says you need to find.  Instead of following general directions, I know exactly where to find it.  That's a bit disappointing in that it takes away from the exploring portion of it.  Minor gripe, though.The graphics also help promote this world.  Terrific, they really make Oblivion come to life.  From the trees in the background, to the tall weeds you pass through, everything is animated and created painstakingly beautifully.  Its a real world come to life in virtual form.  The physics are pretty decent.  I've caused skeletons to explode, people flying backwards with a well cast fireball, rolling down hills.  Sometimes, the close-ups of people are a little jarring because they don't look so realistic when you get up close and a lot of them look like they have uber-wrinkles or a skin problem.  Aliasing is practically non-existent.  When you get a horse, the very very very brief pauses in between loading the outworld area becomes a bit more noticeable because it seems to happen a bit more often.  Its still not in anyway shape or form to the detriment of the game and is completely understandable given that the world is so huge, but its there and noticeable.The sound is also terrific.  The voice actors are pretty decent, the sound effects awesome and the music really well done.  Traveling through a thunderstorm really makes you feel like its raining, lightning and thundering.  The clash of steel on steel is exciting, sparks fly.The game does stutter at times.  In the first dungeon, when I brought out a torch, the game paused briefly as it changed the light levels.  Not a huge problem by any means.  Placing spells on your directional pad hotkey can become a pain as you ready each spell.  Though, I love the fact I can wield a sword and a torch/shield AND cast spells at the same time.  Love it.  I guess there's some framerate issues, but I have barely noticed them at all.  There are some pop-ups with the shrubs etc in the distance but really when the game is generating all of this on the fly, I can forgive some very very very minor quibbles.Overall, if you are a fan of RPGs, I don't know why you wouldn't like this game.  Whatever you bring to the table, it will match you.  Whether you want to get lost in a virtual world, discover catacombs that really feel like they've never been found before, just go after the main quest, buy and sell houses, try and become a mercantile genius or even become a vampire, everything is up to you.  You can do it all, or none of it.I will say it's hard to be objective with a game that was seemingly crafted just for me.  I am usually willing to overlook minor faults etc when the end product is amazing.  Such is the case with Oblivion.  Everything about it are things I love.  I love the openness that is controlled in that I will never get lost.  I can't think of many games that give you so much freedom, but in such a way that you won't lose your way.  Absolutely terrific, there's nothing here that makes me not recommend it fully-heartedly for RPGers.NOTE: I hesitate to even bring this up, but the game has been re-rated by the ESRB as of 3 May 2006.  For some reason, they have decided the amount of blood in the game is more fitting of a rated \"M for Mature (17+)\" game.  There is talk of a mod that will strip away the female character's top portion of the clothes.  Please know that this does not affect the Xbox 360 version of the game.  The mod is downloadable for the PC version, but not for the 360.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00006LEMX","description":"Looking for a new obsession to keep you up nights? Let me introduce you to Hotsuma, the main character inShinobi, the much anticipated new action-adventure game from Sega. Fans of the original 2-D game have been waiting seven years for the next installment, and won't be disappointed by this energetic 3-D game for PS2.The premise hasn't changed much--kill bad guys, kill more bad guys, kill a boss, move on to the next level. You, Hotsuma, are the leader of the Oboro clan. As your clansmen are destroyed, you set out to avenge their deaths by slashing hellspawn and enemy ninjas to death with your powerful sword, Akujiki. As you move through game levels, Akujiki comes alive with power, absorbing the souls of those you kill--and turning against you if you don't keep him well fed. The basic moves--run, jump, slash--are easy to learn, but with each level you must master difficult combos to defeat trickier enemies. Moving quickly and attacking instinctively is essential to killing fast and furiously--each kill gives your sword more power, while each moment of hesitation makes your weapon impatient for blood.Shinobi, at heart, is a souped-up arcade game with awesome graphics. The anime-style cutscenes woven around the slice-and-dice sequences provide an interesting story, but one that doesn't relate very directly with your job on the streets of postapocalyptic Tokyo. Your moves are cool though--spinning in midair to collect coins that will unlock secret levels, killing three ninjas with a flash of Akujiki, zipping around so fast that a shadow of your ghost remains. It's easy to get caught up in the exhilarating energy of the game. Serious gamers will enjoy confronting bosses, who may take several frustrating tries to kill. But when you finally defeat them, you will feel the power of centuries of samurai.--Maile BohlmannPros:Fantastic graphicsExcellent scripting and voicingFairly easy controls and maneuvers at outsetExciting fighting sequences with intense gameplayCons:Killing early bosses can be unusually difficultLong sequences with no save pointsStoryline frames fighting sequences, rather than interacting with them","reviewerName":"Shanghaied","summary":"WHY SEGA WILL REIGN AGAIN","reviewText":"Wow.  That's my first impression of this game.  I've only had it for a few hours, but wow.  This game is everything I thought it would be and more.  It's not complicated, it's not confusing; it's direct, poignant, and very nicely done.I never played the other shinobi installments, but this one is absolutely bewildering. Imagine taking the sword slashing from Strider, adding shuriken from the classic shinobi installments, creating a 3d gaming experience, and turning the speed of gameplay up about 10x or so.  Those, in essence, are the ingredients to this wonderful game.  The game is deeper than this, but it is nothing if not straightforward.  The controls are a breeze (as with most Sega games) and pace of the game is fast and furious.  This game, save it's great graphics and 3d third person layout, revives the gameplay that any oldschool genesis or nintendo gamer has been deprived of for so long.The greatest flaw to this game is the music; it's really not very good at all.  But you can always turn it off and play something else on the stereo in the background (Just like you may have done with all those old Nintendo and Genesis games).  The voice acting is pretty good and the cinematics, though unbelievable, are awesome.  That aside, being able to dash around and slice 5 enemies who fall apart after the fight in a gory, bloody mess is absolute fun, especially after a long day at work.

I had been anticipating this game way back at E3 of last year, when Randy Pitchford, hype man of Gearbox, introduced the first playable demo of Aliens: Colonial Marines.  What a difference a year makes.  This is bar-none, the worst Xbox 360 game I have ever played.  Yes, the graphics are shockingly subpar, the storyline is uninspired, and the animation is clunky.  But what really ticks me off is how a game so disturbingly unpolished was even allowed to be released in the first place.  Case one is the atrocious amount of screen tearing in the Xbox 360 version of the game.  It's everywhere, even in the cut scenes.  Case two is the blatant misrepresentation of how this game was going to look and play.  ACM is definately not the version of the game I saw in the demo.  Whole levels and cut scenes have either been restructered for the worse or ommitted altogether.  The creepy ambient lighting that was hyped is practically non-existent, replaced by a dull, gray glow.  What's left seems like an early beta version of the game that was scrapped together with a $1.50 budget.  I could go on and on about how abysmal this game is, but quite frankly, the reviewers below me have thoroughly done a good job describing this game's faults.  So will there be a game that does this property justice?  Given this title, it's hard to say considering that this was supposed to be the ultimate Aliens gaming experience.  What I can promise is that I will never fall for the hype of an Aliens game until it is released.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00005MO5G","description":"Although the game will seem very familiar to Sonic fans,Sonic  Advanceis an entirely new creation that's been built from the ground up.  The gameplay, graphics, and sound borrow from the classic Sonic games on the  Genesis and are successfully translated to the Game Boy Advance. The game's  single-player modes are relatively short 2-D platform rounds--each run takes two  to three hours--but replay value is added through the game's various characters.  Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy each have different abilities that make getting  through the game a unique experience.The real star here is the game's link capabilities. The Chao Garden allows you  to raise your little critters and upload them to the GameCube via thelink cableandSonic Adventure 2:  Battle. Having one cartridge lets up to four GBA players compete in one  minigame. Gamers can play two additional minigames if each player owns a  cartridge. Although the single-player game is quite good, the link options give  the title tremendous value.The only notable problem stems from the series itself: There are still entirely  too many cheap deaths resulting from the title's high-speed gameplay. You'll  find yourself zipping along a level only to be hit by an obstacle you had little  chance of seeing, let alone avoiding. Ultimately, the only way to get past these  hazards is to memorize where they are. This minor flaw doesn't detract from the  game's excellent value, though.Sonic Advanceoffers a very good  single-player game and some of the best link options of any GBA title.--Raymond M.

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"michael","summary":"best xbox game ever","reviewText":"KOTOR is the best game i ever played and the best rpg ever made i have played a lot of video games but this is by far the best i have seen yet a must buy","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0014ULQB2","reviewerName":"J. Shafer","summary":"Fun game but gets repetitive","reviewText":"Red Faction starts out with Alec Mason going to a terrformed and colonized Mars to start a new life.  Its not really explained why he goes but alludes over the fact that his brother may have done something to have caused it.  He meets up with his brother and immediately begins to start work by collecting salvage from destroyed buildings so it can be recycled and used for anything.  A military force known as the EDF immediately shows up, declare them to be members of an apprant rebellion called the Red Faction and execute Alexs brother Dan on the spot.  Before the EDF can kill Alec, he is saved by other members of the Red Faction, joins their ranks, and sets off on a mission of revenge to end EDF control and the constant terrible treatment of workers on Mars once and for all.The story to this game was basically non-existant.  All your ever told is to just go around and destroy everything you see, gaining more people to join your cause while the EDF slowly loses its influence and power.  Your given a few tid-bits of information here and there, but theres just too little for you to even really care who the main enemies were or who and entirely different faction is (Maraduers).  The plot also really only advances to you finding a mysterious device, learning who the Maraduers are, and then dealing with the EDF flagship as it makes its way to Mars, but when they resolve everything in the end, it just didnt feel very epic, almost as if the developers took the easy way out because they didnt feel like adding much else, however its hinted that there might be future DLC or even a sequel.The main selling point of the game was the ability to - with the exception of the ground or hills and such - destroy litterally everything.  Its extremely fun to run around shooting explosives at all of the buildings and see them fall down on top of the enemy, but towards the end of the game it can get a little repetitive.  The one partial downside to this is that this is the only way you can gain currency in this game, which is just salvage.  The only way you can get salvage is to destroy buildings and than run around and pick it up.  It can be extremely frustrating to do this when enemies are around because in this gamee, cover makes a big factor when it comes to combat.Gameplay itself feels very fresh, but thats mainly because of the GeoMod engine that the game runs on.  Theres not a large variety of weapons, but there are a decent number of original ones (a rifle that can disentigrate anything, a weapon that launches explosive blades, etc.)  Theres a small amount of vehicles that you can use, but again, theres a few somewhat unique ones as well, namely the mechs that you can pilot.  Multiplayer can also be quite fun to play but sometimes, it can feel very broken because of the inclusive of power weapons that tend to kill you in 1 hit.  Youve also got your typical multiplayer modes to play (death match, team death match, territories, MVP, etc.) and while nothing is really original, the game put a twist on most of them to make it seem like it is.  Youve also got a few side missions during the campaign, but they just arent that interesting (destroy a building in a set time, drive from point A to point B as fast as you can).  Theres a bonus offline mode called Wrecking Crew but its mildly entertaining at best and can get boring fast.In conclusion, Red Faction: Guerrilla is a solid and enjoyable game.  However, your best off renting it first because it may not be your cup of tea.  You could always try out the demo but when you play the full game, the demo feels like it doesnt flesh out the game very well, if it all.  If your on the fence, rent it first and then decide because while its a good game, it still has a few things that prevent it from being an absolute \"must buy\".","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2009"}

Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"A classic first-person shooter","reviewText":"Deep in the Pacific Ocean lies a chain of isolated islands which the reclusive Dr. Krieger has taken over in order to pursue his enigmatic 'research' into genetic engineering. Ex-special forces agent-turned-boat-captain Jack Carver is chartered to take an unusual young lady to the islands, but his boat promptly gets blown up by a bazooka. Before he knows what is going on, Jack's been drafted by the CIA and finds himself having to fight his way through multiple islands packed with heavy weaponry-wielding mercenaries and bizarre genetic mutants as well.Far Cry was released in April 2004, with newbie developers CryTek getting their first game out ahead of that year's eagerly-anticipated Doom 3 and Half-Life 2. With the help of a demo tactically timed to come out two months before the game, the title blindsided many players who hadn't even heard of it before, but with its (for the time) awe-inspiring graphics and unusual amount of freedom for a first-person shooter, it quickly won over many fans. Although enjoyable, Doom 3 didn't really bring anything new to the table and its graphical thunder had definitely been stolen by Far Cry, and whilst Half-Life 2 did become a major success thanks to its tense, dramatic storyline and memorable characters, its extreme linearity did limit replayability.Far Cry, despite a generic, corny story and a meathead protagonist, works so well because the game basically just sticks you on a boat or on the beach of an island with an objective, a gun, a hearty clap on the back and then lets you get on with it. There are multiple paths to each objective, some employing stealth, some allowing for a running-in-with-all-guns-blazing approach, sometimes with vehicles available for use, sometimes not.This allows Far Cry to tap into the primeval appeal of the first-person shooter genre: running around with a gun shooting bad guys. All too often this very basic component of the genre is overlooked in favour of gimmicks like bullet-time or physics puzzles, but Far Cry puts it front-and-centre. Running around in the jungle outflanking squads of mercenaries, making use of cover, or shimmying up to a treehouse and deploying a sniper rifle to pick enemies off from 3km away is tremendously satisfying, as is executing a well-planned attack on a fortified enemy position after a careful and painstaking reconnaissance of the enemy position. You can use binoculars to 'mark' enemy troops on your radar which makes absolutely no sense in a literal context but gives you a feeling that recon missions are actually worthwhile. You also have a remote mike you can use to eavesdrop on enemy soldiers' conversations, which sometimes results in plot-advancing information or a random comic exchange, which adds to the game's atmosphere.The game being five years old, it is now possible for most modern PCs to run the game with settings rammed up to the maximum. With the 1.4 version patch installed with new particle, smoke, haze and HD lighting effects, the game still looks jaw-droppingly good. Not as face-meltingly brilliant as Crysis with everything turned up to eleven, of course, but still pretty awesome. The sheer sense of scale is also incredible. These islands are vast and if you can see a location, you can probably travel there, whether it's by boat, car, hang-glider or on foot. In short, heavy weapons-driven ultraviolence has rarely looked so good or been so much fun.There are several downers. Almost immediately noticeable is the total absence of a quick-save system in favour of a checkpoint system. Most of the time this is fine and it actually achieves its goal of making you genuinely think hard about your decisions, knowing that getting killed aimlessly will result in a 5-minute trek to get back to where you are right now. However, there are a few times when the checkpoints are way too far apart with several intense firefights and no health kits in between, and getting past those bits without ripping your monitor from its mount and hurling it through the window in rage can be quite difficult.Rather more famous is the fact that whilst the mercenary enemies are clever, intelligent and satisfying opponents, the mutant enemies are a complete pain in the backside. Even the lowliest mutant grunts can jump about thirty feet through the air and kill you with one hit, and by the time the invisible ones armed with machine guns show up, the joke is starting to wear a little thin. That said, the mutants aren't actually the game-destroying factor they are sometimes represented as: unlike Crysis (where the human enemies vanish quite soon after the even more annoying aliens show up), the mutants and human enemies remain interspersed throughout the whole game, and the mutants actually disappear for quite long stretches of the later levels, but they are fairly irritating. Vehicle handling is also a bit on the oversensitive side and in some parts of the game walking is actually quicker than driving slowly so as not to wrap your jeep around the side of a tree.As I mentioned earlier, the story is quite corny and your main character is a pretty unlikable dunderhead, but oddly this works in a sort of retro-1990s FPS flashback kind of way. Carver is cut from the same cloth as Duke Nuke'em (not quite so ludicrous though) and the fantastically-named John Blade from SiN, and his macho antics are almost endearing in an age of dark and tortured game heroes like that guy from FEAR and whatshisface from Splinter Cell.But Far Cry is all about the gameplay, and the gameplay is superb. I played the game through from start to finish for about the fifth time for this review, and I was still finding new routes, new tactics and new combinations of weapons and vehicles to beat each map. Far Cry has greater replayability than almost any other FPS I can think of (discounting pseudo-RPGs like STALKER), even more than its quasi-successor Crysis. It is simply, an excellent and slightly underrated game.A couple of words of clarification: there were several semi-spin-offs released on consoles with names such as Far Cry Instincts, which used a cut-down version of the main game engine and were not developed by CryTek. There is also an 'official' sequel called Far Cry 2 which has absolutely nothing to do with Far Cry at all and has had a very mixed reception.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2009"}

Here are my observations:+ Great Graphics - Outstanding graphics, the settings are simply amazing and the characters interact realistically with the environment (at least more so than in earlier versions)+ Intuitive Controls - Character controls are fairly easy to learn and are well thought out, making this less of a \"button masher\" then other games of its type+ Many Modes - Single Player (Story, Tower \"Quest\", Arcade, Training), Versus (local 2 player), and Xbox Live (fight against on-line opponents, really works well and is a lot of fun)+ Character Editor - Allows customization of \"basic\" characters and allows creation of new characters, a lot of fun once the stock characters become well known.+ Expandable - Able to add weapons, armor, and abilities with \"gold\" earned in the game. Additional characters can be purchased on-line* Special Character - Yoda doesn't really fit into this game but is sort of fun to play, especially after we bought Darth Vader on-line (fighting in the Star Wars settings makes this a lot of fun, indeed)Notes:* Since this is the most played game we have, we downloaded this to our hard drive and found the game does run quicker.* Some of the female characters are fairly scantily clad, and armor can be knocked off in combat, so while it never gets to full \"exposure\" it does come frightfully close (especially \"Ivy\")* No real gore, which is a big plus for usThis is a very fun fighting game that we all enjoy playing, Highly Recommended!CFH","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2010"}

Klinko \"nureveww\"","summary":"Realistic....What??","reviewText":"Rented this game based on the raving reviews emphasizing the realism of the game.  Um, not so much.  A proper description is boring and tedious.  There is nothing realistic about a bunch of red blips on your HUD indicating where all the enemies are.  There is nothing realistic about lying in a prone position and while crawling you hit an uneven patch of terrain and the camera then pans to you staring straight into the sky when you are just about ready to lock onto an enemy.  The vehicle controls, views and handling are also a complete joke.I think what they attempted to do was make a realistic sim battlefield game rather than a more over the top arcade version, and arcady it certainly is not.  Where they failed is that the game seems rather unplayable, and even though it is nothing like COD or GRAW, it still is not realistic.....just slow and boring.  The tactical commands are also worth mentioning because it almost worked.  You can issue such a wide array of commands which is really cool, however holding RB and pointing with the D-pad through several sub-menus is too time consuming.  I love that they stretched the tactical possibilities, but this is a game that needed either voice command or hot button assignments or something...it just feels like too much work to issue some of the commands.I would recommend renting it, more than likely you will not finish the campaign because you will become disengaged after a few hourse of play.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00030GS80","description":"There's always been a certain magic to Zelda games. The classic formula should have gotten old by now, but it hasn't. Perhaps it's because we all identify on some level with this shy, unlikely hero. Maybe the games remind us of our own childhood. Or perhaps these titles are consistently of such high quality that we can't help but love them. Regardless, The Minish Cap succeeds in all these ways &#x96; simultaneously embracing its links to the past while offering numerous innovations that keep gameplay fresh, exciting, and a true joy to&#xA0;play.The greatest of these novel concepts is the ability to transform from normal size down to the diminutive form of the Minish, a race of tiny people living right under the noses of the humans. This opens up entirely new realms of gameplay, as puzzles and even combat must be accomplished in different ways. When miniaturized, the smallest puddle becomes a deep lake, and the most mundane creatures become monstrous foes.There's a new item called the Gust Jar that allows you to suck up obstacles and enemies before blowing them back out in a burst of air. It's one of the cooler new power-up items I've encountered in any of the Zelda games, and adds yet another level of complexity to how you play. Another new ability allows Link to double himself, creating a ghostly after-image that mirrors his moves for a brief time. As you might imagine, this results in some clever and unique brainteasers that are a nod to the recent Four Swords games. In all these ways, the game challenges you to think in multiple dimensions and carefully remember details on your journey. A large cast of characters fleshes out the land of Hyrule, and monsters both large and small await your blade. To further connect you to the world's people, you will now collect items called Kinstones &#x96; broken halves of coin-like objects that can be fused with the Kinstones that other characters in the world have collected. By doing so, you'll open up portals, treasure chests, and secret doors all over the map. It's an addictive side quest that serves as a worthy compliment to the main adventure.One of my few complaints is that while the puzzles in the game are uniformly challenging, some of the combat is easier than I might have liked, especially against the bosses, who were often one-trick ponies requiring minimal skill. Even so, the fights are satisfying in their simplicity, and you have access to all the familiar weapons and techniques, including the boomerang, spin attack, and bow. The old and new features combine to make a game that feels both true to the Zelda heritage while offering an entirely unique experience.But more than any of this, the game charms you with its stalwart hero. This silent little boy with ruffled, messy hair is faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. Through him, the game establishes a hero whose pure heart and will are carrying him forward. All the elements of The Minish Cap (even its presence on the GBA) contribute to the idea of a tiny force for good that strives to triumph against a huge evil. It's a classic adventure that more than lives up to the legacy of a classic series.Concept:The time-honored Zelda tale retold in yet another new formGraphics:Mixing the familiar images of previous Zelda games with humorous and detailed new character designs results in an impressive success for the GBASound:Some of the most memorable and recognizable tunes in gaming sound great even on those little GBA speakersPlayability:Responsive and flexible with a nearly perfect learning curve that moves from simple to challengingEntertainment:Like many of its predecessors &#x96; a true classicReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerIssue:February 20052nd Opinion:There's a bird sitting on my head, I'm no larger than a toenail clipping, and I've been stuck on the same puzzle for the last three hours. Long story short, I'm having the time of my life. For any of you who played the remarkable Super Nintendo title A Link to the Past, The Minish Cap will bring a tear to your eye. This is classic Zelda gameplay in all its glory. The journey is a tad easy for my liking (boss fights are a breeze), but I can't get enough of the creative puzzles and new gadgets. Shrinking in height to a two-pixel speck is not only hilarious, it's one of the most compelling concepts that the series has offered up in a long time. Minigames are also in great abundance, and you can collect over 130 different figurines that shed some light on the characters in the world (which also happens to be one of my favorite aspects of Wind Waker). From its stunning visuals to its gameplay finesse, The Minish Cap is another harrowing Hyrule adventure that you'll remember for a lifetime.Rated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer","reviewerName":"Carmilla","summary":"Awesome Zelda game.

Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"My First Experience with Fable","reviewText":"I heard a lot of hype about this game and I read a lot of reviews and finally got convinced.It's hard to decide where to start with this game.  In fact I completely scratched my first review and started over again.I'll try reverting to the standard \"pros and cons\" system:Pros:Graphics are decent, things are easy to find, enemies are easily identifiable by red highlights when they first appear - you don't often get snuck up on except when being shot at by enemies off-screen.There's a lot to do in Fable II.  Lots of places to go, lots of people to see, lots of quests to go after, lots of stuff to buy/own/find/steal...  It's a game that keeps you entertained simply by bombarding you with content and options.  That alone justifies the four-star rating.You have a dog.  Everyone talks about how helpful the dog is but I haven't seen much benefit besides finding buried treasure and treasure chests.  He attacks fallen enemies, but when my enemies fall, they're usually already dead, so that's not much help.  Luckily he never really gets in the way, and he doesn't peform good or evil actions to throw your moral standing off kilter (such as would frequently occur in Black & White by the same designers.)  So I don't have to waste time \"teaching\" my Dog to be good or bad - a big benefit.Fable II has a very short learning curve.  I understood the controls and basic features pretty quick, and the game does a moderately good job of coaching you along as new content becomes available.Fighting is really cool in Fable.  It's a lot of fun working up to level 4 and 5 magic spells and watching the fantastic carnage as you set enemies on fire or shock the hell outta them!!  Melee combat quickly seems pointless when you can cook everyone around you in mere seconds.Cons:The abundance of content seems to be just that - content.  It's filler-work.  I can get married, but why?  I can have kids, but why?  I can buy 5 different kinds of Carrots...  but why??  They've given me a lot I can do but no real reason (besides achievements) for doing any of it.The game area is big, but awkwardly broken up.  You play in regions - segments of land that seem completely disjointed from each other.  The regions don't feel the same at all, and it's hard to remember how to get from one region to another because there's no visual connection, no guidance, etc.  I often just end up using the \"fast travel\" feature because I've lost interest in trying to figure it out.  In addition, the map is completely useless.  I mean COMPLETELY useless.  You see yourself represented as an arrow.  But the arrow might mean which way your hero is facing, or which way the camera is looking?  Haven't figured that out yet!  There's dots to indicate quests, and a few other icons, but NOTHING to indicate where stores are, nothing to indicate which road might lead to which region - nothing.  You often find yourself fast warping to somewhere that's literally a 10-second walk away because you just can't seem to figure out where the hell you are.The story is just that - a story.  It's not necessarily compelling, nor is it difficult.  Thankfully the \"breadcrumbs\" feature guides you to your next point, so you can progress as slowly or as quickly as you'd like.You quickly end up with a lot of \"junk\" in your inventory.  It doesn't help that for some reason, you HAVE to take or use any item you find.  There is no \"cancel\" button to just leave items where you found them.  In addition, you can't drop items, so you have to try to sell them off somewhere.Conclusion:Fable II can keep you busy for hours on end.  But the more I play, the more I think that I'll never be compelled to finish it all.  It's entertaining - definitely.  It's a good game.  It's just not addictive.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2008"}

BUT! this game is horribly glitchy and broken for a finished product, and the amount of meat to this game is pityable. the number of clothing choices must be less than 30, no armor, and only 3 maybe 4 tiers of weapon quality. there are 5 towns only 2 of which have anything usefull and nothing really is region specific besides hair so you'll spend almost all your time in just one place. the moral choices are hampered by the ignorant to a fault townsfolk. here's a thing, if you want a person to sacrifice their hapiness or money for the world at large to be \"good\" and \"pure\" you should try to make sure the world isn't populated by idiotic zombies who follow the main character around till your forced to kill almost 5 people just to leave your own home. the day/night system needs work, the shopkeeps begin walking to their shops at opening time but since they are free to wander the town at night it might be some time before the store you want is actually open. the job system is interesting and even fun. but there is absolutley no reward for raising your skill in a particular job even to the max. aside from the money you make working it's utterly useless. you don't even get a discount on weapons for being a master blacksmith which makes some sense. the dog companion is an interesting novelty, key word being novelty, he'll find dig spots with extra treasures for you to gather, but in a fight even at max combat level the most he'll do is knaw on downed oponents and once you get strong enough you stop knocking people over and just kill them. as i say, it's a fun game but i sort of get the feeling peter molixnue once again has made a game he really enjoys without giving too much thought to what we would enjoy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2008"}

It's absolutely incredible to see this game in motion. Crytek has created something that feels distinct enough while remaining similar to other games. They've created a game with combat more akin to Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, but they've made the combat much more challenging overall. While it's true that it's essentially a one trick pony in gameplay and does get a little repetitive, the combat is so satisfying, visceral and challenging, that it's easy to enjoy. And like I said, the graphics are the best of the best. The scenery in this game will leave your jaw dragging on the floor long after you finish playing.Ryse is a game every fan of video games should have in their collection.

I know some complain that this game is too much like Hulk: Ultimate Destruction.  I haven't played the Hulk game so I wasn't bothered by that in the least.  There are also complaints that the story is kind of stupid, the characters are cardboard, etc., which is all true.  There are some other complaints that the camera and targeting are a bit problematic...but I have yet to play an XBOX game where that wasn't the case, and they could be worse than in Prototype, so I didn't let that get to me.The game is set up like GTA, in that there's an open city to explore, and side missions and events to trigger, as well as a main plot that keeps you moving throughout the city at your own pace.This game is just flat out action on a colossal scale.  It is so much fun.  At one point in the game you find yourself fighting a gigantic monster and its brood of smaller mutants in the middle of Times Square, as hundreds of civilians flee for their lives, and the military deploys dozens of tanks, helis, and soldiers at you all at the same time.  Later, the final battle takes place on the deck of an aircraft carrier, where you are literally throwing helicopters at your opponent.  In other words, the scale of the action is just insane.The mix of superpowers and abilities is huge, and your character feels ridiculously powered up.  But this is really well-balanced in the game, and as powered as you are, you will have to use some real strategy and no doubt make numerous attempts to achieve your objectives.  I must have died about 30 times trying to beat the final \"boss\"--but it never got old because each time around I was able to use different strategies, moves, and powers--you're not forced to repeat the same steps, because the game gives you so many ways to combat your foes.  In any situation, you can use a huge variety of powers, or just grab guns or rocket launchers from dead soldiers, or hijack and drive tanks and helicopters. You can fight from the air by running up buildings and drop down on the enemies, or on the ground for intense hand-to-hand, or stay far back and used ranged powers, or just throw trucks and cars and air conditioning units at your enemies!  You can truly create your own gameplay experience based on your own fighting style and tactics.This is some of the most fun I've ever had in a video game.  The story tries to be profound, but it is really stupid, I'll admit.  But when I was running up the side of the Empire State Building, or cleaving tanks in half and throwing trucks at an army of monsters, I forgot to let that bother me!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2009"}

Angel \"americanpride\"","summary":"Excellent start to the series!","reviewText":"I have not played any Star Ocean games before this.  I began playing this game on the heals of completing Chrono Trigger (DS) and Tales of Phantasia (GBA).  It plays much like Tales of Phantasia as one might expect.The cut scenes and voice acting are done well for a portable game and add to the game.  The battles are real-time, but felt less tactical than Tales of Phantasia did.  Battles were still fun.  The AI for the other 3 characters in your party is pretty weak but workable.  I fought with the primary hero (Roddick) for the entire game except the final boss.  I had to take over Millie (the healer) because she didn't know how to keep the party alive and just let the AI beat down the boss.It's a shorter game compared to most rpg's out these days, which was a good thing for me.  I explored and did a lot of minigames/sidequests and finished it in 25 hours or so.  Personally 25-30 hours is nearly perfect for me.  The story progresses at a nice pace until the end where it feels rushed...but it all works.My favorite part of the game was the skill system where you customize your characters abilities.  There is a lot you can do to customize your party.All in all, it was the perfect into for me into the series as I know Star Ocean 2 is a longer game.

Rhodes","summary":"The First Departure in the US","reviewText":"Pros:+Well done cutscenes+Visually stunning+Fun gameplay and mechanics+Fairly good storyline+There are various ways for the story to unfold+Tons of custimization, side quests and secrets+Well developed charactersCons:-A little too easy, which some may not enjoy as much as others-A lot of exposition throughout the game-The voice acting can grate on the nervesIn Japan, a little company called Enix (now Square-Enix) crafted an RPG called Star ocean where it was released on the Super Famicom in 1996.  Star Ocean never made it to US shores.  However, American gamers were able to play Star Ocean: The Second Story, which became a cult classic in 1999 and later Star Ocean: Till the End of Time in 2004.  Now we have a chance to play the first Star Ocean and see just where those elements came from.Star Ocean is probably best known as being one of the RPGs which really brought Science Fiction to the RPG realm.  On the planet Roak, there is a disease that is turning the denizens of the world to stone.  In an attempt to rescue his friends and family and his world from this disease, Roddick and company must travel through time and space to locate the origins of the disease to find a cure.  The story itself may seem somewhat dated by today's standards, but it still manages to be really good.  Particularly because its got a lot of heart and a fairly good cast of characters.  The story is told through traditional text boxes and from time to time through some really well done animated scenes.If there was any problem with Star Ocean's story, it would be that there's just too much exposition in some areas.  There's a lot of dialog and a lot of talking, even for a JRPG.  On the other hand, even this has an upside.  As a result of some of its exposition Star Ocean really does a good job of fleshing out its characters.  You'll be quite surprised at just how absorbing this story can really be when you start to enjoy the characters more and care about them.  From time to time you will be tempted to skip scenes because of the exposition but at the same time you may find yourself not wanting to just for the sake of missing something.  In spite of having such a simple story, there's a lot to take in.  Even more than that, Star Ocean can be a different experience on subsequent play throughs.  There are many playable characters in the game, but it is impossible to recruit them all.  You'll find that the story unfolds in different ways depending on who you recruit and when you recruit them.  Recruiting specific characters does more than alter the story.  It also alters the events of the quest and sometimes in what order you'll take care of things.  You may even skip over certain boss fights as a result of recruiting a different character.The Star Ocean series also contains a well known battle system.  Rather than being turn based like many JRPGs on the market, Star Ocean opts instead for real time battles where the player is able to run around freely and perform melee attacks and special attacks.  You're able to switch party members at any time you need to and open up menus to use items, magic, etc.  If you've played any games in the \"Tales of...\" series, then you probably have an idea of just how the battle system in Star Ocean works--it's almost exactly the same.  Whoever you choose to be in battle, the AI controls the others.The battle system may take some time to learn, but it isn't hard to master.  In many cases it can be reduced to a button mashing affair.  While the game starts off as a seeming challenge, it isn't hard before it becomes incredibly easy to take advantage of.  In most cases you won't even need to use magic.  This is also in spite of some of your allies having some pretty bad AI or carelessly using their special attacks even when it isn't called for.  Star Ocean definitely won't challenge the veteran RPGer.There's a lot more to the battle system, however.  Characters also gain skill points which they can use to learn how to do many different things such as crafting items, or pickpocketing non-playable characters in the towns, cooking and many more things.  The amount of customization is tremendous.  Spend your skill points wisely, however.  The game begs for you to make each character useful for different things.  It works in such a way that you wouldn't even want to make all your characters the same.Visually, Star Ocean First Departure obviously looks better than its Super Famicom counterpart.  It doesn't take the PSP to its full potential but there's a lot of detail in the towns and character artwork.  Artistically, Star Ocean First Departure is a grand game.  Musically, however, there aren't nearly as many memorable tracks.  There are a few good ones, but for the most part you probably won't be humming too many of Star Ocean's tunes.  The voice acting, however, needs work.  They can be very annoying, especially when they say the same phrases over and over again in battle.  The voice acting isn't always bad, but it is most certainly annoying.If you're a Star Ocean fan, then picking up the First Departure is a treat to see where the roots of the series come from.  When the game debuted in 1996 it was ahead of its time.  While much of what you find isn't fresh and some of it dated, it's still a huge game and it's still fun to play.  If you're looking for a satisfying JRPG experience on the PSP, then Star Ocean First Departure is not to be missed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2008"}

{"product_name":"B000MUW98O","description":"InBurnout Paradiseplayers are treated to a rarity in the video games universe: a complete reinvention of an established franchise that equals, if not betters any of the previous games in the series. Yes, this is a large claim, but one that can be explained in a single phrase: Next-Gen Freedom.Driver's heaven is a wide open worldIn Paradise City even cars can fly.View larger.Go for broke in 'Marked Man' Mode.View larger.Nothing is off limits, even head-on crashes.View larger.Start a race any time with 'Easy Drive.'View larger.Although theBurnoutseries&#146; over the top mobile action has been its calling card since it ignited audiences on the PS2 in 2001, and later on the first generation Xbox console,Burnout Paradiseis the first game in the series that has been designed specifically for play on Next Generation consoles. This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"T. Frye","summary":"Like Burnout? Like racing games? Don't miss this one.","reviewText":"I am a big fan of the Burnout series. The first one was good, and I thought it couldn't get any better. Then the second one came, and it blew me away. Then Burnout 3. Then Burnout Revenge. With ever game, the series got better and better. Has Criterion's new Burnout game, Burnout Paradise, continued the trend of the series getting better with every game?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Story: There is no real story in this game, so I'm not counting this in the final score--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Graphics: This game really shines in the graphics section. Not only cause it runs at a smooth 60-frames per second, but because the crashes are phenomenal, the car details are astounding, and the city and environments are amazing. Brilliant job here, Criterion. This game is one of the best looking racing games on the market.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Audio: The Burnout series has had impressive audio, and this game is no different. The sound effects are astounding. Crash you car and you'll wonder if there was a car crash outside your window. Everything in the sound effects department is great, and will blow your mind.Now for the soundtrack. This is where the audio stumbles. The soundtrack is mediocre. Criterion has put a whole bunch of songs on this soundtrack that don't fit Burnout at ALL. Listening to Avril Lavigne's \"Girlfriend\" is like stabbing razor blades in your ears. And you're listening to that song while you're PLAYING BURNOUT!?!?!?!?!? That is cruel. There are a few bright spots, however, that keep the soundtrack from becoming terrible. There are some pieces that were borrowed from the first two games that are definitely note-worthy (no pun intended), and \"I Wanna Rock\" by Twisted Sister and \"Paradise City\" by Guns n' Roses definitely stand out. But it's hard to forgive some of the other songs in this game. At least you can import some songs from your PS3 or Xbox 360 to fit your style.All in all, the brilliant sound effects overcome the mediocre soundtrack, but it's hard to forget the first time you hear \"Girlfriend\" start playing in the background--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gameplay: This is a Burnout game through and through, but there are a lot of new features in it that adds some new flavor to the mix.First of all, the biggest new addition - Burnout is now in an open world. This works in Paradise's favor, since the open world is brilliantly designed, and is actually believable to be an actual city. You'll see elevated train tracks you can ride on. You can go through alleys and run over trash cans. There is a lot of detail. The city is basically your playground. You can free ride (or freeburn as it's known in Burnout) throughout the entirety of the city from the get-go, from the downtown district to the mountain roads. There are also a lot of things to do in the world. There are billboards to crash through, smash gates to run over, and super jumps to, well, jump.There are also, of course, the life and soul of Burnout - events. Go up to any intersection of the world and press the two shoulder buttons to start an event designated to that corner. There are a big variety of races. There is Race, Road Rage, Marked Man, Stunt Run, and Burning Route. There are a total of 120 events on the map, and it will take you a while to complete them.Here is another complaint about the game - navigation can be a pain. Especially during the races. See, there are no arrows on the track telling you where to go (unlike previous Burnout games), meaning you can take whatever route you want to get to the finish line. This is both good and bad. The good is that you get a great sense of freedom in races because of this feature. The bad is that because of this, you need to constantly pull up the menu every five seconds to look at the map to make sure you don't take a wrong turn. Because of this, you crash more that ever. This makes crashing infuriating at times, which is a shame too, since the crashes look so awesome. Eventually, you do sort of memorize the city layout, which can make races a lot easier later in the game. Still, it would have been better if there had been more ways of navigating than popping up the map every five seconds. It would have also been cool if they had made a GPS system like in Fuel (see my review for Fuel, PS3 version), which had arrows on the top of the screen indicating where to go.The other events fare better, since they don't require as much navigation as the races. Stunt Run is an all-new game mode introduced in the game, and it is very fun. There is a timer. You must do as much barrell rolls, flatspins, and other tricks as you can before the time runs out. This events forces you to use your knowledge of the city to your advantage. Burning Route returns from the previous games, where you must get from point A to point B as fast as possible. Marked Man is another new game mode in the game, and it, as well as Stunt Run, is a great new addition to the franchise. You must get from point A to point B without getting taked down by the other cars pursuing you. This is a great new addition that requires skill. And last but not least, there is Road Rage, returning from the previous games better than ever before. Road Rage plays by the same rules as Road Rage in Burnout 3, only this time it's even more chaotic. Wherever you go, you'll have up to 10 cars raging past you. You may go wherever you want in the city, taking down rivals to get as many takedowns as possible. This is by far my favorite mode, since it gives you an adrenaline rush.There are a lot of vehicles to \"unlock\" in this game. I put unlock in quotes because you don't just unlock them - you take them down. See whenever you complete X number of events, you are told that, for example, the \"Hunter Spur\" has now entered Paradise City. You must take this car down to earn him. This is a lot more realistic than in the previous Burnout games. You can be trying to get a billboard when you see a guy going 200 mph fly right past you. You then get in an all-out pursuit. When you take him down, you are told that the \"Hunter Spur\" has been delivered to the junkyard (the junkyard is where you go to change your car). Then, you go to the junkyard and try out the vehicle. It's a neat system that injects life into Paradise City.There are a huge variety of vehicles. There are 78 vehicles to unock, and each one is seperated into three vehicle classes - Stunt, Speed, and Aggression. Stunt cars are great for the Stunt Run events, as well as collecting billboards and going off jumps. Speed cars are great in the races, mostly because they're light and fast. This comes at a downside, since you can only use the boost when the boost bar is full. Aggression cars are perfect for the Road Rage events, since they are aggressive and are strong. However, don't expect to win any Stunt Runs in these vehicles.One of my favorite parts of Burnout Revenge was the crash mode. It was a unique puzzle, where you had to ram into an intersection and cause as much havoc as possible. It was very fun, if not completely addictive. Unfortunately, there is no crash mode in Paradise, as it has been replaced by \"Showtime.\" Showtime is an event where you press R1 and L1, and your car crashes, only you have control over it. You must bounce your car (using the boost in your boost bar) towards the traffic, causing mayhem. There is no real strategy to Showtime, unlike the crash mode, which makes the mode feel like a mindless rampage instead of a puzzle. But that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Showtime can be pretty fun at times. Unfortunately, the mode seems to be based more on pure luck rather than skill. You can get a lot of multipliers and cars to hit in one event, but then the next, there is little to no traffic. Again, the mode is still fun, but it'll never replace the true crash mode.The game experience is very long, and will take you several hours to collect all the collectibles, win all the races, and get the Elite licencse. The experience may get a bit repetitive after a few hours of play, since it may be a bit grinding to spend hours finding billboards, smashes, and jumps, as well as winning events.But that's where the online comes in.The online is brilliant. Totally brilliant. It is seamlessly integrated into the offline experience. The way the entire online experience is set up is really cool. By pressing right on the D-Pad, you open the Easy Drive menu. In this menu, you get to create your own online game, join another player's game, create your own race, and a whole lot of other things without even having to turn off your engine. This is a neat system that really integrates into the overall experience.The actual online play is brilliant, too. There are literally hundreds of online challenges to participate in with your friends. These range from simple (meet in the parking garage on 4th Street) to complicated (get an near miss in the air while jumping off the ramp on Elm Street). Some of these have time limits, which means you have to hurry up to complete these objectives. There are also online Races, Road Rages, Stunt Runs, and Marked Mans. These are variations of the offline modes, and it's a blast.Overall, the gameplay has done nothing but improve upon the past games of the franchise. The open world gameplay was a great choice, and the sheer amount of content here will blow you away.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lasting Appeal: There is quite a lot to do in this game. There is the easily up to 20 hour long offline experience, then there is the online play you may want to spend 100 hours on. And then (there is always more isn't there?) there is the huge amount of DLC to buy in the Playstation Store, which range from new online modes and new vehicles to entire new sections of Paradise City to explore. There is also a DLC pack which allows you to ride bikes around Paradise.Overall, this is a game you will spend a lot of time on.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall: This is a racing fan's dream come true. There are over 120 events, 500 online challenges, 78 vehicles, and a lot of DLC to buy. Sure, the offline can get repetitive after a while, but that isn't a gamebreaking issue, as the rest of the game is spot on. Go buy this if you're a racing fan - Paradise City is open and waiting.The following is a rating system.

Marshall \"Geoffrey Marshall\"","summary":"Worth the discounted price...","reviewText":"...of under $15, $20 max. I bought this game at Walmart because of the low price and the favourable comparison to Halo that was on the game cover. Who says advertising doesn't work? :DAs one previous reviewer said, the only comparison between this and Halo is that they're both FPSs with a sci-fi bent and both a single player and multiplayer game. Other than that, don't play this game with the expectations you may have when playing Halo.I'm writing this review after playing the game for the first time. I started to play it with the story game with Halo in mind, and the cartoony feel plus more than two weapons at a time, as well as offbeat humor threw me off track and got me pissed off. Then I got through the first level and went to the second level set in ganster Chicago, thought \"maybe this game doesn't suck so bad.\" Then I went to multiplayer, and finished playing it with a grin on my face saying \"hey, this game is pretty good!\" On its own terms, of course.Make no mistake, Halo is a GREATER game than Timesplitters 2 in terms of story, gameplay, realism, and ability to involve the player in the game. However, it is not a BETTER game than Timesplitters 2. Timesplitters isn't better than Halo either, but both have advantages over the other to tweak gameplay. For someone like myself who doesn't have that many other people to play with, the ability to use bots in Timesplitters 2 is quite welcome for arena battles, and the weapons/characters are a hoot. Halo multiplayer is for serious contenders who want tactical gameplay; TS2 multiplayer is for people who want to waste everything in sight (ergo, it's more fun).I don't like the aiming system, the game still seems a bit corny to me and the controls are pretty weird, but I am now willing to give it a chance. Judge it on its own merits and don't compare it to Halo, and you'll see it's a pretty decent game for the price it goes for.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000IMYKQ0","description":"The Wii Nunchuk controller is a secondary controller that adds even more innovation to the next generation of gaming, and does it all with less physical movement.Used in conjunction with the standard Wii remote, certain games need the Nunchuk controller for additional control options. Contoured perfectly to fit a player's hand,The Wii Nunchuk (left) connects directly to the Wii remote.View larger.the Nunchuk controller builds on the simplicity of the Wii Remote controller. The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance. Just be careful not to knock out your significant other, or bruise the dog, severely, while using one, or two Nunchuk controllers.","reviewerName":"P.

I *think* (I'm not always the quickest on these things) that the story was meant to be a sequel to the epic poem as opposed to a substitute.In any event, there was a good variety of enemies, the puzzles always made sense (it's a big plus for me when I don't have to consult Google to finish a game) and the way to defeat the bosses wasn't impossible to figure out.  The graphics, while not groundbreaking, lent themselves to a suitably creepy atmosphere.  The controls were nice and tight and I didn't have any problems with the camera.

This one happens to be $199, regular one is (which is the most popular) is $299, and the elite just droped down to $299 from $399 and made much more sales. The reason this one is the cheapist is because it does not come with a hardrive so you can pretty much you can only save a couple of games before running out of space. The console comes with 256 mb (im pretty sure but i used most of it up) a white wireless remote, and the version i bought was a combo pack that also came with two games. Sonic tennis, that i did not care for, and arcade which comes with a pac man championship edition, luxor 2, uno, and feeding frenzy. Then a few demos of a couple other games that you can download from xbox store for the whole game. Anyway, the xbox can be used for many things, if you happen to not have enough money to buy the regular one, you can buy this one and later buy a hardrive for it with different sizes and prices for each one. The graphics for this system are a HUGE leap from the ps2 or original xbox. The main reason for the xbox is Live. Where you can connect online to chat and play with friends or people around the world. There is also a marketplace to buy or rent movies, games and mini games, clothes and things for your avatar. An avatar is a person to express yourself and you can also use him or her in some of the games. Almost every game has live on it and its worth getting. Things to buy or need for live, you will need a subscription card to play, highspeed or brodbrand internet, a wireless or corded live connecter, and you will want a wired or wireless headset. There are many features to buy for live to make it better. This system is mostly made for live so if you cant get it i would suggest long games or highspeed internet. I would rate this item more stars and i love it but it does not come with many things that the other two better 360s have, such as the headset, ethernet cord, HD cable, and a hardrive. I would rather suggest the regular or elite unless you dont have the money and you want it now like i did, later buy the items that came with the regular ones and its good as them.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2010"}

Their games have often combined good storylines with excellent music, but most importantly, they have always given the gamer a little bit more. With Star Ocean 2, and even more so, Valkyrie Profile, the gamer was (gasp!) not bored to fight battles, as strategy played a key role in success. Furthermore, SO2 and VP had extensive bonus dungeons and multiple endings (SO2 had 97, if I'm not mistaken), which added to replay value. I was a bit disappointed in SO: Till the End of Time.  Although the after-game bonus dungeons were incredible, there seemed to be little originality present (including an item creation system that can only be described as baffling - where was the simplicity of SO2 and VP?). I liked the game, but was left wanting more...In the case of originality, Radiata Stories (hereby dubbed \"RS\") delivers. A role playing game in which active recruitment is a driving force (much like Suikoden), you play as Jack Russell, the son of a famous knight Cairn, as he attempts to follow in his father's footsteps by joining the Knights of Radiata. Throughout the game, you will make friends and enemies (there are two separate paths that you can follow!), and in all, you can recruit 177 new members of your party (although I'm not sure that all of them may be called on in a single game).The graphics of this game are beautiful (I wish that the Suikoden series would take a page out of this game's book!), and the recruiting is quite fun. However, as is often the case with these types of games, the story takes a back seat (it is very difficult to get interested in the events around you when your focus is making friends). Much like Suikoden and VERY much like Suikoden IV, there really isn't much going on here. Recruit people to fight a war that seems ill-conceived (and ill-defined - it is difficult to understand the motivation of the combatants) until you realize that some overarching entity is the true puppet master, in which you stop the entity. Moreover, the ending (or one of the endings - I haven't played through both paths yet) can only be described by \"guh?\". It is difficult to understand why you are doing anything at all, other than making friends.But in that respect, the game delivers. It is difficult to recruit all 177 friends, but much of the fun involved is trying! Each person moves through the day according to some schedule, and at times might need your assistance. It is up to you to find those times, however. I found the recruiting to be a blast, in general. Of course, there is a secret character (maybe more, I haven't found everyone) that can only be recruited after defeating an after-game dungeon.All in all, RS is a compelling title, and worthy of the legacy of Star Ocean and Valkyrie Profile. I would however have liked more attention to be paid to the story...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2005"}

The firefight modes, the custom maps you can create on Forge mode are very good. I like how you can choose the loadout (camo suit, sprint, jet-pack) everytime you get killed in the game before you respawn. You can choose to race with players, play infection which players get haunted by aliens and need to kill the infected or become infected. there are many gamemodes and you can vote on which gamemode you want to play.I have no problems with the gameplay at all, its fun as heck, but with that said, some of the graphics on multiplayer maps can sometimes feel and look bland, but other maps just look completely gorgeous. Another small complaint would be that there is some minor frame rate drops in the gameplay while there's a lot of action going on. This only has happened to me on the campaign, I have not yet seen any lag in multiplayer, so for me is not a big deal, but thought I'd mention it. Last but not least is for you guys out there who do not have a hard drive or have the 360S with 4GB, as of this writing, you will not be able to play online co-op with friends.

Figuring it would be worth the buy because of the variety of games available (if only I knew), I straight-up bought and brought the bundle home.Kinect was very easy to set up and get going with (especially for those with a Slim model, since those are Kinect-ready outta the box).  However, here's a bit of a warning:  If you're buying this for a smaller bedroom, make sure to purchase that Nyko accessory for being closer to the sensor because it's a workout alone trying to get the darn thing calibrated.  Then, it finally calibrates (kinda) and I get going.When not playing games with Kinect, you can use your voice to navigate Xbox Dashboard menus.  However, in order to do any motion-sensor type movements involving the Xbox menu, you first have to open up a very primitive and rudimentary Kinect menu.  And if you really think about it, that's just about all Kinect offers outside of games.  When it comes to gaming with Kinect itself, depending on the game and the way you're situated in the room your game can either be as smooth as a controller game, or as buggy as a patch-free version of Skyrim.  Like I said before, Kinect is very uptight about where exactly you're positioned, and if you even remotely goof it up the game holds on until you get back in position.Now, speaking of which I found Kinect to be more of a frustrating piece of equipment than anything else.  Sure, it may offer controller-free gameplay unlike Wii, but is it really worth shelling out that much more for?  Maybe if you've got a lot of friends or you can see yourself shuffling through the many shovelware titles that have been released for Kinect since its launch:  \"Yeah, as a single male gamer I'm totally up for non-stop rounds of Dance Central and Zumba Fitness.  And instead of Guitar Hero, let's play Child of Eden!\"  Gimme a break. [though I will say, I really wanted to check out Rise of Nightmares before I gave up on this]To wrap up an already-too-lengthy review about this POS, I had the sensor for a good week or so before trading it in for a piece of hardware MUCH MORE DESERVING of my hard-earned money:  A 3DS.  If you're a gamer's gamer, pick up one of those or a couple new PS3/Xbox/Wii games instead.  If you're either (a) a large family, (b) a rich family that doesn't care about wasting money, or (c) a large and rich family that doesn't care about wasting money, this is right up your alley.Oh, and about Kinect Adventures...

It works on either your PC or Xbox to give you the ultimate gaming experience.","reviewerName":"Nakkiel","summary":"Great for a wired controller...","reviewText":"I wanted a wireless but unfortunately Microsoft made theirs the only one with native game support for windows games and the wireless is 10 tons of fail. This is exactly the same controller as the regular X-Box 360, but comes with an installation disk. (Which you can DL from Microsoft's site instead.) It was very much plug and play, no real setup needed other than key mapping in games. Also the cord is fairly long. Anyway, will be comparing this to PS3 controller since that is the only other one I use.The grip is much more comfortable than the PS3 controller and button layout is designed for comfort of use rather than to look nice. (Still looks nice.)The movement sticks (or whatever they are actually called)have an indent and 4 small bumps that help grip to your finger to keep it from sliding, which the PS3 controller doesn't have. They are also placed much more intelligently and easy to move with your thumbs, which again the PS3 are intentionally out of the way for aesthetics rather than being functional. (This is because the original controller's games primarily used the directional pad and they inexplicably refuse to change the design...)Now for it's downsides. It is incredibly heavy compared to the PS3 controller... and those have long lasting wireless batteries built in. I don't know if this is an issue with the actual controller or just game support for it, but so far there seems to be no difference how far/fast you push the movement sticks. If you lightly shift in a direction it moves the same speed as jolting it as far as it will go. The PS3 controller matches how fast and far you take it and will move slower if you only lightly press. Also while the bottom trigger buttons are fairly convenient the top ones are very annoying to use, whereas on the PS3 all 4 are easy to use. The X-Box's trigger buttons also feel like you are just pressing down a button whereas the PS3 feels like squeezing a soft trigger. Finally the light indicating which controller it is (1-4)is right in the center of the controller facing you, which is slightly distracting since it is a bright neon green. On the PS3 it is next to the trigger buttons where you can's see, much smaller, and red which won't be as distracting in a dark room.All in all it works very well. Since Microsoft forces you to buy this for native controller support in games if you want to use a controller it is this or the Logitech one that emulates it. I do wish they would make a wireless controller that isn't completely terrible and maybe cut down on weight, but do like the design of the outer casing and how comfortable it is.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2012"}

It gets 5 stars atm but it does need some firmware updates, and obviously, sorting out the usual launch issues and Chinese manufacturing issues will take time. I feel bad for those that got DOAs and I discuss that at the bottom a bit. But for now I have to review my system.For what it is the is the greatest console ever released. The DS4 is near perfect, although I still could use more heft on the backside it is about as good as the original design can get at this point. I mark it slightly higher than the 360 controller and that is high praise. The UI is sweet and fast. MUCH faster than the XMB ever was. Doing things like sharing stuff, contacting people, and general social fare has never been easier on any console. The Xbox One looks to have the same thing going on.As for the power this thing puts out games like KZSF are clearly in the top tier of PC games with some framerate issues and a tad lesser IQ. Everything else is stunning for a launch game. I have no idea where all the bad reviews are coming from but I can guess as with every launch a few people were well paid for their efforts. All in all Sony has done a remarkable turnaround. This console means business, is very quiet, and produces the best launch graphics in any FPS ever for a console. So much so that with just a little extra here and there the game would be top end PC fare if it could produce a stable 60 FPS framerate. Still, we do get a solid 30-40 in campaign, and damn does it look good, and about 40-60 in multiplayer. SO the PS4 is clearly doing its job and the promises of 1080p are here to stay.As far as everything else we need firmware updates. The system is so far pretty bare bones for options. Still don't have all the HDMI sound options needed for receivers, the PS3 got this patch at some point, so my receiver in stereo still sees like 3/4/.1 from the PS4 but it works just with a slightly higher noise floor. There are other things that should carry over from the PS3 as well in time.The DOAs no one really knows what happened. It could be that the extra demand and hence the extra locations of manufacturing produced too much strain or outright sabotage no one knows. It is a fairly small number of dead systems comparing last gen where the console apocalypse basically hit everyone at some point in the launch groin.

The PS4 gives us great graphics, generous memory, upgrade-ability, lots of wonderful games at launch, and plenty more on the way.One thing that surprised me about the PS4 was the weight of both the console itself and the controllers.  Compare by holding a PS3 controller in one hand the the Dualshock 4 in the other and you'll find there's a big difference.  The PS4 is considerably heavier.  I suppose it just means there's that much more good stuff packed into this one!  It's nothing that would in any way change my decision to purchase the PS4, but was just surprising.For any of the more casual PlayStation users out there, please remember this version is NOT backwards compatible so you CANNOT play your PS1, PS2, or PS3 games on this console.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2013"}

Rhodes","summary":"A Great System","reviewText":"Pros:+A Very Powerful Handheld Device+Plays music, movies, and allows you to look at photos+Browsing online is fun+A lot of accessories available+Now has a good library of games+Easy interface and control+Very detailed screen and largeCons:-Online browsing isn't that much fun-Can't organize a music library and UMDs aren't all that fun to watch, even on road trips-The battery life isn't long lasting-The screen is easily damagedWhen the original PSP launched back in 2005, it eventually became subjected to heavy criticism.  Not necessarily the console itself, but mostly that much of what it did, people didn't see the use for in a handheld system, and the fact that its library of games wasn't incredible.  Nevertheless, the PSP has still shown itself to be a powerhouse of a console.First and foremost, this review is not here to talk about the Nintendo DS.  If you would like a review or comparison to the Nintendo DS, I highly suggest you look for reviews under the Nintendo DS or use the forums.  Most people on the amazon community will be very helpful in helping you decide on which handheld is the best for you.The new PSP is much better than the original.  It's slimmer, lighter, and a slightly bigger screen that actually makes some of the picture look a bit more crisp.  Some games also run a little faster, and that more than helps the PSP out.What the PSP has best been known for (and criticized the most for) is being a handheld entertainment center.  It can do more than just play games.  It can play music, go online, play movies, and you can look at photos.  This is all built into the system and doesn't require you to purchase any extra peripherals to use.  While these are all good and well, they come with slight hitches.  You can't organize a playlist when it comes to the music, and while going online is great, it's pretty sluggish when you have to input addresses and such via a keypad function similar to that of a cell phone.  Movies are great too, but a UMD on the PSP's small screen isn't enough to replace a DVD or Blu-Ray disc.Luckily, however, the PSP isn't a home entertainment center and is a gaming console.  In that respect it gets the job done.  The Slim PSP works because the interface is very user friendly.  You can select several things from the main menu to do.  Whether it be to play music, browse photos or just start a game.  When playing a game you can return to the home menu at any time.  The system even sleeps if you suddenly have to put it down.  The UMDs are also a great gaming format.  There's plenty of space, which makes some games live up to their potential in length, and also pushes how powerful the PSP is.  In terms of graphics, it's like walking around with a Playstation 2 in your pocket.The PSP does suffer from a couple of setbacks.  The battery is still pretty short in length.  It lasts much longer in the slim PSP than the original, but it still isn't that long lasting.  At least you can always check how much battery is left, and when it gets low it'll let you know.  Even better for the PSP is that even if the battery dies in the middle of a game, you can just charge it and resume right from where you left off since the console will merely go to sleep.The other setback with the PSP is that the screen can be damaged pretty easily.  In order to protect it you'll need to spend more money on accessories such as a case to protect it.  It's also not the most durable system you can buy.  You have to be a bit more delicate with it because it's a bit more fragile than most other consoles out there.  Luckily, most of you probably won't drop it purposefully, but in case a parent is looking at giving it to a child, you may want to watch to make sure they don't drop it on a concrete or hard surface.For a couple of years, the PSP has suffered the most from having a fairly tight library.  Most of its more notable games were either ported from the Playstation 2 or ported TO the Playstation 2.  With the PS2 no longer being the focal point, it has certainly allowed the PSP to grow much more.  We're now seeing much better games and much more expanded games.  The library is still fairly short on fantastic games, but at least now it's growing as a gaming system.  If you're interested in a PSP, now is not a bad time to grab one as there are better games being released and it's been built to last.The PSP is a good handheld device.  With a volley of games to choose from all across the spectrum, the PSP really does serve as a good gaming choice for everyone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2008"}

The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

And then the game just ends, with no real reward...about 5 hours after you started.

There's also the stupid \"exploding monsters\" which are a tired staple of FPS.  Did I mention that one of them is a giant tower that slowly rotates and farts out alien bugs?* Squad-based tactics?  Sure, that amounts to telling people where to go (they never listen) and telling them whom to shoot at (because it's not obvious?).* Non-destructible environments.  Sure, the fuel trucks can be shot.  There are crates you can break, but there's nothing in them.  The environment is largely static.* There's also a rail game component.  With monsters that shoot projectiles at you.  I've never seen this before. All that's missing is the \"shoot me in the head\" game.* You can't affect anything the game doesn't want you to shoot at.  You can empty an entire clip into your allies heads, shoot their vehicles, and basically act like a moron without affecting the game.  And when I get bored, I can really be a big moron.* You can jump about two inches in the air.  There is no purpose to jumping.  You can't scale any environment, except to slowly fall down a zip-line like you're on an elevator.  In the one area where you can fall to your death, the final boss battle, your dead body stutter-steps down to the ground. This is a fabulous piece of code, let me tell you.* It's short.  I mean, really short.  Even for me.  I tried to play the game on a much harder difficulty, but the crashing actually drove me so insane that I wanted to at least get my money worth.  So I played it on easy to get it over with.There are some redeeming traits, but none good enough to make the game worth buying.  It's got some interesting environments, including a battle in a suburban neighborhood.  At one point you receive air support from a chopper flying overhead while you're duking it out on the ground.  And the rail gun battles, while rote, are at least scripted to be exciting. There's also the amusing, ripped from the headlines dialogue.  None of that saves this stinking fetid pile of excrement.In the era of Bioshock, Halo 3, and Gears of War, Blacksite is proof that graphics alone are not enough to make a great game.  The developers should be ashamed of themselves, but I can't tell you who they are because while I was forced to watch the end credits...the game crashed.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2008"}

This was my first time playing a Hitman game so I was anxious to try it out. You can't really go wrong for free but I am EXTREMELY happy I didn't spend anything on this title. Biggest dislike is the uneven gameplay .......... Its almost jaw dropping how some enemies are alerted from a block away when you take down a bad guy (I'm talking about silent kills). Other times when you choose to subdue someone you can do it within close proximity of several, YET from a block away somehow everyone knows when you throw a punch or use a weapon with a silencer (I'd think they both would tough to tell). That's some great perception by the AI !!  Graphics are good and I like the stealthy feel to the game but sometimes it seems more like &#34;trial and error&#34; is the name of the game here.

{"product_name":"B000K9K9AC","description":"WarHawk Bundle with BlueTooth Headset PS3","reviewerName":"Ira Carmel","summary":"This is a good game, but has some major design flaws.","reviewText":"Warhawk for PS3 is a good game.  The online experience creates a very fast paced game environment which is ruined by \"glitchers, and cheaters.\"  None the less, I enjoy playing Warhawk very much.  Also, the ranking up system leaves a bit to be desired.  The game proports to have customizable look and feel for your character and aircraft, however you can only unlock these things after ranking up, which appears to be tedious at best.  I got a couple of rank ups quickly, but was soon disappointed by the unlocked items.  Honestly, I'd rather have had the game content unlocked from the start.From their literature \"You can play the game however you want...\"  implying that you could always choose to drive a tank or always be a ground troop.  However they fail to mention that you'll never make it past certain ranks if this is how you want to play the game, and you won't unlock all of the content.  So, let me say this to Insomnia Games, \"You can't have it both ways, choose to say that you can customize your stuff, or choose to say you can play it any way you want, you can't say both the way it is currently setup.\"What this state of affairs leads to:  Cheating, glitching, and rank up servers.  These servers are dedicated to getting people rank up.  I was reading one forum about flag throwing, so you can increase the number of points you get per game, and I also experienced the \"tank\" glitch myself personally.  This kind of behavior is of course frowned on by the server administrators.  I can't help but think that originally this game probably was going to have a mission oriented single player campaign in which you could also gain rank, and it was scrapped at the last minute because it was too much work, and the deadline was coming up for release.So lets take stock in what we really have.  We have a bunch of hosted games, with fast and furious battles, on a very small number of maps.  This means that the folks in the beta test know these maps so well that new players have a very hard time playing.  Every little trick and nook or cranny in the map is known very well.  The learning curve is steep, and the controls of the airplane are not configurable enough.  I would be very happy if you could customize the look inversion on the gunsight for the airplane, but you can't, so I constantly look the wrong way with the guns.  So what do we have?  4 maps, 3 game types. I can tell you now it will tire quickly as you are repeatly blown up by people who know the maps by the back of their hands.Sincerely,Ira Carmel.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2007"}

Rhodes","summary":"Still Engaging and Fun","reviewText":"When the Disgaea series debuted way back in 2003 it had a unique appeal.  It was something that you just simply didn't see a whole lot of.  It was funny and was charming in a way.  But what made it stand above all else was by far the interesting concepts put forth in the battle system.  Since then, however, Disgaea hasn't really changed much.  Disgaea 4 is the same way.  If you didn't get into Disgaea before, Disgaea 4 isn't going to change your mind.  But if you've stuck with Disgaea since the beginning, you may find something in Disgaea 4.As usual for a Disgaea game, it takes place in the netherworld where you'll likely control demons. Valvatorez was once a powerful tyrant but after losing his powers he has been reduced to being the guy who trains the new Prinnies.  Unfortunately he may soon be out of the job when the corrupt government of the Netherworld decides that they need to exterminate every last Prinny.  It is up to Valvatorez to save the Prinnies.  Compared to the last couple of entries, Disgaea 4's story is actually quite political.  This doesn't mean it forsakes its characters, but those not too big on political humor or satire, may not find Disgaea 4 to be that enjoyable.  There are a lot of ridiculous jokes weaved into the tale along with some clever parodies and satirical observations.  You'll find bigger and better stories in several other JRPG's but at least it's enjoyable to a degree.  The characters are likable and charming and some of the dialog is funny.  What you may not appreciate right off hand is the voice acting itself.  Disgaea has always gone for over the top voice acting and at times it has been annoying.  You can opt to listen to the dialog in Japanese if you wish, or you can turn it off all together.  The story is still told through, for the most part, small skits that involve character portraits standing across from each other.  A charm of Disgaea that has yet to actually grow tiresome or old.  All told the story might not keep your attention but some of the funny lines will.  But nothing will hold your attention like the gameplay.Disgaea has always been known for it's unique gameplay structure.  And if you've played previous games in the series you won't find too many additions here.  Like your typical strategy RPG Disgaea has you sending characters into the field of battle where you battle your enemies in phases.  The game is much more complex than most Strategy RPGs, even today.  As I said, if you've played the series before you'll have no trouble slipping right in, but newcomers will find themselves lost.  The game slowly piles on new concepts for you to grasp.  First introducing you to the basics of attacks before slowly introducing you to special moves and defending.  It then jumps into some of the more interesting concepts of the gameplay, such as the Geo Symbols.  The Geo Symbols have always been what separates Disgaea from other games.  When in battle you'll no doubt notice that certain tiles are certain colors and blocks on them.  Each Geo Symbol will give any color tile it sits on a specific buff or debuff.  It can be something as simple as \"Recovery 40%\" or something as damaging as \"Ally Damage 20%\".  It might even be something different such as providing you with 50% more experience.  This aspect of the Geo Panels has often made some of Disgaea's battles feel a little puzzle based.  The enemies are not always something to worry about.  So are the different tiles in battle.  And Disgaea 4 is relentless at times.  If you go rushing off into too many battles it isn't shy about punishing you.  If you don't take time to meticulously learn some of the gameplay mechanics the game is likely to be much more challenging than it has to be.Along with the Geo Symbols, Disgaea 4 brings back other familiar things.  The item world is back, allowing you to dive in and go deep to raise the level of your weapons.  The item world has been expanded upon a bit.  Every five floors you now get to branch off and explore more than you otherwise would.  There are still mystery rooms filled with goodies and surprises too.  The item world pretty much showcases another thing Disgaea is about: Grinding.  If you've been coddled by RPGs where you can pretty much do anything, Disgaea 4 will change that quickly.  This is a game that actually expects you to grind.  And if you don't, it WILL punish you for it.  The good news is, the gameplay is engaging enough that grinding doesn't feel like a chore.  Especially because going into the item world presents a unique experience each time.  You won't find a lot of floors the same and the Geo Panels and Symbols are randomly generated.Disgaea 4 hasn't changed much from its predecessors at all.  Much of it will be familiar to fans.  At times its more like putting on a pair of old gloves and finding they still fit perfectly.  If you haven't been much of a Disgaea fan, there isn't anything here that will likely turn you into one.  Disgaea probably isn't going to reach much higher.  It's still unique in its own way, but at some point it may have to do more than just add on small tidbits to its gameplay.There is one area where perhaps it wouldn't have been so bad for Disgaea to progress just a little.  The presentation.  The sprites here are perfectly redone in HD, but it doesn't look all that different from what you've already seen.  All the artwork is pretty much exactly the same.  It is definitely noticeable, however.  The game gives you the option to toggle between HD and SD sprite settings. Needless to say if you're playing on an HD TV then the difference is obvious.  Still, it's hard to shake the fact that even in HD Disgaea 4 looks exactly like the three games which came before it.  More so than the graphics, however, Disgaea still uses isometric maps where you can only shift the perspective left or right.  But you can't zoom in or zoom out or tilt the perspective.  On some maps its fine but on others you might lose track of your characters or some of the enemies this way.The music on the other hand, actually sounds really good.  The voice acting may, at times, grate on your nerves, but the soundtrack isn't likely to.  It fits the game perfectly.  You will also hear a couple of remixed tracks from previous entries.If you've enjoyed previous Disgaea outings then there is no harm in giving Disgaea 4 a try.  The change in the story's themes may not be for everyone at first, but it still maintains a lot of its humor to make it easier to swallow.  Either way, in regards to its storytelling it is certainly a step up from Disgaea 3.  If you've never been into Disgaea you're not going to change your mind with this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2011"}

So I was looking for equal enjoyment with this expansion. I didn't get that same feeling I had with the original as I did with this one. The story is kind of bland, as well as the new party members. The only new character I liked was Anders,the others didn't really catch my attention like the old ones did. And why in the world did they choose Ogrhen as the returning character? I would have rather had anyone other than him. The game play is the same of course. New spells and skills are forgettable and I found myself using the old ones more often than the new. The story is worth playing the game, though it is not too great. There also seems to be some issues with previous DLC that have yet to be fixed. I really hope too see another expansion for DA:O, and with that expansion all the characters from the previous 2 available and a better story than this. This one would have been better as a new downloadable side quest to play through before you kill the Arch Demon in my opinion.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2010"}

Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords delivers a brand new type of game that pushes the puzzle genre to a previously unseen level.","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Incredibly addictive mash of puzzle and RPG elements","reviewText":"With all the various puzzle games available for the DS, there isn't really all that much anymore that can make one stick out more than another.  Puzzle Quest manages to stand on it's own thanks to it being an incredibly addictive mash of puzzle and RPG elements that set it apart from the rest of the pack.  Starting out as a typical RPG, you perform combat by partaking in puzzles that are reminiscent of Bejeweled.  You take turns moving pieces around and the game even requires some strategy to it as well.  The fact that the puzzle and RPG elements are combined here, and that they actually work as well, is reason enough to pick up Puzzle Quest alone.  The game's overall presentation is fresh and the main quest is incredibly long and also features some incredibly addictive puzzle gameplay that will keep you playing Puzzle Quest for quite some time.  The only downsides to Puzzle Quest are that the puzzle field is cramped on the bottom screen of the DS, and it's easy to miss something in the heat of gameplay.  Not to mention that many of the enemies throughout the game can be very frustrating, but the good definitely outweighs the bad here thanks to the addictive gameplay.  All in all, Puzzle Quest may sound like an odd hybrid of two genres that have seen well worn entires on handhelds, but make no mistake that this one of the most fun experiences you'll have either way on the DS right now.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2007"}

{"product_name":"B003P9C6QY","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"Red Faction Returns to its Roots...","reviewText":"Red Faction Guerrilla was a big step in the evolution of the franchise... going from FPS to a more Sandbox style game. Despite its success at drawing in a new crowd of fans for the franchise, Red Faction Armageddon takes a step backwards to return to its roots. In doing so this may alienate new fans of the franchise and Sandbox style, but may appeal more to the traditional FPS gamer.GAMEPLAYArmageddon changes it up from Guerrilla by going with a over the shoulder Shooter style vs the Sandbox element the previous title had. Instead of running missions and driving around to pick up objectives you are given a clear cut path to travel. Armed with a variety of weapons you find and can upgrade along the way, you will shoot, destroy and rebuild (only to blow it up again!) your way through the campaign. Armageddon has a linear feel tot he game and does little to change that feeling up. While there are sometimes two paths you can take, it always leads you to the same place and puts you through similar trials(or just leads to a secret). Despite being linear with little in the ways of exploration, the devastation this game brings is very enjoyable. On top of your regular arsenal of weapons you have perhaps my second favorite weapon in the game.. the magnet gun (as seen in the demo). This gun is just pro at causing mass devastation and squishing enemies between scrap. Acquisition of your weapons like most shooters occurs linearly through gameplay. Upgrades are tied to completion percentage to prevent you from becoming to overpowered.Overall the gameplay is a lot of fun.. Linear yes.. but very entertaining as the game almost taunts you to kill as stylishly and destructive as you can. There is plenty to destroy, tons of enemies to have your way with so in the end you will be left satisfied.GRAPHICSThe graphics here are not anything mind blowing.. but they are very nice. The real meat and potatoes here is the physics. While not perfect the destructive and rebuilding elements of the game is what really sells the effects. There are some cases where objects are rigid and do not bend nor break but for the most part, once you see your first large building almost implode on itself you'll be in awe.SOUND/STORYSound effects are fairly solid. Weapons have a fair feel and sound to them but the voice acting is a bit weak in my book. Not bad just could of been better I think. Perhaps a lot of that has to do with the storyline. It is very generic almost existing to take you from A to B, but I don't think people tune into Red Faction to get drama so as long as there is reason behind your actions I am fine with it. Besides, a reason to go from A to B means more stuff to blow up!REPLAY/LENGTHReplay value I think is decent. There are some online modes included with the game the main one being infestation mode. Basically survival mode as you try to survive waves of mobs while using the environment to your advantage and mix in some objectives. There also is a mode where you try to rack up as much damage as possible within a set time(Ruin Mode), but I have not checked it out yet honestly. The campaign itself is short.. You can probably breeze through it in 5-7 hours if you just Rambo through BUT there is a plus here.. Game plus mode that is! Once the game is completed you can re-start the campaign with all your existing stuff to further upgrade gear or just see how much more chaos you can cause.OVERALL 81% ... B-Red Faction Armageddon is not a bad game by any means. It took a few steps back from the previous title, but returned to its roots with gameplay in doing so. Storyline and Sandbox took a back seat to Linear progression and in your face action. This might work for some and not for others. With that said RF: Armageddon is a game one really needs to play to see if they enjoy it. If you are a fan of the originals you will feel at home with this title. If you are more into sandbox style this game might upset you with its linear, closed-in feel. With that said I give the game an 81%.. a solid game but not for everyone.**NOTE: If you are on the boarder about the game, check out the demo to see if you like the feel of the game. It does a fair job giving you a taste of the arsenal you will have and destructive capabilities.**NOTE: This game has perhaps the best weapon to date... Mr. Toots. Once you unlock Mr. Toots you won't stop laughing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2011"}

{"product_name":"B004FYJFNA","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason \"&#51228;&#51060;&#49832;\"","summary":"More of a corridor, but great fun.","reviewText":"UPDATE: (3/26/2012) Beat ME3 in 32 hours with all side quest completed and I'm now playing it again after beating ME2 again to carry my brand new spanking character through ME3.THE ENDING: Wow, this ending has gotten people angry.  personally i kept hearing about how bad the ending was before i got to it, and that might be why i actually liked the ending.  I will agree it needs more closure.  I want to see what happened to the worlds i saved or failed to save with a nice little final video. and what the happened to my Shepard.  If you know the ending just ends on you, then you wont be caught off guard, and the build up before the end is riveting, i think i played 5+ hours straight when i got to the end.  Just know everything up until the end is great.ROUND 2 THOUGHTS:  ME2 is more about the characters and the final Reaper battle feels like a end goal, but its more about the characters you meet along the way.  ME3 is about the war and the choices you make are about alliances.  Some choices will kill off an entire race so watch out, i killed off my favorite race accidentally and felt really bad about it for the rest of the day. that's the Power of ME3, nothing like that existed in ME2 for me.  The Paragon choices in here feel much less cut and dry then in ME2, and all the points go into one big pile of reputation points, which i liked way more. i don't feel obligated to chose only evil or good choices to make sure my persuasion is high enough in the next scene.DAILOG TREE:  One thing I've noticed since i just beat ME2 and restarted ME3 is the lack of control i have in a dialog. Expect Shepard to talk a lot more then in ME2 before you get to choose any response. If feels like your dialog choices are more about the choices and not the dialog during the main story segments, unless your just talking to one of the ship mates then you have as much control as before.END UPDATEI feel this game is more of a corridor, with most of the choice from the last game influencing this one then, then my choices in this game.  It does make me wish i had a Xbox so i could fully experience my influence from game one to game three.  that said still loving it. I did buy the Collector Edition but gameplay wise it should be the same.  Only a few added DLC items and a Mission which is on sale right now.Story: Great, and yes it's much darker.  but feels right for how the story has progressed thus far.  Side quest are also a plenty, and many different new and old characters to talk to.Sound: Voice acting is as great as ME2.  the music is a nice touch for the cinematic scenes, but ofter underscored in the rest of the game.Graphics: If you thought the demo looked bad, then you be happy to hear that really the worst looking level i've been to is the level in the demo.  The foreground usually looks good, on par with ME2, nice lighting and textures, fully rendered 3D visuals, but anything in the background is often 2D animations.  If you want an example, in the demo or first level look at the ground, you'll see people running out of the building in 2D animation like a 'metal slug' game.  Luckily most of the following levels aren't in as grand of a scale so the visuals look fine.  But definitely looks like a outdated engine.Combat: Same as ME2, but will agree with other reviews that going into cover is often clunky. there is more of a emphasis on melee combat in this game though. fun but nothing not done in other games, and done better.RPG Elements: much stronger in this game, lots of Weapon modifications, Suit and Money that make sense.  always felt the money in ME2 didn't have a purpose.  Leveling can be done at anytime, which is really nice as I'm a compulsive leveling person.  and you get Exp for doing everything, even opening the door will sometimes give you 150Exp.Character Import: Worked fine, i started at level 25 and leaved up from there. The character does look slightly different from my ME2 game, so i had to tweak her a little. but interestingly she does look a little older in this game.  Took a little to get used to, but neet effect.Glitches: Some frame rate, texture popping, and some times during cinematic scenes people will just appear.  but nothing game breaking for me.  Hasn't frozen once, but it has stuttered.Conclusion: If you played ME2 then get this game, you might want to wait till it comes down in price a little because EA has already released a $10 DLC mission/character. That said if you haven't played ME2, pick that up first or you'll be totally lost.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2012"}

But as one might imagine, things go wrong. Dr. Grey gets murdered, and Maya is suspected to be the killer. Wright once again has to defend Maya.Although this is a sequel to the original \"Phoenix Wright,\" players can still play this game without having played the original. The first case on this game is a brief introduction to the gameplay system, in which players must cross-examine witnesses to the crime and declare objections when they find something in their testimony that doesn't match the prosecution's arguments.Still, it really is better for fans to play the original game before the sequel. Some of the long-time favorite characters from the first Phoenix Wright game appear for some even bigger crack-up jokes in the fourth case, and most newbies won't pick up on all the gags.Although all four cases in \"Justice for All\" are top-notch, the fourth case really has one of the best stories I've ever seen in a visual novel game. The case features a villain so diabolically evil that he really puts the main character's stable life into complete jeopardy. It's a fantastic, emotionally wrenching final case that really taxes on people who try to solve it.With so many great features in the game, there is only one thing that gamers didn't quite enjoy--the Psyche-lock system. New to the Phoenix Wright series, there are certain points in the game in which Phoenix Wright has to interrogate witnesses when they are lying. In order to clear up certain contradictions with witnesses' accounts, Wright has to show the proper evidence to the witness to \"unlock\" their Psyche-lock so that they can give an accurate account to Wright.However, if a player makes a mistake, they lose health. The trouble with the game is that if a player loses too much health, they will have to go through the trial without losing health. If health runs down to zero percent, the game will end. And witnesses often have multiple Psyche-locks, leaving Wright to endure the grueling feat of unlocking all the locks with all the evidence he can get.But as I said, the ending is definitely worth the effort. The story of \"Justice for All\" is one of best I've ever read. If anyone finds it in a used game shop, they should look into buying \"Justice for All\" for one of the most dramatic and earth-shattering plots in a video game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0017HIIWW","description":"Transformed and unleashed, Sonic races to save the world...and himself. Sonic the Hedgehog is on an adventure unlike any other. Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience. Merging blistering 2D action with meticulously rendered 3D environments, players race through intriguing locations across the globe as Sonic to save a chaotic world.The other side of SonicSonic and his alter ego Werehog.View larger.Collect rings for Ring Energy.View larger.Swing into action with Werehog.View larger.A NewSonica New StoryOn a quest for world domination Sonic nemesis Dr. Eggman has managed to steal the chaos emeralds once again and this time drained them of their power. As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new modified game engine,Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.","reviewerName":"Jean Duque","summary":"It's ok but I wouldn't recommend it","reviewText":"Good game for a while, but I'll recommend you to don't buy it, rent it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2010"}

Wario, Mario's jealous rival, plays the hero--well, kind of--in his first console adventure.Money TroubleIn the depths of Wario's castle lies the plunder of his many adventures on the Game Boy, Game Boy Advance and elsewhere.While Wario kicks back in his crib, enjoying the videogame equivalent of bling-bling, a mysterious black jewel in his trove transforms gems into monsters. His wealth, which was once a source of pride, becomes his greatest foe. Now, Wario must scramble to recover his riches.Cranky CapitalistStep into an alternate world filled with quirky puzzles, swarming enemies and lots and lots of loot. You'll learn a multitude of cool moves as Wario progresses in the game. You can punch, kick, jump, grab monsters and objects and inhale surrounding coins like a two-legged vacuum cleaner. The game even has a wrestling game-ish feel, as you can string together combo attacks that The Rock would give his eyebrow for.Early on, you will learn the significance of special sticky balls that dot the landscape. Wario can cling to these balls to navigate tough spots, reach new areas, and even fight bosses.You can freely bash and manipulate your surroundings to discover secrets. For instance, you can pick up a stone pillar and swing it at your foes or spin a fallen monster to activate a switch that raises a gate.Perplexing PuzzlesThe side-scrolling action remains true to the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games that made Wario famous, but Wario's incredible range of motion gives him newfound freedom.Finding treasure often calls for flipping a colored switch, then searching high and low for the activated chest. Considering the size of the worlds and the plethora of hiding places, this can be quite a feat. When it comes to moolah, though, no task is too tough for Wario.Trap doors transport you to hidden worlds that offer mind-bending puzzles. Using your noggin' will yield some important items. A colorful band of fairies offers game info and advice throughout your adventure.GraphicsThe development team at Treasure have stamped Wario's Nintendo GameCube debut with colorful and vibrant graphics. Wario's signature look comes to life like never before. From his arrogant waddle to his purple trousers, Wario is immediately recognizable. Charles Martinet, the actor famous as the voice of Mario, brings a special zest to Wario's growls, chortles and guffaws.From gleaming castle walls to gloomy gravestones,Wario Worldis crammed with beautifully realized details. The action is relentless but the frame rate never falters, even when the screen is packed with dozens of enemies that explode into showers of coins when defeated.Wario Worldwill test both your brains and your button-mashing skills.","reviewerName":"Mark E.

{"product_name":"B0050SXLQC","description":"","reviewerName":"phoongdan","summary":"A solid 3-star review...","reviewText":"If you look at the review distribution, there are a lot of 5-star reviews and 1-star reviews, with not so much in the middle. I found this to be, however, a very mediocre game that is certainly not worthy of 5-stars but not deserving of a 1-star rating either. I think what you have here are die hard fans of the series either very disappointed (leading to the 1-star reviews) or vigorously defending the RE series (leading to the 5-star reviews).I've read 50 plus reviews on here and waited until I finished the game before writing this review. I can tell you for a certainty that there are a lot of reviews on here that didn't play enough of the game to justify their review. For example, many people said in their review how you need to beat all 3 campaigns to unlock the Agent Hunt extra. Wrong. You only need to beat one campaign and the Agent Hunt option will unlock.I beat both the Leon and Chris campaign and played about half of the Jake campaign before I got bored with the game and decided I'm done with it. And unlike RE4 and RE5 which I still have, I'm going to be selling back RE6 which at the time of this writing is already about $20 below the original release price. That's a pretty fast drop 3 weeks after release for an RE game! So clearly many people were disappointed with the game.I liked the Leon campaign best which was surprising a little as I expected I would like the more action-oriented Chris campaign. But after the 1st chapter of the Leon campaign it was basically all action. What I liked better about the Leon campaign though was that it didn't seem to drag on like the Chris campaign did. The Chris campaign had way too much \"chasing Ada\" in it and felt very repetitive during Chapters 4 and 5.Everyone has mentioned the overuse of the QTE's and I'm no exception. Hated it! Way too many. However, there were a few new things I did like. Like the new directional feature (the golden arrow accessed via the \"L-2\" button) to show the direction you need to travel, very good implementation for this game. Another cool implementation is being able to shoot while lying on your back - this came in handy several times during battle. However, like many others I too have found the new inventory control feature confusing, though after a few hours of playtime I did finally figure out how it works. I still like the old system better of carrying items in a suitcase, and RE4 did it best I think in that you could upgrade your suitcase to carry more items as the game progressed. However, I see what Capcom was trying to do here by allowing you to access all of your inventory during gameplay rather than having to wait until you finish gameplay and then have access to it. But the implementation of it is awkward and not user-friendly. The key I think is to leave a couple of slots available so that when a battle ensues you can pick-up specialty items like grenade launcher ammo for example, and not have to fumble with your inventory and delete things you don't need. So I think Capcom did make some improvements to this game over the previous RE games, though some of them (like the inventory system) were not well-implemented.I think what I missed the most were the notes and journals that you could read and collect from RE4 or RE5 - to me this always added great value to the story. Now you are looking for and shooting blue stars that unlock parts of the story. But I think it makes much more sense to find these items and read them during the flow of the game. You should be uncovering these story aspects at the point in the story that it makes sense to learn about them, not an hour or hours later after you stop playing and go back to read what you found. But I know many people don't care about the storyline and just play for the action, which is probably why Capcom made this change. But for me, I replayed RE4 and RE5 just to gain the journals and notes so I could understand more parts of the story, but with RE6 I didn't even bother.I also don't like the skill system - this is borrowed from several other action games where you can enhance skills and abilities of your character or the game play. I much prefer the old system of collecting money and upgrading my weapons with the money.When I heard that there would be three campaigns with intertwined stories I thought it was going to be a really well-developed storyline, but what we got was boring, repetitive, and discombobulated. RE4 and RE5 I played on each of those for about one month. Replaying because I was interested in doing so. I played this game for 2 weekends and finished nearly all of it and have no desire to replay any of it.FINAL GRADE: C","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2012"}

It's pretty hard to calibrate those things to work how you want them to. I almost feel like the Wii version did a slightly better job with the aiming calibration.But, once you get it working in a way you like, it works great.I highly recommend cheap gun attachments.For the price, if you already have a PS move, this is a must have to get some good use out of them.Also - The 3d support of this game is pretty solid.

That's right folks, they're here to save the world again, as the Ghostbusters video game has finally been unleashed, and be glad that it has. Playing as a young protege on the first day of the job, you accompany our favorite wise-cracking ghost wranglers as New York City is thrown under siege by a bevy of ghosts and other creepy baddies. Technically speaking, the game looks great despite some minor graphical glitches, and even though the somewhat cumbersome controls take time to get used to, wrangling ghosts ends up proving to be a fun and rewarding experience. Adding to the fun that Ghostbusters ends up conjuring is a funny script with plenty of witty dialogue written by original film scribes Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd, and to make matters even better, Ramis, Aykroyd, Bill Murray, and Ernie Hudson all lend their voices to the characters they played way back when, along with other stars of the film Annie Potts and William Atherton, as well as Alyssa Milano as a pivotal character whom Venkman takes a fancy to. Multiplayer modes provide even more fun as well, with the only real drawbacks of the game being that it is a little too short, and the combat itself can be a little too repetitive. Still though, if you are a Ghostbusters fan in the very least, you can easily overlook these flaws and still get plenty of enjoyment out of what they find here. All in all, Ghostbusters is a pure enjoyable blast, and if you grew up with the films, cartoon, toys, or whatever; this game is a must-have.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2009"}
{"product_name":"B002I0EMUO","description":"Product OverviewFrom the critically acclaimed director, Hideo Kojima, a new 3D   experience re-imagined from one of the most popular Metal Gear Solid   titles from the    past, comes METAL GEAR SOLID SNAKE EATER 3D.In the aftermath of the Second World War, the world was torn in two   between East and West. It was the beginning of a new era- the Cold War.October 16, 1962. The President of the United States received word   that the Soviet Union had deployed nuclear missiles in Cuba. The world    trembled in fear as the prospect of nuclear war loomed ever closer.   After days of tense negotiations, the Soviets finally agreed on the 28th   to withdraw their missiles from Cuban soil. With the resolution of this   incident, later to be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, it    seemed that humanity had survived yet another threat to its existence.However, there was a secret condition in the deal that put an end to   the crisis. Nokolai Stepanovich Sokolov, a Soviet scientist who had   defected    to the West, was to be sent back to the Soviet Union. The U.S.   government agreed to this stipulation, and returned Sokolov back to his   native    land. Little did they know that Sokolov was to be the designer of a   nightmarish weapon. Now, with Sokolov back in their hands, the Soviets    are ready to resume its development. If this weapon is completed, it   will mark the beginning of a new age of fear.August 1964. Realizing at last the urgency of the situation, the CIA   forms a plan to recapture Sokolov. They dispatch the covert FOX unit    to Sokolov's research facility, located to the south of the great   Soviet fortress of Groznyj Grad. Led by former SAS member Major Zero,   FOX is a    next-generation special-forces unit that operates both as a   specialized combat group and as a covert intelligence outfit. The FOX   unit's modus    operandi is to send a single agent, backed by radio support from afar,   into enemy territory to carry out solo sneaking missions.August 24. A lone soldier swoops down from out of the blue. The man's code name is Naked Snake.FeaturesExperience an all-new re-interpretation of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, previously released on      PlayStation 2 with over 4 million copies sold, in 3D for the first time ever.Auto-stereoscopic 3D viewing capability that endeavors to create a rich jungle world with natural depth in      settings of trees, rock/stone, water and more.'Photo Camo' system utilizing the built-in camera technology of the   hardware bringing customized stealth      and camouflage options to the player. By snapping a photo in the   real world, players will be able to use the same image as a camouflage   pattern      applied to Snake's uniform within the game.Utilizing the Gyro Sensor, players will become one with Snake   through specialized tilt mechanics throughout      the game design. As Snake climbs trees, or traverses bridges and   other environmental obstacles, players will be in danger of falling   based on the      balancing of the system.An intuitive menu utilizes the touch screen for quick and easy equipping of items and weapons.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"A Fantastic Game Gets a Subpar Port","reviewText":"Snake Eater.  The third Metal Gear Solid game originally debuted on the Playstation 2 in 2004, with an updated Subsistence version that came around a year later.  The game won high praise, particularly for its characters and storytelling.  It has seen numerous releases at this point.  The original, the subsistence release, the essential collection and the recent HD collection.  With the 3DS, this marks the fifth time players could potentially jump in.  How does it stack up on the 3DS and is it worth the buy (especially for those who have the HD collection)?It would take a little too much time to talk about the plot of the Metal Gear Solid saga.  The third one in particular takes place before all the other games in the series and mainly focuses on \"Naked Snake.\"  An operative sent into USSR to rescue a scientist known as Sokolov from the clutches of a brutal man named Volgin.  He is aided by a few allies, including Major Tom, his mentor \"The Boss\" and paramedic.  When the mission to save Sokolov ends in failure and betrayal, Snake is sent back into the jungles to stop Volgin once again, as well as to wipe out a special faction known as \"The Cobra Unit\" (hence, \"Snake Eater\").  On paper the plot is fairly simplistic, but Metal Gear Solid 3 has quite a good story filled to the brim with incredible characters and moments that'll really tug at your heart strings.  It is nowhere near as complex (or as convoluted) as the plots for Metal Gear Solid 2 or Metal Gear Solid 4... and that's probably why the story in this one works so well.  It's a simpler story but still has its moments and twists that'll blow you away.  But thanks to the emotional attachment we can make to these characters and the environment we're placed in, there is so much more than just an intricate plot at hand.  This alone has caused a great deal of fans to label Metal Gear Solid 3 the best in the franchise (myself included).  It just has the most encompassing story.  That's not to say there won't be cut scenes that drag... but there certainly aren't nearly as many.  And best of all, it's perfectly fine to start with Snake Eater as your first Metal Gear Solid game because it predates the rest of the story.  It might even serve as a decent introduction for those who haven't played the series before.Although, it should be known that the gameplay to Metal Gear Solid 3 is complex.  The original Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Solid 2 had you using a radar as you snuck around avoiding the enemy.  Here, you use camouflage to blend into your environment, with a camo index showing you how well you blend in.  The higher the index the more hidden you are.  You'd think this would make Metal Gear Solid 3 a difficult game, but the game is hardly difficult at all.  Keeping yourself hidden is simpler than it looks.  If anything the downside is that you may find yourself in the menu often to change camo.  In fact, if you get your index high enough, enemies could be standing nearly on top of you before they realize something is awry.On the other hand, the new controls on the 3DS will take time to get adjusted to.  This is especially true if you're used to the consoles.  You can easily aim and shoot in first person, but the lack of a second analog stick makes camera control feel awkward at first.  Instead you control the camera by using the face buttons while you use the d-pad and touch screen to change items.  At first this control scheme is going to be awkward.  If ever there was a reason to buy that Circle Pad Pro, this would probably be it.  It takes time to get used to, and you can't help but admit that playing the game using an actual controller is just all around better.  The game compensates, but it doesn't separate from the fact that the controls are clunky.The 3D itself is fairly good, however.  In fact, it may be some of the best 3D to date on the system.  You'll certainly be immersed in the world here.  This is especially apparent when you're crawling through grass in first person.  Of course, because the game was originally not in stereoscopic 3D to begin with, you won't really find yourself in dire of need of using it.  But at least it doesn't detract from the experience.  However, it does do one of the things that 3D CAN be good for in a game... it has made the game world itself more immersive.  It doesn't impact gameplay, but it certainly enhances the aesthetic experience of Metal Gear Solid 3.  .  The game was already impressive looking on the Playstation 2, and it continues to be impressive looking here.  The 3D just happens to add an extra layer onto that.  It most certainly shows that some games can be converted to 3D (that aren't made by Nintendo) and done well.On the other hand, the gyro controls most certainly could've been done without.  Having to tilt or move the 3DS while crossing a bridge or being on a tree trunk just feels awkward.  Especially because you don't have to go across surfaces where you balance yourself that often to begin with.  It's more a distraction than an actual additional feature.  And if you intend to play with the 3D on then the gyro controls really don't add to the experience.  They're more likely to take away from it.But, of course, there is the big elephant in the room.  Metal Gear Solid 3 has had SEVERAL releases.  The HD Collection just came out a couple of months before this release.  And if you got your hands on that, is there really a need to pick up this one?  It really depends on if you want MGS3 on the go and if the 3D alone will make you want it.  The game isn't bad but the 3DS isn't the best way to enjoy it.  Especially because it lacks so many features the console version has.  It's impressive to see the game done on a handheld, but the controls aren't good enough and all the extras you got before with the HD Collection or Subsistence simply aren't here.  Even worse, the HD Collection comes at the same price.As great as Metal Gear Solid 3 is, nearly every version released before the 3DS version is superior.  Not only are the controls better, but all the extras are included in full.  The 3D effects in the game are brilliant and the story remains untouched, but one thing is simple: Metal Gear Solid 3 simply worked better on the console.  It's an impressive feat that the full game--cutscenes and all--is on a handheld, but with better versions coming either cheaper or roughly the same price it's a wonder if the 3D alone can really salvage the package.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2012"}

As in Oblivion, you get to create a character to suit your style and combat techniques, but now instead of magic and swords, you get the good ol' magnums and laser guns. I'm gonna lay down some pointers on what I think of this game.Starting with more of the good parts.1: The Mojave: You get to walk around into a bomb battered Mojave Wasteland, which (presumably) is a very extensive playfield. The area gives you countless places to go to and explore. You get to be in the desert, small (and possibly very run down) towns, and, of course, the New Vegas Strip! Welcome to Sin City that just got radioactive.2: The Quests: The main storyline isn't all that this game has. Along with that, it has numerous side quests that make up for part of the 40 hours of total gameplay. Each quest has its own little twist, keeping things interesting.3: The Combat: Guns a' blazin', bombs a' boomin', and lasers a' wizzin'; the combat in this game is intense, and for those of you who are Fallout 3 vets, you know what I mean. VATS hasn't changed, but the combat had been tweaked slightly to get some adrenaline going.Now there are warnings that I have to put out there(these aren't exactly cons of the game, but they should be noted)1: Soooooo...Now What?: The game does have a bit of a slow start, and for good reason. If you are one of those people, like me, who don't usually pay attention to(or plainly skip) the logistics people are giving you and want to get right to the action; goooood luck. EVERY. LITTLE. SENTENCE. COUNTS!!! You are going to lose yourself in the storyline if you skip through dialogs and story plots, and since this is a role-playing game, every action that you do will affect the rest of the game.2: Don't Let That 9mm Burn a Hole In Your Holster: Yeah, you get a gun, and you have stuff to shoot, but seriously wait until you level up a bit before you go on a killing spree. Having a 9mm really doesn't do anything when you got 4 badies shooting at you with Miniguns; you won't be a corpse, you'll be chunks. There is a strategy to all the action, keep that in mind.3: Bugged, Glitched, You Name It: This game isn't perfect, it does have some glitches. While a good portion of these bugs are exploits, some may cause your game to crash (which is an absoulute pain when you just got to level 30). It is smart to look up the list of bugs on the web to get a sense of what could happen. If you want to challenge yourself, avoind peeking at the exploit section. Or you can just go to Xbox Live (or whatever they have for PS3) and patch it up; your choice. Also, after a while of gameplay, the loading time does get gradually longer. A good way to fix it is just to save the game, turn off the console, and load it all back up so you don't get too impatient.And those are the points I wanted to put out. For those of you starting fresh on the series (Fallout and Bethesda) hold on to your hats and get ready for a nuclear blast. Fort those of you who are Oblivion junkies, it's the same idea, but tweaked a bit. And for those of you who mastered Fallout 3, you're taking the plane from Washington and stopping at New Vegas.Enjoy!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2010"}

However, it isn't as much of a return to those fallout games as Obsidian has said it is.  But it is still a great game.  The faction system is a nice touch but I wish they would have stuck to reputation and done away with Karma completely.  The writing and voice acting is top-notch, the locations are great and more diverse and sprawling than what we had in Fallout 3.  The game engine is the same so while things are different shapes and colors they are still the same boring textures but they did a good job of trying to improve them.  Hardcore mode is a nice challenge as well, and the weapon aiming is significantly improved.  Harvesting items and crafting items feels under-developed to me.  If you aren't playing on hardcore you won't need to craft food/meds and some of the crafting items can be hard to find.  Overall I felt the actual types of items you could craft wasn't as diverse as it could have been.  Essentially it is ammo, food, a few poisons and a few chems and that is pretty much it.Now, the bad (and the reason I give the game 3 stars instead of 5).  This game is horribly buggy.  Even more so than Fallout 3.  It is truly horrible and in some cases unplayable.  It really is a sad thing that they would release a game with these problems.  The physics are buggy, the game locks up a lot, save files get corrupted, items and characters get stuck in the scenery, quests break, audio and video doesn't always sync up and there is a lot of slow down and framerate stutter.  I can understand some bugs in a game this big but I think it is unforgivable to release a game in this condition.

The race to rescue Chroma City has just begun, and only de Blob can save the world from a black-and-white future.Gameplay: de Blob's Primary Goalde Blobis a 3D platformer where players use the Wii Remote/Nunchuck combo to maneuver their hero, de Blob. Equal parts amorphous blob of paint, struggling artist, revolutionary and juvenile delinquent, de Blob's goal is to replace the drab, lifeless gray coloring that the I.N.K.T. Corporation has imposed on Chroma City and its inhabitants, the Raydians, with a range of vibrant life-giving colors, all the while avoiding and battling the gray-clad forces of the Inkies.Players must acquire paint and hurl de Blob at the buildings, walls, statues, roads and skies above Chroma City. As de Blob bounces around, adding color wherever he lands, his supply of paint is depleted and he begins to dry out. As this happens players must collect more paint and rehydrate in pools and in front of hydrants scattered across the city. As the game starts access is limited to the colors red, blue and yellow, but these can be blended to create a number of other colors. Being able to create and apply these colors becomes important as Chroma City and its inhabitants come to life, and de Blob makes contact with a range of other characters known as the 'Color Revolutionaries' and receives an increasing amount of missions that charge him with splattering color all over town. Success at these mission gains the player point which drives the game forward, eventually leading to a direct assault on Comrade Black's I.N.K.T. fortress guarded by elite Inky soldiers and massive ink turrets.Key Game Features:de Blob- Flip, bounce and paint your way past the all-powerful I.N.K.T.

Just a few of the multiplayer campaigns include:Paint Match- Paint as many buildings as possible and steal points from opponents by re-painting the buildings that they've already covered.Blob on the Run- A variation of 'Capture the Flag,' in this mode only one blob can paint and is pursued by opponents who attempt to slam him into submission and gain the ability to paint and accumulate points themselves.Blob Race- In this mode buildings can only be painted once and are indicated by in-game arrow.

I'll start by saying that de Blob is one of the most unique platformer titles available on any console.  This game is what you would expect if Super Mario Sunshine, Okami, Jet Grind Radio and Katamari Damacy had a love-child together and raised it in a jazz club populated with hippie jelly beans.  You run around the different black-and-white levels playing Blob, who happens to be a blob of paint.  Similar to Okami, the more you play, the more the world around you changes.  As you touch things such as buildings or trees they become drenched in paint matching your current color and vibrant patterns.  There are puzzles along with traditional platform challenges.  It doesn't do anything particularly new, but the combinations of gameplay elements found within are well thought out and very engaging when the paint-the-world aspect comes into play.Graphically, the game is very crisp and smooth.  Musically the game annoys me, but I'm not personally into jazz-club style tunes, so I am a little biased.  For a platformer, I'm really impressed with the camera and I rarely have to fight with the controls to see what I want to see.  Blob controls fairly well, but it took me a bit to get used to the movement mechanics, especially the jumping.  You score points by painting the world around you and you'll gain bonus multipliers if you score combos without touching the ground between objects.  It took me a good couple of hours before I could get the hang of creating combos, wall-sliding, and wall jumping, but it was all very rewarding once I crossed that hurdle.  I just wish that Blob moved a little faster and the wall jumping was a bit more predictable.The Good++> Huge levels to explore, although they tend to be similar.++> An Okami-like change-the-world gameplay mechanic sits at the core of the game.++> Simple but vibrant graphics with smooth gameplay.++> Great presentation and style, even if it is very jazz-heavy.++> Clever challenges and puzzle designs++> Very forgiving gameplay with a steady increase in difficulty.++> This game is a completionists dream-come-true with challenges and rewards for every level.++> Good camera control++> The audio controls let you reduce the volume of the vile easy-listening jazz.The Bad--> Too much jazz.--> Adults will probably care nothing for the storyline, but children will probably enjoy it.--> I really want to see more challenges and puzzles.  There just aren't enough.--> Blob could move faster... but apparently he chooses not to.--> Jumping mechanics are a bit unpredictable--> Completionists might be overwhelmed with the amount of stuff to accomplish.Overall, I am really enjoying this game.  I haven't tried any of the multi-player yet.  The single player though is very strong and it looks to be a fairly long game.  Fans of platformers should definitely consider picking this game up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"Matthew Smith \"oncedead\"","summary":"A great game.","reviewText":"This is a great game that fixes many of the problems in the first Resident Evil games.

I bought the game on the recommendation of a friend, but I didn't turn out to be what I hoped. I thought this was an RPG, but it's really not. It's a first person shooter disguised as an RPG, and even though the game packaging promises adventure and action it really fails to deliver. So here's a list of pros and cons for this game:Pros:- Visually the game is quite well made. On my desktop computer it looks absolutely beautiful.- Open game play, you're not forced to immediately pursue the main story, and after the initial few quests you are free to explore the entire map.- It delivers the theme nicely. Fallout is based on mid twentieth century ideas of a post apocalyptic world. The radio station playing 1940s hits, as well as the themes of the houses and the perception of computers and robots is spot on for the era and I simply loved it.Cons:- Awful gameplay all around. The combat system is that of a poorly made FPS combined with an AP based targeting mechanism named V.A.T.S. The \"shoulder view\" had me completely perplexed. Who is the world thought that this would be even remotely interesting or functional? The only way to play this is would be by zooming in completely. Your characters' movements are awkward, the positioning and bulkiness of your companions is highly irritating and the mouse pointer is very inaccurate. I actually abandoned my companions for several quests simply because trying to fight in a crowded Vault corridor with a dog and super mutant right in front of you just did not work at all. Instead of the V.A.T.S. targeting system they should have made AP based commands for your companions. The very few options you get don't really help at all, so most of the time having your companions with you was detrimental to your gameplay and just not fun at all.- Voice acting was amazing for the first few hours of play. But when you hear the same voice coming from 40 different NPCs it gets really tiresome. I was so happy to hear Liam Neeson would play your character's father, but even his performance bored me to tears eventually. They should have either hired more voice actors OR they should have done what most RPGs have done, which is get audio for main characters, and have text for everyone else. It must have been an ambitious project to give voices to all these NPCs, but in the end it just makes the game seem unimaginative.- The open ended gameplay really destroys the main story. There are no bosses in the main story with the exception of one huge mutant who you can one-shot anyways. All the enemies are generic NPCs who either spawn randomly or come at you with limited numbers. Combat rarely lasts more than 40 seconds or so, it really hurts the game in the end. The main story is very short, the ending is predictable, full of plot-holes and will leave any RPG fan feeling empty. The ending is so abrupt and unsatisfying that it discourages people from starting a new game and exploring further. 60% of the world map is filled with places that add nothing to your story. You're usually given a situation in the form of a side quest, then you can choose to approach it from a good or evil side. Whatever you do, it doesn't really matter. You will level to 20 (which is the cap) without doing most of the side quests. You don't need any amazing weapons from them, because you can just loot them off dead NPCs, there's no point in developing your character after the first initial hours of the game, because it doesn't matter in the end. I really hoped that the side quests and all the explorable content would be fun, but the game keeps really tight to it's main theme, so exploration is unsatisfying and character development doesn't matter that much. After first completing the game I wanted to start over and do things differently, but it didn't change the game much in the end and I felt really let down.- Even at the highest difficulty setting, this game offers no real challenge. The mini games for hacking computers and picking locks are gimmicks that won't keep you entertained for long.- It's the same boring thing over and over. Every house is half destroyed, every vault has the same basic design, every DC building works the same way. All you do for 80% of the game is loot crap, meds and ammo. At the end of the game on the hardest difficulty I had my bags full of stimpacks and chems, as well as enough ammo to equip a small army. What's the point of going around creating weapons when I get over encumbered every 5 minutes because trash NPCs are dropping weapons by the truckload? There are no surprises in the game, not in the characters (they're all one dimensional), not in the environment (broken stuff, wasteland, yeah we get it) and certainly not in the story. Every conversation with NPCs goes the same way, you can either be nice, mean, or indifferent. The game does so little to keep the player interested it's appalling.- The game is vulgar in a completely off-putting way. The player will for example stumble upon a settlement inhabited by just children, much like a \"Peter Pan\" setting. I initially thought it was charming, until the first kid I bumped into starting swearing and cussing for no reason. This isn't edgy, this isn't clever, this is vulgar. I can deal with the burned corpses, the gore, hell I even understand foul language from packs of raiders or slave traders. But really, little kids? Ugh, what a mess. I'm not saying children are angels, far from it, but this really doesn't do anything for the game. It would work if some of it was funny, but it isn't, there is no humor in the game, just depressing story.- Bugs. Installing this on my laptop (an expensive one, mind) was a nightmare. Why was this game released with so many bugs? I consulted a great Fallout wiki and honestly there were more bugs listed than anything else. This game is a hot mess of design flaws, shame on you developers.- $49.99 for a game that I finished in three afternoons. Ouch.How this game got a Game of the Year award is absolutely beyond me. I guess there just isn't much competition for this genre and people will give their support to anything that's new.I really hope that the people who made this game look at the mountains of negative feedback concerning this release and learn from it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2009"}

It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect.

In the Disney universe, King Mickey has disappeared and tells Donald and Goofy to search for the one with the \"key\" and Sora and the Disney characters get tangled up in a big plot. Great story that has a dark tone even with Disney and Square characters.Graphics: What great graphics and even capturing the worlds of Disney such as 100 Acre Woods(Winnie the Pooh)Halloween Town(Nightmare Before Christmas) and the jungle(Tarzan). And it's so nice to see you interact with Final Fantasy characters and Disney in the same screen.Sound: With Disney they always had memorable voices play their characters and hear they are authentic too(save for a couple). The music is great and fits each scene great. The only thing you might complain about is that most voices from the really old movies like Peter Pan and Sleeping Beauty don't have their original voices but it's no big deal.Gameplay: Hm...well playing the game is quite fun there's just one problem: the battle system. Basically you move the character with the Analog stick and the D-Pad for the menu. And it's all real-time too so if you're running out of health and need a potion fast, you can't just stop and take it or they'll get you. And that annoying camera. It often gets obstructed.Even if this includes Disney characters you should play it anyway cause it's a really fun game with one of the best pairings in gaming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2002"}

For one, the whole \"freedom of choice\" thing is a huge lie. If you want to be \"good\", you can rescue the same people over and over; for \"evil\", you kill them repeatedly. That's it. Second, you CANNOT choose where you want to go and what you want to do there. This game is mission-based, just like every other bland game this year. Oh, sure, you can \"choose\" which mission you want, but if you choose any but the \"right\" one, you'll find yourself getting killed in an instant. So no matter what you do, you have to follow a linear path.The gameplay is a mess as well. The combat system doesn't work half the time (you'll often accidentally target people instead of enemies), and even when it does work, you'll still get killed because your skills aren't powerful enough. How do you get them more powerful? By going to the forest and killing bees until you level up. Hmmm, where have I heard this before? In every single other RPG to hit the market, perhaps? Unlike better games, where you always find yourself at the right level to move forward if you take on all the available enemies, Fable forces you to go back and forth between areas to get the enemies to respawn, watching a long loading screen each and every time you exit and enter an area. What fun.Even the non-combat interface is completely dilapidated. Menus were a monster to navigate, and it took me a good ten minutes just to get my equipment on. And don't get me started on my attempt to use the controller customization feature.Finally, there are the things that aren't \"broken\" exactly, but are still annoying. Like the people, for example. Even when you are just walking through an area, perhaps on your way back to kill more bees, NPCs are constantly chattering away in irritating accents. You can't get a moment's peace. Also, you can call me a prude if you wish, but I can't believe that \"burp\" and \"fart\" have their own buttons. This game is rated M for mature, but perhaps it should be rated I for immature.Overall, Fable is an annoying, clunky, and frustrating game. Far from the promised revoloution, it delivers a package that doesn't even meet mediocre standards.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2005"}

The sidequests were entertaining, but you had to them before a certain portion of the main quest was complete or they disappeared.  That is completely idiotic and foolish.2.  I noticed my wives would leave me at times for no reason, even when I paid that guy of who was blackmailing.  They would be happy, and all of sudden they would leave me that was stupid.3.  The boss fights were weak and unchallenging.  I never once died in the game except I came closed against the wolves.

{"product_name":"B003O6E800","description":"","reviewerName":"Rondy","summary":"A disappointment.....","reviewText":"I am going to be really strict for this review for 3 reasons:1. This is a remake- a second chance of the same game.2. I am an experienced gamer and have played the old version, amongst many other games, old gen and next gen.3. This is a Zelda game, and fans expect the best.Why one star? I know many people love Zelda, and no doubt some people will write angry comments thereafter, but try to understand, expectations MUST BE HIGH due to the 3 reasons above.I am very disappointed with this game.First, Ocarina of Time was a home console game, and should stay that way. There is no reason to make it for the 3DS, except to fit it in a small screen so that you can sell a low definition graphics game in today's world of Next-Gen consoles. If PS2 games can be made HD and ported to the PS3, why not this game? Of course, it is very obvious that til this date, Nintendo still has not released a decent HD home console. (The Wii U is sub par in my view.)That being said, the feel of Ocarina of Time is very different on a handheld. You struggle with a small screen, and the controls are awkward. It does not feel as pleasurable as on an N64.3D is a nice gimmick, but the feeling of novelty wears out pretty quickly. And yes, the graphics are updated and look better, partly because of the illusion that a smaller screen makes it look more detailed. Experienced gamers are able to tell right away.Touch screen functionality is absolutely unecessary. Why do you need it when you didn't have a touch screen for the N64? Seems like every port to the 3DS requires touch screen use. It did more harm than good here; it is just distracting, and makes you switch from the button controls and pick up the stylus regularly, and is such a pain.Again, I emphasize, this is a review of Zelda: Ocarinao of Time on the 3DS. Not the N64 version. The game is great and nothing has changed, but this release is illogical.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2013"}

The game begins with a high-speed boat chase and initially noticing the graphics, I concluded the game failed to deliver what we'd expect from a \"next gen\" Bond game.  I was reluctant to continue my adventure feeling it's prequel, Quantum of Solace, which I had played previously, was the game to beat.  Luckily for me, I didn't put the game down and decided to give it a second chance.Once you manage to get comfy with the highly technical cross-hair shooting mechanism, you will gradually ease yourself into the highly engaging storyline.  The games characters are well done and the voice-over acting performed by the movie stars themselves including Judy Dench and Daniel Craig lends the needed polish to the graphical lackluster.  I found myself at numerous points in the game thinking that the game was over finding that the studio was trying their darndest to squeeze every last bit out of the space on the blu-ray disc!  The game just doesn't quit.My favorite part of the game would have to be the stealth based combat.  There are so many different ways to approach a fight tactically which gives the game tremendous replay value not found very often in current offerings.  I found myself repeating various sequences for the pure exhilaration of the take down.  The game is truly realistic at finding ways of disarming your foe and this was the game's strength.Overall, I would shy away from giving the game a 5 star rating purely from a graphical standpoint.  Otherwise this game is a definite buy especially at the current sub $60.00 pricepoint.  To be quite honest, it seemed almost as if the game got off to a shaky start and they polished it as the game progressed.  Don't be hesitant to continue playing this game as I'm confident you'll find it highly entertaining once it gets going!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2011"}

I completed the Casual-Level campaign in four or five sittings of 1-2 hours each, and I don't consider myslef a hardcore gamer.If your gaming preferences are for offline games, then I'll ask you to think about it before getting this game.I also couldn't conceive that I had to try about 10 times in two days to get into my first online ranked game, so even the online part wasn't satisfactory. I guess this should be temporary but I had to comment on this particular issue.So why even give it 3 stars?  Well, I have to admit that getting the hang of the controls was as easy as pie.  The addition of cover tactics were a nice touch and they were very well designed. Gameplay was smooth, I couldn't see a frame skip while I was playing, and we are talking about playing among many huge characters on screen at once, it takes a lot of power to handle as efficiently as this game did.You know, I saw the advertising, I watched many trailers for this game on cable and on the Internet, I read and watched how all the industry experts at E3 considered this game a revolutionary concept in shooters, I got so hyped up that I reserved a darned copy months in advance, I guess like many others.

Nintendo had handed over to them a well known but dormant franchise at the time and using ACM graphics, this stunning game wowed anyone who played this title for the first time back then. It was considered state of the art for its time and it made owning an SNES console even better.In Donkey Kong Country, you control Donkey Kong and his sidekick Diddy and set off to get back Donkey's Kong most prized possession: his banana hoard. King K Rool, the main villain and his army of animals, have taken over the island and to defeat him, you must travel through 6 worlds filled with stages and then confront King Rool on his pirate ship. There are many ways to earn extra lives and some of the local friendly animals lend DK and Diddy a hand from time to time. In addition to completing the stages, there are many secret rooms scattered through most of the stages just waiting to be discovered. In the one player game, you control both characters. In the 2 player game, you and another player can play together cooperatively. In the 2 player contest, you and another player take turns in playing the game. When you reach a certain character in each world, you are allowed to save your progress.The PROS: This game blew away gamers back in the 90's and it's one of the few retro games where it has aged well. A side scrolling platform game starring one of Nintendo's recognizable characters meant it was going to be a good time for all and it was. Thanks to the awesome graphics, sounds and music plus tongue in cheek humor, each themed world is filled with stages brimming with enough variety to keep it fun. To cram it all in into a cartridge is a remarkable achievement as nothing was sacrificed. It's fun by yourself and when you bring in another person and the game is hard enough to challenge you but not overwhelm you at the same time. Adding hidden areas and secrets gave it more replay value.The CONS: Nothing. It's a perfectly balanced game.The Donkey Kong Country trilogy began with this crowning achievement. This game sold millions and gathered praise and critical success and there was good reason for it. Thanks to the success of this game, Rare released two sequels and they too have sold well. If you haven't tried this game out yet, you're not out of luck. You can either try to get this game (new or used) or you can download this off the Virtual Console service for the Nintendo Wii for 800 points ($8.00.) It was well worth it then and it is still a great game to play today. Get this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2011"}

Although they stopped making video game systems, they really kept gamers going for video games for other consoles like Playstation 2, and the Xbox. Now, the latest title finally decides which of the most beloved mascots is better, the beloved Mario or the fast and furious Sonic. This is the title for the Wii that could make gamers decide, young and old.Mario & Sonic At The Olympic Games for the Nintendo Wii, finally puts 2 of the popular video game mascots head to head in a battle that takes place in the upcoming 2008 Summer Olympics. This game, you can play not just as Sonic or Mario, but characters like Luigi, Tails who is Sonic's sidekick, Bowser, Princess Toadstool a.k.a. Peach, Yoshi and many others in a battle for the quest for Olympic Gold. The game features twists on classic races like Track & Field, swimming, fencing, table tennis and the hammerthrow. The graphics look very well while the action doesn't really deliver for solo players, but multiplayer action fairs a little better. You can also use their special battle features like power ups and special tactics like Bowser's fire breath, and Sonic's speed to help you through the game as well, and the Wi-Fi gameplay adds a little bit more. Although the gameplay isn't as bad, it just doesn't click to die hard Wii fans who want more outrageous gameplay they would get from Mario Party 8 or mario Strikers Charged brought excitement.All in all, many more gamers are much more anxious for Super Mario Galaxy and Super Smash Brothers Brawl for the Wii. Mario & Sonic At The Summer Olympics isn't a bad game, but just misses the mark in fun and excitement for die hard fans of both franchises.

The Running game has greatly improved, blockers will actually block and make routes. And finally after these past few years of listening to horrid commentary we get some fresh air from a different guy, It adds a little flavor of excitement to the whole mix on top of your coach yelling advice into your head set...really pulls you into the game.Now granted I ain't saying this the greatest Madden yet, It ain't perfect. They haven't improved the Franchise mode and Superstar Mode which to me is like the bread and butter of anything related to the NFL.

{"product_name":"B004EVWYYG","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Jones","summary":"Certain to Set Standards","reviewText":"I skipped over several Pok&eacute;mon games over the years. I was a Generation 2 guy playing Pok&eacute;mon Gold in the days where 250 whopping Pok&eacute;mon to collect. But when I purchased a 3DS in 2011 I decided it was time to get back into Pok&eacute;mon. I purchased the Gold remake first and then played it intently. A few years later I pre-ordered and played Pok&eacute;mon Y to completion. I had Pok&eacute;mon from HeartGold I wanted to transfer but the new transfer system would not work with that game.So I set forth to purchase a copy of White and White 2.First of all, Pok&eacute;mon White treats its audience like intelligent participants in a world that is unfriendly and wild. This is clearly an E +10 game and is in no way a hardcore title... but it presents a complex question to it's audience... Is fighting Pok&eacute;mon, collecting Pok&eacute;mon, and trading Pok&eacute;mon ethical? And like any good question there is no straight answer. Even the best player of Pok&eacute;mon has a Pok&eacute;mon in their PC storage that they have not used in a very long time. Is that Pok&eacute;mon lonely? Are they hungry? Are they claustrophobic? None of this is truly answered.But beyond that, this game plays smoothly as an individual title with small rewards if you play the associated Pok&eacute;mon Black title. Unfortunately for collectors, you cannot trade Pok&eacute;mon between White and it's older peers Pok&eacute;mon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, SoulSilver. There is an annoying minigame to transfer these Pok&eacute;mon six at a time from one cart to another, but it requires patience. It irked me that I could not simply trade between them. Speaking of trading, Pok&eacute;mon White 2 has full trading capability to the best of my knowledge.The Pok&eacute;mon in this title are some of the best I have seen. I am still favoring the Gen 1-2 style but the Gen 5 Pok&eacute;mon really set the environment well. From lumbering stone ghost golems to brilliant blustering eagles, this set of Pok&eacute;mon is worthy to collect.As a whole, I would recommend this title to anyone from ten years old to thirty five. It asks good questions about the game played and sets a standard for Pok&eacute;mon games in the future. While not perfect, it really seems to be the definitive DS incarnation of Pok&eacute;mon so far. And White 2 improves upon the shortcomings of White with more activities, seasonal changes, competitions, mini-games, and good ol' fashioned Pok&eacute;mon battles. If you are planning to get Pok&eacute;mon White's PokeBank then I would certainly suggest getting this game to round out your collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2014"}

Everything about the system reeks of cheapness and cut corners. Tiny upper screen, low resolution, only one analog nub, terrible cheap d-pad, unimpressive selection of games, and worst of all: the total reliance on the 3D gimmick to sell the system. Nintendo has been all about gimmicks for 10 years now, just look at the Wii and you can see the biggest example. They can't compete in terms of design, manufacture, and technology, so they throw in cheap gimmicks to sell their stuff. I gave up on Nintendo over a decade ago; still have all the older systems and love them (NES, SNES, N64, GBASP), but starting with the Gamecube Nintendo has just been all about cheap JUNK.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00000JRSB","reviewerName":"D","summary":"amazing classic game","reviewText":"Final Fantasy VII was a major hit in 1997 it was also the first final fantasy game not to be on a Nintendo console. This game has gone on to be without a doubt the most popular final fantasy game if not the most popular jrpg game ever made, and with good reason.If I had any complaints about this game its the fact that the graphics while amazing back in 1997 look a bit dated in 2014 which while some of the other final fantasys might look a little jagged around the edges but the have aged better. Which isn't the games fought or nothing given that company's where still getting the foot on the ground in the whole 3d fad in 1997, but it might turn off other players. Everyone kinda has a legoie look to them. In the battle scenes however are really detailed and graphically hold up today. Now for the music 90% of the games soundtrack is amazing for a psx game its highly catchy and without the music I doubt the game would have been quite as popular as it is today. With that being said there is a few tracks in the game that are hard to listen to but most of it is great.Of Coarse the important part about final fantasy is the story and game play. The story without giving out any spoilers for the few that haven't played it yet, in this game is probably the best we will be able to see in a video game (besides final fantasy 6 and maybe star wars knights of the old republic). What I like about the earlier final fantasy games is that its kinda like reading a book only that your playing and immersed into it. So with that being said I actually preferred this over the newer ones with the voice acting. If your a younger gamer or have kids the may have a hard time getting into a final fantasy game until the have reached the age the can read and perhaps this game can even help them learn or want to learn how to read. Also for newcomers of the series you do not need to play any of the previous final fantasy's to understand the story. Most Final Fantasy's with the exception of the ons that have -2 on them have nothing to do with one another story wise other than a few minor references here and there so if you just want to play one final fantasy you are invited to do that.Game play wise this game is very similar to the previous final fantasys IV-VI with the active time battle. This makes the battles a lot more fun as you can not scroll threw everything all day and get a shower before you make your move. With that being said you do have some time before making a move but you do have to be careful. Anyway this is on of the more easier final fantasys although it is still challenging none of the final fantasys (while maybe 13) are casual friendly and this is no different there is a learning curve however if you don't play games much and are sucked into this on you will learn it eventually. Just might have to start over a time or to.Anyway believe it or not despite popular believe this is not the best final fantasy game. Now it is on of the best and is the best final fantasy game to get started with since its slightly easier but I would recommend playing threw Final Fantasy VI as well since after beating VII I discovered more games in the series and found that this game was a lot more fun although similar plus the story of that game completely sucks you in even more than VII does. Along with the soundtrack of VI is just as great if not better.Anyway even though VI is a better game, although a bit more hardcore. VII is still a great follow up for that game and was the game that got me hooked in the series (although I did played the first on on the old nes back in the day) and is on of the best RPGs ever made anyone into rpgs both western and Japanese ones will be happy with this game as long as there willing to sit threw the outdated graphics, they will find a very fun and likable game with great characters (although this is somewhat where final fantasy started going to stereotypical anime people) and a great story.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2014"}

Silent Hill 2, one of my all time favorite, was the last horror game I played and enjoyed a lot. Since then, I have been trying other games, but they just don't do it for me. Then Dead Space comes out and I give it a shot. And man, I just loved it. It has been a long time since I have played a game with such thrilling suspense horror atmosphere.*************PROS*******************THE SETTING: Most of the horror games (and movies for that matter) use the same idea over and over again which would be a haunted house, town or object. Not this game though. It takes place in futuristic time on a mysterious space ship missing crew. While you arrive with some company, you will soon find yourself alone walking through dark corridors, rooms with strange signs made of blood and guts etc. and have no idea what you will encounter. Want to describe more, but don't want to spoil it for you.UNIQUE WEAPONS: You are not a soldier, but an engineer. So the weapons you use to fend off the horror you encounter are tools rather than weapons that you see in most games these days. But this is what makes the experience quite unique. Instead of mindlessly shooting enemies, you will find yourself using unique tools in very particular way to get past your foes. There are quite a few weapons in the game. They will range from circular saw blade operating guns to exploding vibration shooting devices. And ammo are fairly limited. You will get enough to kill enemies, but you will run out of them if you mindlessly waste them.TERRIFYING ENEMIES: In most horror games, you can shoot enemies pretty much anywhere and they will die. In this game though, enemies are exceptionally designed. Not only they look terrifying and disgusting, but they will require distinct method to be defeated. In most games you go for enemy torso or heads; however, in this game you have to use your unique weapons to clip off the limbs of these monsters. If you don't they will come and get you in the most brutal way possible. Another thing you will like in terms of enemies is there are variety of them. Each will different offensive and require different approach to be killed. All enemies will utilize brutal attacks and if not taken care of swiftly punish you with a gory death. This one of the few games where I loved dying for this reason.DECENT BOSSES: Unfortunately there are not many of them, but the few bosses this game has are quite unique. Just like common enemies, mindlessly shooting bosses will just get you killed. Again you will have to experiment will different weapons and tactics and discover what works the best.UPGRADABLE WEAPONS AND SUIT: Another thing I loved. Killing enemies and exploring dreadful spaceship will reward you with money. This money can be used to upgrade your suit and weapons. There are tons of things to upgrade and limited money. So it requires you to choose carefully and think strategically.SUSPENSEFUL STORY: Can't tell you much without spoiling. But there are plenty of twists. You will like it.SPACE ENVIRONMENT: Enemies are not the only horror you are facing in the game. You are in space and part of ships are blown off. So you will also have to work through harsh conditions such as zero gravity and no air. Don't worry though. Your suit will help you thorough. I can't describe enough how wonderful job they have done making this space horror environment.ART STYLE: This is one of the few space/futuristic games where everything feels very real. When you play the game, you actually get the feeling that this is the future, this is how it would be if you were to be on an abandoned space ship. Attention to detail is just spectacular.REPLAYABILITY: While the game is only 10-12hr long, the experience it provides will keep you coming back for more. Plus, there are 4 different difficulty mode. If you are a completionist, it will keep you engaged for quite a long time.*****************CONS******************ASTROID SHOOTING: Whoever put this level in the game should be fired. If you are really good at first person shooters, you may not mind it. But as for rest of us, this level will be very torturing. This just this one part in the game where you get access to a ship turret and you are supposed shoot the incoming asteroids. If you are an average player such as myself, THE ASTROID WILL GET YOU. I hated it, just hated it. Without it, this would have been a perfect game for me.************CONCLUSION*****************The con I described is simply horrible. But if you try sincerely you will get past it. Other than that con, this is an amazing game and a MUST experience for lovers of third person shooter and horror genre fans. I highly recommend it. 9/10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2010"}

The use of sound in the game is particularly interesting - I would say this is the first game in which I have noticed the design of the sound, and how much it adds to the game overall.This is a linear FPS. The creativity comes in deciding how and with which weaponry you can defeat the enemy. I don't think you can just blast your way through.

K. Malone","summary":"It took me 10 years to finish GTA III","reviewText":"My first experience w/ the GTA franchise was at my friend's birthday party in Dec. 2001. He received GTA3 as a gift that night, and we all watched him play it for a while. Lots of drunken hooting and hollering at the wanton random violence and depravity. Running over pedestrians, cop-killing sprees with countless innocent bystander casualties, partaking of a prostitute's services for a health bonus and then beating her to death with a baseball bat to recoup the money paid to her, and so forth. I didn't dig that particular aspect too much. I wasn't personally offended, per se... I love over the top violence in games and movies. But I had something of a political issue with it due to my perspective as a long-time gamer. To wit- for two decades up to that point, annoying \"concerned parent\" groups had been decrying video games as \"murder simulators\" that condition and desensitize, destroy the moral compass, blah blah blah. Those groups had always been completely full of crap, but it seemed to me that in one fell swoop GTA 3 was going to make them all correct, retro-actively. I thought \"We've been in the right all these years. But now you've released the game those nitwits have been waiting for, and it's finally going to give them the upper hand. Good job, guys.\" There was also the simple fact that I've always been more drawn towards fantasy, whether it's futuristic sci-fi, swords & sorcery, supernatural horror, a past time period, whatever, I need *something* aside from mundane reality. A video game where you're a just some Joe Schmoe running around a modern city driving contemporary cars... that simply wasn't going to satisfy my appetite for escapism. So, it felt like around the time I was going ga-ga over Devil May Cry, Ico, Metal Gear Solid 2, Final Fantasy X and Halo, everyone else was falling madly in love with GTA3. Especially my aforementioned friend. He would not shut up about how great it was and he was so enthusiastic and positive that I'd love it too if I gave it a chance that I bought myself a copy. I played it for a few hours, long enough to confirm that it definitely wasn't my cup of tea, and I put it away in the cabinet under my TV. It's been sitting in there ever since.I then watched as GTA3 went on to become one of the most revolutionary and influential video games of all time, giving birth to a whole new genre, i.e. open world/sandbox. Naturally I avoided this genre like the plague... until Assassin's Creed. I initially dismissed that game as well, since A) I had never been won over by Prince of Persia-Sands of Time and B) it appeared to be GTA set in the 12th century Middle East. But later I heard that it also had some kind of hi-tech sci-fi aspect, so that piqued my interest and I ended up playing it. Flawed as it was, that broke the ice and got me past my aversion towards open world games. After three Assassin's Creeds, Infamous, Red Dead Redemption, and most recently L.A. Noire, I was finally ready. I opened that cabinet under my TV, fished out GTA3 and started a new game. That was about two weeks ago, and now I've finished it. A lot of it was boring; there's no getting around the fact that you spend most of your time driving around Liberty City. I drive around Los Angeles every day, so this is not exactly exciting to me. Bits of it were aggravating; in the first 30 missions or so the GPS always indicates precisely where my next goal is... and suddenly that is taken away for no apparent reason. I'm directed to go find a \"Yardie car\" without any info as to just what in the hell a Yardie is or kind of car they drive. Y'know, the sort of thing that Official Guide Books and the internet were created for. But a lot of it was a hell of a lot of fun, and I'm glad that I can finally appreciate what it did for gaming. Thanks to eBay, after finishing up GTA3 I cracked open an original sealed copy of Vice City and started in on that (I can already tell it contains some big improvements,) and I've got a sealed copy of San Andreas waiting in the wings. Now my biggest issue with these games is whether or not I can finish them before I burn out.EDIT August 8, 2011: Since writing this review I've gone on to enjoy Vice City, San Andreas, GTA4, The Lost and Damned, and The Ballad of Gay Tony. I am now a true blue GTA fan. Who'da thunk it? I've been looking up old articles and interviews about the history of GTA and its developer Rockstar, and I found out something very enlightening: When they initially came up with the ideas that were the foundation for the GTA series, one of the most important goals was to create a new game that would appeal to people who normally weren't interested in video games because they thought of them as \"nerdy\". Being that I had been playing and loving video games for about 25 years by the time GTA first appeared in 1997, it's hardly any wonder that it didn't interest me. I wasn't anywhere near the target demographic.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2011"}

Everyone else should buy this as well. If you are worried about it being too hard, then all I can say is you are missing out on one of the best gaming experiences of the last 10 years. Dark Souls is worth playing because, if you are like me, and you don't have time to spend 3-10 hours sitting around playing a game, you can still have a wonderfully immersive and magical experience.So, one can joyously invest 30 mins to 1 hour here and there and still see progress over time. This approach is an excellent method of combating frustration associated with getting killed and any potential burn out effect. So, I say that anyone can enjoy Dark Souls if they let themselves experience it, and adopt the notion that this is a game that will take months to master, and even the most busy game consumer can enjoy Dark Souls in short, yet intense, busts.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2011"}

Richardson","summary":"Mass Effect Goes Third-Person Shooter","reviewText":"First, the good news: Mass Effect 2 fully solves the biggest problem with the first game -- its combat system. It utilizes a new Gears of War-esque combat system (touch-and-go shooting with an easy to access duck and cover system) which makes battles more challenging but also infinitely more satisfying. The enemy and ally AI are both significantly improved. Enemies are now far more cunning than they were in the first game, and your allies are actually responsive to combat orders and are now more of an asset than a liability. This game stands with some of the best third-person shooters on the console. The game actually expands on the first ME's excellent dialogue system by giving you karma-based interruption options during key points in a conversation. The game is beautiful to look at and biotic abilities have been improved.Now, the bad news: Because Mass Effect is now a shooter, the RPG aspects have been scaled back significantly. No more of the first game's vast customization options. Skill growth trees have been streamlined and don't figure too significantly in the action. For those of us who wanted Mass Effect 2 to retain its RPG elements while improving the broken combat system, this is incredibly disappointing.Another element is extremely disappointing is the new planet exploration system. In my review for the first game I complained that the planets you traveled to lacked variety. But at least you could still travel there and drive around and occasionally find something of interest. The system introduced in ME2 is a complete chore: you scan a 3D model of a planet and click a button to harvest resources from specific areas. This becomes boring after two minutes and you have to spend several minutes just scanning a single planet. And there are multiple planets you need to harvest resources from. What a pain! This just makes the planet exploration option of the first game ten times less interesting. Before, the game had exploration elements, dialogue elements, customization elements, and battle elements. Now the game only has dialogue and battle elements.The game's plot is weak and has very loose ties to the first game beyond some common characters. Apparently the concerns of the first game have been discarded entirely, and a new enemy has been introduced. And even some of the first game's characters, like Liara and Ashley, have had their personalities radically altered.The tech specialist class has been undermined by giving players of all classes the ability to open all vaults, thus making the game less replayable.And finally, the wide expanses of the first game have been reduced to a series of hallways for the second game.Unfortunately, ME2, while solving one or two of the first game's biggest problems, introduces other problems or makes old problems even worse. I enjoyed playing it, but they could have done much better with this.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2011"}

Posey","summary":"Mass Effect 2: Raising the Bar in Video Game Entertainment","reviewText":"One of the main questions you will hear people ask about Mass Effect 2 is whether or not you need to play the first game. Different people will say different things to this question, but the answer is a little complicated. Someone who played the first will get 100X more enjoyment out of part 2 than someone who hasn't, but even if you skipped the first, part 2 is still an amazing game. You'll be missing out on the small things, like when Shepard is stopped by someone thanking him for saving them \"on that one planet.\" If you played the first, this will jog your memory and you'll actually remember saving this person and a feeling of goodwill will wash over you, something I have never experienced before. I actually felt like people were thanking me for saving them in the past...when in reality, I just controlled a character to do so in a game. What an amazing game design!Building off of my previous point, if you played the first game you probably still have the save file. If so, good! Keep it! Mass Effect 2 has a build in import tool that allows you to import an existing Shepard into Mass Effect 2 bringing over your looks and morality. Depending on what you did in the first game, you could also begin your career with extra money and minerals. I imported a max level (60) Vanguard from the first game and I started the game \"rich\" for importing him. I was given a stockpile of minerals and money and was able to begin at level 5. This was a very cool addition to an already amazing game.The team at BioWare really put an effort forth to change some of the mechanics from the first game. Most people who played the first game complained about a few key things. First, the Mako. The Mako is the vehicle you drove in the first game when you landed on a planet. The driving sequence has been removed completely, replaced with a system that automatically puts you on the planet where you need to be. Another issue was the elevators (although a minor complaint). The elevators in ME1 took forever since they compensated for the load times. Finally, the combat was reworked in the second making the game a much more competent third person cover shooter (think Gears of War meets Uncharted). Ammo has been introduced into the game for the first time in a unique way. Instead of picking up ammo for each weapon, you will instead pick up cooling clips. You \"reload\" when you weapon is beginning to overheat and picking up additional clips will give you additional ammo. It's an easy system to master, but at first can be a little different.In terms of gameplay, the game just feels a whole lot more polished. They took everything that was wrong or not perfect in the first and tweaked it to make it perfect. The game is quite literally a masterpiece of game design. Enemies are varied and unlike the first, can't just be gunned down all willy nilly. You need to think about what enemy you are fighting and plan accordingly. Some have shields, some have armor, some have both and each take different tactics. Shields can be brought down with a team members overload ability and then gunned down at will. As you play you will pick up these tidbits of gameplay knowledge and by the halfway point you'll be mowing down enemies at will, with the big challenges, the end bosses, putting up one hell of a fight.The main part of any BioWare game is always the story. Continuing from where the first left off, something big happens in the beginning of the game. This big event allows you to make your character look any way you want and you can even change your character type. The choices include a soldier class that allows you to use all weapons, magic classes, magic + combat classes, engineering classes, engineering + soldier, and a few other combos. Needless to say, there will be a class that will suit your needs in some way or another.After the game begins, you are tasked with finding a group of soldiers, mercenaries, vagabonds, prisoners, and other unlikely sources to join your team. You have to visit a wide range of worlds, all uniquely designed and beautiful in their own right, and \"woo\" each to join you. Most won't join you at first or need something in return. Once you complete the mission, they join you on your ship. From here on out, they can accompany you on missions. There's a bunch of people to recruit, but once you recruit them the \"wooing\" doesn't stop there. You need to gain the loyalty of your crew, although this is completely optional. Gaining the loyalty of your crew confirms whether or not they will join you for the final mission of the game, the looming \"suicide mission\" that is constantly talked about. It is possible for Shepard to end the game dead and the game completing. This only stresses the need for you to gain the loyalty of each crew member and upgrade your ship to it's max capacity. More on upgrading later though. After you bring the members on board, you can talk to them after each mission you undertake. You will learn about their back stories, their troubles, their lives, basically who they are and how they tick. When you speak to them enough and get a good repertoire going, they will offer you their mission. Complete the mission, and you gain their loyalty as well as a new outfit and power for them. Screw up the mission (some can be failed with no retry) or say something damaging to them and you could lose their loyalty forever. With some characters, you can even garner a romantic relationship that ultimately ends up in a bedroom before the final mission. This love interest will carry over into Mass Effect 3 and play a big role, so chose carefully. Character growth and character relations is a huge part of the Mass Effect universe and you will spend a very large amount of time talking to your squad mates. If you just grimaced at that, don't. It's very enjoyable and you will feel closer to your teammates because of it. You'll find you'll bring your \"friends\" with you on missions more than the other people you don't like as much. My personal favorite characters include Miranda (the sexy Cerberus operative), Tali (Quarian from first game who is now a possible love interest), and Jack (Subject Zero - the hard ass biotic bitch who has a very troubled past).Mass Effect 2 introduces a couple new features that weren't present in the original game as well. You can now upgrade most, if not all aspects of your armor, weaponry, and ship. Your armor can be fully customized to whatever color scheme you want, different armor types, helmet types, etc. and these will show up in all cut scenes. This helps to better immerse you in the game. Weapons can be upgraded much like other games and your ship you will be upgraded for bigger and better facilities and weaponry. The ship upgrades don't really matter until the end of the game. Upgrading your ship is a must to survive the \"suicide mission.\"While certain things were added to the game, others were removed. The biggest removals from the game were random loot drops and enemy XP. In the first game, killing an enemy gave you two things, experience and loot. Now, you only get exp after a mission has been completed and your loot is found sparingly around the levels with upgrades thrown in for good measure. It's missed, but not a big deal. I found that in the first game I would clear out every enemy in the level to try and get every piece of exp possible...now I don't care as much.Mass Effect 2 is going to be considered for Game of the Year 2010, I can assure you that. It's an amazing game that has surpassed my expectations completely. Having spent well over 150 hours with the first game, I consider myself an expert on the Mass Effect universe. The lore continuation, story flow, characters, everything is just perfect. BioWare is doing an amazing job bringing the universe to life in Mass Effect 2 and players who give it their time and attention will be treated to an experience unlike any other. It's not unlikely that while you aren't playing the game, you'll be thinking about playing it. Sitting at work yesterday I was contemplating who I should become romantically involved with, Miranda or stick with my old girlfriend from the first game Liara T'Soni. But what about Tali? What's hidden under that environment suit...yeah, it's sounds bad, but don't knock it until you've experienced it yourself, and you won't experience it unless you give it a shot. Mass Effect 2 is a game you should buy though. Unless you have GameFly that allows you to rent games for however long you want, you'll need to hold onto the game for a good long while to complete the 25-50 hour game. You could blow through the main missions and forget everything else, but if you did that, you'd be missing out on the whole Mass Effect experience. Take the time to do the side missions, talk to the characters, gain their loyalty...in doing so you'll be experiencing gaming history in the form of storytelling the likes of which have never been seen in a video game before. Be careful though, this game will take up a lot of your time, willingly of course.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00CH923NE","description":"","reviewerName":"Nate","summary":"Get Paper Mario 3DS Instead","reviewText":"Can't reiterate just how much the battle system in this game peeves me off. Sure like past installments there is the &#34;jump&#34; option to avoid attacks, but are you skilled enough to do so? Absolutely not. It takes countless battles to finally memorize your opponents moves. Until then you're going to get pummeled to death as these same foes decide to attack five times in one turn. Just to clarify that's 5 times. And each attack will do damage. Nintendo may as well have given every enemy omnislash while they were at it. I mean are you freaking kidding me, this no longer qualifies as an RPG!! And boss battles? Forget about it. They don't even follow the golden rule of turn base as they can attack you 2 turns in a row if they wish to do so and that's still using 5 hit combos a turn. Omnislash..... Nintendo really needs to sit down and rethink these games or seriously give back all the stuff they stole from Paper Mario well... Back to Paper Mario. Otherwise I'm not buying any more of this junk.

This game is NOT a five-star game. It is NOT a 95/100 like it's score on Metacritic. It is quite simply hype fueled by Rockstar and people starved for a open-world wild west game. I had fun for about a week playing through the story and free roam. Then it got all too repetitive like all Rockstar games do. It's not like Fallout where things happen different each time. Where you can find unique locations and have true random encounters and there is replay value. RDR is simply encounter after encounter of things you have already seen and done. While it may seem cool to encounter these things throughout the game, and at first it is, it becomes so repetitive that you actually avoid travelling after a while. Riding your horse for five minutes and seeing the same thing you just saw 30 minutes ago gets old. Now I know you can ignore the encounters, but they are still there and it just feels cheap.Another huge problem with this game is that when you kill people, with the exception of killing one guy way out in the desert, there will be groups of lawmen that will hunt you down until you outrun them. Your bounty goes up with each kill and it's just stupid. Rockstar can claim to have made this game realistic, but when you can't get away with a couple murders out in the wasteland, then it's pointless and makes you not want to do it. This brings me to another huge issue with this game. The \"karma system.\" Basically there isn't one. RPG's/sandbox games like to make you feel you have choice and impact on the character and the story. Well, unfortunately, you don't in RDR. Fame and Honor mean nothing. The game tracks your stats and everything, but it just feels so pointless because you don't have an impact on anything. People don't treat you different, the story doesn't change, you don't change, all that happens is you get a bounty for doing bad things and your fame and honor change. John Marsten doesn't change. According to the story he was once a gang member, but changed his ways, so having John do bad things doesn't make sense anyway. This is the reason why you can't mess around with prostitutes.A slow story, empty free roam, terrible structuring of quests, easy auto aim, unreliable controls, and just generally boring and repetitive gameplay make this game suprisingly dissapointing. If I would have done RDR I would have skipped the same old grand theft auto style and went for a more immersive open-world experience. A game where you can make your own character and have influence over the story. A game where you don't see the same encounters happen over and over again. A game that actually has choice and a karma system. And even better and more interesting characters.The good things about RDR are the graphics, art design, voice acting, and the overall production value. I wanted to get into this game like I can with Fallout or Elder Scrolls, but I can't, atleast not for long. It's just the same old GTA gameplay. You do a set of missions for this person, then this person, then this person, then this person, all the while riding back and forth to no exciting or cool locations and not really accomplishing much. You actually forget what the story is supposed to be about and who the bad guy is by the time you get to Mexico. There are flaws I could go on about like the game making a terribly annoying noise while I play the whole time, but I can't go on anymore about it. Just a generally dissapointing game where I feel like Rockstar really missed a great oppurtunity, and instead chose to do the same old thing. But apparently the critics disagree because RDR is getting outstanding reviews. If you like Westerns and sandbox shooters you'll probably enjoy it for awhile, or atleast appreciate it, but it will get old fast. And that to me just isn't a 95% five star game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2010"}

Not only do you get one of the most highly anticipated PS3 exclusives of the year, but you also get a strategy guide, an artbook, and a soundtrack CD.  The game case is exquisitely done with embossed paper and shining foil.  All of the art work is top notch and beautiful.  Like most of us, word of mouth reached my ears about how wonderful this game was and how great it was that the PS3 finally got its own exclusive, hardcore RPG.  The fact that Atlus only pressed a limited number of copies practically made me panic into ordering the game online.  After having played Demon's Souls I'm here to tell you that it's not THAT great.After getting started on the game, I found that the strategy guide wasn't all that useful.  The walkthrough seems spotty with not a lot of detail.  It had some nice photos and rundowns of weapons and armor, but that's about it.  I think I appreciated the artbook more due to the character descriptions and, well, the art.  I'm not into game soundtracks so much.  Suffice it to say I wasn't impressed with that either.  If it's your cup of tea, that's fine.  The extras that come in the deluxe edition provide some brief novelty, but they didn't really enhance the game that much.The game itself proved underwhelming for me.  The initial character creation process was pretty standard.  It's pretty much the same thing you've seen in Fallout 3 and Dragon Age.  The graphics ended up not being nearly as jaw dropping as I would have liked them to be.  Maybe I'm spoiled on Uncharted 2 and Killzone 2, but since Demon's Souls isn't really what I'd call an open world game, I assumed the developers could have spent a little extra time on the environments and such.  The controls aren't very precise.  I found myself trying to attack an enemy, but I ended up lunging at a wall 90 degrees from where I was standing.  Frustrating.Speaking of frustrating, probably the most popular aspect of this game is its level of difficulty.  Yes, the game is very unforgiving.  I don't mind the fact that my character dies regularly.  What I do mind is that you cannot save your progress.  Rather, after you die you're relegated to the very beginning of the level.  I'm not sure who thought that was a good idea, but they were wrong.  Every other RPG worth its weight allows you to save your progress.  I disagree with a lot of other reviewers that this somehow forces you to play to the best of your ability or that if you can't deal with it then this game is not for you.  I believe that the inability to save your progress creates a situation that simply isn't fun.  It destroys the pacing of an already miniscule story.  I'm not sure if the ability to save my progress would have saved this game for me, but it couldn't have hurt.Unfortunately, I decided to give up on Demon's Souls.  I traded it in at Gamestop for a paultry fifteen dollars of store credit!  Some may think that was a bad move, but I don't regret it for a second.  The thought of having to slog through Demon's Souls for countless hours was more painful than taking a hit on the money I got back.  Keep in mind, I enjoy deep, hardcore RPG's like Fallout 3, Oblivion, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, KOTOR, and the like.  Demon's Souls just doesn't compare in my humble opinion.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2009"}

{"product_name":"B002I0H79C","description":"Gears of War 3","reviewerName":"Joseph Sayre \"Venom Computing\"","summary":"Bigger, Badder, and more Polished","reviewText":"LEGEND:GOW1: CampaignGOW2: Versus---- GOW2A: Buttons---- GOW2B: Matchmaking---- GOW2C: Maps and Matches---- GOW2D: New WeaponsGOW3: Horde 2.0---- GOW3A: FortificationsGOW4: BEASTGOW5: Bits and Bobs---- GOW5A: Menus---- GOW5B: Tradin'---- GOW5C: Mutators---- GOW5D: Unlockables---- GOW5E: Levels---- GOW5F: Enemies---- GOW5G: GraphicsGOW6: What I Didn't LikeGOW7: Wrap UpUse CTRL + F and code to search, GOW7 is a short synopsis for a quick reviewGears 3 marks the end all for the series. Is Gears 3 the best game of this year? Lets find out.GOW1Campaign: In case you didn't know, campaign mode is now 4 player. The game has gotten big enough that you can play more than 4 players total and this change in characters has really become evident. The story arcs allow you to be in multiple places at once meeting goals either side by side in the time line or flat out doing things while the other team does something useless and uninteresting to join in on later. This means Marcus, Baird, Dom, Cole, Clay, Anya, Sam and a whole mess of other characters are playable by one of your 4 campaign slots. The story goes much more in depth with the actual characters as well. Their memories and dreams that were shattered when the locust came up. Its nice to see that backstories and who these characters really were. It allows the player to connect with them more. Other than that, campaign is longer, MUCH longer than previous games and more of the Lambent story arc is explained. Basically it fills in the gaps gears 2 opened. In short, Campaign is fleshed out and more than what you'd expect for this obvious multiplayer fest.Campaign mode clocked me about 15 hours on Hardcore, and is and EXTREMELY acceptable ending to the game series. The story ends, and it does so in a spectacular fashion. The story itself is funny, its well animated in the cutscenes, challenging on higher difficulties, but out of everything, the emotion i felt was not amazement or happiness, it was sadness. Feeling for characters i've never known or don't exist is odd. The story is a sci-fi theme with the war elements thrown in. Since you've known these characters so long and they are so developed, they're easier to care about and easier to sympathize with, and that only makes their troubles more real. The game is immersive in these moments, and I dare say this is the best work Epic Games has ever released.GOW2 Versus: This is broken down a bit more into the types, but i'm reviewing it as a whole.Versus acts much different than you remember, the first thing you'll notice is the speed of matches both in connection and in physical movement. The game uses dedicated servers and as such, your connection to the server is all you need to worry about. But for the nay-Sayers who are worried EPIC will turn the servers off, the P2P is still available for parties, so yes post server there can be games played P2P, just not ranked or random matchmaking. But back to speed. The characters no longer have a burst run after jumping, instead post jump or straight up running is max speed all the time. This means no more having to continually jump forward to go faster.They've also modified interactions, most of the glitches seem to be gone, with that said, the game likely will still have glitches that exploit the multiplayer, however, that's not the issue at hand. Now the reason I mention this is because of an old glitch called weapon sliding, this has been more or less eliminated in principle because of the new interactions.GOW2ATo latch on to a wall and run, the A button is used, A is also used for movement interactions such as the swat turn or jumping. Basically, if it involves movement, A is what controls it. Plain and simple.B is used exclusively for Melee. Under normal circumstances, B makes your character lash out and strike with the blunt part of your current weapon, it also is held for the Retro and normal lancers for their unique melees. Retro lancer has a running charge impale attack that needs about 15 game feet or more to fully charge up to impale, otherwise the impale will fail and you will deal damage but will leave your opponent standing with a good chance to kill you. The attack is not able to be interrupted by bullets, only death by bullets will stop it. However, characters can be melee'd to interrupt it if timed correctly.The chainsaw is also changed, and will not be dropped as you take damage. The initial animation takes about 1 second to rev the chainsaw and it will stay up even if you are shot multiple times. The character cannot run while his chainsaw is up. The balance is actually not bad. Under cover facing a Retro the Charge is hard to pull off, and the chainsaw is noisy and relatively easy to dodge. But they can be considered overpowered.X interacts with objects, like turrets or downed enemies, X now picks up downed enemies as meatshields instead of A, X also picks up weapons and ammunition. To pick up ammunition or revive a downed teammate, tap X, to pick up weapons hold X, generally the pause is just enough time to prevent you from picking up a weapon when you really want to help a team member. This happened a lot in gears 2.Y's pretty much your go nuts button. it handles the like 20 executions. Each weapon has one execution (usable in story mode at the start) that you unlock. Once you unlock an execution, executing enemies is not only fun, but nets you extra XP. So you'll be using Y a lot.Use RB to reload and active, active works the same as it always did but for the newbs, timing your reload right gives you a boost to something for the weapon and reloads it faster.LB another big beast of a button, LB is your tac com, holding it down gives you your teams positions, where weapons are,and allows you to mark dangerous people. Using the Tac Com in conjunction with the movement stick (clicked) you can \"mark\" dangerous, rare, or hard to find enemies your team can then see as a floating icon. Very tactically useful in versus when some guy is owning everything he sees and you think you might need some help.LT aims, RT shoots or swings the sword, The D-pad changes weapons, and the sticks move your character Select brings up the current game's statistics and start pauses. Simple.GOW2BMatchmaking: Matchmaking in gears 3 is different, first of all no more getting a party at multiplayer screen, its all handled on the main menu. In addition parties can be rounded off at 10. From the main menuthe host of the party can choose a multiplayer mode and all players will be carried into the match. The only load times are for the actual load into the pre-game and actual map screens. Multiplayer works right out of the box, though horde and Beast can seem slow. This is also the only matchmaking that I've seen where the console actually says what its doing, and why it can or can't find a match, or where it gets hung up. Its ALSO tells you what your current NAT type is at this screen. Matchmaking is streamlined and works quite well this time around. No fears there.GOW2CMaps and Matches: Maps are generally larger and most are original, with a chosen few coming back with STELLAR cosmetic improvements. The overall feel of the maps is that they were laid out both so that both sides can identify their respective side, and also that each side is fair in its capability to get to weapons. Macthes are bit of different bag, there are many different players and the number of people in my opinion that do not wish to play as a team is too many. This is a community problem, and as a result it doesn't effect my score, but expect many players to not have mics, and even more to act in ways you may not like or understand. The first few weeks of this game's life will likely be plagued by the people who want to either try it out or beat it and move on. And though this seems bad, its not. But it does drop the quality of matches when people do not act as a team and you get steamrolled because 1 or two guys on your team think that playing COD style is going to work.GOW2DNew WeaponsThere are a multitude of new weapons available:Retro Lancer - The retro lancer is a mid/close range rifle that has poor accuracy at range, walks very badly, has tracking issues and demands massive input from the player to keep under control, however, its power is high and it possesses a 1 hit kill melee. The rifle is a good addition to those who don't like the hammerburst's constant input, but also don't like the lancer's support role.Sawed-Off shotgun - Does mega damage to anything within about 2 feet in front of you but washes out almost completely past that range. The weapon takes forever to reload, carries one shot, and is surprisingly balanced due to its shortcomings. The weapon is very useful in Horde mode where you can spawn with the ability to one shot most horde heavies with it.Digger - The digger is the most interesting rocket launcher i've ever used, it uses a little fired locust that burrows underground and pops up to explode when it gets near an enemy. Basically the gun is a land torpedo. The little munching locust does a number on Grubs and COG alike if injected directly into the body.One-Shot - Think of this thing as the mother of all sniper rifles. The small power up time post aiming is small price to pay for its kill anything in one shot firepower. The weapon is considered a heavy and you move like a snail with it, but anything you shoot just flat out dies. Its reticule is zoomed in far and can be disorienting, but the gun kills everything in one go, its got to have some problems.Some changes:The other guns that return but with twists:Gorgon: Now fully automatic. Power toned back a bit, still rocks.GOW3Horde 2.0 is in a word, phenomenal. To think that this mode might be skipped in favor of a versus only user sickens me. This is quite possibly the most improvements I've ever seen a side mode get EVER in a franchise. Horde 2.0 is a game all by itself, an ever changing, and ever expanding universe that only seems to get deeper the longer you play it.Horde still works the same way as it did, 50 waves, 5 gears, lots of death (on both sides) but this time, its different. the waves 1-9 (each set) are conventional ground troops that get stronger and stronger each wave. but this isn't just like horde 1, the number of enemies is the key, not the types. In horde 1, you got the same pre-scripted enemies per wave, but they got harder. in 2.0 they get harder always, but when you might fight 4 polyps and a few drones on wave one, on wave 41 it might be like 1 polyp and a boomer and 9 drones. Plus their stat bonuses, it can be rough. The bosses are epic, and i do mean epic, berzerkers, Gunkers and Brumaks just to name a few line the list, and they're mean, unforgiving and brutal. The Horde mode here has massive content and difficulty increases, and I'm just getting STARTED on what it offers.GOW3AFortificationsIn addition to the play mechanics, horde 2.0 offers the ability to fortify your camp. First of all you need camps to start, pick a camp that you think you can defend and start building, you can build very little at the start but the more you build, repair, and reload your fortifications the more you unlock and the better they get. Every round you earn cash + a bonus for completing the round. The more money you earn the better you can afford to fortify your base. As more unlock, the repelling of locust gets easier, but as the difficulty goes up, so does the need for improving you equipment to repel them again. When first starting horde you only have metal barriers, as you play you unlock better barriers and more types of fortifiers. As you level your fortifications up, the maximum level gets stronger, and the repairs get cheaper. Its nearly impossible to get to wave 50 on a fresh horde mode start and only until players vamp up their arsenal of purchase-ables will games start seeing the later levels. Don't be stingy spend spend spend!GOW4Beast mode is a wonderful little minigame gone medium. Beast mode is a 12 round sprint where you get to kill your favorite little cog friends. You start off with cruddy 1st tier locust (they're still useful late game) and as you kill, maim and destroy, you unlock tiers 2-3-4. Each tier brings in more baddies to break the humans with and the whole thing is gratifying as all heck. Basically you start with about a grand. Each locust costs a certain amount of money to purchase and use. Locust do not have regenerating health, so the money essentially prevents you from spamming power characters over and over. For instance, the boomer costs 1500 dollars. You may have saved up 3K by the time you get to use him. If you're foolish and lose a boomer without a single kill, you're 1500 out and can either run another boomer, but wipe out all of your funds or use a less powerful locust. Whats really interesting is how similarly this works to a MMO raid. You really need classes, a tank, a healer, some nukers and someone to take down the fortifications that stand in your way. I also like how you're not pressured to use the best, one person could do some serious damage as a grenadier but do terribly as a Kantus and the other way around. If you're beast with one character, its more useful to rock that one than to fill a role you're not good at. Beast mode is quick, fun violent and gratifying and overall a great addition, if a bit short.GOW5Bits and BobsNow with the main stuff out of the way I near the end of my review, lets do the stuff I didn't cover.GOW5A:Menus: Menus are easy to navigate but many are buried in other menus, and some don't even seem usable but they are. Now you can access your main stats from the main menu but nowhere else, this kind of sucks when you want to check how many kills you have with a particular weapon, but its over-lookable. Still this screen has ribbons, achievements, stats, unlocks, and medals (some things I'll get to in a sec) and all the gratifying info you could ever want. All its missing is how many times you've sworn throughout your time with gears 3. All in all though menus are bright and useable and presented quite intuitively.GOW5BTradin': Characters can now swap cash, ammo, and guns, all you have to do is target your comrade with the LS and hit the corresponding button to trade. Useful for tight spots or for when they really need a gun and you need theirs. Also useful for buying crud in Horde.GOW5CMutators: Make playing Horde harder or more fun or easier. Big head more, instagib, and laugh track are just a few of the obtainable game mods that make horde mode and other modes weird, zany, challenging, and fun.GOW5D:Unlockables: whether they're ribbons for a job well/not well done, medals for being awesome, weapon skins for the same reasons, or because you've wiped out the right amount of enemies with your favorite guns, or better yet using them in deadlier ways, to even unlocking more skins for use in almost every game mode, gears 3 keeps the steady flow of unlocks coming which keeps you chomping at the bit for the next level.GOW5E:Levels: Everything you do in gears 3 earns you xp, whether that's shooting a dude, ripping off someone's arm and beating them into submission, or not doing a darn thing whatsoever in a match, you'll pull some XP from the ribbons and kills you earn at the end. All of this gets pooled into a leveling system that both unlocks things and gives you some bragging rights, and generally gives a good indication of how long someone's spent with the game, and how much you should fear them.GOW5F:Enemies: Massive new sets, the lambent have their own full species and many are still locust but just as many are not really locust so much anymore. Locust have a few new bodies and cultures as well, overall the number of different enemies in this game is more than I've seen before. On higher difficulties than casual, most enemies seem scripted to do different things as well, like a savage grenadier will be more daring than its normal counterpart.GOW5G:Graphics: Needless to say the graphics are phenomenal, no hiccups, no frame rate drops, awesome looking visuals for fire, smoke, and ink grenades, as well as very realistic gore effects and damage. The environments are bright, destroyed and beautiful and must be seen to be admired properly, My words do not do them justice. Gears 3 plays nice and looks nice too.GOW6What i don't like:Gears 3 is often too fast paced and due to this its practically impossible to play casually. In addition, may be very unfriendly to newbies,  its also gratuitous, and excessive in violence meaning that some kids shouldn't be subjected to this level of gore, but it is able to be turned off so in that respect its somewhat ok. Gears also has a barely functional host transfer in horde, but it removes all upgrades and sets you to horde level 6 if you're higher, and any level lower than that if you're on that respective level. I am completely unsure why. Host transfer is not available in other modes unless the host quits before the match starts. I was hoping for seamless host transfer, but oh well. Finally, gears 3 kind of is lacking in the skins dept. from the get go, Bernie, Raam, Kim, and some other characters aren't available. Maybe they'll be patched in.Gears 3 is quite repetitive, not to say its brethren aren't but the story is fairly predictable and bland in actual gameplay, the story writing is very well done and executed however. The problem is that its a shooter, and most of your time is spent shooting, so you know that every time a cut scene occurs you shoot afterwards or every time you have to wait for an NPC the same thing happens. But it does shake things up a little with the bigger enemies. But even then its usually more of the same. The lack of bosses doesn't help, there are less than five really total, and only two of the bosses can be considered hard. Still, the game had me pushing to shoot stuff not because it was necessarily fun or challenging (though that happened) more to see what happened next in the story. A lot of the time I was going through the motions to get the next piece of the puzzle. Don't look at this saying I don't like shooting or the story, I definitely do, but sometimes it got very monotonous.GOW7Wrap UpGears 3 as a whole is awesome, a well polished shooter that has extensive amounts of life on and off the internet due to bots being playable. Its filled with challenge and gratuitous violence and skillful play. Its new Horde mode and Beast Mode add re-playability and challenge to some of the more tired formulas and Epic shows that They're still king of the Horde mode. Also it has an excellent long campaign mode with a solid ending. The control is fluid, the animation is solid and the graphics are great. With very few shortcomings such as repetitive play and some issues with multiplayer and possible difficulty becoming accustomed or leveled up to where you need to be, Gears 3 is great in every way, and something every 360 library should not be without.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2011"}

Some of the games will have you a bit winded, and if you play this game for quite some time, you're getting an effective workout.The game makes great use of augmented reality to actually put you and your room in the game. One game in particular has you dodging bombs, lasers, and traps as they appear on your room's floor -- along with you. Even the opening title sequence places your room into the window of an apartment. It's a great touch and attention to detail.The real fun occurs when more than one player is involved. The single-player games are modified for multiple players to make use of more than one player -- depending on the mode you select, it either requires cooperation or competition. The teamwork modes force you to think quickly and beat the clock, since most of the mini games are two or three minutes. It's great fun for family, especially since the game snaps photos during the sessions and displays them on-screen. A lot of times one player can't really see what the other player is doing, but the photos end up showing the \"whole picture\".The game has incredible replay value due to several creative Xbox 360 achievements. The more you play, the more you'll unlock. In this game, it's about quantity and time -- the developers made sure you'll come back again and again.Overall, this is a great game that will make you smile often. It's the type of game that you can play for either a few minutes or for hours at a time, whenever you want to play something that doesn't require too much thinking. I recommend this as a great Kinect game that's really fun for either a single player or a small to large groups.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I0KOSI","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"Excellent story, good gameplay, but the two feel a little disconnected","reviewText":"BioShock Infinite is the third game in the BioShock series, following on from BioShock and BioShock 2. However, it is a stand-alone game that does not require foreknowledge of the older two games to be enjoyed (though there are a few nods to those who have played the earlier titles).In fact, it would be more accurate (not to mention appropriate) to say that there are in fact two BioShock Infinites. The first is a narrative and character-based game featuring a complicated storyline and an exploration of themes revolving around the American ideals of free speech, equality, liberty and responsibility. The narrative is recursive, using time loops and parallel universes to drive forwards the storyline and melds elements of hard SF, steampunk and revolutionary fiction together. The storyline is also highly focused on individual characters, including Booker DeWitt, Elizabeth (Booker's constant companion for roughly three-quarters of the game), the Lutece twins and the rarely-seen, often-heard ruler of Columbia, Zachary Comstock. The narrative is twisted and twisting, complicated (though mostly cohesive) but well-told and addressing issues that most games pretend simply don't exist, such as racism and prejudice, and doing so intelligently. In short, it's a bit of a triumph.The second BioShock Infinite is the actual gameplay, wherein you blow away a truly vast number of adversaries with an exotic selection of advanced weapons and semi-magical powers. Enemies are defeated more quickly if you shoot them in the head (causing their skulls to explode) or use your powers to lift them into the air and then blast them over the edge of the city. BioShock Infinite is a startlingly violent game where your path through the excellent story is soaked knee-deep in blood.There's a bit of a dissonance between the story and the gameplay. Ken Levine and his team have attempted here to create a complex and literate narrative, perhaps gaming's answer to Ulysses, except that Leopold Bloom didn't periodically wander out onto the streets of Dublin to mow down hordes of enemies with a crank-powered rotary chain cannon (literary critics are divided on whether this would have improved the book). This collision between gameplay and story is something that the original BioShock also suffered from, though in Infinite they do a much better job of trying to integrate the two together. For a start, combat is fast, fluid and fun, a far cry (no pun intended) from the often-stodgy shooting of the original game. There are a few similar problems, such as the fact it's bewilderingly easy to get stuck on the corners of buildings and platforms and the game seems highly reluctant to let you jump over anything (often resulting in your character bunny-hopping like a maniac to clear a two-foot step whilst multiple opponents are firing missiles at your head), but broadly speaking the combat - incongruous to the setting as it often feels - is pretty good. It's particularly good fun to take to the overhead sky rails to zip above enemies' heads, either shooting them from afar or jumping off to perform a melee takedown. Booker's different powers - Vigours - are varied and entertaining to use, and intelligent use of Vigours can mean the difference between a fight being a dull slog and an exhilarating demonstration of power. It's all cool, but it also feels rather distanced from the actual storyline and the quieter moments of exploration and dialogue.Much has been made of the game's environment and with good reason. The art direction is stunning. BioShock Infinite is hardly at the cutting edge of visuals (the Unreal 3 Engine is starting to show its age) but its colourful palette, World Trade Fair-inspired architecture, open spaces and blazing sunlight combine for a vivid gaming experience. The game may be shifting far fewer polygons than Crysis 3, but the ingenuity and originality of the design more than makes up for that. It's a game so striking that it's fun just to wander around and look at things. Unfortunately, this artistic excellence does not extend to character animations, which are often unconvincing and wooden. It's not Bethesda-bad, but it's certainly somewhat lacking compared to the game's strengths in other areas.Much has also been made of your AI companion, Elizabeth, who accompanies you for roughly four-fifths of the game. Elizabeth doesn't fight, but she can help you explore areas and finding money, and also scavenges extra ammo, health and salt (which recharges your Vigours) for you mid-combat. She is also an accomplished lockpicker, and can use lockpicks to open sealed doors. Lockpicks are severely rationed for the first half or so of the game, forcing you to carefully explore each area before moving on, but later on become so commonplace that such care is no longer required. Elizabeth's voice acting is good but her animation is somewhat lacking. She also has disconcerting tendency to teleport around the map, as her pathfinding leaves something to be desired. Combined with her inability to fight, this makes her rather less impressive a companion character than Alyx Vance in the nine-year-old Half-Life 2, which seems rather poor going.The game's biggest weakness is the same as with BioShock before it. Irrational Games (and Looking Glass, where its founders worked beforehand) started off with roleplaying games, most notably the System Shock series, which is the spiritual predecessor to the BioShock series. These games were roleplaying games with shooter elements, whilst the BioShock series are shooters with a few roleplaying elements grafted on. This is fine, except that the complicated story, more notable characters and even the fascinating environment feel like they've still been designed for a roleplaying game. The result is a game which hints at immense depth but it held back from fully exploring or embracing it by its shooter credentials.As it stands, BioShock Infinite (****) is a very strong shooter with an unusually deep story, complex characters and thematic elements that don't entirely gel with the game's genre. It's still a fascinating, fun and thought-provoking game, but one that does not fulfil its full potential due to genre limitations. However, it's still a remarkable game, with a genuinely intelligent and smart ending, one of the best endings a game has ever had.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2013"}

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.PlayStation Network support including PlayStation Trophies.","reviewerName":"Edgar Jose Burguillos Lopez \"The Buf\"","summary":"Buen Juego","reviewText":"El juego tiene buena trama, el online medio fastidioso pero bueno hay que acostumbrarse... algunos fallos pero nada que lamentar.El envio como siempre fue de calidad, Amazon siempre me ha cumplido.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2011"}

It took me eight hours to beat the game on \"medium.\"  I loved it, but I thought it was a little too easy.  I never had to stop, take stock in the situation, rethink my strategy, and just catch my breath.  I never got stuck on a puzzle, and though I admit I souped up my line gun with a few power nodes, the necromorphs were never a problem, even the \"horde\" of necromorph children swarming me!  So much for \"cut off their limbs!\"  You can just cut them in half now.  I think I died twice during that first game, more during \"hard\" but I still didn't have as much of a problem as I thought I should have.That said, it was definitely a cool game with some heart-stopping action sequences, and top of the line graphics.  I really loved it- at least the first time through.  The atmosphere was still creepy, but in my opinion, boarding a mining vessel that appears to have been deserted for no apparent reason, only to find it crawling with these hideous, fast, lethal necromorphs was much creepier than waking up in a luxury sky-city.  The fact that it resembled our own dwellings in so many ways- day cares, churches, shopping centers, etc. was scary, but not nearly as much as the dark, dripping, tension filled Ishimura.  In some cases, I think they could've pushed the throttle forward a little bit more, like in the crypt scene.  Great atmosphere and a great place for \"something\" to happen- other than what you already expect.I did enjoy this game with its great graphics and added perks here and there (new suits), but basically, after playing it through four times, I think it falls short of what I expected as the sequel of one of the scariest games ever.  It's not enough that it's gross to stomp on dead bodies to get your ammo or to make sure to turn around to shoot the other necromorph that's behind you just after you finish off the one in front (not scary when it happens every time), it's that great tension building that drives you forward, and mad!

I actually had better luck with the D-pad without the directional cross being exclusive. The battery pack was worth it since it fits perfectly on the controller and I don't have to worry about recharging more double-A batteries. However, I bought this controller hoping that there was some major improvement with the D-pad and the analog sticks. Very minor. It's amazing that this bundle used to cost about $65-$75. When I saw that it was on sale here on Amazon.com, I pounced on the offer. Again, if you're looking for a major improvement with the D-pad, don't expect much. It's as if the twist feature for the D-pad serves to be more aesthetic if anything for the responsiveness is the same as any other 360 controller I've had over the years.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2011"}

The last few days have just flown by ever since I got this game. I like how you follow different characters' stories but they all tie in to each other. There are a lot of missions and \"side quests\", and that barely scratches the surface. Like the other games, there are many activities to participate in. There's tennis and golf as well. The strip clubs seem a lot more \"real\" this time too. I find the main storyline and other characters interesting, personally. The voice acting was great; it really feels like you're watching a movie. The graphics are spectacular, and several times while driving up in the hills I crashed because I was staring out at the sunset, just admiring the view. And believe me, the map is huge. One last thing I wanted to add was that they picked a lot of good music. Add that to all the satirical radio shows and websites and you've got many, many hours of entertainment in store.Now, the reason I gave it 4 stars was because the game crashes a lot. I've looked it up online and it seems like some people had similar problems. My Xbox is old but it's still frustrating.

If you were disappointed that Twilight Princess ever had to end then this should be your next game. This is what you need to know.  When I watched the little video clips of this game I didn't understand how this game was supposed to work with this paint brush thing?  And after playing Twilight Princess I didn't understand how a wolf could make a very good principle character because the wolf on Twilight Princess wasn't so great at battling.  But, in this game that is not the case this wolf has all kinds of bad ass weapons that can be upgraded and upgraded over and over again.  This world is so vast and there are so many side quests and worlds and secrets and abilities to obtain, it's awesome! It took me 65 hours to finish this game [70 hours for Twilight Princess] so it is very very long, but I do like to do a lot of exploring and always try to find out everything for myself rather than checking out the walk-through, go here [if you need it] [...] [and you will] the bosses are not difficult but they are VERY FUN!  And, anyway that will be relieving to you because the rest of the game is very challenging.  The downsides are this, I will admit that it took me 3 hours to understand why it was that everyone liked this game so much? I know this because the first 3 hours of this game are essentially nothing more than dialogue and not much else, so just wait it out because the rest of the game is worth it.  2nd most of the brush strokes and techniques are very difficult and frustrating to pull off - here is a BIG TIP - make sure that whenever your drawing circles the most important thing is not that they are perfect circles but that the ends meet EXACTLY so just slow down at the end of the technique to make sure that they do.  Also, whenever you want to make straight lines, then all you have to do is hold down the Z Button while you slash and it will connect every time with no difficulty.  So, ONLY 2 DOWNSIDES, TOO MUCH DIALOGUE and BRUSH TECHNIQUES that are DIFFICULT and can be VERY FRUSTRATING.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2010"}

It doesn't really excel at anything and tries to do a lot of things at once.  Set in the future you play a corporate tough guy in pursuit of the guys who tried to kill you while attacking your boss.The game is very shallow.  It does not do anything to any real depth except to ambush you behind enemy lines while trying to either evade, kill, or evade and kill piles of bad guys.Early on there are RPG-like elements -- conversations, main quests, side quests, and so forth but quickly the game devolves into a serious of extremely linear stay-hidden-or-die scenarios.  Early on there seems to be some versatility -- maybe you sneak into a place you need to get by using the jumping augmentation, maybe you move a heavy object out of the way using the arm augmentation, maybe you smooth talk your way in with your pheromone augmentation -- but, like the level design the game play also narrows considerably.  The first \"area\" was enjoyable.  The second area was enjoyable until near the end.  The third area and so on was just a relentless grind of repetition.The bosses battles are just ridiculous.  Lord help you if you specialized in hacking and stealth -- both very REASONABLE things to do with the early game play.  If you don't have the right combination of equipment and/or augments you will have a very difficult time with the bosses, especially the second.  She is just...  unacceptable.Lastly, I find the story to be less than compelling.  The whole \"ethical dilemma\" about human augmentation is so pedestrian to the game that it doesn't even matter after the first area.  The game's plot is like a hipster kid with his messenger bag, overly gel'd hair, tight pants, and his overly-practiced poses.  All dressed up, but no real substance.  Very generic Sci-Fi/(very lite)Cyberpunk fair.What started out as a game of possibilities turned into a stale cracker with a funny processed chemical taste. The label looked good, and it has all the right ingredients, but somehow it just tastes bad and leaves you wanting the real thing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2011"}

Designers think that graphics are the only thing to change, but graphics are the easy thing. The challenge is designing something new from the ground up, as when Capcom did Resident Evil 4.

It's hard to find a good mature title. I remember reading about this game eon's before the Wii was released. So when it came out I knew that I had to give it a try.I only saw a few screen shots and read some reviews on the game but I hardly pay attention to what paid reviewers say. I had to judge the game for myself. My first time playing the game I wasn't so into the style of it. I was thrown into the game without understanding what was going on. I pressed some buttons swung the Wii remote around and but the game back in the case. I just wasn't taken away by it.Some time later I found the game again and decided to give it another try. This time I stuck with it. When I got to the first boss, I then realized just how amazing this game was. The fighting was unbelievably intense! I hadn't experienced combat like this. It really got me interested in the game.Now I'll be honest about No More Heroes. The game isn't exactly polished. There are obvious areas of the game that needed more attention like vehicle controls, and the environment. However, that is just a small part of the game and can be easily over looked. This entire game is about the Bosses! and oh my! They are incredible. There seems to be so much more going on to them that isn't spoken, but it's like you get to learn everything about them by the way they fight. The Shinobu battle was one of my favorite and I fell inlove with her style (very glad she will be in the sequel).The game pretty much goes like this. You do side quest to earn money for the next fight entry, you \"warm up\" for the battle by fighting mobs of enemies,then you go and fight the boss. It's pretty simple enough. No more heroes is pretty much a fighting game thrown into an \"action adventure\" format. It works extremely well, but people that compare this game to others like GTA etc. don't understand what this game is supposed to be about.The bosses in No more heroes have alot of character and are probably some of the most interesting I have faced in all 20+ years of gaming. It's like after you defeat one assassin you can't wait to see what the other will be like.My only issue with No More Heroes is that it feels incomplete. The story even though interesting just seems like it could have more depth and development to it. The game just feels like something is missing. It's well crafted, but it's just missing that \"shine\" to it. Another thing about the game is that it's also semi challenging. The \"warm up\" battles are pretty straight forward, but the bosses can be rediculously hard, or rediculously simple, it all depends on how quickly you can adjust to their fighting style.After you fight Shinobu, you quickly learn what you need to do to beat the game, as she forces you to actually fight her logically rather than just mashing buttons and hoping for the best. Not many developers can pull of melee combat that forces you to think and study your opponent. It's what really makes this game.Just to also note, I've read lots of reviews where people talk about the art style of the game. You can't really mention No more Heroes without talking about it's visuals. The game is crafted well, and the semi-realistic art style fits right into it. The facial expressions, personalities, and overall theme of the game can't be accomplished without it. It reminds me a lot of the old Playstation \"Fear Effect\" games. It's just absolutely great.Overall this is a great Wii game to own if your a mature player. Don't really recommend for people under 17.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2009"}

{"product_name":"B008GFZV6Y","description":"","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"Looks like Nintendo just might figure out these Anniversary Collections after all","reviewText":"Mario is the leader of the Free Video Game World.  He is the most commercially successful video game character of all time, and leads the best selling video game franchise of all time (including several different subseries set within the same universe, all equally best selling).  And he has just been shown up a pink puff ball named Kirby.In celebration for Kirby's 20th anniversary, Nintendo has published \"Kirby's Dream Collection\", an anthology of six Kirby games, including exclusive new content.  At this point you are either a Kirby fan or not.  If you don't like Kirby nothing here will change your mind. But for those Kirby fans this is a Godsend.  Kirby was originally a stand in until the developers could come up with a more sophisticated character design when they made the first \"Dream Land\" game, but they got so attached to the little puff they decided to keep him.  And that's Kirby's appeal for even the \"mature\" games.  There is something irascibly attractive about the character.In every way, shape, and form, \"Kirby's Dream Collection\" trumps the rather insipid \"Super Mario 25th Anniversary Edition\" Nintendo released in 2010 for the Wii.  The \"Super Mario\" collection was simply the SNES ROM of \"Super Mario All-Stars\" thrown onto a Wii disk with no updates whatsoever.  They didn't even update the SNES controllers represented graphically in the game itself and there's so much wasted storage space on that disk it should be criminal.  I love \"All-Stars\" and bought the game, but as far as an Anniversary celebrating the biggest name in Video Gaming (and Nintendo's single most valuable character), the results were underwhelming to say the least.  It's even better than the \"Mega Man Collection\" from 2004, released on the Gamecube, Playstation 2, and original XBOX.  Unfortunately Nintendo did not issue a disk like this in celebration of \"The Legend of Zelda\" either.  If they can put Gameboy titles on a Wii disk, then they can release the Oracle games!  \"Skyward Sword\" did reference the twenty-fifth anniversary as did \"Super Mario 3D Land\" in level 5-3.  Apparently Iwata and Miyamoto did not want to release a \"Zelda\" compilation because Mario had just gotten one, for whatever sense that makes.NEW CONTENT:  There are new challenge stages (13 in total), based on the Wii \"Kirby's Return to Dreamland\".  These Challenge stages are just that: challenging and also quite fun.  The Museum section details the various games released staring Kirby.  There are also three episodes from the Kirby anime \"Kirby: Right Back At Ya!\" (\"Waddle While you Work, Kirby Comes to Cappy Town, \" and \"Crusade for the Blade\").  There is also a 48 page book included covering Kirby's history and is also an activity book.  Note that one of the answers (Cupid Kirby) on the quiz on Page 28 in incorrect.  Also some of the art work has been updated.CONTROLS:  You can play the anthology with the Wii Remote, a Gamecube Controller (with those who have the older model Wiis that support Gamecube Functionality) and the Wii Classic Controller.  My recommendation is to use the Classic Controller for the SNES and 64 titles.SOUNDTRACK:  There are forty five tracks from 16 different Kirby games.  Much, much better than the palty 28 minute CD included in the \"Super Mario\" Anniversary collection, which consisted of a handful of songs and a good deal of actual sound effects from the series.As other reviewers have noted all games use save state technology, so if you decided to stop a game for whatever reason, you can return to it at the same spot later on.  This is great news for the games that originally had no save functions.The only real noticeable flaw is that of omission of one key title that should have been included.  Notably, the collection is missing \"Kirby and the Amazing Mirror\", a Gameboy Advanced title currently available only to 3DS Ambassadors who bought their 3DS before the price cut. This is one of the best Kirby titles and quite extensive, being a \"Metroidvania\" type game.  It's a real shame that they didn't include that game, as it's probably my favorite of the Kirby series.  Although there are several spin-off games not included, \"Kirby and the Amazing Mirror\" is the most puzzling omission from the Collection, as it's easily one of Kirby's strongest games and is no longer available commercially.  I'm actually docking the collection a star due to not including this game, it's that good!At this point, I will go over the individual games, as well as the spin-off games that weren't included, and then end the review with the official tracklisting for the Soundtrack that's also included with the game and the 13 challenge levels.  There's a lot of info there and the review is rather long, so if you want to skip those sections I understand.  For Kirby fans they will already know the games.  For new comers you may find the blurbs educational and helpful on informing your decision to purchase this or not.Bottom line: Buy this for the Kirby fan in your life! And if you never played a Kirby game, pick this up and see what you've been missing all these years!  For those looking for a great compilation this is the one to get!  And it shows hope:  maybe Nintendo is on the path and will figure out this Anniversary collection after all, given how badly they botched Mario's anniversary.  With only one glaring omission (not including the Gameboy Advance \"Kirby and the Amazing Mirror\", arguably one of his best games), this collection does everything right that Mario got wrong.---------THE GAMES:  Like any good anthology, the stars of the overall package are the games themselves, and here they are:\"Kirby's Dreamland\":  Kirby's debut, and probably the only Gameboy title ever available to play on the WIi itself.  Rather basic compared to subsequent installments, \"Kirby's Dreamland\" is a rather charming platformer from the early 1990s.  Although many of the series' conventions get their start right here, Kirby's famous copy ability doesn't show up until the next game.  Originally there was no save in this title.\"Kirby's Adventure\": released in May of 1993 (the penultimate year of the NES's lifespan), this platforming game is Kirby's only NES release and also the first appearance of the popular Metal Knight and Kirby's copy ability.  The game features seven different worlds and several boss fights.  Kirby must collect the seven fragments of the Star Rod to return order to the Fountain of Dreams so others may dream again.  Graphically, this is one of the best NES titles, featuring quasi 3D backgrounds and parallax scrolling.  The game was 6 megabytes, one of the largest NES titles ever released in terms of memory.  As a late generation NES title, like \"Little Samson\", \"Duck Tales 2\" and \"Little Nemo: Dream Master\" this is one of the key titles from this era of the NES's lifespan.  Unfortunately (myself included), many gamers missed this title when it was first released, having moved onto the SNES and Sega Genesis.  The game has also been released back in 2007 on the Wii's Virtual Console.  The game does have a save feature.\"Kirby's Dreamland 2\": Kirby's second Gameboy appearance, this game builds on the previous two titles, as well as including three new playable animal characters (think of the four playable characters from the NES \"Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse\".  Kirby can jump, swim, fly, and inhale his enemies for to shoot as projectiles or to eat and heal himself.  The three new characters are Kine the Ocean Sunfish who carries  Kirby on the swimming levels even against harsh currents (but isn't good, naturally, onland), Rick the Hampster who Kirby rides and who doesn't slip on the ice, Coo the Owl who navigates harsh winds and allows Kirby to inhale on the flying stages.  The Super Gameboy version includes limited color and each stage has a specific color theme.  The version on the disk is the regular Gameboy title.\"Kirby's Super Star\": released in 1996, this was one of the last SNES titles released and also has had a DS remake called \"Kirby's Super Star Ultra\".  The game comprises eight smaller games.  \"Spring Breeze\" is a simplified remake of the original Gameboy \"Dream Land\".  \"Dyna Balde\" is a four level platforming game where Kirby must battle a giant bird that is disrupting Dreamland's crops.  \"Gourmet Race\" is a simple racing game (and probably the least substantial mini-game here).  Kirby must collect treasures in a cave in the \"The Great Cake Offensive\" .  Some of the treasures are winking nods to other Nintendo IPs, such as Captain Falcon's Helment, Mr. Saturn, the Screw Attack from Metroid, and the Triforce which is of course Zelda religious artifact pivotal to that series.  Kirby must battle the Meta Knight's battleship in \"Revenge of the Meta Knight\" .  \"Milky Way Wishs\" is the largest game in \"Kirby Super Star\", where Kirby must travel through nine different planets to battle evil.  \"The Arena\" is an endurance challenge where Kirby must fight all the bosses from the various other games (a total of 26 boss battles spread across 19 stages).\"Kirby's Dreamland 3\" is the second SNES title and third \"Dream Land\" tile, released within a year of \"Super Star\".  Abandoning many of the game play conventions of \"Super Star\", \"Dream Land 3\" is based heavily on the first two \"Dream Land\" titles; as a result, critics were harsh on the game for not utilizing the conventions established in \"Super Star\".  For those who like the original Gameboy titles and NES title you'll love this, though playing this after playing \"Super Star\" does make you feel that the series was regressing backwards.  This was the last first party game released for the SNES.\"Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards\": in the era of 3D obsession, \"The Crystal Shards\" along with \"Yoshi's Story\" is one of the very few 2D platformers (in this case, 2.5D) available for purchase on the N64.  The game is rather short but fun while it lasts.  This one is available for purchase on the Wii's Virtual Console and featuers three minigames in addition to the mian quest.  These support up to four players with difficulty settings of \"Easy, Medium, Hard, Intense\".THE SPIN-OFF GAMES NOT INCLUDEDThere are seven games that are spin-offs and subgames of the Kirby series and not part of the lineage of the main series, and none of them are included.  These are the following:\"Kirby's Pinball Land\" which appears on Gameboy and the second title Kirby appears in, as it was released even  before the NES game).  Available on the 3DS Virtual Console.\"Kirby's Avalanche\": an SNES puzzle game and a localization of the Japan exclusive \"Super Puyo Puyo\".  The game was never released in Japan.  The game uses sprites from the Sonic game \"Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine\".  Available on the Wii Virtual Console.\"Kirby's Toybox\":  eight minigames broadcast over the Satellaview back in 1996.  These games are not commercially available in any form whatsoever since the discontinuation of the Satellaview\"Kirby's Dream Course\": An SNES golf game played form an isometric point of view, available on the Wii's Virtual Console.\"Kirby's Block Ball\": a Breakout type puzzle game for the Gameboy, available on the 3DS Virtual Console.\"Kirby's Star Stacker\": a Gameboy Puzzle game similar to \"Dr. Mario\" and \"Tetris\", released in 1997 and available on the 3DS Virtual Console.  The game was remade as a Super Famicom exclusive called \"Kirby no Kirakira Kizzu\".  This SNES version was never released outside of Japan, and is available on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan.\"Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble\": a Gameboy Colour title, this one is built around motion controls and tilting and tumbling the Gameboy itself to control what is happening on the screen.  Humourously enough, if you play this game on the Gameboy Player for the Gamecube, the only way to control what is happening on the screen is moving the Gamecube itself.A List of the Challenge levels:Happiness Hall:Sword ChallengeParasol ChallengeSpark ChallengeMagolor Race Level 1Apricot Atrium:Whip ChallengeFighter Combat ChamberWing ChallengeMagolor Race Level 2Last Land:Smash Combat ChamberNormal ChallengeMagolor Race Level 3Smash Combat Chamber EXMagolor Race EXSOUNDTRACK:Kirby's Dream Land1.

{"product_name":"B00FM5IY0Q","description":"","reviewerName":"Geekdomo \"GeekDomo\"","summary":"Not ready for primetime...","reviewText":"The 3rd installment of Dead Rising made officially as an XBox One release day game, is full of issues. The story takes over as Nick and his friends look to escape the city infected with a mass zombie horde. The zombies in this game are slow and stupid, not nearly as silly as some like seen in World War Z or as incessant as the ones in Day Z. Now if you follow my YouTube channel you will see I am big Zombie fan. I did a whole series where I played some 30 zombie games. Getting this game for the Xbox One was almost a no brainer for me. I was soon disappointed with the game I got day 1.The main issues I have with this game are these. When you have a brainless slasher combat game you need simplicity of control.Often I would be fighting and accidentally hit a button that would throw my weapon away. Or when in the midst of combat I needed to eat some food the devs decided that picking up a bag of chips and then eating it should be 2 separate buttons. While from the outside it seems so common sense that it should be easy to remember, in the midst of combat its anything but intuitive and a real chore to remember the keys. Sure with enough muscle memory you might get it but its really difficult in the beginning. Ok so your amazing with muscle memory.Ignore that part of my review if you will. Instead the physics are laughable at best. Several times I would bump into another object to have my car explode and I flip no less than 300 times down the road to stand up unscathed. Once I bumped into a parked tow truck (a side rescue mission to clear out the zombies around this girl) The car became damaged but I kept on clearing out the Zeds.What happened next was hilarious if it wasn't so sad. The car blew up, I flipped 300 times in the air and flew into a building a block away. When I stood up I had killed all of the Zombies around the girl and every car in the area was on its roof.  Its not just when the car blows up that the physics are laughable its most things you hit/run into when driving.Shooting in this game seems a bit off too. Its hard to describe, but the camera angles are all wrong. You never get to really aim well. Its just a sloppy mess and your better off not using a gun at all.Pros:+ A day one zombie release for Xbox One+ Lots of carnage+ Silly situations are funCons:- Controller a mess (too many functions for a hack & slash game)- Camera following is terrible when shooting- Physics are atrocious with regard to explosions and damage- Feels really sloppy- Graphics are for Xbox 360Overall I was not happy with the gameplay/controls/physics. Also this is an obvious 360 game ported to the One. The graphics are decent at best. I realize its a release title and they didn't write it for the One but it still feels old.Recommendation:Skip this for now and get it in the bargain bin next year.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J9M0","description":"","reviewerName":"Nathaniel V. Graham","summary":"Could have been worse.","reviewText":"Portal 1 was fantastic, and it probably ruined me for the second one. This game had all the potential in the world and they dropped the ball time and again. Where the first game you had so much room for creativity in solving the puzzles, they made sure you had to do each one in Portal 2 their way. They accomplished this by having 95% of the surfaces in the game \"unportalable\", so basically anywhere you can actually make a portal was part of the solution. This of course made the puzzles much easier which was another disappointment. Armed with the skills I picked up in the first game, I was able to breeze thru this one in less time then the original, in spite of this one having a lot more content. Never did I have to wrack my brain and spend sometimes hours bouncing around a level until I finally had that eureka moment where I came up with the solution. This follows a sad trend of games \"Catering to casuals\", gone are the days of it \"beating\" a game, now you just finish it. There were a few laughs, and it was worth playing, I guess. This was a failed rehash of a masterpiece. If I never played Portal 1 I would probably give this 4 stars, but I did.  Two and a half stars.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-10-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXI6K","description":"","reviewerName":"G. Denick","summary":"Everyone's Favorite Lombax and Backpack Robot Return (yes, it includes the Sly Cooper demo)","reviewText":"Ratchet and Clank is probably my favorite franchise of all time, and certainly my favorite Sony franchise. Of all the great titles from the PS2 era, this is the one series that I still return to. The gameplay, the humor, the art direction, the creature and robot design, the characters... it all just comes together perfectly in the strange, whacky universe that Ratchet, Clank, and Captain Quark live within.Now, I can finally play those PS2 classics in HD format, and boy, does it make a difference. I was reserved about the graphics, based on the available photos, but the pictures look nowhere as good as the actual games when they're in action on your HDTV. It's great to see the visuals so crisply sharpened up, and tailored to fit a widescreen. Understandably, these games look nowhere near as good as \"Tools of Destruction\" or \"A Crack in Time\", since those were developed from the ground up for a more sophisticated console. But that's okay. The gameplay is so rock solid, and the improvement to the visuals is so significant, I quickly lost myself in these adventures once again... it was like a reunion with a great friend. Insanely addictive and enjoyable, I immediately resumed trying to scoop up every last bolt, and acquire every last, whacky weapon and gadget. The mechanics/controls have aged remarkably well (even with the lack of strafing in #1), as have the storytelling and voice acting aspects.The addition of trophies, along with the ever popular \"skill points\" that the series is known for, is a huge bonus for players who want to reinvest time exploring these fantastic alien worlds. I obviously have not had time to explore every nook and cranny of this enormous collection, but so far, so good, and I'm looking forward to every moment of revisiting these adventures. It sure took a while, but it was worth the wait. My one minor gripe is that \"Deadlocked\" is not included, making this one title short of a complete R&C; collection from the PS2 era. Insomniac, if you're listening... please consider adding \"Deadlocked\" as a DLC to reward your loyal fans. Thanks!Update: Some have commented about the Sly Cooper demo. It comes in the form of a \"voucher\" code, which must be redeemed on PSN.Update #2: Maybe somebody at Insomniac heard us, because they just announced that \"Deadlocked\" will be available on PSN later this year!Update #3: After thoroughly putting RC#1 HD through its paces, here are my further thoughts (all good):I picked up RC for the PS2 when it was first released in 2002. At the time, I was wowed by the game. It seemed to take platformers to a whole new level, and it was one of the most enjoyable experiences I ever had with the PS2 console. It combined great humor, storytelling, platforming, combat, weapons, gadgets, and variety. The variety came from a number of tastefully implemented elements that broke up the gameplay, including using your Trespasser gadget to crack hi-tech locks, using Clank to control miniature \"Gadgetbots\" and solve puzzles, piloting starships in intergalactic battles, and even transforming into a gigantic robot to get into some arena-style combat.More than anything else, this game got me HOOKED- I had to play it right to the end, and after that, I wanted to uncover all the hidden bolts, skill points, weapons, and gadgets. Never did I imagine that I would have as much fun when I went back to revisit RC with the RC Collection on PS3. But I'm happy to report that I did!I CANNOT believe this game is TEN years old! It's true that it's been given the \"HD makeover\", but the content and gameplay mechanics are identical to the original. Even though this was the first RC entry, and improvements would slowly occur over time (such as strafing and an enhanced \"quick select\"), this game has aged remarkably well, and it's still as gripping and fun as it was ten years ago. What's just as impressive is how incredibly GOOD this game looks. Nothing was \"rebuilt\"; developer Idol Minds simply enhanced the resolution to HD and fit it to widescreen format. Yet, this game looks better than most PS3 games... and it's only a PS2 game! That speaks volumes about the fantastic, cartoony art direction that this series has always embraced, and the wonderful passion with which developer Insomniac poured into this game.Ratchet and Clank fans, and newcomers alike- rejoice!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2012"}

Overall I thought that this game broke new ground mainly by doing something different, being different takes guts.  This game is considered the king of quicktime events, these are actions you must replicate onscreen or you can't move forward in the story or if you fail to replicate correctly your character fails.  Quicktime events have never to my knowledge been used so heavily in game before.  Truth be known this game was really constructed with Sony's motion control add on device in mind, however the game was finished much too early to wait for this new device to be released in time, so they released it to be compatible with the standard controller.  Here in lies the reason why so many people hated this game, they found it difficult to control the main characters, they didn't care for QTE's  or they found the story to be non-compelling.  Those critics who didn't think the story was engaging are most likely the younger generation those born in the 1990's and up.  I would venture to say that 90% of those born in the late 70's and early 80's who have children of their own would certainly appreciate the mature storyline.One critique:  Why did the character they we feel compelled to love have to be the character that we learn to hate?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2010"}

Then February. Then March. Then April. Now it's here. In June. 7 months after it was supposed to come out. Watch the previews of the game and it will say coming \"This Winter.\" It sure feels hot out for winter. The reason it was delayed is because the very smart people at Core couldn't fix all the problems with the game. So with 7 months of working on it you'd think the game would be perfect. Not so. Anybody who plays the game for 5 min can find several problems with the game. The main problem is the AI. I've been bitten by a dog, who is behind a fence, and 15 feet away from where I was standing. Big problem here. Also, Lara moves VERY slowly and she's very stiff. She actually controlled better back on Playstation 1. You now automatically climb on to things just by walking up to them. This is a serious problem since if you're in a tight jam you may accidentally climb up on something when you don't want to. The game also takes very long to load. Just to get to your inventory takes several seconds to load. And the game suffers from serious slow down many times. And by slow I mean SLOW! It's strange too since I've played much more complicated games where there was no slow down at all. So what is good about this game? Well, the story for one thing. The graphics are beautiful but some things like Lara's ears are all blurry. The voice acting is pretty good. I'd have to say the best thing about the game is the bonus features. I think Core knew the game would never be perfect so to make up for it's faults they gave fans extras like a preview of the Tomb Raider 2 movie and the making of the game. For people who pre-ordered the game from ebworld.com, they got a bonus DVD with LOADS of Tomb Raider goodies such as Memorable Moments from previous games, TV Spots, a TV show dedicated to Tomb Raider and a featurette of \"The Hand Of Fate.\" Very nice. So for this the game was well worth the money I spent on it.Graphics: 4.5 (beautiful but suffers from slow down)Sound: 5.0 (great music and voice acting)Control: 3.5 (Lara is stiff and often doesn't do what she's supposed to)Fun Factor: 4.0 (it'll give you something to do)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2003"}

I've played with Super Mario Kart (SNES) and Mario Kart: Super Ciruit(GBA) but not Mario Kart 64(N64) but i do have experience with the series. I have to say, this game is tougher than its predecessors. Especially the 150cc. You know the usual four cups, Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup, Star Cup, and Special Cup. However there is one extra cup, The All Tour Cup. You could only unlock it if you win 1st place in the 150cc in the Special Cup, a pretty complicated task. I'm still training myself so i hope to beat the Special sometime soon. The graphics in this game were great. It was kinda real. the karts are different, this time you have two people racing in one kart. The person in the front takes care of the driving while the person in the back takes care of the items. You could switch both characters via the z button. You could also pair the characters in any which way you want. Just for fun, you could even pair Mario with archnemesis Bowser (very ironic) and Bowser Jr. with Luigi (weird). there are also other unlockables, bu i don't wanna spoil the surprise.

Unfortunately this doesn't necessarily translate into \"Kill Fun\" as some poor level designs, clumsy controls, and terrible AI in solo play sucks a lot of fun out of the game.  The story is set 10 years after the events in the first game.  Much of the frozen tundra of planet E.D.N. III has given way to tropical jungles and arid deserts, opening up new terrain for the player and also meaning that T-ENG (Therma Energy) doesn't drain as drastically as it did in the first game.Perhaps the biggest growth in video gaming is in online play but its nice if a game still gives you the option of playing online or solo.  The first thing you notice when selecting the campaign mode in Lost Planet 2 is that the options all appear to be online options such as selecting a quick match or a custom match to join where you select the episode and chapter you wish to play.  This puts you into a multi-player game with three other players in a cooperative environment.  So how do you play solo?  Good question...The game virtually hides solo play (never even calling it solo play) in the Create your Own Game option.  To play solo you have to set the AI players to three.  You also have to set the connection type to offline so you can pause your game.  More on solo play later...The muddled storyline finds you and the other players taking the roles of various factions who are battling for control of the planet's T-ENG and fighting off hordes of E.D.N. III's native aliens known as Akrid which are giant bugs that make the monsters in Starship Trooper look like fleas.  The problem here is that you're essentially playing as a nameless grunt so there's little in the way of character development.  Playing cooperatively is the key to having a successful campaign, as some of the levels can be long and frustratingly difficult.  In one sequence you're battling a giant worm while riding on a speeding train and given little hint as to what to do to defeat the creature.  Fail, and you're doing the whole thing over again with 20 - 25 minutes of gameplay lost.  The game is played in six episodes, which are divided into several chapters that you'll get to know well by repeating them over and over.One of the stumbling blocks of the multi-player campaign play is the wait to join a game.  Even selecting the quick match can leave you waiting for several minutes for an opening to join.  You can't join a game that is already in progress until the level is complete or a checkpoint is reached.  This all pales next to the solo play which Capcom and clearly discourages.  The AI of the NPCs is awful.  The three NPCs will often all converge on the same data post, seemingly fighting over who gets to access the info.  Even worse, they'll stand about staring off into space as you are getting attacked.  I can't imagine it's even possible to complete the campaign playing solo.One of your main tools is your anchor which is a projectile rappelling tool that allows you to scale walls, mountains, giant Akrid, etc...Recently Just Cause 2 came out which had a similarly device that was simply a joy to use.  You felt like Spider-Man shooting out a web strand and propelling yourself along...here your anchor is as likely to pull you off the edge of a cliff, as it is to save you.Lost Planet 2's strength lies in its visuals, which are fantastic.  The monsters are big and there is a large variety of them.  The cutaway videos are gorgeous, making you feel as if you are in the midst of the action.  There's great special effects and explosions, usually courtesy of some of the many cool weapons you get to use and its in this area where Capcom did a great job.The multi-player online play gets a nod over the campaign play by far.  It's no Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, but it's a lot of fun.  The usual options of Deathmatches and capturing the flag (i.e. Akrid Eggs), Team Elimination and more. Fugitive mode is back as well and pits a small team of lightly armed fugitives avoiding capture against a fully equipped team of hunters.  There's a good number of map choices and Capcom promises a lot of downloadable content as well.The bottom line with Lost Planet 2 is that if you enjoy cooperative or multiplayer online play, then its worth at least a rent or two but if you like to fly solo you'll want to pass on this one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ9YB0","reviewerName":"Steven Bonner","summary":"Revolutionary fun! This should not be passed up at ALL.","reviewText":"Warioware: Smooth Moves is a wonderful first party title that was released way back in January 07, near the start of the Wii's lifespan. It was one of my first Wii games, and it was the game I had the most fun with, by far. The game to this day feels revolutionary and is great to pick up and play.It's a collection of microgames, you have 5 seconds for each game. Now to me, that sounds bad and I wouldn't expect to get any fun out of it. Well, having been a fan since the GBA original, I for one know this series is very fun. Its all about the entertainment, and boy does Nintendo provide us with lots of it! Before each microgame starts, a box will pop up showing you how to hold your Wiimote. This prevents tons of confusion. Without this, we wouldn't know what the hell to do. When each game starts, instructions will appear for a second. They are usually 1 or 2 words; You get the point. Adding in the control scheme, quickly your mind must decide what to do. And for the most part, its not hard to understand. If you are fluent in your mind's movements, then you should be okay while playing this game. It makes you think fast!The animation is wonderful. Through each of the many stages you can play, there is a cute little animation of things such as dancing cats or cheerleaders cheering you on that move around before each microgame starts. These are very entertaining to look at, so the game always has you enjoying what it has to offer. There are also boss stages which are not timed, and these can be very fun. Some of them aren't as good as others. They range from a Punch-Out clone to a full blown SNES Star Fox blastathon! Insanely awesome!!The music is original, and the sound effects are funny. The game also has sounds come out of the Wiimote, and that's always interesting to hear. One microgame has you pick up the Wiimote like a phone, only to have the Wiimote's speaker say, \"Sorry, you have the wrong number\". Revolutionary, I say. Absolutely revolutionary.The game is full of fast paced action and has many stages, as well as hundreds of microgames. Its full of replay value, and once you beat it, its always fun to back and play some more microgames. There are also a few unlockable standalone games with no time limit, in which you go for the biggest score possible. Can Shooter is similar to Duck Hunt, check that fire out.I highly suggest this to every Wii owner. It appeals to the most casual, as well as the most hardcore of gamers. It also seems vastly underrated, like Wario's other game on the Wii, Wario Land: Shake It. Wario needs love just like Mario, and I say give it to him. By God, give it to the man. He deserves it. Wario has never disappointed us. Ever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2010"}

BioShock immerses players into a war-torn underwater utopia, where mankind has abandoned their humanity in their quest for perfection.","reviewerName":"The Matrix Fan \"Video Gamer since 1979.\"","summary":"\"This shooter's got soul, so give it a shot.\"","reviewText":"+ PROS:+ Beautiful, detailed world to explore in a first-person perspective+ Several upgradable weapons & superhuman abilities+ Morality-based game endings+ A completely justifiable purchase at Greatest Hits pricing- CONS:- Some areas are unmarked on the maps- Easily missed trophies can make the game frustratingPLOT:The year is 1960. The game starts with a plane crash and our main character (Jack) is the only survivor. After swimming to a lighthouse, we reach a bathysphere and descend into the underwater society of Rapture...a world created by Andrew Ryan. He was frustrated with the rules and regulations of the surface world, so he started an attempted utopia - which has fallen into a decidedly dystopian state.As we explore Rapture, we learn its inhabitants have undergone some horrifying changes. The scientists/geneticists of Rapture learned how to splice DNA so anyone could gain new abilities: telekinesis, pyrokinesis, cryokinesis...but repeated gene splicing proved to be as addictive as heroin. These de-gene-erates are shadows of their former selves, and will kill anyone who gets in the way of their lust for ADAM - the substance that makes Rapture go `round.GAMEPLAY:BioShock is presented in a first-person shooter view.  Jack's right hand takes control of the various weaponry including guns, flamethrowers, grenade launchers, and so forth.His left hand is in control of the Plasmids - these include abilities such as throwing bolts of electricity, encasing enemies in ice, hurling fireballs, and much more. These abilities can be found, bought, or created throughout the game.The transition between plasmids and hand-to-hand weapons is very smooth - just a press of the L1 or R1 buttons.Jack also has the ability to hack machines like security cameras and gun turrets to turn the tables on his enemies, and he can hack safes and vending machines to get more goodies or buy items at a discounted price. You can also hack door codes to get into locked areas.Research photos can be taken of each enemy, which provides damage bonuses and other upgrades.A good portion of your time will be spent trying to upgrade Jack's abilities for the dangers that are surely to come as the game continues. The only way to purchase new abilities is with a substance called ADAM, and ADAM can only be obtained by taking it from small girls genetically altered into \"Little Sisters\". Each Little Sister has a protector - a \"Big Daddy.\"Fighting a Big Daddy is akin to a mouse fighting a gorilla, but if you defeat him, you have the option to either Harvest or Rescue the Little Sister...and the choices you make will affect the game's ending, similar to the morality gameplay mechanic inFallout 3.A FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER GAME? I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T LIKE THOSE?To be perfectly honest, I usually hate first-person shooter games because they rarely offer much in the way of storyline. What can I say, I'm a sucker for a good story.BioShock is one of the only shooter games that made me forget I was playing a shooter game, if that makes any sense. The storyline compelled me to push further into Rapture, I found myself genuinely concerned for the plight of the Little Sisters, and I had a sense of true satisfaction when I finally finished the game and eventually earned the Platinum trophy.It was only afterwards that I realized I voluntarily played a shooter game all the way through, three times. And I consider that time well spent.TROPHIES:There are 54 trophies to earn and 12 more if you purchase theBioShock Challenge Roomspackage.At times it feels like game designers throw in trophies for the sole purpose of making us insane...but this is one of the few games I've encountered where earning trophies actually makes you a better game player.For example: The first time through the game, you might rush through and not do the photo research, which in turn makes the game harder. While you earn the research photo trophies, you unlock damage bonuses and upgrades (such as automatic hacks for turrets). When you start playing the game on Survivor difficulty, since you know researching enemies will make the game easier, you'll be eager to play the paparazzi early on to make your battles less time-consuming.CONS:There are very few cons to this game, but I feel they are worth mentioning.Some of the levels branch into other areas, but they are not marked on the maps. If you're a trophy hound, you will definitely be backtracking a lot, and you'll get lost without a strategy guide. Thankfully, there are plenty to be found out there.Some of the trophies can be missed (such as Weapon Specialist) and you'll have no idea why or how you missed them until it's too late. Since the game autosaves, unless you had a backup at an earlier point, you have to start all over again. Again, this is preventable by checking a strategy guide.FINAL VERDICT?BioShock took me a while to love, but it grew on me and I consider it a worthwhile gaming experience. It's probably the only shooter game I've ever played that made me forget I was playing a shooter game, and that's not easy to do.To say that Ken Levine did a top-notch job creating BioShock sounds like I'm selling the game short. I would definitely recommend it.A special shout-out to my compadre AJ, who asked me \"Would you kindly buy this before you leave the store? This shooter's got soul, so give it a shot.\"","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2011"}

As these survivors' allies mysteriously fall victim to dementia, it becomes clear that protecting a young girl granting them a bizarre immunity may be their only hope for survival in a struggle that could have implications for all of humanity.GameplayAlthough designed to preserve the feel of the action of the original game, gameplay inExtractionis also quite unique. First, the player perspective has been changed from third, to first-person, placing all the action right in front of you. Also,Extractionis a 'rail shooter,' meaning a shooter game where most of the action engaged in and paths followed are programmed into the mission play, instead of the freeform wandering ability built into the considerably larger Next-Gen and PCDead Spacerelease. The combination of these two changes funnels the players focus onto the combat options available in the game. In dealing with the danger of the alien Necromorphs swarming the game space,Dead Space Extractionutilizes the precision of the Wii Remote in variety of ways. Weapons like the Plasma Cutter can dispatch these enemies from a distance by taking advantage of the remote's pointing targeting ability, while a quick wave can activate weapons like the Ripper, a guidable spinning saw blade. The Wii Remote is also handy for picking up items and hurling them at enemies using the power of Kinesis.Other gameplay changes include new play modes. The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn't become too easy. In addition,Extractionalso features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed. Taken together all these changes add up to more action, more fun and moreDead Spacefor players on the Wii.Key Game FeaturesAn All-New Prequel Exclusively for the WiiFollow the lives of several different Aegis VII colony members as they carve a bloody path to survival.Meet a new cast of characters, destroy fearsome new enemies, and wield brutal new weapons.Real TerrorStunning graphics, panic-inducing audio, and a frenetic first-person perspective thrust you headlong into the terror.Play through an engrossing, interactive horror movie experience that raises the bar for storytelling in video games.Intuitive ControlsStrategically dismember your enemies with pinpoint control using the Wii Remote.Wield a powerful arsenal of abilities and weapons to freeze enemies, manipulate gravity with telekinesis, solve puzzles, and fight off attacks from every direction in zero gravity.Co-Op GameplayTeam up with a friend to fight off the invasion on the USG Ishimura with jump-in cooperative play.Combine efforts on engineering puzzles or determine specific roles to create a unique experience with each play session.","reviewerName":"Rich Stoehr \"Idle Rich\"","summary":"Changing the game","reviewText":"The verdict has been in for a while now - the original 'Dead Space' is a modern masterpiece, a nearly ideal fusion of science fiction and scare-you-out-of-your-seat horror. Its flaws are few and can be easily dismissed in light of how well it plays and the effect it has on those who dare.So why mess with a formula that works so well? 'Dead Space: Extraction' is the answer to that question. It's a game that succeeds well on its own merits and even manages to improve on some things from the original.Where 'Dead Space' was a survival horror game that put the player in full control of a single character, able to stop and start at will and explore fully, 'Extraction' is a \"rail shooter,\" meaning that the player does not fully control character movement, and it is seen from the first person. The player is in charge of picking up powerups, occasionally selecting from a choice of routes, and shooting whatever beasties pop up in our path.And there's a lot to shoot at. Many of the same creatures from the original 'Dead Space' make their appearance here as well, rendered in lovingly gory detail. The Wii's graphical limitations were surely pushed to their limit here, but it rises to the challenge as grotesque monsters and mutants attack the players in seemingly never-ending succession. Sounds, too, are reproduced faithfully, and the same growls, shrieks, and gurgles you remember from the original are plentiful in 'Extraction.'The story of 'Extraction' takes place prior to the events of 'Dead Space,' beginning with the discovery of an ancient artifact (\"The Marker\") and carrying through to the infection of the crew of the USG Ishimura and the chaos that follows. In some ways it's a bigger story than the one in 'Dead Space,' told from the perspective of several different characters and spanning a lot more plot and intrigue than the original. The multiple character viewpoints, and the transitions between them, are handled very well, and each character has their own important piece of the puzzle. 'Extraction' also does an excellent job explaining some of the more frustrating aspects of Isaac's many tasks in 'Dead Space,' and unlike Isaac's dearth of personality from the original game, 'Extraction' features full-bodied and well-drawn characters, each with their own personalities, their own agendas and their own secrets.\"But Rich!\" I hear you saying. \"Is it SCARY?!\"Scary? Disturbing? Upsetting? Nausea-inducing? Oh yes - it's all of this and more.What impressed me most about 'Extraction' is that it not only replicated the feel of the original, it enhanced and broadened the effect. Rather than a limitation, the \"on-rails\" aspect turns the game into a mad rush to escape a rapidly deteriorating situation. In 'Dead Space' you were mostly alone on the huge Ishimura from the very beginning and it was the sense of isolation that was frightening, but you can take all the time you need to explore it and deal with it. In 'Extraction' you begin on a fully-populated space station. When things go bad, they go bad fast. The scenes of sheer madness as the infection takes hold are memorable and fast-paced, filled with disturbing images and sounds as the games pushes you inexorably forward.After the first five or ten minutes (which is sort of a training mode with a nasty twist), you're immediately on the GO-GO-GO setting, with precious few chances to stop and catch your breath until you meet your end, one way or another. You'll find weapons along the way, familiar friends like the trusty plasma cutter and some new toys too, and you have to be quick to keep them powered and loaded. Missed a powerup or ammo pack? No time to go back and get it. Wanted to check out that hallway? Too bad, we're moving on. Unlike some rail shooters, I found this aspect of 'Extraction' added to the intensity of the game as a whole, and propelled the story forward steadily.Once you get deeper into the game, the ship is dark and quiet and the sense of menace hangs all around. Things go from bad to worse as the infection spreads. An unforgettable scene near the end forces you to do something you REALLY don't want to do. And thanks to the Wii controls, you get the experience viscerally as well as visually.The controls are simple and intuitive, and after the first few minutes shouldn't cause any problems. Shooting is as easy as pointing at the screen and pulling the \"trigger,\" while using telekinesis is also a simple button press. Reloading can be done quickly if you learn the trick, and shaking the nunchuk in the right area will even charge up a glow stick to beat back the darkness for a while.Final analysis: 'Dead Space: Extraction' matches the look and feel of the first game almost perfectly, fills in many aspects of the story we were missing from the original game, and is a grisly, gory, scarily satisfying experience overall. You don't have to have played the original to play this, but at least knowing the story of the original will help you understand what's happening. Those familiar with the Dead Space story already should find this a worthy, if different, experience, and those new to the horrifying alien mutations will likely be blown away.Why mess with what worked before? Because they can, and they can do it well.This is a great game - probably the best rail shooter for the Wii so far, a real testament to the capability of the system, and a fitting way to expand on the story of 'Dead Space.'Scary? You bet your last plasma round it is.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2011"}

Savings as far as buying as a bundle:This is actually a really good deal for 2 reasons. One, the PS3 320GB system normally cost anywhere new between $290 and $300 dollars by itself which means your getting Uncharted 3 (As of this writing the retail is between between $50 and $60 dollars) for free. Second, is with the cost of Hard drives having doubled and in some cases almost tripled due to the current hard drive shortage the hard drive alone is worth anywhere between $150 to $200 dollars by itself. the overall cost savings on both items mentioned more than justifies this purchase.2. The PS3 Game Console System:This is actually our family's second PS3, the 1st one my son got an almost pristine PS3 1st Generation 60gb CECHAxx Launch model (November 2006) from his 2 best friends as a Christmas Present, not realizing at the time what a diamond in the rough he was receiving. I'm not going to lie to you, If anybody still owns one of this original launch models and it still works, KEEP IT! They are vastly superior to these newer \"Slim\" Models that Sony is now selling. The reason for the additional purchase is Problems started to arise with \"play time\" on the PS3 with my son so I decided to go ahead and purchase one for myself and the rest of the family. With that being said, I will move on with the review of this 320GB 4th generation PS3 Slim Model (CECH-30xxB series).The Hardware on the inside is the same reliable PS3 Hardware Sony has sold since almost after the launch of the original PS3 in North America (Once they fixed the Blu-Ray defect). Starts right up, plays my PS3 Games perfectly, works with my blu-rays, and works perfectly with my home Network. The Dual Shock 3 wireless Controller that comes with it works awesome and is easy to use. The HDMI and Sound are also equally awesome (Has to be plugged into a \"amplifier/receiver\" to tap into the Dolby Digital sound experience). As far as the drawbacks go there really is only 1 that stares you right in the face and that is the New \"Slim\" Design, It's God Awful. The Best way to describe is as my oldest son put it; \"Dad, That looks Ghetto!\"; However, due to its size it was easily hidden inside my entertainment center and barely noticeable to the naked eye. The only other minor problem is sometimes you can hear the hard drive on the PS3 when it's being written to and read to.Features of the PS3 4th Generation Console:* 802.11b/g Wi-Fi* 2 X USB 2.0 ports* BRAVIA Sync XMB control (CEC)* Slimmer form factor* Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio bitstreaming (available Through Optical Sound Cord with an open optical port on your Home Theaters \"Amplifier/Receiver\")* 320GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive (Upgradeable up to 1TB 9.5mm form factor laptop hard drives)* 3D Capable for both 3D Blu-Ray Games and Movies (You muat have a 3D capable monitor or TV in order for this to work)* Plays normal CD and DVD movie or Music ROMS* 10/100/1000 built-in NIC* Playstation 1 (PS1) Backward Compatibility.

Also Additional Accessories like the MOVE Package can be added to this system as well.3. The Uncharted 3 Game:For those who have played the previous Uncharted games you will not be disappointed, it bigger and badder than before. Nathan Drake and mentor Victor Sullivan are once again traveling around the world to such places as the Rub' al Khali desert, in search of the legendary lost city, the Iram of the Pillars. Elena Fisher and Chloe Frazer also return in Uncharted 3. The plot draws from the archaeology days of T. E. Lawrence.Several new features have been included in the game, including mechanics that create gameplay situations designed to assist the losing team, improves ability enhancements and augmentations that must be purchased for each use, special abilities that are made available when a certain amount of medals has been attained within a match, and \"Uncharted TV\", a small video window that appears throughout the multiplayer menus, creating a video that can be uploaded to Facebook, YouTube or the XMB. Multiplayer also includes a character creation system, allowing a user to extensively customise their in-game character. Co-operative multiplayer also returns from Uncharted 2.Other than that it's like most everybodys review of the game, graphics are aewsome, game play astounding, you will be playing for hours to play the game.4. In Conclusion: Wether you are buying a PS3 for the first time, adding a second one, want the game and would not hurt to have another PS3, or just replacing a no longer working PS3 this is the bundle to get. I would overall highly recommend picking up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2012"}

In other words, once you have played one, you have played them all.However, GTA is still among the top video games of all time. It created a video game hype not seen since Mortal Kombats hayday, and many tried to copy GTA's success. The success was a double edge sword. GTA had to respond to the immitators with improved sequals, but they also lost many fans with too many sequals.If your not too jaded by the sequals and you liked the original GTA 3, then buy Libery City stories. It contains many of the improved features, such as changing clothes, jumping out of moving cars, etc. The story mode is very good. The graphics are also very good. Many have complained that the graphics are bad, but they actually look slighty better then the original GTA 3. Another complaint is that the game is too easy, which isnt true. The game has a very moderate level of difficulty (not too frustrating and not too easy). The swearing is toned down from SA and Vice city, but you do hear the occasional F-bomb.graphics=4 (GTA standards)control=5fun=4.5replayability=4.5Finally, when I purchased the game, the sales associate told me that this game would not have the free roaming sandbox capability, that it would be mission only.

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. Get ready to jump out of your couch cushions!--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessGreat cooperative modePlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multi-player options","reviewerName":"Nanohead \"nanohead\"","summary":"Awesome, to a point, then downhill. Too Bad really....","reviewText":"Lots of people have covered this here, so I'll only summarize.  This is a great game, for the first few hours.  Then, you want to hang it up.  Me, I was fine until I got to hell.  Then, I wanted to simply quit, as it was impossible to proceed, and so dark, I couldnt tell what was going on.  I've played dozens of FPS type games, and this was the first one that I started to hate halfway through.  While I always have a game of FarCry going, and I've played through Half Life 2 6 times, this one is a one shot deal for me.  I may try the expansion pack, but basically, this whole Doom 3 thing is a pretty face with almost no substance.I would be plenty happy just killing things, but only if they can actually die.  Getting into levels where you have to use nearly all your ammo to proceed is boring, frustrating, and just plain dumb.  And the constant darkness, well, its just dark.The visuals are awesome, as are the sounds.  The taunts, I could take them or leave them, but they are not too bad.  The whole flashlight thing, everyone has criticized this game for that, and yes, its frustrating, but I can even get past that. The construction of the game is amazing, truly a tour de force.  But the gameplay, well thats another story.I find that I lose motivation, and just plain stop.  The obsession to see what comes next, just isn't there with Doom 3.  After the first 10 levels, I just got bored.  And then Hell came, and I quit for a bit.  It was like banging my head against a wall (maybe that would have worked).  This level simply ruined the game for me, with undefeatable creatures, replays of save points 100 times, and just lousy gameplay.  The essence of the level is interesting, but the gameplay is aweful.I seriously doubt that I will ever replay this game.  I may try the expansion pack just for kicks, but only when it is a 10 dollar item at the local game store.  Basically, this game was a big disappointment to me.  ID software probably is tied with Valve for technical brilliance, but Doom 3 is just plain drippy and frustrating.  A solid 3, with HUGE potential.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2005"}

Most of the gameplay is virtually the same and there aren't any major improvements or changes in graphics and sound. There are those who will be disappointed that the game isn't more \"realistic\". Well, this is a video game. If it was completely realistic after a couple of bullet wounds you'd be dead, there'd be no chance to heal, etc.Most people will be playing this game for all the multi-player set-ups. There are more maps than in CoD:MW2, so that's a plus. However, there's really not place to hide. You can find a good place to campout and wait until trouble passes or try to set-up an ambush, but there isn't any because there's always a backdoor where the enemy can sneak in from behind. So, you are forced to move around all the time. Also, there aren't any major new weapons.Personally, I don't play many video games for the multi-player or online experiences. I usually play video games for the story. Campaign-wise, CoD: MW3 begins immediately after CoD:MW2. Price and Nikolai rush the critically injured Soap to a safehouse in Afghanistan. WWIII continues to rage but with the tide of the war turning against them, the Russian President desires peace. While inflight to a peace summit, the Russian President's plane is overtaken by terrorists working for Makarov. They force the plane to crash and take the President hostage. However, his bodyguards are able to keep his daughter safe and out of Makarov's hands. But with Makarov using all his resources to find her, her safety can only be guaranteed for so long. A special force of U.S. troops is sent into Sierra Leone to track down a shipment of cargo that Makarov is intending to send somewhere in Europe. The team is unable to intercept the package and in a dramatic fashion the package is later revealed to be a biochemical weapon that is released in several major cities in Europe. With the Russian President missing, Makarov is in control and the Russian army invades Western Europe. Makarov is determined to get the nuclear launch codes and if he is able to capture the Russian President's daughter it is only a matter of time before he has them and destroys much of the world. Only Soap, Price, Nikolai, and Yuri and their team can stop him.There are several more Special Ops missions that can be completed as an individual or as a multi-person team. There's also a Survival Mode that's slightly better than its predecessors. I just wish that the Survival levels would actually have a point where they end. Also, it would have been nice to see some sort of zombie level in CoD: MW3.I enjoyed the gameplay of the campaign, but felt the storyline was a little too short. It should have been extended somewhat. I enjoyed having more Special Ops missions to play and really liked the Survival Mode.Overall, CALL OF DUTY: MODERN WARFARE 3 is a slightly improved extension of CALL OF DUTY: MODERN WARFARE 2. After playing the CoD: MW2 for the past two years, multi-player and online players will probably enjoy having different settings they can play in. Also, it's nice to see the storyline that began in CALL OF DUTY 4 finally come to a conclusion.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000VJRU44","reviewerName":"Stuart Floyd","summary":"Gaming from Couch Potato to Buffed Tomato - Wii Fit","reviewText":"The other night, after indulging in some greasy lower-Manhattan takeout, I received my Wii Fit from Amazon.  I put the box near the television, took some Rolaids, and resigned to test-drive Nintendo's new fitness machine in the morning.The next morning I warmed myself up for a high-tech exercise experience by playing some of Marvel's Ultimate Alliance and some Paper Mario on the Wii's Virtual Console.  After a few of hours warming up my fingers, I was ready for the Wii Fit.The game is simple enough to setup; the installation of some batteries and an uneventful synch up of the Wii Fit Balance Board with the Wii console are about it.My first session with the Wii started with entering the date, my age, getting weighed, and an initial body balance test.  Wii Fit used those data to calculate my Wii Fit age, an embarrassing 47, about 12 years ahead of my actual age. I immediately repeated the body test and scored an ego boosting age of 31.  Much relieved, I listened as the Wii helped me set fitness goals. It told me I should shoot for a body mass index of 21 instead of my 24 (i.e., lose some weight).Based on my Wii fit experience so far, the technology's strength lies in two areas. First is its variety. There's a large variety of strength, balance, aerobic, and stretching (yoga) exercises, with additional exercises unlocked after completing basic sessions. The more you use Wii Fit, the larger the selection of exercises.Wii Fit's second strength comes in its coordination of the balance board and the Wii's position sensing tech. The system does a good job of tracking where the user is and integrating that into game play.I like Wii Fit's aerobic exercises the best. In the meat-world, I enjoy running, so it wasn't really a surprise that I liked Wii Fit's running exercises. It gives me the opportunity to run with a dog, something my real dog shrugs off all requests for (She usually responds to my requests to run with a \"you're joking right?\" look.). If you have other Mii's on your Wii, you'll occasionally see them run by you. There`s also a never-ending supply of people waving at you and cheering you on during runs. Before Wii Fit, I'd never would have guessed running in place could be anything but boring and awkward.Again, the Wii's positioning system seems well suited to keeping track of my running-in-place gate. The running exercises start with short intervals and work up to a free run mode.  Be sure to wear sneakers while Wii Fit running.  Running in place can be hard on the forefeet.On the down side of the aerobic games, Wii Step seems to be a bit on the slow side. It's like a lazy Dance Dance Revolution.  It's not that Wii Step is boring, it offers some insanely catchy, but unvaried, music and the advanced version of the game is fairly challenging. The problem is that Wii Step didn't offer much of a workout.  In the accompanying video, when I look at my watch, I wasn't checking the time, I was checking my heart rate.  My average heart rate during Wii Step clocked in at around 110bpm, about my heart rate during moderate walking. Still, the ability of the balance board to detect my position was a real high point of Wii Step. Also, I swear I saw Greg Allman in the audience watching the virtual step class.I also haven't been able to get the hang of the aerobic boxing class.  Wii Fit consistently misses my left, or I have a terrible left. I can't tell which. On the plus side, the boxing exercises push my heart rate higher than the step classes do.  The boxing sessions also have the interesting initial shock of suddenly appearing shirtless with an overly butch shirtless man.The strength and yoga exercises are not as fun-oriented as the balance and cardio exercises, but are focused and straightforward with good instruction from very non-Nintendo appearing fitness trainers.  I'd never attempted any yoga until Wii Fit and was able to follow the exercises and feel like I was accomplishing some real stretching. The pushups with side-planks also offer a decent body-weight workout.Wii Fit's balance games have offered me the most challenges.  They're fun too. You get to play as a fishing penguin on an ice-float; see your Mii's transformed into rolling balls; play a boy in the bubble floating on a river; and do some skiing. A note on the skiing: the slalom steering is exactly the opposite of what you do during actual skiing (In the game, leaning to the left makes you go left.). That took some getting used to.According to my exercise watch, I've been burning between 300-450 calories per 45-55 minute session. That's less than what I'd burn at the gym, but more than what I'd burn playing Zelda, Super Mario Galaxy, or even Resident Evil IV.I'm enjoying Wii Fit and I can feel some muscle soreness in my hips from the strength and yoga exercises I did yesterday.  I think that's the point of Wii Fit.  It offers palatable exercise in the privacy and convenience of my home. I'm more likely to play Wii Fit after a long day at work than I am to pack up my equipment and run to the gym.The only other note I'll make is that after four days of play, at about forty-five minutes per session, I've already had to replace the Wii Balance Board's four AA's. Having rechargeable on dock is advisable.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2008"}
{"product_name":"B003VUO6H4","reviewerName":"Strategos \"The Guardian of Time\"","summary":"Not For the Techno-Phobic","reviewText":"I've been gaming since the days of the NES. My favorite Game Consoles are the Dreamcast, the Saturn, and the Playstation 2 (mostly for the PlayStation 1 Games). I currently own every one of \"The Big Three\", the Wii, the PS3, and the Xbox 360. Oh, and I write a lot of game reviews. For fun. I've wanted a PS3 for a long time, just because I've been curious. I wanted a Blu Ray Player to see the difference between Blu Ray and DVD, and I've wanted to try some of the PS3 exclusive games. This year I finally saved up my money, and bought a used PS3. My thoughts?The Wii is a toy, not a game console. It has the WORST online store I have ever seen as far as design goes (you have to enter your credit card EVERY time you make a purchase) and the BEST as far as selection (it's worth buying a Wii just for the Turbo Graphics shooters if like me you are a serious retro gamer). The Xbox 360 is a Gamer and Home Theater Enthusiast's dream come true (except the lack of Blu Ray and 1080p). And the PS3...is....interesting.After navigating the menus and going through the options in the PS3, using both as a Blu Ray and DVD player and doing a lot of comparing, I have to say that it is very good if you fall into one of the following categories: 1. SONY Fanboy. If you are in this group you will think this system is the best due to the placebo effect and be very happy in your purchase no matter what. 2. Blu Ray user. If all you want to do is play Blu Rays this console has EXCELLENT Blu Ray playback, though the remote control is the worst home theater remote I have ever seen (button placement, readability, and responsiveness are terrible. 3. Filthy stinking rich. Back when this system came out a lot of people liked it simply for SONY bragging rights. They make ridiculous claims about superior image quality that they feel are justified because they paid more for the hardware (therefore it must be better). 4. Techie Super Nerd. If you are running Unix/Linux/some other OS, love rewiring your Home Theater (or perhaps your car?), fiddling with your BIOS, and setting things up MANUALLY this is the system for you. It has the most confusing settings menus I have ever seen in a piece of home electronics in my life.As far as sound and graphics go, the Xbox and PS3 are about equal. They both output HDMI in HD both audibly and visually. While the PS3 can indeed output 1080p, this will not effect your experience unless you are using a screen larger than 50 inch and have Eagle Eyes. Even then, the increased resolution may actually WORSEN the picture (razer-sharp picture makes artifacting more obvious and display flaws stick out worse).Mechanically the advantages of game-based and movie based experience on the Xbox and PS3 cancel each other out. While the PS3 requires no disc swapping due to disc space requirements, almost every game REQUIRES an install because of differences in rotation speed at the center and outside edge of Blu Ray discs. While Blu Rays look spectacular, DVDs look WORSE on the PS3 than on the Xbox due to inferior up-scaling (no arguments please, this is based off of repeated tests of identical scenes in DVDs).The controller for the PS3 has no user-replaceable battery and this is a major disadvantage (I had to string a USB cable all the way from the system to my couch to keep playing when my controller ran out of juice, and the controller CANNOT be charged by plugging it into a USB-wall-charge adapter). The controllers are also more expensive than Xbox controllers. And of course, the Xbox controllers are concave instead of convex, and feature deep analog triggers. Personally I think that's just better design.The online experience on the PS3 is a joke. Not only has the entire online store been down for over a month (a temporary glitch, but STILL) with people's personal info and credit card info compromised, the online store NEVER allowed me to download anything using a credit card. I tried every possible way to list my address and it STILL was rejected by SONY (not my credit card company's fault). After calling SONY's support all I was told was \"Keep trying\". UNACCEPTABLE. More than that, while Xbox Live has a trial version of EVERY game, hardly ANY of the downloadable games on PSN have a trial version! And when you DO download a trial...it HAS TO INSTALL!!!! What kind of a joke is this SONY???Overall, the entire PS3 experience is just...clunky. After getting used to the smooth, easy, effortless Xbox Menu Navigation with its large readable icons and fonts, going over to the PS3 was a lot more work. There's a reason why the Xbox is more popular for online play despite having a price tag for Xbox Live. You get what you pay for.I do own a few PS3 games, but I largely find myself not playing them as I use my Xbox 360 for playing all games that are available for both systems and playback of all my DVDs. The 360 also makes for a great Windows Media Player device, allowing you to control and record TV, and play back videos and music. And of course Xbox Live has some games for retro gamers (Ikaruga and Rez anyone? Am I the only one excited about Guardian Heroes and Radiant Silvergun on XBLA?) that are just not available on the PS3.If you can only buy one system, buy an Xbox 360. If you are into retro gaming buy a Wii. If you want a Blu Ray Player and want to play PS3 exclusive games, or fit into one of the groups I mentioned (:I'm a super-techie gamer nerd :) go for it. Just make sure you explore your options and give it a test-drive first.*Update November 18th, 2011*I discovered a Playstation 2 Controller Adapter that allows you to play the Playstation 3 with a Dual Shock 2 Controller. While not perfect (no guide button or six-axis obviously, and no rumble function) it DOES effectively eliminate the horrible controller of the Playstation 3 from the equation, including the recharge and L2 and R2 buttons that are incredibly uncomfortable. For me this is almost a deal-breaker fix. I HIGHLY recommend you pick one of these up if you can do without rumble and don't mind cables. Just make sure to get a remote if you get rid of your six-axis controller so you can use the guide button. The only reason this does not raise the system to a five star product is that it is not provided by SONY, and there is no SONY wired controller option (another reason to buy an Xbox 360; if you want a wired controller you can get one instead of a wireless controller).*Update June 11th, 2012*After getting a brand new Dual Shock 3 I have found that the design of the control was VASTLY improved since the original Six-Axis controller. If you get a PS3, be sure you throw away the Six-Axis and get a Dual Shock 3 immediately for both vibration functionality and reduced hand-strain. There are still charge issues, but these can be dealt with by getting a REALLY long mini-USB cable to plugging the controller into your PC when you aren't playing (the controller doesn't seem to gradually decrease in power, it just sudden goes from full charge to nothing).Since writing my original review I have discovered that the system is worth buying for the game Valkyria Chronicles alone, and have replaced the hard drive with a high-capaciy laptop hard drive. I then started to download some hard-to-find PS1 games that have become available on the PSN store and some truly brilliant PSN games (Flower and Journey). I still believe the interface needs some serious work to be more friendly, but there are indeed some very good things to be found in the PS3 experience provided you are willing to do some digging and can overcome the overly-complex interface.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2011"}

Originally built as an experimental, self-sufficient and 100% &ldquo;green&rdquo; habitat, the reported rapid rise of the Earth&rsquo;s oceans has forced the Ark to become home to not only the original founders and their descendants but also to thousands of refugees. With tensions between the two groups growing, Security and Resistance forces are locked in a heated battle for control of the Ark. Which side will you choose?KEY FEATURES:Not Just Another Hero&ndash; Brink&rsquo;s advanced player customization offers a near-endless combination of looks for your character &ndash; allowing for the appearance of your character to be truly unique.

{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"Andrew K.","summary":"They Say Fortune Favors The Bold","reviewText":"Nate Drake and company took the Playstation 3 by storm back in 2007, and represented one of the first promising original IP's for Sony's console. Two years later, as one of the few remaining behemoths of the rather lonely Fall '09 lineup, Uncharted 2 has quite a bit of hype to live up to. Luckily, it does, and then some. Uncharted 2 is a fantastic game through and through, the likes of which we don't see too often these days.The story again follows Nathan Drake as he scours the world in search of treasure. This time around he's surrounded by quite a number of well rounded characters. The banter between Drake and these characters is quite amusing, and feels surprisingly natural even given some of the over-the-top situations they might find themselves in. Of course, the plot thickens, and there are a few twists, but the story is campy, and never becomes convoluted. Uncharted 2 might not have the deepest story, but what it lacks in depth, it makes up for with great pacing, dialogue, and characters.With the plot paced as fast as it is, the gameplay moves at a similar rate. The constant flow of new things to do, and story snippets, as well as seamless implementation of the platforming, and shooting systems we know and love makes for an experience that nearly borders on the sublime.In essence, Uncharted 2 recycles the same gameplay formula as featured in its predecessor, but segments of gunplay, platforming, and puzzle solving, as well as awesome set pieces are implemented in a much more graceful manner. Instead of a segment of just shooting, followed by a segment of just platforming, etc. the game integrates all of its elements so well, it's easy to get lost in the campaign mode.To go more in depth about the gameplay, I'll just say that the guys over at Naughty Dog kept things simple. Shooting sequences are done in a \"stop-and-pop\" style similar to a game like Gears of War, platforming is exciting, yet effortless, and puzzle solving is perhaps too easy.Some may be disappointed by the simplicity of these gameplay elements, but they are implemented very well. That coupled with the fact that set piece moments pop up at a near constant rate keep things fresh, and fun.The second (and entirely new) pillar to Uncharted 2 is the multiplayer component. Players can go head to head in 5 vs 5 matches, or play co-operatively with two friends.The adversarial multiplayer is quite good. The 10 user player cap fits well with the smaller maps, and, quite impressively, Naughty Dog was able to work the platforming aspects of the campaign into the multiplayer. While none of them are very original, there are plenty of modes, but disappointingly, there aren't a whole lot of maps. Still, that's one minor gripe for an all around great multiplayer experience.The cooperative mode is great as well. There are a number of levels to go through that recreate some of the best moments from the campaign with a few new twists. The dynamic of the three player team works quite well, as you'll have backup, but there won't be too many allies all shooting for the same bad guy, and there's plenty of strategizing that can be done, especially on the higher difficulty.The multiplayer modes are tied together by an experience system (a la Modern Warfare) in the form of cash money. This cash can net tons of goodies from weapon upgrades, to characters, to even taunts one can use after a particularly sweet kill. The experience system might not be entirely original at this point, but damn if it doesn't make the multiplayer experience addicting.It goes without saying that Uncharted 2 is a very impressive game in terms of it's production values. The environments are stunning, the animations feel real even when it comes to the gravity defying platforming, the orchestral score is great, and the overall sound design is awesome as well. However, the motion capture, and acting during the game's numerous cutscenes really steal the show. As ridiculous as the events in the game may get, they always feel real thanks to the way the writing, voice acting, and mo-cap all blend together. Technically, and sonically, Uncharted 2 is impeccable, and unmatched as far as console games go.Uncharted 2's 8-10 hour campaign is, at this point, of an okay length for an action adventure game, and the treasure hunting aspects can add some re-playability for perfectionists. It's the multiplayer, however, that will add a lot of value to the overall package. With tons of modes, and unlockables, the multiplayer experience can quickly get addicting, and will soon enough the hours will add up.Uncharted 2 is one of the most important games of this year. Not only is it a great improvement on its predecessor, but it's one of the few games that has struck me as more of an experience than a game. As I've stated before, it's easy to get lost in Uncharted 2; the campaign never lets up, the multiplayer is addicting and all around awesome. If you have a Playstation 3, don't miss out on Uncharted.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2009"}

Wii, like all the previous releases in theSuper Mario Bros.franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiis held sideways, allowing for easy, classic inputs using the D-pad to direct playable characters, the 1 button to jump and 2 button to spit out projectiles like snowballs and fireballs. In addition, players can access powerups with their choice of either the push of a button, or by shaking the Wii remote, again demonstrating the perfect merging of classic gameplay and modern game design which isNew Super Mario Bros.

Players can pick each other up to save them from danger or toss them into it.Supports 2-4 players in multiplayer mode.Mario, Luigi and two Toads are all playable characters, while many others from the Mushroom Kingdom make appearances throughout the game. Players can even ride different Yoshi characters and use their tongues to swallow enemies &ndash; or their fellow players.In some areas, players use the motion abilities of the Wii Remote controller. The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"Manu","summary":"I love this game","reviewText":"I bought it because I love Mario games, but I can say that this is one of the best.

Most reviewers have already detailed the inner workings so I will just add that whoever thought this sytem up was a genuis!!  The interaction between the controls and the video game are amazing.  This system beats any other in my view.  The potential for wii is mind boggling although they have been a little a slow in output lately.  Hmmmm.  I will sit in anticipation of what they will think up next.

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"Turtle502","summary":"Innovative and fun - sleek design, easy to setup -- great product!","reviewText":"Nintendo has designed a beautiful piece of hardware. Everything is easy and fool-proof to connect. All of the cables have sufficient length so that you can place the console away from your TV if needed.  Nintendo has thought of everything, and they obviously have tried this unit in various setups with various TVs. You can choose to place the remote sensor bar on top of your TV or at the bottom, and they include adhesive squares and a stand for different situations -- like I said, very well planned.Setup can't be easier, connect all the cables and turn it on. The system will walk you through a couple of setup options. The system has built-in wireless, and it can connect to the Internet if you have a wireless connection. If you have encryption enabled on your router, you'll need to setup the connection manually. Once connected, it downloaded 2 updates but it was ready to go within 30 minutes.The remote controller is an interesting piece of technology, playing back sound, vibrating, and sensing your movements. It took only about 5 minutes to get adjusted to \"pointing\" to menu items on the screen, and I was amazed that you can also \"twist\" the direction of the pointer so that the hand points up, down, and all around -- I can't wait to see how this is used in games. The controller is well-designed and the wrist strap is comfortable and doesn't seem to fall off at all.  My 5-year old could handle it with little difficulty.  If anybody thinks the Wii is not technically advanced, a lot of the advanced technology is in the controller/remote -- keep that in mind.Wii Sports is an interesting game package. Bowling is fun and very realistic. Gold is extremely enjoyable, and I don't even like golf. Even my 5 year old daughter could play the golf game.  Tennis is fun but somewhat challenging and requires a lot of practice. Baseball, as well, is fun -- but \"changing sides\" and pitching isn't all that fun. Boxing is fun and can be quite a workout.In fact, I think the real beauty of this system is that you're not sitting down when playing games like those in Wii Sports.  Get up and move!  I can imagine a game where special controllers are strapped to your ankles, and you hold the remote and nunchuck in your hands...and you dance...while the character on-screen mimics your movement.  The possibilities are endless...!Although I don't have a Gamecube, I love that it plays Gamecube games and supports all the hardware (memory and controllers) so that it's backwards compatible with the technology.  Nintendo can continue to write games for the Gamecube and those of us (like me) with only a Wii can still buy and play them.  Ingenious.There's a ton of other features -- but in all, it appears to be a well-built little package...very well-thought-out, with endless possibilities.  It turns gaming on its head.  You won't be disappointed!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2006"}

You can casually push people aside who get in your way, or you can roughly shove them.  You can attack random people, which will cause a panic, and people react to what you do, such as remarking about you if you go dashing by, or calling you insane for bumping into walls or trying to climb up things or jump on top of random objects.  Bump into an armed guard and they WILL chase you.  Not only chase you, but chase you RELENTLESSLY!  It's rather difficult to get them to stop, as you have to get out of their sight AND hide for a short time.  Your character is agile enough to jump from rooftops with ease, hang on to edges, scramble up walls like a cat, and dive into stacks of hay to get out of sight.The many options for combat and running around are impressive, as is the combat system when fighting people.  It has some button mashing involved, but it's not mindless mashing.  Your sword can even get red from blood, and horse riding is very realistic as well.The Bad:Oh wow... first, gameplay-wise, the AI is simply retarded.  About the only time the guards are competent is when they're chasing you for causing havoc in the city.  Once they surround you, or you're engaged in combat with them, they only bother to attack you one at a time.  So far in my gaming, when engaging in fighting, I've never fought or killed men who didn't surround me like a pack of gangbangers coming at me one at a time.  Even if I had no weapon but my fists, they wouldn't bother, and even if I were slaughtering them.  It would seem the explanation being they're too cocky to attack you all at once when you're helpless, and they're too scared to attack you all at once when you're dominating.  No middle ground.Historically accurate it may claim to be, it fails massively in even the most menial, and yet telling of aspects: The main character, in a 12th Century Arab country, has an AMERICAN accent.  You could nitpick with the whole \"well they didn't speak english in Arab countries in the 12th Century\" and it wouldn't matter a damn, because English DID exist at the time, but AMERICA did NOT.  Not only is the American accent an annoying anachronism (which is inexcusable, because despite popular belief, Americans CAN accept protagonists with non-American accents) but has the stereotypical arrogant American swagger so hated by people of other countries, that not only makes him an unlikeable character, but gets him in trouble in the game, as within the first fifteen minutes of the game, he already breaks all three rules of the Assassin's Creed.  Because he's \"badass\".Of course, if you didn't know from the other reviews, this is all just the \"memory\" being replayed via some scientifically fragile theory of \"genetic memory\" in which a person's life experiences are recorded in their DNA, and passed on through generations.  The main character is yet another American stereotype of the typical badass loner assassin who just wants to turn his life around by being a bartender.  Not only is his dialogue so dull and listless as to make you not give a damn about him, but he is also very plain and ugly.  Not really a valid complaint, but it's a physical manifestation of the person's mental state.So awful was this game's story that I did not want to go on playing it after the first few missions.  I simply could not tolerate it.  I had to force myself into living the horrid story and AI.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00DBRM3G8","description":"","reviewerName":"pastapadre","summary":"NBA 2K14 Shows Great Potential; Design Decisions Show the Worst","reviewText":"[FEBRUARY UPDATE] Server issues have stabilized with far fewer outages, and patches to fix crashing have worked for the most part.[LATE DECEMBER UPDATE]: The game can no longer be recommended due to the incredibly damaging VC system, crashes preventing the ability to play various modes, and reliance on the servers to be always-online to play the majority of the game. The servers have often been down meaning almost everything in the game is inaccessible (even what is considered offline based modes like MyCareer and MyGM) while some have lost money/VC and their save files.[Original Review]Much more to come in an expanded review within the next day or two, but NBA 2K14 is a spectacular product that immediately shines a light on the merits of the new hardware.In terms of being a true next-gen experience NBA 2K14 is flat out phenomenal. The graphics, presentation, and gameplay all reach exceptional levels. The rebooted modes are absolutely refreshing - even if MyGM means a loss of some features and MyCareer is a little silly. The fun I've had playing MyCareer while streaming it through the console has gone well beyond any expectations going in. This is the game to get...whether a fan of the NBA or not.That statement of course is completely dependent on being able to reach the various modes. Server-related issues have caused trouble for many and prevented a significant number of consumers from accessing advertised features. Unreliable online has always been an issue for the series but this goes well beyond that to misrepresenting the product. Chalk it up to making VC an integral part of the series from top to bottom as it has now infected just about every aspect of the game. Many features including online are buried in the horrifically designed menus, online leagues are missing so many options it's not really viable, and The Park rarely if ever works. If your online is down or the 2K server is down, you'll be unable to continue playing any mode but quick games. MyGM, MyCareer, and MyTeam all become inaccessible. An online connection is basically essential to NBA 2K14.Outside of the online troubles - if that doesn't matter to you - I would wholeheartedly recommend NBA 2K14 on PS4.***********FULL REVIEW********************NBA 2K14 represents a phenomenal first effort on the next-gen systems. It immediately shows off the capabilities of the new hardware and provides fresh experiences coupled with the reliably excellent gameplay consumers have come to expect from the series. No game is perfect though and NBA 2K14 has its share of faults. Continue on for what NBA 2K14 did well and where it faltered in this Hits and Misses review.---------Hits-MyCareerThough silly at times due to the cliched dialogue, awkward interactions, and bad voice acting, MyCareer is a blast and revolutionizes what had been the traditional boring career mode. There is now an emotional element to playing that had never been present. Having a true rival provides additional motivation, the draft presentation is excellent, and while it's scripted there is enough variation to make how your player performs matter.2K needs to get rid of the bad call for pass penalty, or at least move it to a button where it won't get pressed accidentally so often. Teammate AI appears to be much improved making it far less frustrating to play without the ball in your hands. It'll be interesting to see how 2K Sports evolves the mode in the future. They'll have to start from scratch with unique stories and compelling twists every year now.-Graphics and PresentationThere is no game that better puts on display the graphical achievements of next-gen than NBA 2K14. Most player faces are stunningly true-to-life, the players show actual emotion, and the lighting and courts look great as well. The general flow to the games and way they are presented could easily be mistaken for a real NBA game.The on-court interviews utilizing real audio are a tremendous addition (just need to have the crowd filing out, be on the right spot on the floor, and different poses...small details to address). Commentary and presentation otherwise is familiar but still excellent. A network branded package would take things to another level however.-GameplayMany will likely consider the gameplay to be largely the same as 360/PS3 but there are some improvements of note. Eco-Motion has made the foot-planting more prevalent and the ball being loose feels naturally dynamic without going overboard on deflections and turnovers. The Points of Emphasis system is a great concept that could use some more work. Additional options include voice commands and the touchpad on the PS4 controller to call quick plays.-New Experiences Accompanied By Good Of The OldReplacing Association with MyGM has generated similar response to when EA had Franchise mode evolve into Connected Careers in Madden. All the new options have been received fairly well but there are a number of features of the old Association that have been left out in the process.There's a lot more to get involved with in MyGM however and that level of interactivity and decision making is welcome. MyTEAM brings in a few new ways to play including an offline \"Domination\" mode (where NBA teams are the opponents) and online tournaments.The new NBA Today screen is awesome. It displays all the scores around the NBA, stats leaders of the day, the previous day's results, updated standings, and throws a highlight reel in the middle of the screen.nba2k14nbatoday1120---------Misses-Online and VCWhile 2K Sports has excelled in many areas with the NBA 2K series, the company has failed more often than not in providing an acceptable online experience. The servers have been unreliable, lag and disconnects prevalent, and features either omitted or broken.That doesn't change with the PS4 and Xbox One and in some ways the game has become even more dependent on the shaky servers. Losing an online connection or the servers being down means being unable to play just about every mode in the game including MyCareer and MyGM.The Park, while an intriguing addition, rarely if ever works. Online leagues lack the necessary options and tools to make it a viable mode to invest time in. There are no leaderboards or apparent record keeping and stat tracking. It's nearly 2014 and two online users still can't do things in the pause menu at the same time?Much of the blame for the dependency on the servers falls on the implementation of VC throughout the game. VC has infected everything now - even in MyGM mode it has to be spent to unlock abilities like being able to change the lineup. Simming in MyGM mode of course does not earn VC which means all games have to be played to really progress in the mode.What may be the biggest issue with VC is how it all pools together. Consumers can't effectively bounce between modes as spending in one limits their success in another.-MenusNBA 2K14 offers up arguably the most poorly designed menu system in the history of sports gaming. Good luck finding all the advertised features within them.nba2k14noel------------SummaryWhen all the features are accessible and located in NBA 2K14 it's a true next-gen experience that combines compelling modes with excellent gameplay and brilliant graphics. It hits many highs and avoids some of the lows that are typically associated with launch titles. This is the rare sports game that has legitimate carryover appeal to even non-sports fans.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2013"}

The only people who remember that game are probably in their 30's right now. For the new kids Uprising is a great 3DS game with length, lots of items to collect, and a few modes to keep you busy. The game looks great and seems on par with Resident Evil: Revelations graphics wise. The 3D effects are good as well, but the game doesn't come without issues.The game consists of two part: Flying and ground combat. Flying is the best part of the game because each level is different and rushing around canyons, clouds, caverns, and other locales is exhilarating and exciting. You move Kid around while shooting and can use various power-ups. Once you start playing you will notice one of the major problems - you need three hands to play the game. You control the reticle with the stylus and either the circle pad or the face buttons to move Kid around. The ground combat is more problematic because the game just needs dual sticks to really work. My hands cramped up from having to use the shoulder buttons to shoot so I could only play in short bursts.Ground combat is longer than the flying which is disappointing. Moving around and shooting just isn't as fun as flying, but each of the 22 levels has a boss fight at the end. Thankfully the game is as hard as you make it because before each level you can increase or decrease the difficulty to earn more hearts. Hearts are used to buy weapons and upgrade them. Of course there are hidden areas in each level that has new weapons or healing items. Be careful though, you get three recovery spheres at the start of the level and that's it so higher difficulties are extremely tough.There's a co-op mode which is fun, but gathering the items and replaying the levels is really for hardcore fans only. There's a lot of rewards for finding items and completing certain objectives like number of enemies killed, so there's enough content here for any type of gamer. I just feel the game gets too repetitive after a while because the levels follow the same pattern of flying, ground combat, boss. Sure they are all different, but I would have liked to see some mini-games or levels that are all flying, all ground combat, or just one big boss level.Overall, Kid Icarus: Uprising is a beautiful game with lots of content, but has a repetitious pattern. The voice acting is sketchy at best, and even the story is pretty much yawn worthy. The 3D effects are great, but the biggest problem here is the controls. We either need three hands or dual sticks so expect some hand cramping often.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2012"}

If you're somebody who loves first-person shooters or FPS games you'll love this game or if you're somebody who loves role-playing/quest games you'll love this game. It is a combination of summary good elements it's just fun. And I would recommend playing Borderlands 1 if you plan on playing Borderlands 2, while not required it will give you some back story on certain characters.I've played through this game many times using all four of the available characters and it is just a great time. Also want to be excelling parts of Borderlands is that it's a great cooperative game. If a few of your friends have this game and you can play simultaneously with each other it's so much more enjoyable.ProTip:If you're new to the Borderland experience here's a tip. When you kill enemies or scavenge in garbage bins etc.  You're going to find loot - guns class modification units shields - and whatnot. Now the loot in borderlands is color-coded just remember When Grandpa Burps Patrick Obeys why would you need to know that? Because the loot in the borderlands universe is color-coded as to rarity. Now in general the rarer the gear/gun the better it is. So hence When Grandpa Burps Patrick Obeys applies to the colors of white, green, blue, purple, orange. Now Orange weapons are also referred to as legendary weapons they are the best But they are also super rare and hard-to-find. But as you come across weapons and gear look at the colors in their name card. This will help a ton in deciding what gear to keep and what gear you want to throw away.But yes I recommend borderlands to all gamers as I think it has many things that appeal to gamers of all types.Thanks for reading!PS you might want to get the ultimate addition of the game as it comes with all the DLC or downloadable content.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2013"}

K. Malone","summary":"Just another sheer masterpiece, that's all.","reviewText":"Sometimes it seems pointless to bother reviewing FF titles. Such a huge segment of the gaming community has already made up their minds about the series. There are the loyal fans who have been more than satisfied by the previous FF games, and on the other hand there are those who seem to resent Final Fantasy, claiming that it's overrated, undeserving of the mountains of accolades it's garnered over the years. This goes out to those who fall in between, those who have never played an FF game, or those who have and weren't quite sure what to make of it.First of all, I want to say that FFX's story impressed me immensely. FFIV was simplistic, but in 1991 it was the most sweeping and grandiose epic ever told in an RPG. FFVI had more emotional impact than any game that came before it. FFVII's story was amazingly complex and perhaps the most compelling and propulsive, but it was also a tad overly convoluted, and many found the ending unsatisfying or hard to swallow. As much as I loved FFVIII, the story simply didn't have as much of an impact on me as the previous ones did. It was a nice love story, nothing more. FFIX was good, but offered nothing that seemed too earth shattering. At last, FFX... I believe this to be bar none the greatest story every told in a Final Fantasy game. It's complex yet crystal clear, with great inter-character relationships and development. I say it's easily the most emotionally affecting FF of them all. By far. I can almost guarantee you'll like every character. The voice acting isn't perfect, but it's certainly above average, and better than I was expecting.On the game play front... Here's some irony for you: a lot of fans have complained that the characters in recent FF games are \"too generic.\" That they don't have enough unique abilities. The reason this is ironic is that there have been only TWO FF games involving hardset non-customizable characters: FFIV and FFIX. FFI, FFII, FFIII, FFV, FFVI, FFVII, FFVIII, and FF Tactics, EVERY SINGLE OTHER FF GAME HAS FEATURED HEAVILY CUSTOMIZABLE CHARACTERS, where YOU are in control of who has which abilities. Well, FFX has struck a great balance. The Sphere Grid system is a method that gives each character their own set of unique abilities, but if you INSIST on giving the characters the same abilities as another, you can. But not until relatively late in the game, and not without penalty. Each character is on their own \"growth track.\" If you move one off of their growth track and onto someone else's, you're sacrificing their higher level abilities, until you decide to backtrack, which is a pain. You're better off letting them stay on track and let them remain unique until they reach the end of their track. However, FFX is packed to the gills with sidequests and optional uber-bosses to fight, so there will still be plenty of motivation to keep the growth going.The battle system has been greatly retooled. Since FFIV, FF games have used \"Active Time Battle\" or ATB, which means that characters must wait a certain amount of time before they can take a turn. This resulted in lots of dead-time, sitting there doing nothing for several seconds while you waited for someone's ATB gauge to fill up. No longer. FFX features CTB. Can't remember what it stands for (edit- according the Japanese version, it's \"Count Time Battle\", which in the NA and EU English versions, it's \"Conditional Turn Based\"), but suffice to say there is NO dead time whatsoever in FFX's battles. As soon as one character uses their turn, the next character or enemey can take their turn instantly. The battles have a very dynamic feel to them now.I'd comment on the graphics, but a picture is worth 1000 words. You're on the internet... pics are at your fingertips if you want to see them. You'll probably be impressed.Personally, my favorite FF game has been a toss up between FFVI and FFVII for over four years now. My indecision was really getting on my nerves. Thanks to FFX, I don't have to think about it anymore.Best. Final Fantasy. Ever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2001"}

I'm 19 now and can honestly say this brought back so many good memories.  The graphics are phenomenal.  Chief looks great in HD, Cortana looks lame but she looked hottest in Halo CE 01 but oh well.  The textures aren't as strong as in reach but the lighting is much better so it's a fair trade off in a way.  The pistol is back and is OP as ever.  It's so nice to be able to use one of the best guns in an FPS ever created again.The game itself is 40$ which is a steal but the game is fairly barebones, offering the Halo: CEHD campaign and a few maps for reach multiplayer remade from old ones.  I'm pleased Headlong is back but they still haven't brought back Bloodgulch which sucks.The Campaign is nostalgic and feels new yet still old at the same time.  It's cool to see all the old levels we know and love revamped in yummy HD Beauty.  Dolby digital is incredible for this game.  The sound effects sound extremely well since most are re-engineered for Halo 1.  The Sniper sounds like a sniper and no longer a cap gun.  The game captures the feeling of being a super human again like the good ole days.  When playing Halo 1 it's easy to see why Halo: Reach felt so weak in comparison.  Sure you know you're a Spartan but you just feel like a wimp with a weak gun and shields.  However, in Halo 1 you feel indestructible, godlike and deadly.  I think Halo 2 was the last Halo that had that feeling.I don't really like Reach's multiplayer since I got bored of it but I'll enjoy it again one day but with Skyrim, Gears 3, and BF3 it's hard to go back to reach MP.  343I should've just revamped the old-school MP instead of being lazy.If this game had Halo CEMP I'd give this 5 stars but because of that minor inconvenience I'm giving this 4 stars.If your a fan of Halo you should buy this.

Well, I'm here to tell you that \"Metroid Other M\" is the exact opposite of that.  Words can't describe just how much I truly hate this game.Let me just start by saying that this is the most disappointing entry in the Metroid series by a long shot.  That is a given.  Even the nut-busting difficulty of Metroid Prime 2 is no match for the abomination that is \"Metroid Other M\".  I pre-ordered this game assuming how incredible it would be as has been the case with every Metroid game that has preceded it.  Shame on me.  This is the first game in the series I considered abandoning and selling promptly while it still had a high resale value because I was having ZERO fun with it.The biggest offender of \"Metroid Other M\" is the controls.  They are \"clunky\" to put it mildly.  Why you are forced to use the Wii remote only-with it's hobbit sized control pad, is beyond me.  Why no nunchuck control?  We've been using this crazy little thing called an \"analog stick\" for well over a decade now with good reason.  My left thumb would often protest after even the shortest bouts of slogging through this game.  it's pretty much like using your entire hand to operate a door bell.  Also,  the forced switch between 2d and 3d by moving the remote is awkward at best and completely jarring at worst.  It doesn't work.  Fail on Team Ninja, fail on Nintendo.  This is the sloppiest control scheme I've seen on a Wii game for some time now.  And considering the sheer amount of garbage games available on Wii-that's really saying something.  Also, certain segments of the game were just plain clumsy.  Climbing up elevator shafts for instance was an unnecessary chore.  Not because it was difficult mind you, but because 90% of the time you can't make a jump without falling down a few rungs.  No matter how many times you try, you can't connect the jump-then all of the sudden it works, even though you didn't do a thing differently.The next \"Other M\" offense is the graphics.  I know some reviewers have commented on Other M's \"great graphics\".  Surely they must be referring to the cinematic scenes (which really are great) or the graphics of Samus and the Federation officers themselves, because everything else in this game looks like puke.  The environments in \"Other M\" are uninspired, flat and \"ugly\" looking atrocities that probably wouldn't have looked good even in the N64 days.  The bosses (besides Ridley) are also very uninspired and weak.  The Metroid queen for instance looks like something out of \"Ocarina of Time\" circa 1998.  Even the original Metroid Prime for gamecube which has eight years on \"Other M\" runs circles around it in the graphics department.  Even for a Wii game, this game is truly ugly.Offense number 3 is game play.  First off, the enemies just aren't fun to kill.  They don't leave bits of health behind for you to collect either.  I was amazed at just how much I missed this small detail-but just like most of Metroid's other hallowed trademarks, this too has been unceremoniously dumped from the experience.  The game play is also linear to a fault.  No more serious exploring folks.  Exploration is discouraged in Other M which pretty much goes against the grain of the entire Metroid series.  No more unlocking weapons.  No more colored doors.  It's all scripted and you are shoved from room to room with your ability to explore and find secrets all but taken from you.  Activating your weapons because \"Adam\" finally allows you is a ridiculous gaming device.  This just smacks of lazy game development.  Was progression through the discovery of new weapons too much to ask of team ninja?  I guess just like everything else associated with Nintendo this generation though (outside of maybe the Mario Galaxy series), cutting corners is the name of the game.You may want to skip this next offense, as it has no bearing on the experience-it is just a personal quip.  It concerns the art direction.  What happened to Metroid?  This game bears very little visual resemblance what-so-ever to the Metroid series outside of Samus herself.  That in and of itself is not necessarily a bad thing in gaming as the same can be said for \"The Legend of Zelda: Windwaker\" when compared to the rest of the Zelda series.  However, unlike that game-this game doesn't even feel like it's part of the same universe.  It's such a complete variation of the Metroid cannon-and the creatures here just don't seem to fit visually at all with what we know of the Metroid series.  It would be like putting Jar Jar Binks into The Lord of the Rings.  The universes just don't jive for me.  But like I said, that is more of a personal gripe-it's nothing that affects the gaming experience.Overall, I found the whole \"Other M\" experience a completely un-fun drag.  I slogged through this game and even played the epilogue only to justify my investment in pre-ordering it.  Trust me though, the minute I finished, I literally went to my computer and listed it on amazon in the used games section.  This will be the last time I pre-order a Nintendo game without playing it first.  I've never been burned by Nintendo before given their track record, but this game was pathetic on just about every level.  Boo and hiss to the biggest dud in Metroid history.  Fail.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2010"}

Old Baldly is back in action again, but this time it's personal. There is only one legitimate contract. The rest of the story follows 47's trials and tribulations as he tries to protect the agency's latest asset: a young woman named Victoria. Apparently, a faction within the agency has engineered Victoria into a new-age killing machine on the sly, and Diane, 47's handler, isn't down with that. She kidnaps the girl and ultimately tasks 47 with keeping her out of the agency's clutches, which is a job he soon pursues with his own, special, customary, cold-blooded single-mindedness.It's a wonderful story laden with superlative characters and presented in a convincingly cinematic fashion. The cut scenes are brilliant, every stone in its place, every line spoken convincingly. Brilliant art direction.Gameplay is vastly improved over the system used in Blood Money. You can interact more with the environment (set more traps for your enemies, kill them with a variety of happenstance weapons like bottles, bricks, wrenches, and hammers), sneak more realistically, and attack faster and with even more ruthless abandon.\"Instinct\" allows you to see objects that might be of use to you, and even anticipate the movements of your enemies.People are smarter, their movements less predictable, and their vision keener, making for more challenging areas.The scoring system, challenges, and trophies all make for missions that can be replayed, so that the game can go on long after you've defeated it.More positives: sexier, bloodier, harder than the previous game. Better sets, with multiple ways in and out of areas. Better triggers, conversations you can overhear. Goodies you can find and unlock, a rating system that lets you know how well you're doing.Negatives: the main story is too short. Even poorly played, you can get through it in a weekend. There should be some sort of side mission system outside the main plot. More goodies to find, with more rewards for finding them. Not enough environmental interaction. You should be able to push over objects, use practically anything as a weapon, drive a car, etc.The online features are weak. You fulfill \"contracts,\" which sounds promising, until you realize that it's really just playing through one of the chapters of the main story based on certain pre-defined criteria: for example, killing a guard with a brick and disposing of the body without being seen and without using any disguises. You'll get paid for doing it, and appear on leaderboards, but so what? You can use the money to upgrade a weapon, but again, so what? To what end?The mapping system is terrible. What on earth is going on here? Is there even a mapping system? It's that bad.Still, all in all, sneaking around, throttling people from behind, pushing the bad guys off bridges for extra points, sticking an axe in the back of a drug dealer's head, turning the mad scientist's sadistic experiments back on himself, and of course, risking all to save the damsel in distress? What's not to love? This game is awesome. Next entry, please.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2013"}
