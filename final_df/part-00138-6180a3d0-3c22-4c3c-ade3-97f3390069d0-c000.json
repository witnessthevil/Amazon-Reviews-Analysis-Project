However If I can convince just one person to not buy into the hype and consider both the deserved praise and, more importantly, the legitimate criticisms against this game, I'll be happy. This review isn't for the fans, its for potential players who want an honest review.Something about LA Noire captured my imagination months before it was released. It featured a new technology called \"motion scan\" which allowed for it to have the most realistic facial animations I'd ever seen. When I saw the motion scan demonstration, I was floored. I saw it as a huge step forward for narratives in games and if it was done right could make games rival or even surpass movies in terms of emotional investment.And what a seemingly great way to show it off! A game about a detective who has to read people's intentions through their facial cues? It has all the makings of an incredible game. It also takes place in my hometown and in one of my favorite time periods. And its Rockstar! There's no way they could screw this up!I was (and still am) so tired of games with immature and underdeveloped stories. I was ready for a game with a mature story not just for its own sake, but one that integrated itself with gameplay in such a way that it couldn't have been done in any other medium. Finally a game that understands that interactivity is the key to making games into a unique art form.And then the game pretty much ruined everything it had going for it. Motion scan ruined by having a boring and unlikeable protagonist. Integration of gameplay and narrative ruined by making the player's choices mean absolutely nothing. The prospect of at least having an interesting plot was ruined by having an unremarkable story with a bad ending.After the initial sparkle of everything wore off, I realized nothing about the game is fun to play at all. Investigations are boring and repetitive. Interrogations look nice thanks to motion scan but I might as well have been watching a movie due to the limited gameplay involved. Chase scenes are too heavily scripted to be exciting, and gunplay is pretty unremarkable considering every other action game this generation has done it and done it better.The idea of interrogations is that after each question you ask a suspect you are given three options to proceed: assume they are telling the truth, accuse them of lying, and the ambiguous \"doubt\". This seems intuitive in theory, but in practice each choice is fairly arbitrary and differs from case to case. Doubting could mean coax the suspect a little bit to if you know they are holding out, or it could mean wild accusations which make the suspect unwilling to respond. It is impossible to tell what the choices will result in. There is only one correct answer, meaning there is no freedom to approach the cases in any way but the arbitrary one the designer wanted. The choices would seem to indicate that there may be different outcomes to each case depending on the player's choices, but this is not the case. The plot will continue in the same way no matter how well or poorly the player does. So what, then, is the point of this gameplay mechanic which is purely based on choice if the player's choices don't matter and the game is going to continue on the same regardless? What makes games so unique as a story-telling medium is interactivity and gameplay, and this is where LA Noire could have really shined and instead dropped the ball big time.The game tries to mask it's shortcomings with an expansive and admittedly beautiful recreation of 1940's Los Angeles. However there was literally nothing to do in this open world outside of the main story besides drive around, sight-see, and heavily-scripted side-missions which didn't require an open world, nor were very fun to begin with. Why tease us with such a large and beautiful world and then make the world so void of activities? Surely it would have made more sense to make the game more linear and save the no doubt immense amount of resources making the world so huge and instead use them to polish out the other aspects of the game to make them more, you know, FUN?To say LA Noire was disappointing is an understatement. Maybe I was asking a little too much of it to begin with, but in my mind it didn't deliver on a single one of it's selling points and that is what made it such a disaster for me. The game is by no means unplayable, in fact many will probably buy it and be perfectly content with its great visuals, particularly the facial animations, detailed world, great characters, and overall uniqueness. But strip all the aesthetic stuff away and you're left with a mediocre story and a game that just isn't very fun to play.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00CQ7CIMS","description":"","reviewerName":"Denise","summary":"Now This Is What I'm Talking About","reviewText":"This is a short and concise version of NSMBU, and I actually like it more. Played this after the young one went to bed, because this game is way more hectic than its older brother.Nabbit: If I have one thing to say, Nabbit rocks. I was stealing mushrooms left and right, and left my fellow players in the dust. There's nothing like running through Piranha plants. Plus, those \"stolen\" powerups are converted to 1-ups at the end of each level, so I don't have to worry about jumping to the elusive top of the flag.Gameplay: The added \"hops\" of each character is handy, but that lost traction can burn you in tight spots. But, that's part of the fun. The levels are shorter, and I like that aspect. It's easier to jump in for \"one more level before bed\", than NSMBU, and definitely faster than Super Mario 3D World.Levels: These are redone levels of NSMBU, but they still felt different. In fact, they weren't completely recognizable as the counterparts of their longer cousins, so props to Nintendo. Some of them are \"kill levels\", but I think those are the best types. Overall, after a few hard ones, the game is not too difficult. We got to World Three in one night. Oh, don't even try Boost Mode on this game for really fun party nights.NSLU was a shining moment for Nintendo this year. I love everything about it, and can't wait to finish it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2014"}

{"product_name":"B001YHX4B0","description":"Blurring the borders of good and evil, this cinematic and stylized adventure stars Bayonetta, a heroine bent on sending supernatural forces to the depths of hell. Armed with her four enchanted guns known as Scarborough Fair, she battles both monstrous behemoths and angelic enemies. By combining special magic attacks, summoning primal forces and unleashing devastating weaponry, she impressively punishes anyone who gets in her way. From its fluid and intuitive combat system to its gripping story line, Bayonetta is one action thriller that won't disappoint.Unleash your powersView larger.Amazing graphicsView larger.","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"Best Heck&Slash 2010. Period.","reviewText":"I am a huge fan of Devil May Cry game and heck&slash; genre. Since Bayonetta is created by Hideki Kamiya, the creator of the original Devil May Cry and the inventor of the heck and slash genre, I felt obligated to try Bayonetta out. Simply put, the game just blew my mind and here is why.-EXTREMELY DEEP AND ELEGANT COMBAT SYSTEM: Just like devil may cry games, this game has amazing combat system. You will be amazed by how many different types of combos you can pull of using hand to hand as well as weapon combats. Furthermore, as you master these combos, you will enjoy this game more and more. Normal and difficult modes of this game are mainly designed for people who take joy in mastering and exploring different combos and use them to punish enemies; however, if you are a button masher don't worry. Easy and very easy mode will take you through the game, performing various combos by the taps of the same button.-LODS AND LODS OF WELL DESIGNED WEAPONS: In this game you have access to 11 or so special weapons that are specifically made for Bayonetta throughout the game and 4 or more special weapons you can unlock by meeting certain requirement. You will also have access to 7 or more enemies weapons. You can equip two sets of weapons at the same time so there is a lot to experiment by pairing different weapons to punish enemies.-EPIC BOSS BATTLES: To me a game is no good if it does not have good bosses. Fortunately this game has plenty of awesome boss fights. God of War and Devil May Cry games are my favorite games of all times because of the boss battles, but some boss battles in Bayonetta even goes beyond any God of War or Devil May Cry game. Unfortunately, I can not tell you about some of the most spectacular boss battles without spoiling the experience.-VARIETY OF ENEMIES: So many games these days have the same enemies over and over again. Not Bayonetta though. It will start with some relatively easy enemies, but as you further progress in the games, the enemies will get stronger, harder, faster and more interesting. Again, can't tell you more without spoiling the content.-AMAZING SUMMONS: With difficult enemies and bosses, you need strong moves to finish them, right? No worries, Bayonetta can summon 10 (if not more) ridiculously powerful monsters from Hell to finish off your opponents. As you progress further and further into the game, Bayonetta will summon more and more stronger monsters. Believe me there is no better way to finish a battle than annihilate your opponent using these creatures.-SPECTACULAR LEVEL DESIGNS: Different levels/stages in this game are very well designed. Most game you are standing on flat land from beginning to the end. Not in Bayonetta though. You will be walking on the walls, running on the ceilings, jumping from a chunk of a land flying in space to other, surfing in the ocean and everything that you never imagine a game could make you do. THE BEST PART HERE, the camera angles changes accordingly, so it doesn't confuse you and allows you to make the best move possible. I just loved the whole experience.-TRANSFORMATION ABILITIES: Being a witch, Bayonetta can transform into lightning fast panther, elusive bats or flying crow. These transformations are extremely useful in the combat. Being able to transform into bats right as an enemy hits you to evade his attack, JUST PRICELESS.-WITCH TIME: Another great feature of the game. Dodging an enemy attack at the right time slows time and gives you upper hand to punish the enemy making the gameplay so much more enjoyable.-VARIETY OF GAMEPLAY: While majority of game is heck and slash fighting, you will also be doing cool things like riding bike and other things (really don't want to spoil it more). At the end of each level, you will get to play mini game called Angel Attack. This keeps the gameplay experience fresh and prevent the game from being redundant.-DECENT STORY: While it is not the strongest element of this game, it has fairly decent humorous story. Under most scenarios due to cultural differences, sense of humor is very different in Japanese games from the Westen games. Honestly for me though, different jokes in the games made me laugh hard. Cinematic were decent and if you want detailed version of the story, there are plenty of documents you have access to throughout the game.-PLENTY OF UNLOCKABLES AND GREAT RE-PLAYABILITY: There are a lot of accessories (helps you with combat), combat moves, characters, weapons and costumes you can unlock in the game by spending halos you get from defeating enemies. Plus, there are hard and extra hard modes to the game. It will be difficult if not impossible to unlock everything on your first playthrough. Good thing here is you can keep all the things you have unlocked and use them when you play the game again and unlock more awesome items. This truly adds replayability value to the game.Now like many of you the first time I saw Bayonetta, I was like what the hell is this creature? After playing this game, it totally makes sense to me. She is designed in this particular way because she is a witch and to appreciate the beauty of this design, YOU MUST PLAY THIS GAME.So all and all this game will make you go through the experiences you will not see coming and before you know it, it will get you addicted. BELIEVE ME, I JUST FINISHED IT FOR THE FORTH TIME.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2010"}

Such is the case with Legend of Zelda:Oracle of Ages &amp; Oracle Seasons.  Originally planned as a trilogy, this two-part adventure is exceptionally good which is why I highly recommend that you add them to your collection.It all begins in Oracle of Ages. Veran(The Sorceress of Shadows) kidnaps Nayru(The Oracle of Ages). Because Link feels directly responsible for her kidnapping(as you find out while playing the game), he sets out to find her and save her. With the Harp of Ages, he travels between the past and present meeting familiar faces (some of which you'll recognize from Ocarina of Time)in his effort to make things right. That's when the storyline deepens and the fun truly begins. Rest assured, though, he's not alone in this one. Along the way, he enlists the help of Moosh, Dimitri, and Ricky.Out of two games, in my opinion- this is the harder game of the two...but the most rewarding. I think Capcom did an outstanding job with their first effort in the Zelda series and I hope Nintendo continue to let them develop future installments for the Gameboy and the Gameboy Advance.Again, I highly recommend you add these games to your collection. They're awesome.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2004"}

Mario 64 was a classic game, and in bringing it to the handheld Nintendo has not only added to the original game but has given a whole new generation of gamers the chance to experience this excellent game.  The game doesn't translate to the DS perfectly, however, with the control system being a significant drawback.Audience:  Some remakes of games are nostalgia trips and appeal only to people who enjoyed the original game.  This is NOT the case with Mario 64.  Fans of the original will of course be happy to see the game again, but the game is still fresh enough to be enjoyed by anyone.Graphics:  Excellent.  The graphics on the original N64 were great but somewhat primitive 3D (the game represented one of Nintendo's earliest attempts at a 3D world) caused some glitches.  Mario 64 DS, on the other hand, is smooth and seems to be glitch free.Gameplay: The original Super Mario 64 had a total of 120 stars available.  It wasn't necessary to get them all to beat the game, but having that many provided a lot of replay value to the console version.  Mario 64 DS has expanded that value even more, adding another 30 stars (total 150 now!).  In addition, the game allows you to play not only as Mario but also as Yoshi, Luigi, and Wario, each with unique moves and attributes you'll find useful throughout the game.Super Mario 64 also includes several mildly amusing minigames and some multiplayer options, allowing 2 people to play together using only 1 copy of the game.Control:  This is the only major complaint I have with the game.  The N64 controllers had an analog joystick which was used by Mario 64 for movement.  It controlled not only Mario's movement but also his movement speed, and the adapted control system for the DS leaves much to be desired.  The first obvious shortfall is a lack of an analog joystick--you wouldn't think it would make that much difference, but the directional pad on the DS feels awkward and stiff for anyone used to the N64 controls.  Because the analog control also controlled Mario's speed in the original, the DS version now requires you to hold down a button if you want your character to run.  Considering you'll be running over 90% of the time this gets very annoying.These control issues may not seem like a real threat to gameplay but, believe me, they are.  People who remember playing the original Mario 64 may feel, as I did, that Mario's movement is very limited in this version.  It's not enough to turn me off of what is otherwise a very good game, of course, but it was enough to deter me from buying this new version, preferring to borrow it (for the new content) instead and just keep my old version on the Nintendo 64.Challenge:  Obtaining enough stars to defeat Bowser and rescue the Princess is not overly difficult but is, nonetheless, a challenge.  Getting all 150 available stars, however, is a different story.  Some of the stars are incredibly difficult to get and should provide a great challenge for people who found the game too easy.Overall this is a great game, and still one of my favorites of all time.  The controls are a pain but may not be an issue for anyone who didn't play the old one as much as I did, and when it comes right down to it the ability to have this game on the go will probably outweigh the inconvenience of hooking up the old N64 for most people.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMAX","description":"Mario Kart 64, one of the first games released for the Nintendo 64  platform, is an updated translation of the very popularSuper Mario Kartfor the  Super NES (SNES). And while the game clearly takes full advantage of the graphics  power and speed of the N64, a few components that made the original so compelling  have been left out of this release.Still, Nintendo's expertise at sucking players into the game world is strongly evident, andMario Kart 64offers enough challenges to keep players (especially casual  gamers) entertained. Placing a familiar Nintendo personality behind the wheel of a  sputtering kart powered by a 50, 100, or 150-cc engine, the game lets players race  computerized opponents or up to four other players on a variety of well-designed tracks.  Because karts lack the power and speed of race cars, drivers must focus on collecting  power-ups and nonlethal weapons rather than negotiating hairpin turns on two wheels.  Grabbing and using on-track items is the heart of the game's fun: a strategically-placed  banana peel sends the unlucky victim into a spin, nailing an opponent with a turtle shell  launches their vehicle skyward, and a rocket provides a quick boost to near-breakneck  speeds, if only for a moment.The multiplayer mode provides enormously chaotic fun for up to four players--flip it on  at a party and watch the guests congregate around the screen.--Eric TwelkerPros:Well-designed tracksSimple controlsStrong multiplayer appealCons:Computerized opponents sometimes pull off questionable feats","reviewerName":"Alex \"47\"","summary":"Amazing","reviewText":"This was the first 'Kart' game quite like this.. there isn't any 'Kart' game like this either outside of the Mario franchise.

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants.

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming.

I think this is a great thing as you can't just use attack every round. The job and ability system is awesome. You can learn abilitys on jobs and use them for other jobs. You could have a sorcerer have the power to store one of his attacks. You could have a knight cast demi. You can have a barbarian who guards other members. It is really cool and fun as you stay with basically 4 characters. These 4 characters can change jobs and look different for each one. The fun thing is getting to choose who does what. The story is great, as it should be. The characters interact and have personalitys.Now, I stopped playing ff5 half way through because it is much longer than other final fantasys. It also has a saving issue. Sometimes when opening the save menu you will see the pixels go crazy. You have to exit the save menu a couple times or just select save by pressing down once than x 3 times. This bug is kinda annoying at times but it can be fixed. It does have high points though that should not be overlooked.FF6 is good. It has much better sprites. It is different though. You can't just have your 4 favorite characters as you will probably switch it up alot. I liked the characters, but they do tend to become useless. Most of them do. I never use Cyan or whatever. The challenge is moderately hard. It is not as challenging as FF5, but more challenging than ff7. There are a ton of summons. I read Expert Gamer sometimes and they have a whole page filled with summons in one issue. The battles are relatively fun, but can be won easily with Edgar. It is so easy to use tools that it is almost a joke. I stopped playing this one half way through also as I got distracted.If you like classic 2d games, these are pretty good. I am gonna finish ff5 after starting over and plan to do the same with 6. They are both good and the editor said &quot;ff5 should of stayed unreleased&quot;. When you say something like that, you clearly did not play the game. It is innovative and fun. Great value for 2 great games!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2004"}

I kept hearing about this game.  I still rented it.  It had good and bad parts.  Some of the good stuff was the story.  It seemed to move to fast for it's own good.  But, it really drew me in.  It was weird to watch the videos.  Made me feel as if it were all real.  If you really listen to the story, it makes you want to complete your goals.  Like your fighting for your freedom.  Well, that is about all that was good.  I did not try the multi player stuff.  So I can not speak for that.  Some of the stuff I did not like was this.  The fighting is fun, but time after time I had to make sure I aimed at the moving enemy.  Not was fine, but it was hard to keep on them.  Lock on would have been nice.  When you go through a door, if you are with other players, you have to let them go through the freaking door first.  Even if they are in the back and your like a foot from it.  I was trying to get through and was like, what the hell, this sucks.  The graphics actually look rather dull.  Like your playing a PC game from like 2003.  I don't care about graphics, but I did notice them this time.  As I said about the story drawing me in, you get bits and pieces.  I never really got a good grip on what the heck was going on in the world.  I really wish I could hear more.  You can not shoot your teammates.  Sometimes I just wanted to pop them in the leg with something.  Then, the game play is far to short.  I played for like 20 - 40 or so minutes and had it beat in less than 7 days.  For the price, there should have b een a lot more.  Hopefully they will have a second game or DLC.

The left joystick controller is located higher than it is on the PS3 controller.  This was not a problem for me because I actually like the setup of this controller.  However, I did not notice it immediately when I ordered this item and may change some peoples minds.Secondly, the backlight on this remote is a little confusing since it is only one color.  When playing some games, they show the buttons you need to press (God of War for example) and it shows a shape and color.  This is only red.  If you are a person that uses color to determine the button to press, you are out of luck.Thirdly, when installing this for the first time, it locked up my system.  I could not get it to respond and needed to unplug the system completely, reboot without the remote, add it in the settings, and then reboot again.  Seemed to work that way but it was a pain in the butt to figure out and even at that I'm not sure I figured out anything.Overall, this is an okay controller.  It works as a cheap second controller if I have company.  But for now, I think I will stick to my original controller and be happy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000MUW98O","description":"InBurnout Paradiseplayers are treated to a rarity in the video games universe: a complete reinvention of an established franchise that equals, if not betters any of the previous games in the series.

This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Cute Chihuahua","summary":"FUN GAME, GOOD VALUE","reviewText":"I purchased this game and loved it at first but got boring after a couple weeks.

The games advertises that it has 250 miles of open roads, stunts and 120 unique events.  They recently release two different free downloads to the game as an added benefit.

{"product_name":"B002I0K3M0","description":"","reviewerName":"Jack Treese \"Jack\"","summary":"Very underwhelming pack-in compared to Wii Sports","reviewText":"Now before I receive any criticisms over the headline, I know these two titles shouldn't be compared as being the same type of game.  Wii Sports was a sports-centric title while Nintendo Land is more of a mini-game collection than anything else.  I'm only comparing the two as pack-in titles, nothing more.  Now, on with the review!As more of a solo gamer, I was let down by Nintendo Land's offerings.  For the uninitiated, Nintendo Land is an amusement-park themed mini-game collection, starring many flagship Nintendo franchises we all know and love such as Mario, Metroid, Pikmin and Zelda.  Six games are 1-player only, three are for 1-to-5 players, and the other three are multiplayer-only.  While the game mainly focuses on Wii U GamePad features, other players can join in with a Wii remote, and sometimes Nunchuck.  Two of the games require some iteration of MotionPlus (whether the attachment or a Wii Remote Plus).Now before I get into why this game was a let-down for me, let me iterate something:  I've been a Nintendo fan since I can remember; the NES was my very first game console, and I've been a fan of the Big N ever since.With that having been said, I had no problem trading this game in after a few weeks.  Whereas Wii Sports is fun for anyone--whether you're a casual or hardcore gamer, whether you're by yourself or with friends--Nintendo Land panders to having multiple players.  It's a great idea for bringing friends and family together, but as an introduction to the Wii U my friends and I all found this game to be laughable.That's not to say it doesn't have its charms.  For me personally, the highlight of the entire disc was the Donkey Kong themed game, DK's Crash Course.  In this mini-game, the players tilts and button-taps at the right moments with precision to make it past all the areas and to the goal.  Even when nearly every other experience felt dull, Crash Course had me going back for more... and more...Another one I actually liked was Pikmin Adventure.  I mainly played this one alone because my friends by this point were too off-put by the game's design, but I had a blast controlling Olimar and sending out Pikmin to clear enemies.  The other games on this disc feel more like unrealized tech demos than legitimate mini-game experiences.  Yoshi's Fruit Cart has you drawing a path out for Yoshi with the stylus, Octopus Dance was flat-out stupid, and Metroid Blast wasn't that much of a blast.I dunno, maybe this game just isn't for me because I play solo for the most part.  However, I can't be too harsh on the game, especially since I'm sure many gaming families will have a great time with this.  But for me, I'm gonna hold out for Pikmin 3 and other great titles.Nintendo Land is fun for a bit, but if you're by yourself you won't wanna stick around too long.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2013"}

There is no real combat, it's a climbing jumping mostly. You can fight the bad guys but it's not recommended as you are outnumbered most of the time, smarter to run. This is mostly an art game like Shadow of the Colossus, Okami, Portal and others are so you have to like non-mainstream games to like this once you get past the awe of the slick and unique graphics.This is not a 5 star game but the whole judging a game simply because of virusware for anti-piracy reasons is getting a little old on every PC game review. Look at Tomb Raider:Underworld it's a top shelf game that was reasonably priced with no securom but of course didn't sell as expected so the company is laying people off and cutting it's projections so even if you leave out the virusware and have a fair price and a game that needed no patches out of the box there will be piracy taking profits.So a little sanity is needed from these goobers who give the WHOLE game a 1 star for just one aspect of the game, not even the gameplay aspect is included. All these guys need to get a class action lawsuit instead of flame on Amazon.Most non-pirates don't care about securom and like 98% of the time you won't get drive problems or the like on your PC from securom. Reviews need to be informative about the whole product and try to be as complete as possible not a rant from someone who never even played the game!I think the graphics are awesome but at the same time they are fairly simple and static so it's very easy to get fooled into thinking this game graphically is on par with Crysis, GTA, Bioshock or Deadspace when it's really just run of the mill. You can get the best looking graphics if it's just a 360 degree render that doesn't have any complex movement and this is really what this game does as well as being mostly white in color with red objects as hints to the next objective. This kind of reminds me of a Google earth render of a city with everything being mostly white.I've played a couple levels and found it fun, not sure it would have much replay value though since once you figure it out the first time there's not much reason to do it again so it's pretty linear in nature.The controls are pretty easy to pick up using things like shift, space and tab to get things done. The audio is pretty run of the mill as well and a problem is that it's set way too high on startup and you can't get real-time change in game, even if you turn it down it does not take effect until next startup. Also you can't save where you want, it autosaves at predetermined checkpoints which can be annoying because if you fall you'll have to do the same bit of real estate over and over just to get where you left off.I didn't have any issues with running it but there is a first patch out there if you need it, I think for a Physx problem some people were having. I'm at all high on 1680x1050 and the game started up at this level so it's good at detecting and adjusting to your systems specs. I'm running a q6600, 8800GT512, 4GB, XPSP3.Other than that I really can't think of much else to say, it's uniqueness is it's strength more than anything, it's a pretty simple game and is an enjoyable experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2009"}

You play Dan, and he has an assault rifle which is a blast to use. You get to carry a lot of ammunition right from the start. Finding more ammo is really easy most of the time. Dan also carries a decent hitting pistol which has infinite ammunition. He can pick up a third weapon from the downed enemies. He also carries a few grenades which are really nice in the right circumstance. Also, he can carry a fourth special heavy weapon if you find one, although he will drop it when you switch weapons. You get to shoot robots aplenty, and they are just plain fun to annihilate! You can shoot their legs off and they will crawl. You can headshot them and then they shoot their allies. You can even shoot their arms off and watch as they try to melee in battle! Ha!Health comes back over time. However, you can get 'knocked out', and then you will need a first-aid kit to get back in the fight. First-aid kits can be bought or found. You may need them! All characters in your squad will carry first-aid kits. They will heal themselves if they are knocked out, and can even heal you if needed.Destroying enemies and beating bosses will give you cash which can then be spent on upgrades. There are two types of upgrades, weaponry and skills. Each character may equip up to six slots of skills. Skills and weapon upgrades are purchased from various vending machines scattered throughout the levels. Some skills take 3,or 2, or 1 upgrade slot, with the better upgrades taking 1 or 2 slots. Weapon upgrades are for each charachter's main weapon. Accuracy, rounds per clip, damage, fire rate, range and more can be upgraded for each character, and it is wise to do so. Dan's weapon is special, and has a 'shockwave' close assault blast as well as main rifle rounds, very nice.Boss battles are awesome! There are a lot of them, as well. I found the normal difficulty I started on was just right for me. The bosses are of different types, and you will fight them in different situations. These boss battles were lots of fun!You are part of the Rust Crew squad, and there are other members in the squad. Each has their own personality. You can increase your Trust level with each squad member in very short conversations that pop up. Also, how you fight will affect Trust. If they trust you more, they will respond to your commands better. If trust is low, they will fight poorly. I found this aspect of the game better than I thought I would. Also, how you fight battles will affect Trust. If you sit back too much and plink, you are seen as cowardly, whereas if you charge forth and do lots of damage and down many enemies everyone's Trust will increase. The game has a good melee system, so do it to it!The story is not a stereotypical sci-fi story. It will keep you engaged and even guessing until the end. Binary Domain has a very serious story. It plays out nicely, and the cutscenes are usually not very long. I found the story to be very engaging.There are also a few cool arcade sequences in the game. Normally, I hate such things, because I cannot do them very well, but the arcade sequences in Binary Domain were actually quite fun. They pop up every now and then.The graphics are outstanding. Very clear and crisp, right down to facial features. The colors are not overwhelming, nor is the game too bright or too dark. The graphics are great! I can't say enough about how good the graphics are.The voice acting is terrific. These characters each have a distinct personality, and the voice actors bring it all to life very well. I thought the voice acting was great. Furthermore, I like the sound overall. It is not a loud in-your-face game with a horrible soundtrack. Everything is just right.I did not use voice commands much, which is supported by the game. I found using L2 for the commands easier. However, the voice command system worked fine for me.Overall, Binary Domain is a great third-person shooter with good mechanics, great characters, a neat and interesting story, and high production values. Hope this helped!PS: Don't miss those credits!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2012"}

E Jackson","summary":"mortal kombat trilogy","reviewText":"Mortal Kombat Trilogy was a popular game back in the early days of the Playstation's existence. Even before the Playstation Mortal Kombat was known as a groundbreaking game for its graphic violence on the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. It was the first of its kind, or one of the first. Looking back at the old 2D fighter games, despite the heavy amount of blood and all the creative fatalities, Mortal Kombat STINKS, plain and simple. The game tries to look dangerous and back in the day it really WAS a threat. Parents were terrified that their children might experience all the blood and gore.We're talking nearly 14 years since the original Mortal Kombats release, and now we can look at the Mortal Kombat series for what it really is: a cheesy-looking and crappy series of uninteresting tournament fighting. That's what the entire series is (until the game turned 3D, then I don't know WHAT to think). Just the way the two fighters attack each other is SO boring. Even the best fighters like Sub-Zero and Noob Saibot are a total bore.Midway thought they really had something going when they created Mortal Kombat Trilogy. It featured nearly EVERYBODY from the previous Mortal Kombat games. How can it be bad? Well, besides the reasons I mention above, the Playstation version is murdered with INCREDIBLE amounts of loading times. People can say the Playstation was a bad system when it came to loading all they want, but the fact remains Mortal Kombat Trilogy is quite possibly the most annoying game when it comes to waiting to play the freaking thing. Sometimes you have to wait almost a minute before the game *finally* loads the fight screen. And the fighting is so bad (because the entire Mortal Kombat series up until this point is severely dated and horrible) that the loading times are actually the part I look forward to the most.I'll give the game one extra point for featuring all the fighters in one nifty little package. Besides that. BAD game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2006"}

Antiquity (12,000 B.C.) is an age where the world is divided between people whose continent is buried in snow, and the magical kingdom of Zeal, a highly advanced civilization.

There have been spin-offs, ports, and terrible sequels since then, but Origins redeems the series. There isn't really a story here except you're saving lums and princesses of different lands to earn powers. There aren't any cut scenes or voice overs because this goes back to its old school roots, and yes, the game is hard.The controls are silky smooth and so are the animations. It helps that the controls are responsive as well as you jump around the levels that require focus and skill to navigate. Obstacles lay in your path such as treacherous waters, enemies, and fire. Each new area has unique enemies, hazards, and an overall layout which is very nice to look at. Enemies can be jumped on or punched and after that they inflate. You can use the Vita screen to touch them so they pop to get the lum inside which actually makes this version more forgiving than the consoles. When you jump around to find lums you will see them in hidden objects, and some will be trapped in bubbles. You can touch them to pop them to add to your collection which is much easier. While your bounding about the cleverly laid out levels you can find hidden areas with cages full of lums that you can find by hearing their cries for help.The game is just so cleverly designed with levels that are tricky, but not so tough that you can't forgive the game. You may restart a few times, but it actually requires skill instead of luck or exploiting the game's faulty controls (if they were). Sliding around on ice, or dashing towards an enemy and punching them, grabbing onto a ledge then jumping up on top of an enemy can be tricky, but it can be done with a little practice and quick reaction. The levels slowly get harder, but the whole point is to collect the lums and get medals at the end of each levels. Save enough and you can unlock special treasure missions where you have to chase one down through a series of tricky obstacles.Origins is just so clever and charming that you can't really hate it. There are plenty of characters to unlock as well as extras. This game is perfect for people who love exploring levels and finding secrets. There are plenty of levels and things to find to keep you busy for many hours. I do wish there were some more features for Vita besides just using the touch screen. However, what is here works and nothing got downgraded from the consoles. I can only really recommend this game to hardcore platformer fans because of the difficulty.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2012"}

I found myself disoriented many times once I got to Gran Pulse.-I was discouraged from switching characters due to the games lack of saving my paradigm builds with certain characters. I simply just used Lightening, Hope and Vanille the whole game.-They really need to stop making the annoying characters in these series. Vanille's character was just annoying with her over the top high pitched squeal of a voice. Seriously guys...-The game is linear, but I found myself not caring as much as expected because I loved the battle system.The best parts of this game are the music and the graphics. The battle system is top notch too. It's different, but it works. It's fast paced and other than you really not being able to at least customize what abilities they use with certain roles it's a great change to the series. I wouldn't say keep it, but I liked it because it hadn't been done before and battles are very challenging most of the game. If I was to nitpick. The only thing I wish they would have added is as option to reselect the previous round of attacks so you don't have to keep selecting, rush blitz attack. it remembers the enemy you are attacking but not the multiple abilities you used.All in all I like this game. I'm still on chapter 11 doing alot of the side missions which is a great addition. The lack of cities are fine for this, but they probably should have added them at chapter 11 because everything previous just felt like a big long tutorial up until then.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2014"}

Simply put the action is similar to that of the Kingdom Hearts series, you use a variety of combos to take out your foes. There is no traditional jrpg menu driven combat system in this game. Hence an action/hack n slash title. The reason why this game leans towards rpg is because you can select the types of attacks that you have on hand to use from a variety of attacks that you accumulate throughout the game. Its strong points are the very well executed combat system and the top notch design/graphics/visuals. Where the game falls short is the lack of rpg elements, and a lackluster story. I will elaborate in detail in the following paragraphs.What is interesting about the combat system is the distinct use of the enemies you defeat. For example the first time you take down the \"horned bull\" and absorb its \"spirit\" you can then attack using this spirit and the \"horned bull\" is visually represented during your attack a few feet in front of your character, visually this is very neat. Furthermore linking together combos from various spirits makes for some distinct gameplay that in my opinion far surpasses the extremely repetitive nature of combat found in games like Kingdom Hearts. There is allot of room for creativity in how and when you combine your attacks/spirits. The combat is very fun and beautifully executed visually, if you are a fan of fantasy styled visuals you will not be disappointed.Which leads me to what strikes me most about this game, the over all art design and wonderful use of color. The many environments, and various foes look just fantastic. Design wise I would describe the look and feel of this game as Hansel and Gretel meets Final Fantasy meets Wizard of Oz. Very distinct traditional story book vibe meets modern fantasy feel which had me deeply absorbed for the first 5 hours or so simply due to the solid combat and the distinctly gorgeous visuals. Though like most things beautiful that lack \"heart\", over time the flaws begin to outweigh the visual beauty.When I said this game is NOT an rpg that is because it isn't in the traditional sense. Your character is in one very small town throughout the game and you interact with a very limited number of characters that you must interact with to unlock the next action driven playable area. There is no open world, various towns, player defined pacing of game play.  Which is not a big deal to me, just do not go in with the expectation of jrpg styled exploration. This game is on rails.And the story. In my opinion the story was convoluted, abstract and bland. There are really no memorable characters in the game. And by around hour 12 I had lost all interest in the unfolding \"mystery\", I simply didn't care about the story or characters.That about sums it up Folklore. If you are looking for a different action title to mix into your gaming routine, then I say go for it, the combat is fun and distinct. Again the game looks just great, I am a fan of the art design and the graphics. On the negative side the game itself does not let you \"explore\", and the story was very hard to follow and boring. The characters are far from memorable and are all image and no heart. I really wanted to love this game as it made such a strong impact at the outset, though over time I just found myself not wanting to \"hack it out\" to learn more about a story/characters that I simply did not understand/care about. Three star game worth about $15-$20.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001TOMR6Q","description":"","reviewerName":"Tristan A. Hayes","summary":"The definitive Nintendo RPG","reviewText":"Golden Sun Dark Dawn is a pretty phenomenal RPG for the Nintendo DS. Rather than being essentially an RPG that starts off immediately after its previous entry, it decides to do something unlike other RPGs and have us play as the offspring of the Warriors of Vale from the first game to explore the world after the rise of the Golden Sun.The game once again allows for eight characters, all of which are related to the previous warriors in some way. This time there are more than 72 Djinn available (the elemental creatures that can bestow difference skills and abilities), there are new psynergy skills (possibly close to a hundred with many that can be used on the field to solve puzzles and dungeons, mind read, and teleport).The game lasted me about 40 hours, which involved me being able to get all of the Djinn, all of the summons available to get before the ending of the story, and to complete the story and defeat the final boss. It does open up later after beating the final boss to get the remaining summons and rare weapons and to face the strongest boss of the game which will be a challenge in and of itself.The Dark Dawn is the typical turn based RPG, with the Djinn being able to be summoned and kept in reserve to enable the player to unleash powerful summons, weapons themselves can unleashed multiple skills, making it a pleasure to resort to using psynergy and weapons, and the djinn can be shuffled around to change the classes of characters to reveal more psynergy to use during battles. I also enjoyed how changes to the characters weapons also appeared to affect their character models in the battle area.Dark Dawn looks amazing and all of the locales are lush and lively. Nonplayable characters had interesting conversations and moved about on the land. The various regional designs of buildings was a nice thing to see. Ultimately, it felt like I was actually exploring the world and it felt immersive.I really had no cons with the game apart from the game left me wanting more because I had so many unanswered questions at the end, but all in all, this is one of the definitive RPGs available from Nintendo and should be played by all whether or not they played the previous entries","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2010"}

The Vita is stunning. It is a beast of a machine. The real star of this piece of equipment is the OLED screen and the dual analog sticks. The screen really is as good as everyone says. It's stunning. The dual analog sticks, while small, work well and allow the Vita to play games that other systems just couldn't do comfortably. The Vita feels solidly made and the size feels good in the hand. Not to big, not to small.The front touchscreen is among the best I have ever used, and I use a lot of apple and samsung touchscreen products. The back touch area takes some getting used to but is a nice touch and I think it will be used for some neat innovative game play as more games utilize it. About the games....the Vita has a really great release lineup of games. I personally own Uncharted, Wipeout, Lumines, Hot Shots Golf, Little Deviants, MLB 12 The Show, Unit 13, Super Stardust and Escape Plan. Uncharted is the first game I have ever played on a portable that has drawn me in like a console game. This sounds stupid but I honestly didn't even think about the fact that it was on a portable as I was playing it. I was just that much into the gameplay. Yes there are a few things that feel gimmicky on uncharted where they want you to use the touchscreen but overall this game is top notch. Wipeout is awesome too and cross platform play with the PS3 is a great feature to have available. Lumines is great and has great music, Hot Shot Golf is basically just the normal hot shots game but it looks awesome on that big 5 inch OLED screen. Escape plan is an original downloadable title that is well executed but not for the fast paced gaming fan.Overall the Vita is awesome. I have owned literally every single portable gaming system I can think of...from the original game boy to the Atari Lynx and now the Vita. The Vita is the first portable game system that actually has the firepower to change the portable gaming market. Call of Duty, recently announced for this fall to hit the Vita, could be a huge game changer for the Vita and portable gaming in general. The Vita has the muscle to pull it off and has every opportunity to succeed and have a long life as a portable system.  One of my personal tests for a new system is how much I play it after the first two or three weeks.  I got the 3DS and played it for two weeks to finish the Mario game and now I rarely pick it up...it's actually been a few months since I have touched it.  I pick the Vita up almost every day.  Sometimes it's just a quick 9 holes of hot shots golf or a quick run of Unit 13 but it has become the game system I play most.  If you have the money I would definitely recommend the Vita.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2012"}

It's like a Sims game, but with more of an anime / fun style to it. Animal Crossing Wild World takes the same fun on your handheld.You're playing on a relatively small town map, so it's really easy to get to know where all of the residents' houses are located. You start with just 3 residents, and new ones join in slowly. Each resident is a different kind of animal, with a name, personality, likes, dislikes and more.As the game progresses, they give you presents, you write them letters, you trade compliments and they really do begin to seem like friends. But this is only the beginning. You set up a whole trade system with the local shop. You can buy and sell turnips on the \"stalk market\", learning to time your trades to make the most money. You can harvest the local tree fruit and sell that. You can go fishing and either donate the fish to the local aquarium or sell the extras.You can design a town song that plays in the background, design your own clothing, even breed new types of flowers. You can learn songs from the local guitar player, look at the constellations in the sky, and much more. The game is incredibly immersive, and is just as much fun if you only have say 1/2 hr a day to play while you're riding the bus. That's plenty of time to catch up with your virtual friends and keep the town tidy.The wi-fi capabilities are neat if you have online friends - as long as you give your secret code, you can visit each other. That of course is critical - the last thing you'd want is some unwelcome visitor able to leap into your town and chop down your trees!I do have some complaints with the game. First, I do think the day-night cycle is neat, that it's timed with your actual clock. However, I am a night owl. I work very hard in the day and the only time I have to play is in the early morning hours, say 2am - 5am. The stores and everything are closed in the game!! I finally had to actually change my DS clock to be able to sell some stuff but I *hate* having to do that. Why couldn't the store have a \"night shift\" so that those of us who are night owls could still enjoy the game?Also, some of the conversation gets redundant. You have to sit through certain greetings - say at the store - every single time. Surely they could either think of something new to say or just let me get about my business. Also, when I am dropping off full loads at the store, it'd be REALLY nice to have a \"select all\" button instead of having to drag every single little thing one by one.Still, those are relatively  minor complaints with the game. It is really quite relaxing and fun, and since you customize your little world by planting flowers, decorating your home, thinking up nicknames and quotes and even designing your own clothes, it is just so \"comfy\" to be there. There are tons of little touches that add great delight to the game. If you drop a rose on yourself, you carry it around in your teeth :)Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00DHF39L2","description":"","reviewerName":"Steven","summary":"Awesome old school gaming done right.","reviewText":"I was a little hesitant to buy this at first because I wasn't sure if I wanted to pay $60 for a linear single player only shooter. I found this on sale at Costco for $34, so I had to pick it up at that price (if you caught this review in time then run to Costco! It's a nationwide deal). It's definitely worth the $34 and after playing it I have to say it's even worth it at full price.Though I have played through classics like the original Doom, original Half Life, Quake, etc, this is my first Wolfenstein game. What a blast! The game mechanics are very simple but it has a surprising amount of depth. You can tackle many situations using different strategies. In many cases you can either go guns-a-blazing, or clear an area using stealth. It's surprisingly fun going the stealth route.One simple but cool feature is the perks system which has a few dozen mini challenges that if completed will give you passive perks. For example if you get enough grenade kills then you'll get an additional grenade slot, or if you shoot enough people while being stealthy your gun will do more damage. The challenges are actually fun and well integrated so they don't feel tedious.One feature you should take advantage of if you have Kinect is the voice commands. Most actions are easier to execute using a controller (such as throwing grenades or reloading), but being able to switch weapons by just saying \"knife\", \"assault\", etc is very helpful. Otherwise you have to use a somewhat clumsy radial menu which does not pause the game when active. I hope more games integrate Kinect like this, even though it's very basic it is also very helpful. The voice commands are not enabled by default but are easy to turn on in the settings menu.As far as graphics are concerned they are a bit hit and miss. They are a little bit of a miss because character models look a bit odd and textures are a little sloppy (especially up close), but they are also a hit because the actual environments are amazing! One thing I love is how varied the environments are. never did I feel like things were becoming repetitive. I also like how this game uses pretty much the full color spectrum and doesn't limit itself to dull grays, greens, etc like many modern gritty FPS games. A lot of care went into level design. Also, this game runs at a full 60 frames per second and I never saw it dip once no matter how much action was on the screen. This translates to extremely smooth gameplay and controls that feel great.I'm happy they went with just a simple finely tuned single player experience and didn't add any fluff. The campaign is lengthy for a shooter (15-20 hours) and everything just feels right.If you are looking for an old school shooter then don't pass this one up!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"ps2 gamer \"star wars\"","summary":"Best portable system ever !","reviewText":"Wow. This thing really exceeded my expectations. I didn't want to buy one at first, but i'm really glad that I changed my mind.The PSP is the best portable gaming system out there. No joke. Not only can you play games on it, but you can also watch movies, download photos and music from your computer, and go on the internet. Also, it has an LCD screen, and the graphics are really great. Though they're not as good as the PS2 graphics, they're still very good, and I wouldn't even expect it to have graphics that are as good as a console's, because it's only portable.If you have read other reviews about the PSP, I'm sure you heard like a thousand times that the PSP doesn't have good games. Maybe this was true in the past, but right now there are many great games coming out. They're things like Mega Man Maverick Hunter X, Daxter, Ultimate Ghosts n' Goblins, and more, so all you'll need is some patience. Also, the movies play really great, and the sound effects for the music are awesome ( especially when you have the headphones on ). You can also download videos from you computer. All of these features are awesome, and they're really worth it, especially since they feel fleshed out and not just tacked on.However, this system does have its flaws. For one, the 32MB memory stick that comes with the PSP can only hold a few songs and photos, even though it can hold a lot of videogame memory. You'll probably want to buy a memory card that holds more memory, but these things aren't very cheap. Also, you can't put CD's you already have in your PSP. You'll have to buy the special UMD discs, so that might bother some people. Another thing is that the battery life ranges between 4-6 hours. You'll have to reload it occasionally. That didn't really bother me, but the impatient type might find it very annoying. Also, the PSP is pretty sensitive, so you'll have to be careful with it. Remember to keep it out of high temperatures and humidity, and try not to hurt the screen. Some people have also complained about Dead Pixels (places on the screen where the color is slightly unfocused) appearing on their PSP, but this can be prevented by simply keeping your system out of direct sunlight. However, these aren't really big problems, and they definitely shouldn't discourage you out of buying the system.Overall, this is a really great system, and if you have enough money to buy it (...) you definitely should. this is a really awesome portable device, and you can play it in your home, or outside of your home, like in a car, etc. PSP rules!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2006"}

The first lessons were for sketching in pencil. I drew a ball and then an apple, which I thought weren't bad. Then, came the tree in pencil and paint. That turned out well, also.Afterwards, the lessons became more difficult. I could mimic, but I don't think I did well. Part of the problem is the stylus is no replacement for an actual paintbrush. It feels more like pencil. If the lessons focused more on sketching, I think it would have been better. The focus appears to be more on painting.After each lesson, there is a mini lesson. We get an object to draw and paint without prompting, using all the skills we've learned up to that point. My creations are never very good, so I think I didn't pick much up.Maybe the lessons just move too quickly for me. Maybe they should have put more time on each skill. I was doing well drawing a circle and then a sphere. How about a box and then a cube? A circle and then a cylinder? Maybe once I draw all the shapes, I could move on.

A brave New World is rising--a hostile yet beautiful world, filled with innovative gameplay, new strategic scenarios, eye-searing graphics and much more. Welcome to a world calledAge of Empires III.CampaignIn this action adventure tale of historical fiction, players take on the role of Morgan Black and his family, struggling against the hostile wilderness and a mysterious cult that's crept in from Europe.In a series of 24 scenarios divided into three acts, Morgan Black and his descendants help the Aztecs resist conquest by Spanish conquistadors, pit the French against the British in the French and Indian War and help Simon Bolivar lead revolutions in South America.MultiplayerWhether you're searching for a quick game or hoping to talk strategy with friends online,Age of Empires III's Multiplayer site is your community destination.Here, you can play with persistent Home Cities that gain power and strategic options the more games you play, compete for a spot on dozens of ladders, help organize your clan or chat after a game -- all without leaving the multiplayer portal.Fans ofAge of Mythology's Quick Search can still look for games swiftly, while players looking for something specific can browse game lists to find the set of options that matches their tastes.New Feature--Home CitiesThis revolutionary new feature to the RTS landscape is incorporated into all aspects ofAge of Empires III-- from Campaign to Multiplayer -- and is unlike anything you've experienced before.Much like the persistent character from a role-playing game that encourages you to keep playing, your Home City is an important support system to your efforts in the New World. During a game, your Home City can regularly send you supplies or military reinforcements.You are the leader of your colony, but your success brings glory back to Mother Europe. The more games you play, and the better you do, the more powerful your Home City will become. Every few games, you gain the ability to both upgrade and customize your Home City:Upgrade your city by unlocking new types of soldiers or buildings, or improving those you already have.Broaden your tech tree in whatever direction most fits your play style--invest in warships, native alliances, cavalry, artillery or economy.Customize your Home City by changing the appearance of buildings, the weather or even the types of people who walk, work and perform in its streets.Throughout a game, as well as in between games, you can visit your Home City to watch its citizens go about their lives, get an opinion on how you're doing, plot your next move or just marvel at the beautiful sunset.Full 3-D Graphics, Destructible Environments and MoreWe first set out to reproduce the rich detail ofAge of Empires II: Age of Kings. As we strove to make the fascinatingAge of Empires IIItime period come alive, that goal quickly evolved: We at Ensemble Studios wanted to create the best-looking game ever. From the stunning water effects to the hundreds of units battling on-screen, you'll feel like you're a part of the action in the New World.Tone mapping--This photo imaging technique balances the colors in a scene on the fly. The end result is a rich, warm game where bright colors are vibrantly rendered alongside darker counterparts, such as shadows.Lighting and shadows--The sun is always shining inAge of Empires, so it's important that lighting and shadows be an awe-inspiring experience. Units and buildings cast shadows according to a real sun position, and even cast shadows on each other. High Dynamic Range rendering allows us to represent the shiny glints of sunlight that bounce off highly reflective surfaces.Bump and specular mapping--Water glistens like water. Metal shines like metal. These advanced techniques serve to provide an extra level of rendering detail heretofore unseen in real-time strategy (RTS) gaming.Water--We felt that portraying stunning, realistic water effects in the game was so important that we devoted a programmer to it full-time. You'll find the water rich with details like foam near the shore, accurately modeled water motion, flotsam in rivers and realistic water colors. Plus, reflections change with the viewing angle, the angle of sunlight and the motion of the water. The overall effect is breathtaking.Cliffs and Riverbeds--Instead of just stretching terrain, we built a system to attach geometry to the terrain map to allow for realistic overhangs and steep cliffs, from areas like the American Southwest. This effect is supported on random maps too.CivilizationsBritishQuick access to Settlers gives the British one of the strongest economies in the game. The ability to upgrade two key units -- the Musketeer and Hussar -- make the British military formidable in the late game. The British Home City emphasizes improvements to technology and naval warfare.DutchAlthough Dutch Settlers are limited and costly, their civilization makes up for this economic disadvantage by building Banks and generating coin automatically. The Dutch Home City emphasizes upgrades to defense and economy.FrenchAlthough the French economy starts slowly, the Coureur unit, a Villager with strong fighting skills, makes the French difficult to attack early. The French also have the strongest cavalry unit in the game -- the Cuirassier. Plus, the French are experts at allying with the Native Americans.GermanThe Germans have fewer Settlers and therefore a slower economy. Fortunately, both the Settler Wagon and Uhlan cavalry spawn for free from the German Town Center. Plus, the Germans start with the ability to send Mercenaries from their Home City (long before other civilizations can).Native AmericanEuropean civilizations can learn new technologies and gain troops by forging alliances with the Native Americans. A British player who allies with the Iroquois is essentially playing as two civilizations: the British and the Iroquois.OttomanFor the Ottomans, Settlers spawn automatically from the Town Center. Building a Mosque and conducting research help keep that Settler production steady. Befitting their position straddling Europe and Asia, the Ottomans have more unique units than any other civilization.PortugueseStarting the game with two Town Centers, the Portuguese can quickly produce Settlers, control territory or support their allies. The Spyglass ability allows the Portuguese to easily spy on the enemy. The Portuguese also have a strong navy, strong light infantry and the best Dragoons in the game.RussianStarting the game with extra resources but fewer Settlers gives the Russians the flexibility of focusing on economy or an early raid. Russian infantry, individually weak, are trained in blocks at a faster rate, providing the Russians with the opportunity to overwhelm their enemy with greater numbers.SpanishThe Spanish have a strong military, with both hand infantry and cavalry. Flexibility in early shipments from the Home City give the Spanish the option to attack early or set up for a strong, late economy. Spanish Home City improvements benefit soldiers, buildings and naval units.&nbsp;CombatAge of Empires IIIgives players an amazing amount of control over their side of the battlefield.More to command -- Not only are you in command of large and diverse armies of infantry, cavalry and artillery, but also Native American warriors, mercenaries and tall ships.Multiple formations -- You can assign different formations to your army for different strengths and weaknesses, or have the game automatically choose the most appropriate formation. Examples include:Volley -- ranged infantry, like musketeers, take turns firing at enemies ahead of them.Charge -- your soldiers walk, then run into combat. Cavalry wield sabers, and musketeers fix bayonets. This formation does tremendous damage but makes your soldiers more prone to injury.Bombard -- your soldiers protect the cannons, while the cannons shell enemy ranks. Available only when you have artillery in your army.Battles are easier to follow -- You can still command individual units. But when the units fight in formation, you'll be able to tell exactly who is winning the fight.Real-time physics -- Infantry struck by cannon fire will be thrown like rag dolls, perhaps even over a cliff and into the water. Cannonballs bounce and ricochet.Detailed destructions -- Shingles, shutters and whole towers may fly off a building and interact with the terrain, such as crashing into nearby water. This next generation effect is done on the fly so that each building always has a unique destruction, no matter how many times you see it.Unique animations -- With hundreds of unique combat animations, you'll never see the same battle twice.","reviewerName":"Gc \"iPoker\"","summary":"Only strategy game I'm playing so far","reviewText":"I wasn't a big fan of the old AOE series, but I decided to take this one seriously. One of the things you will notice in this game is that blowing up stuff seems more fun than it use to be back in the old days. The game is divided into three parts, and they all link up into a great storyline. Graphic is like nothing you will find in previous strategy games. All the smoke effects are in there from cannon recoiling, a battalion of musketeers loading off their rifle to buildings blowing off, even fogging up in jungle maps. Destroying building just doesn't get any better than this. These medieval buildings actually look and sound like they were flaking off as you attack them. The maps, especially the jungle maps looks extremely vivid and alive, everything just look so natural. Animals are roaming all over the map in groups, some lethal, and others are delicious. The water looks so shiny it like a mirror, and the sun shining off the surface looks incredible, I haven't found this effect in any other strategy game. I was disappointed that the ships in this game didn't make waves as they move. They pretty much flake off as you attack them just like the buildings. By the way, some of the advance ships are humongous, they even outsize most of the buildings; seeing 3 of them means that you are screwed. There is also this card system, which makes your job easier, but they must be unlocked. To make your job easier, these cards let your home city import supplies right to the battlefield. I had fun with this game, and you will too.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2005"}
{"product_name":"B001T8S62Q","description":"","reviewerName":"Lucas Black","summary":"Not groundbreaking, but a step in the right direction.","reviewText":"I got the original Nintendo DS for the Christmas following its launch and I liked it a lot.  But I was a mite bothered when they made a spiffy new one two years later and I already had old technology.  But I thought, \"Is the Lite really good enough to warrant the price when I've already got something that does the same things?  No, not really.\"  So I never bought one.  But when I heard about the new DSi, well, I was interested.\"What's so special about it?\" I thought.  Well, for one it's got cameras.  That's nice.  I do already have a camera in my phone... and I have a standard digital camera made specifically for taking pictures, but nothing wrong with one more, right?  There's also... a music player.  Well I've got an MP3 player (has a broken screen, small capacity, and is pretty worn, but I'm upgrading to a 4GB ZEN that's coming in the mail any day now...) and theres MP3 playback in my phone as well.  But it'd still be nice to have the ability to use my DS as a music player.\"Well,\" says Nintendo, \"too bad!  You don't get to use it!\"Why you ask?  Well because someone thought it was a good idea to make it only compatible with AAC format music.  Now me, I don't own any AAC music.  In fact, I'd never even HEARD of AAC before I read up on the DSi.  So it's basically a feature I can do NOTHING with.  Thanks Nintendo!What's left?  Well, the screens are bigger.  The Lite had bigger screens than the original DS, but I didn't have one, so I noticed quite a difference when skipping from 1 to 3.  I like it.  The colors are much more vibrant, the brightness control is better, and it's just an overall good thing.Unfortunately, the GBA slot is gone.  So now if I want to play GBA games and DS games I have to bring along my DSi and my SP.  I don't much care for that, but hey, at least I've got an SD slot so I can play musi... oh wait... I can't.  Thanks Nintendo.  The SD slot doesn't do much for me, yet.Here's what does it for me.  Here's what I like: DSi Ware.  Yep, the ability to download material to your DS through the internet via wireless connection.  And a shiny 1000 points to start off with.  The launch titles are largeley... adequete.  They're okay.  I'm kind of liking the Brain Age one.  But do not judge this section on what is available now, but what could be available later.  Maybe we could be downloading GBA games onto those SD cards, or maybe some Super NES games.  Or maybe user created games.  Maybe a developement tool will surface.  How cool would that be?  We can only wait.Next up, the browser.  I like it.  Yes, it's cumbersome to navigate web sites on two dinky little screens (in comparison to a home computer or laptop that is) but it does work just fine.  I wouldn't do any extended surfing on it, but it'd be great to be able to check email and forums on-the-go.  And it's free!  Can't beat that.The bottom line?  Whether this is worth the purchase depends on your needs.  If you're expecting this to be an iPhone, you will be disapointed.  If you love your DS Lite to bits and are very practical, you might want to just stick with that, at least for now.  But if you still have that clunky old original DS like me, or you want to pick up your first from the lineup, I'd say this is more than fine.  It's good software wrapped up in a tight, clean, Glock-like package.

Players can once again choose to be either Rikimaru, the silent sword-wielding assassin, or Ayama, the acrobatic younger ninja. Both characters pass through the same game world, but each has slightly different goals that take them on different routes. A third character can be unlocked later on.During the first mission, you're required to choose a number of weapons to aid you in your immediate tasks. Throughout the game, more and more weapons--from melee to ranged weapons--are added to your arsenal depending on your performance during each level; your chosen weapons dictate how you approach the mission goals. The silent approach is always encouraged, and there's a variety of graphically satisfying stealth kills that will only work if you remain elusive and strike unexpectedly and silently.Aside from the stealth kills, the game is a mixed bag in terms of its graphics. Light shimmers off your sword menacingly, but the environments are bland and repetitive, and the game fails to maximize on differences between light and dark areas in ways that might have added to the experience. Also, the stealth dynamic is made less challenging by the shortsightedness and slow reactions of the enemy guards and the iffy AI. Since guards give up searching for you within seconds and are unable to follow you through doors, this potentially atmospheric and tactical stealth game is actually just a hack-and-slash arcade romp. Multiplayer options are included, though, so if you feel the need for a more realistic opponent, you may want to call a friend.Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis still an enjoyable experience despite its flaws. It&#x92;s just a shame that, after doing so much to establish and define the stealth-game genre, it fails to raise the bar or introduce any novel elements. The game feels more like an update of the first Tenchu, and while this is no bad thing, fans will probably be expecting more.--Chris Ryan, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Axel Law \"The Happy Seizure Kid\"","summary":"Tenchu's Back!","reviewText":"Tenchu introduced stealth assassination in 1998 on the Playstation, which was followed by a prequel/sequel, Tenchu 2.  While Tenchu 2 had its shortcomings, it was still a decent entry in the series.  For the PS2, Activision decided to utilize the PS2's capabilities to the fullest in this third installment in the series.  A \"true\" sequel (because Tenchu 2 took place before the first game, which somewhat explains the crappy hookshot---er, grappling hook---in that game), here's the lowdown:THE GOODWOW, Tenchu's back!  It's a great game, too.  They improved the grappling hook and even the controls are better.  Instead of pressing forward twice and jump, just pressing X twice and moving forward obtains the double jump.  Pressing O blocks (instead of holding down)... the list goes on and on.  The graphics are vastly improved because of the PS2's capabilities and you get to choose between three characters (once you unlocked Tesshu, that is).  The music (which was largely absent in 2) has returned and some of the original Tenchu music has been remixed!  Plus, they included a MULTIPLAYER option!  This is Tenchu 3's strongest point.THE BADPerhaps the only bad thing I can say about it is that the camera, while improved over previous games, is still hard to cope with.  It gets tiresome in the heat of battle when you're trying to evade and are backed up against the wall.  Still, it doesn't detract too much from the playing series.OVERALLTenchu isn't for everybody, but if you liked a good old fashioned stealth game, ala Metal Gear Solid (but set in Feudal Japan), then you will enjoy this.A WORD FROM THE WISEPeople tend to compare this to Shinobi; Shinobi is an entirely different beast (no stealth), so comparing them is pointless.  It would be unfair for me to compare them since I love the Tenchu series a lot.  With that said, all I can say is \"Tenchu's Back.\"  Play and enjoy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2003"}

Until that point I had dismissed the game as more of a gimmick, but after reading about the countless movie and pop-culture references and parodies I decided to give it a shot, and although it may still be a gimmick it is hands down one of the greatest Nintendo 64 games ever released.The star here is the variety of gameplay.  Every level has you doing something completely different, (and often, absolutely hysterical.)  The boss fights are memorable, the puzzles are fun and challenging, and the sound and graphics are leagues ahead of most Nintendo 64 games.  There's a very good amount of spoken dialogue, and the music is catchy too.And, as Electronic Gaming Monthly predicted, the movie parodies are spot-on.  They're hilarious, they're fun to play, and they fit with the game.At this point if you're still entertaining the thought of purchasing an N64 game, and you're an adult, (although the humor is rather immature) I strongly reccomend looking into this game.

Where Grid is all about the race.  With the emphasis is to SEE a slew of good looking cars driving around the tracks.  Though that is true here is REALLY what makes the game:The Physics!No better car in the game to confirm that then the Ferrari 458 Italia.  I drove that car in the game around La Sarthe and thought WOW!!!  Absolutely wonderful to drive.  Then I saw the show Top Gear (Youtube) showing the 458 Italia and the performance of the car was appeared identical to what I felt in GT5!So very realistic!!!  There are over 1000 cars you get to experience and will find cars very enjoyable to drive as well as clunkers!This is my Experience with the game:Racing:  Very tough to find a competitive race WHERE YOU ARE BATTLING AROUND THE TRACK WITH OTHER CARS (online or off).  Capitalized because that is the key point. There is only a difficulty setting in Arcade mode.  In every race in arcade you are coming from way back to try and catch the leader.  Totally unrealistic.In A-Spec mode where you are leveling pretty much the same is true.  Competition vs. the AI is non-existent.  Its either blow the field away or try and catch the leader by the finish line.  That's not racing.Online: Its hard to find clean racers, so you leave damage off and try to find a room where most guys have driving ability.  Not so easy a task.  Stay back or get way ahead and let the pack clear the first turn and they'll start thinning out where you can make a move.  The first turn drivers get taken out by other bad drivers.  If you can find an online community where guys race in a league that is your best bet to find good, clean competitive RACING.This is a bunch to do in this game.  It would take countless hours to get through the whole thing. I wiped the file and started over just to see how long it'd take.  About 4 months to get to the highest level playing fairly regularly.What would be great is a marriage between Grid and GT.  Grid offers hot and heavy racing, with cars that can be damaged.  It's a different style of racing in that you must be careful if you want to finish the race.  In GT you can bang into anything as hard as you want with no effect to your car.  You drive differently and unrealistically if you know you can't damage your car.  It would be FANTASTIC to have the realistic racing in GTs Physics environment!!! That would be pure Nirvana!!!What I don't like about GT:1) No Damage.  No visible damage and no negative effects to the cars with a crash.2) No Crew Chief and No Manager like in Grid to help guide you through the leveling side.  In Grid the Crew Chief talks to you during the race.  He tells you who's ahead, what position you're in, damage to the car.  It would be nice to have that feedback during the race.  Or guide you in modifying your car.  The manager give you guidance on which races to run, what's best for your financial gain and gives you an overview of some of the functions.3) No Help choosing cars.  In Grid you're given a choice of \"these\" cars for this race.  In GT you may be just given a country.  You may be just given a range of model years.  Sometimes you're given a list of cars.  You can't just click on one and be taken to an offer to buy.  You have to remember then back out to the main menu and then go either into the new or used dealership to try and find one.Once you drive in GTs physics environment nothing is going to feel as good.  If you drive a Mercedes M5 in this game it's gonna \"feel\" like you've driven on for real.I give this 4 stars.  Had the racing been better against the AI I would have given it 5 stars!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2010"}

Gears of War 1 is a game full of glitches and movement problems, leading to cheap death after death after death after death. It takes a CLIP AND A HALF just to kill one enemy! And it literally takes a slight elbow bash for them to kill you. Which wouldn't be so bad if you could actually move/dash in any fashion other than a straight line. Plus, there virtually is no story. You're at war with aliens... or mutants... or mole people... or something. That's all you're given and even that you have to assume. I simply hated Gears of War.2/5Gears of War 2 is a slight improvement, as the difficulity has been significantly balanced out, making the game not so hard. And the guns have been improved too, with it no longer taking a clip and a half just to down one Locust soldier. The guns themselves have also been improved too, with accuracy, features, and damage being upgraded. The story has been slightly fleshed out with artifacts and items you find, but there still is no real in-game backstory told or explained. I had to figure out that COG is the government, the Gears are like an international army, and that Sera is this universe's version of Earth. Still don't know if the Locusts are invading aliens are a warring native species, though. Gears of War 2 is less frustrating of a game, but still pretty smiplistic in its execution, style, and overall gameplay. It's just a super-generic third-person shooter with nothing really special or unique about it, which is why I can't figure out why its so popular.Also, both games are so lifeless and devoid of color; its like everything looks gray or faded-out, even if it isn't. Very dreary and somber graphics and \"color\" (or lack of). Oh, and I guess Hoarde Mode is okay, though I haven't tried it (or any of the games) online.3/5And although it isn't included here...I rented Gears of War 3 just to complete the trilogy and it is a MASSIVE improvement over the first two. The game FINALLY has color, FINALLY has backstories and explanations for the storyline, FINALLY tells you what guns are what and what they actually do, and FINALLY has women in it! Seems like the first two should've had these all along, but whatever. I'd personally suggest playing Gears of War 3 over the other two, unless you're a huge fan of sci-fi third-person shooters. Although games like Mass Effect may have \"borrowed\" their engine from the Gears of War trilogy, those other games actually have story, un-generic characters in them (seriously, Marcus is every generic 80's-90's action movie hero, ever) and excitement to the gameplay. But even still, Gears of War 3 is finally a game worth enjoying for more than just some online Hoarde Mode stuff. Its a good game, so play that one out of the three and skip the rest.4/5","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2013"}

As such, I thought I would give Skyrim a try. I had just completed Demon's Souls, so I was up for another round of D & D style adventure. However, this is one of those games that was great initially, until about midway through, when I begin to question why I've spent so much time playing it. The final quests for the main story, are about as anti-climactic as a game can be. Of course, you have plenty of side-quests, but after the main story, there really isn't any motivation to continue on, essentially because everything pays off with loot that you don't really need. I suppose this could also be a complaint about other Bethesda games, but in comparison, without spoiling anything, in Oblivion, which is the previous game in the Elder Scrolls, it's final mission ended in the most D & D way possible. In Skyrim, the resolution to the game basically feels like any of the other mission. In fact, many of the other missions had much more satisfying resolutions.Ultimately, this is a game that looks great, is sort of fun to play, but ultimately is kind of just a time-waster.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXQ12","description":"","reviewerName":"Kyle Slayzar","summary":"Innovative, Novel, but Hardly Original","reviewText":"I've been a dance gaming fanatic since I first had fun with the dance aerobics on the NES dance pad.  Since then, I've played around on the original Dance Dance Revolution arcade games and Playstation 1 releases, Hottest Party 3 for the Wii, and Dance Party I and II for my Microsoft Kinect.  I've been a faithful believer in dance gaming since day one and am not so easily impressed with small evolutionary steps that cost full retail price only to be replaced by another the following year.I tried Everybody Dance with this predisposition and I was somewhat pleased with what I saw.I tried Everybody Dance on my PS3 and, thanks to limitations in my budget, had a friend bring his Playstation Move over and we tried it out for a few hours.  One of the first features we tried was the multiplayer (\"Party Mode\") and sampled the very contemporary soundtrack with a handful of classic dance songs (Barry White just creeped me out).  My first thought was that the soundtrack was considerably one-sided, but at least Sony tried to include some classic hits to bring in older gamers, but just not enough.After trying the party mode for a while my friend and I noted that Everybody Dance shares waay too many similarities to Dance Central and Dance Dance Revolution aside from the Move features and the up to 20 player dance competition.  Just about every feature that Sony touts on the box of the game is something that others had done.  The superimposed shots were done partially with Dance Central, the music videos superimposed on the background began with Hottest Party III, and so forth and so on.This isn't to say that Everybody Dance isn't worth it, far from it as we got some good use out of it and the DLC seemed very diverse and reasonable.  However, the game just isn't enough for me to discard the Kinect (particularly Dance Central) and get the Move.  It certainly will prove entertaining for people who have the Move and is one heck of a party game, but it lacks any real replay value for single-player as it is primarily designed as a party game.If you have a need for party games for the PS3, Everybody Dance is the ideal choice you otherwise, if you're debating between DDR, Dance Central, and Everybody Dance, I'd go with the former two.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2012"}

Dead Space 3 continues the backwards trend and is not quite as good as 2 - and nowhere near as good as the first one.  They just couldn't recapture the atmosphere of the first game.  2 and 3 told the story more thru in-game cinematics where the first one relied less on cinematics and more on voice recordings and text logs to propel the story.  Also in the first one the lead character Issac was voiceless - he was pretty much by himself which added a feeling of isolation and I felt it enhanced the whole \"terror\" experience.  In the second and third game there are more npc's so you don't really ever feel like you are alone.  Dead Space 3 also seems satisfied with simply throwing hoards of enemies at you all at once, relying more on creating a feeling of panic by overwhelming you with numbers rather than creating a feeling of tension.  The mechanics of player conrol just aren't geared towards this style of gameplay and it quickly becomes irritating.  I don't really care for the weapon crafting aspect of the game either, I am fine with just building weapons from blueprints and upgrading them.  The resource gathering scavenger bot is a nice addition though.  Overall though this game just doesn't have the same feel as the first one and I'm glad I waited for it to go on sale rather than paying full price.  I doubt I'll go back and play it again.  I'll probably wind up trading in Dead Space 2 and 3 and keeping the first one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2013"}

Pirates follows your character, a nameless family member who's entire extended family is captured by a quitessential evil baron, and sent to the Americas. You follow as a member of a various faction (British, Spanish, French, Dutch) in order to resuce them, becoming a privateer in the meantime. As you work for various governments capturing ships and cargo, you garner lands and titles, discover hidden Incan cities, plunder buried prate treasure, and confront famous pirates past. You can also woe and dance your spare hours aware with the governers daughter.Combat is this game is pathetically easy. Ram ship, dispatch enemy captain, hooray. However, if you're feelnig malicious, you can blast away sails, grapeshot the crew overboard, or sink her with roundshot, even after they run up the white. You also aren't belabored with crippled ships (Your ship, the flagship, sets the pace) This doesn't make it any less fun. Sacking cities is a bit trickier, and can require some significant strategy in order to prevail against greater numbers.Travel is sometimes annoying. The windlass is a bit misleading, and different ships run into or in front of the wind in ways that sometimes don't make sense, but a through explanation of wind and ship types helps with this. Morale also plummets at odd times, unless theres a steady stream of treasure incoming, which there usually is. Side quests, while repetitive, don't lose their charm for being integral to the progression of the various settlements. Probably my only real infuriating complaint is Simese, which I've hated since the release of the Sims. As they added enough voices that they're rarely repeated, I'd have thought a halfway decent voice acting cast would've been just as easy to run.Overall, this game is fanstastic. Fun, engaging, relatively frustrating at times, and it actually manages to convey a sense of adventure. Only a few annoyances with the system and setup prevent it from being perfect. Its also safe for all ages, though younger kids probably won't get some of the theme. And despite its age, its graphics and sound still are good enough to get a thumbs up. Considering its now in bargain bins across the land, go pick it up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2008"}

I heard so many bad things that I didn't even want to touch this with a 10 foot pole. However, this game is actually pretty fun. I've only played the single player and am liking it so much that I wanted to write a review for it before I forgot.Don't get me wrong, this game has some problems, but the main thing is that it's Fun. Yeah, that is subjective, but if you like the Aliens film. If you liked Aliens Vs Predator the game (The human perspective at least), you will enjoy this. The sound helps a lot to immerse you in the game, and just fill you with the memories of the films. I think the Atmosphere is spot on. I'm getting into it pretty good.The first Alien I encountered actually was buggy and was going threw the floor, but honestly that didn't make me hate the game too much, since I knew about bugs prior to playing. A lot of the fiasco from what I know, is that that the devs or whoever showed a great looking game, but delivered something totally different. Yes, the game isn't Dead Space of Uncharted good looking, but if you can get over that the game is just plain fun. I'm sure there were other problems with the game, but I liked the last terminator game, lol I just rented that one, but I thought it was playable.I played on the solder setting. It didn't really say how difficult it would be, but I assumed it was normal mode. I was getting killed over and over in the first stage, but it was like the old school days, where you wouldn't get too frustrated to stop, but just genuinely wanted to keep trying.I haven't played online (since I'm not big for the online portions of games) but I heard it was good. All in all, if your into the Aliens games, you will like this one. We are already used to not getting the best games from the series, but I really think this is one of the better ones.  I wouldn't pay 60 bucks for it, but 20 is a good deal.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2014"}

Lang \"Chris L.\"","summary":"Not perfect, but far better than most.","reviewText":"I'm sure anyone who's reading this review has already read up on this title.  The comparisons to other games (Bioshock, a \"steampunk\" Fallout, etc.) are inevitable.GENERAL:  Dishonored is one of the more polished games that I've played in 2012. While it doesn't innovate,it successfully implements the stealth, action, \"spellcasting\", puzzle solving, and exploration aspects of many of its predecessors.  The story tends to be dark, but you can affect just how dark the ending will be.GAMEPLAY:  Probably the most polar aspect of this game.  There are times when I'm absolutely in love with the controls.  Other times, I'm frustratedly trying to get the \"press A to climb\" prompt to come up.  Combat can be a lot of fun, but wonky controls can get you trapped in a corner occasionally.GRAPHICS:  The art-style is incredibly reminiscent of Brink (which I know was developed by a different company, despite being distributed by Bethesda)...a \"cartoon-ish\", charicaturized realism (imagine the drawings you see done at street fairs, etc...now turn them into a photograph).  No cell-shading, but facial/body features are often exaggerated.  I've run into some texture issues, but overall it's easy to be absorbed by this world.REPLAY:  This is definitely a game that I will play through several times.  First, because it's relatively short...12-15 hours for a fairly direct play-through, double that for explorers/completionists.  Second, it is VERY difficult to build up a \"max level\" player in one playthrough (disclaimer: I have not started my second play-through...so I'm \"assuming\" the second time will be \"new game +\").  Oftentimes, power-ups (runes, charms, etc.) are inaccessible early-on...and you may need power-ups that you don't have in order to get to them.With multiple endings, I'm sure to try many approaches to affect how dark the ending will be.As a 30-something year old married gamer, my budget for this entertainment is a fraction of what it was when I was younger.  That being said, I'm exceptionally careful of my choice in titles.I thoroughly enjoyed this game, and look forward to my next play-throughs.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2012"}

The original Paper Mario came out near the end of the N64 era, so some people just passed it up, big mistake.  The first game had great graphics then, and it had a unique battle system that has been carried over, and improved during the second game.The new updated battle system remains almost the same but now there is a crowd that watches the battle.  Some will throw items at you that harm you while others will throw mushrooms and helpful items. You can choose to hit these people, but don't hit them until youre absolutely sure that it is a dangerous item.  Another new feature is now the ally players have HP, which is, in my opinion, better than what they did in the original.  In the original if your partner got hit, they would be disabled for a limited time.  There's also a slot game called 'Bingo'.  You get 2 cards when you attack, if they are the same, you get to spin the last reel.  Getting a match can raise HP, FP, or Star points, but if you get 3 poison mushrooms, you are harmed.The sequel also carries a new storyline one that doesn't involve Peach getting captured by Bowser.  In fact, there are times you get to play as the Great Koopa King himself.  Some of his levels are designed like the original Mario Bros. with bizarre set ups.  The power up system, which were the Star Spirits in the original, are back too.  You use the magic map to use these spells.  And as usual there's the characters who help along the way with special moves.If you enjoyed the first game, then this is a must have gamecube game.  For the RPG fans out there, this isn't Final Fantasy, but it's still a great RPG.  The only reason that you wouldn't like this game is if you have a extreme hatred towards RPG's.

The very first mistake that they did was make it an On-line ONLY based game.  The game is great in terms of graphics.  The sound is amazing.  The movement is suprisingly fast, depending on your connection, but mine is pretty fast.What makes this game frustrating is that lack of intelligence of those that are playing.  Don't play this game around kids and don't have the blue tooth on.  You'll hear all the cursing and downright raunchy comments made by the guys playing the game.  If you are a novice, like I am, forget it.  I've been \"Voted Out\" by the other players maybe because I wasn't fast enough, or had enough kills and even learning how the game is.  I'm just learning the game.  But, to tell the truth, I don't know if I want to learn the game as much now. Because the levels are just not that interesting.  I like the other games which you had missions to do and you had to converse with your team where to go and what to do.  They did it.  Maybe not right all the time, but you didn't see a whole team running about with no coordination.  Everyone seems to just be going where they please.This game IS a great idea though.  Connecting players everywhere to play a game.  I just think there are parameters that should be built in the game.  Lose the communication.  Useless.  I've heard nonsense.  One guy was singing a song.  Another bragging that he was high and needed to get more booze so he can get really drunk.  I don't want to hear that.  So, what I found myself doing was leaving the BlueTooth on, and just setting it on the counter so I wouldn't hear all the nonsense.  I turned off the ear piece one time and you can here their stupid comments through the speakers with the rest of the game and my kid was in the room!!One thing that I wish that this game had was a level of skill where you can join a game on your skill level.  For example, when you connect to a game, it would automatically put you in a game where all players that are of lower rank would play.  If you were a high rank, it would keep you out, because obviously, you don't belong.  Then as you increase your skills, you graduate to another level where you are teamed with guys on that level, and so on.  That would be much better I think.  Because it seems like no matter what skill level you are, you'll be in the mix with guys that play the game together and will actually KILL YOU if you are not up to their standards.So, I don't really recommend this game at all.  I'm sorry that I purchased it.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2009"}

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone. To help you maximize the potential of this setup, two-player online and offline co-op modes ensure that you have options when picking a partner.Steel yourself Against the Harsh Reality of KijujuAn advanced version of Capcom's proprietary MT Framework game engine brings groundbreaking graphics and effects to Kijuju, the highly-developed environment where this game's action takes place. New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"David Stone","summary":"Collection your thing","reviewText":"A FPS maybe, it seems more of a puzzle solver to me.

It has great graphics, fairly smooth framerate, and solid controls.  The story is interesting, and the boss battles are decent.And now the problems.  First, the game is really short.  I think I finished the game in under 8 hours.  There are only 4 bosses and you fight the flying fox twice.  The cutscenes seemed almost as long as the actual playtime.  The game is also pretty easy-I think I died twice the entire game and that was during boss battles.  It is mostly a button masher, but I really liked using the tilt controls for guiding arrows and cannon balls.  Finally, there is really no replay value.  Once you finish the game, hell mode is unlocked, but I really didn't want to play through the same levels again even if they were more difficult.  There is no way this game is worth full price.

From the outset, you know you're in a Fallout game when you stumble from your shallow grave, past the doctor who nurses you back to health, and almost immediately into a conflict between a gang and the townsfolk. Old hands such as the Van Graffs, the Khans, and the NCR are major players, and who can forget the Brotherhood of Steel? But new to the field are the Three Families of New Vegas, The Legion of Caesar, and Mr. House, the invisible iron fist of Vegas.Graphics and audio are Fallout 3. Thats really all that can be said. Facial features are slightly better, and there are much better long distance vistas, but otherwise, this is exactly what you're expecting. Voices are a bit better delivered, and side conversations are a touch more realistic, but otherwise its the same as usual, which isn't a bad thing.Gameplay is straight out of Fallout 3. New perks, new stat boosts and new weapons manage to change up some of the strategy, but overall there's nothing that'll really throw veterans for a loop. Armor plays a much bigger role, and makes combat a tad more tedious, but once you hit your stride there's little that'll stop you cold outside of stumbling into a Deathclaw pride. Welcome additions are reloading benches and campfires. Although a little sparsely placed, these help immensively with inventory management. Sick of having 1000 rounds of 9mm when you use a 10mm? If you have shells for 10mm, break down one to make the other. Also added is Hardcore mode, which adds sleep, food, and drink as crucial factors to consider. This makes the wasteland far more unforgiving, and forces you to pick up every scrap of material, as you'll need it all to boil water, purfiy food, and otherwise survive to make it to the next quest.And quests there are. While wandering among 20 \"travelers\" and \"wastelanders\" and \"gamblers\" to find the sole person with a name is frustrating in the extreme, the problem is not as blatant as in Fallout 3, and there are far more people you are able to interact with. And side quests are all named, and you'll eventually find yourself so deluged with quests that it'll be reminiscent of Oblivion. The quests flow far better, and even \"unmarked\" quests manage to be well documented.There are quite a few bugs and flaws though. Clipping errors aside, there are lots of quest flaws, making it impossible to finish certain missions despite doing everything right. Terrain isn't modeled as well on your Pip-Boy, meaning you can get stuck easiyl trying to make it over a ridge, not knowing you have to walk 5 miles south to find a crossing. Certain areas are almost totally inaccesible despite being part of the main storyline. And while I understand the need to have quest key doors at certain times, too many doors are permanently locked with no descrinable way to open them. A vault door I can understand, but a simple locked wood door? Which is odd since almost every quest has both a sneaky smart way as well as a brute force way to get for point A to B. Companions, while insanely useful, are walking dead men, as there is no \"Retreat!\" command, meaning your helper charges straight to their death almost immediately. Lastly, theres the standing issue of you aggro everything on sight, so you are frequently running for your life while your companion fights every fight as the Alamo.Overall, this is a few patches away from being borderline perfect. Great, fun quests, scenery more varied that just miles of ruins, great dialogue thats bitter and funny, and gameplay thats getting better but still winds up pretty loaded by the end. I've always been of the opinion that Fallout x The Elder Scrolls = Happy, and this pretty much proves it. If not for Bethesda releasing a game that desperately needs to be patched, and already dangling DLC for the following month (meaning they removed content from this game to sell right after the buying frenzy), this would be 5 and 5 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2010"}

Ever since the first TR for the PC and PSX, Lara's gone though some painful transitions w/a lot of forgettable titles for the PSX, PS2 and XBox. This Raider, on the other hand, made me cheer for Lara - something Ive never done for her before. Square got it right this time.They finally gave Lara a heart and personality. She gets her butt kicked around so much in this game it's hard to watch but equally moving to see her triumph from a naive girl at the start to a assault-rifle wielding powerhouse in the end.Square Enix developed a breathtaking island world in TR. Mesmerizing tree foliage, mists, and glistening, rolling water create a beautiful world. The combat is fluid, challenging and fun. You can take out thugs stealthily or balls out, guns blazing (or flaming arrows). There are lots of upgrades to skills and weapons, so you always have a reason to explore and find all the hidden stuff to earn skill pts and upgrades. Raider takes about 25 hours to finish.Sounds, supporting characters and cinematography are a blast to watch and hear. The developers used lots of different camera angles to create drama in the action scenes. This pulls the gamer into the world and makes you feel like you're controlling a person in a movie.You'll love every moment of TR. There aren't any boring points.

But although it comes in a small package, this is a full-fledged game that stands on its own. With an all-new, deep story that approaches the familiar sights and sounds of the infamous Liberty City from a different perspective, an innovative control system and multiplayer options,Chinatown Warscaptures the tone and flavors of the long-runningGTAseries in unique ways that both longtime players and those coming to it for the first time will find hard to put down..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Grand Theft Auto:Chinatown WarsPlayers:Offline: 1; Online: 2Gameplay Modes:Single player; competitive &amp; coop multiplayer via Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.Kick some tail as Huang Lee.View larger.Use the DS stylus like never before.View larger.Reconquer Liberty via PDA.View larger.The Story: Left for Dead in the Worst Place in AmericaFollowing his father&rsquo;s murder, Huang Lee is given what seems a simple mission: to deliver an ancient sword to his Uncle Kenny to ensure his family retains control of the Triad gangs of Liberty City. Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement. While driving players also have access to five in-game radio stations and use of their weapons. Your PDA provides efficient management tools for your growing crime empire, including quick weapons switching, a running total of available cash, in-game e-mail and Internet access and nearly instant game saves any time. The control scheme inChinatown Warsutilizes an easy to use and comfortable to play combination of steering via the D-pad, choice of action through the face buttons and/or stylus taps and manual and automatic weapon locks and unlocks via shoulder buttons.Key Game Features:The Largest DS Game Ever- Contemporary Liberty City is a massive world complete with pedestrians, weather and traffic patterns, five different radio stations and four different sprawling boroughs to explore.Endless Gameplay- Mature storyline with over 70+ story missions; plus dozens of side quests, collectibles, contextual mini-games and the all new mission replay feature.Street Economics- Addictive drug dealing side game with 6 different drug types, 80+ drug dealers and a supply / demand driven narcotics economy.Play with Friends- Nintendo Wi-Fi mode for head-to-head and co-op multiplayer mayhem.Bragging Rights- Chat, trade guns and commodities with your friends, and compete for glory via online tournaments and leaderboards on the Rockstar Games Social Club.PDA Interface- Use the touch screen as a PDA device to set GPS waypoints, change radio stations, communicate via e-mail with in-game characters and order weapons on the Internet.Online Bragging Rights and MultiplayerCare has been taken to ensure that players can share theirChinatown Warsexperiences with friends and fellow players in different ways.

The GPS featured in the game is less helpful for this.  The city is extensive with numerous building establishments, businesses, parks, tolls booths, clubs, stores for lottery scratch cards, gas stations, and even boating activity.The storyline is captivating where your character is following a time line of avenging his father's death, while assisting members of the 'organization' to win power struggles.  When on an assignment, you are directed to carry out missions which are quite elaborate - fighting, killing, protecting characters, rescuing and illicit pharmaceutical sales.Sound is good for a hand held platform with voices, sound effects, and music.  The soundtrack is original and adds to the ambiance of the game.  The graphics are detailed and there is a lot of attention to detail with regards to the surroundings.  You can interact with many of the items in one way or another.Game play is accomplished through the use of the keypad and buttons for navigation, fighting, and shooting.  The touchscreen is used to carry out tasks of hotwiring cars, vandalizing cars, making Molotov cocktails, accessing the PDA/email.  The interface is good but navigation with the cars are, at times, awkward since orientation changes frequently.  Vehicle physics is realistic with regards to large/small vehicles and boats.  It is quite unusual that you can run and catch up to a moving car on a freeway.  There is a shop where you can buy cars but you can carjack any vehicle that is slow enough for you to catch up with by running.  I find it unusual that police always try to harass me while driving my taxi (my main source of income in the game) - is it art imitating life? I don't know.  I also find it unusual that the walking police officers are always beating up citizens in the game (I don't know if this is a feature in preceding games of Grand Theft Auto but I thought it was odd).  Gameplay can be masochistic with Rampage mode where you destroy all gangsters vehicles with a flamethrower and burn your enemies.  You can set a bug to track your enemie's car or even set a bomb.  There are sexual references in the game, also.  This game has a lot of depth to the detail of tasks and characters with which you interact.  It will keep you occupied for a very long time.Fighting is facilitated with various weapons including your fist, guns, machine guns, Billy Clubs, crashing vehicles and Molotov Cocktails.What contributes to the realism is the ability to raise funds by working as a taxi driver, delivery person, pharmaceutical sales, working at a tattoo parlor, occasional robberies, and completing major tasks.  Money is so hard for me to come by, in the game, that I predominantly work as a fireman, taxi driver or sell downers/marijuana to 'dealers' (the cost of other pharmaceuticals is too much to pay for).This game can take many weeks to explore the various mini-games, missions and exploring.Overall, this is great game for adults in this role playing game.  It has excellent attention to detail and replay value.  This has to be one of the best games for the DS/DSi Platform.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2009"}

The download content is also great if you want more.However the gameplay was either too hard or too easy.  Even with the 5 skill level, the game just seemed to be too large a jump in skill levels.  The speed the notes come and the notice you get before they were even on medium makes the game very hard unless you learn and memorize the songs.Also unlike Rockband, you can not simply add older games songs into the library of music.  That was a huge selling point for me since we want as many songs as possible.The slider was pretty cool for the guitar but does not get much use.  Its kind of a gimmick IMO and not really needed.The graphics were not as good as Rockband either nor is setting up to play.  It felt like it took a lot longer to select songs and play.  Though the graphics do not matter much for a game like this, being able to get into a game quick with friends is critical.Overall not a bad game but just not as good as I had hoped.

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Bump in the night...","reviewText":"I don't usually play the Resident Evil games.  Why? Because I always got killed by a zombie that I couldn't see!  Capcom is justly famous for its useless camera angles, but not so with Resident Evil 4.  The camera stays in one postition; over-the-shoulder for better aiming.When I heard that this game was the best looking game on the GameCube (or any console), I had to play it.  And I wasn't disaapointed!Leon S. Kennedy (who first appeared in Resident Evil 2) is on a mission to save Ashley, daughter of the President of the United States.  His search takes him to a small village in Spain, where people attack him to say \"Hello\".  The first thing about this game is that you don't fight zombies.  You are fighting living, breathing people that want to kill you in ways that'll make any Mel Gibson movie jealous.Ashley isn't the only character in the game.  Luis, a local,  helps you on your way.

You take on the role of a commander of a US Navy Seal Platoon of 4.  You are given various missions to complete in many different areas of the world.  This game will really give you an appreciation for how the seals have to work.  To complete your mission, you must use stealth, speed, and accuracy.  In some missions, if you don't kill the other gaurds within 5 seconds of killing the first gaurd your mission practically ends.  How do you control a seal platoon you ask?  Well, there is one of 2 ways.  You can use the included headset for voice commands or you can issue commands through your controller.  This is the only PS2 game to currently use a headset.  What happenes if one of your team dies?  Don't worry.  As a seal rule, no man gets left behind.  While it may seem like your guy has been killed, he has only been critically wounded.  Once you complete your mission, he will return to duty status with full health.  What will make you appreciate what the seals do, however, is that the missions you receive are very similar to missions that an actual seal platoon would receive.  While I can't really explain the gameplay enough to emphasize its greatness, I can say that it is very similar to Counter-strike, only better.  There is a online multi-player mode in addition to the 17 single-player missions.  NOTE: The online mode is BROADBAND ONLY.  Any dial-up users will be unable to play online.  In multi-player games, you may also choose to be on the terrorist side instead of the Seal side.  While you don't have command of 3 other platoon members in multi-player, you can use your headset to talk to your teammates and set up strategies.There are 4 different preset controller combinations, all very well suited to the game.  The graphics are astonishingly realistic from the gunshot blast to the moving of brush as you walk through it.  The sound is incredible.  There is no music (the game is intended to be similar to a real-life seal mission) but throughout the game you will notice things like chirping bugs and birds.  The gunshots even sound realistic.  The framerate never experiences slowdown, even in multi-player (even though there is sometimes lag during a multi-player game).  I found only one thing wrong, and that was that there is no indication of how injured you are in multiplayer.Overall, this is an excellently done game.  It has no recognizable flaws and has an excellent online multi-player mode.  The addition of a headset makes for ease of gameplay and allows the player to feel more like they are in the game.  This is definately worth the money.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2002"}

I'm not saying that it's good or bad, it's just one giant deathmatch.  If you love large scale first person shooters where you can play against a lot of other people, this is your game and you should buy it right away.  If you want a game with levels, saves, CGI movies, coop levels, this doesn't really have any of that.The game consists of two groups - Empire versus Rebels for half the game, Republic versus the Separatists in the other half with about 200 to 250 people per side.  The battlefield is a medium sized field on different planets with different terrains (forest, beach, desert, ice), the vehicles, of which you control, range from simple speeder to huge Imperial walkers.  You control one soldier in a battle until you die, then you respawn and continue the battle.  You win the battle by killing all the enemies or capturing their respawn points.  The only other control you have is that you can order a few nearby soldier to follow you or stay put.  Pretty simple and straightforward.The single level mode is basically a series of battles, either following the timeline of original Star Wars trilogy or the prequels, or through a galactic conquest sequence that you invade planets and expand an empire.  Either way, it's just a flimsy excuse to get to the battle.  There is also a split screen mode, but it really is just the same battle.The main part is the multi player online portion, where you participate with a large number of others.  The online portions still suffer from some of the normal online difficulties of this current game system generation.

AWESOME","reviewText":"Here's the gist: You plug a real guitar into your Xbox and play along with some great rock songs, the game scaling the difficulty up or down depending on your abilities.That in and of itself is a pretty cool idea and for those interested in playing a real instrument makes this a step up fromRock Band 2.Yet simple ideas are also the easiest to botch.They don't botch this one. Rocksmith is essentially a guitar teacher in a box, walking beginners through all the basic concepts while also providing experienced guitar players with a fun way to learn how to play the included songs. A simple tutorial gets folks up and running. Experienced Rock Band players will need a song or two to adjust to the slightly different visuals, but once that clicks you're off and running.The very best feature is how the games adjusts to your experience. I am a more experienced guitar player than my son, for instance, so it didn't take long before it was asking me to play note-for-note covers of The Rolling Stones, The Black Keys, Silversun Pickups, and more. He's newer at the guitar, and the game automatically adjusted to that, giving him more stripped down versions that still had him playing along but in an \"only the basics\" kind of way.The game is a little more challenging than your standard music rhythm game. If you've never held a guitar this might not be the best place to start. However, even newbies to the guitar should catch on pretty fast -- and they might even benefit.In addition to the usual shtick of playing through a career and unlocking all sorts of guitar gear, the game also provided a slew of mini games, many of which are essentially guitar practice sessions to help you master various techniques.Rocksmith falls into the category of music rhythm games, yes, but it's an evolution of the genre, providing players a great blend of gaming and actual musicianship. A great bridge between playing games and playing instruments. I love it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2012"}

A roster of more than 40 WWE superstars are yours to get into the squared circle with, either through the Exhibition mode or through the newly designed Season mode.  In Season Mode, you can take on the WWE Superstars to progress through a original storyline that finds you challenging for titles, being challenged by various Superstars for the right to take their Diva away from them, earn cash to buy items in the Shopzone area, and more.New features include new unlockable legend Superstars (though why The Rock is one of them is a little odd...), the new Parking Lot Brawl (where you can use the cars that surround you as weapons), a Ringout Meter (during the Royal Rumble, this meter will decrease as someone tries to eliminate you from the match, or as you try to eliminate them, and refills if you succeed in an elimination), actual voice commentary from all the Superstars, Jim Ross and Jerry \"The King\" Lawler from Raw, Michael Cole and Tazz from SmackDown!, a new ability to create your own Championship, a new Online mode that also allows you to defend a created Championship, the ability to fight either fair or dirty, a revamped Bra and Panty Match system, the new Challenge Mode where completing certain objectives in Exhibition Mode will earn you more cash, and moreThe only downsides are that several of the Superstars that we would have wanted in the game are nowhere to be found (Good if you are a Molly Holly fan since she has FINALLY been added to the series, bad if you are a Gail Kim fan since she isn't in the game).  Additionally, Kurt Angle is the SmackDown GM in the game, even though he was fired from that position and returned to the active roster a while back.  You would think that the programmers would have noticed this a while back.All in all, this is definitely the game for those in your circle of friends/family/acquaintances who have a serious WWE bug with no cure in sight...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2004"}
{"product_name":"B001AWDFUY","description":"007 Quantum of Solace PS3","reviewerName":"J. Urban \"U2fan4ever76\"","summary":"Bond Is Back In A Great Game","reviewText":"I've played many of the various Bond games over the years and some were great and others mediocre, but \"James Bond 007: Quantum of Solace\" is one of the best to hit consoles. It is a first person shooter, but shifts to a third person perspective when you seek out cover or are climbing, etc. There is no confusion and the cover system is one of the better ones I have seen, allowing you to move from one cover point to another with a quick movement.The game starts out where the movie \"Casino Royale\" ended and you start playing as Bond in an extended scene at that mansion at the end of the film. The game takes liberties throughout with the story from both films, but for the most part, they extend or \"flesh-out\" scenes that were referred to in the movies or just seem to make sense in the game (except the \"Opera level\").You'll first notice the graphics are very sharp; Daniel Craig looks just like Daniel Craig. The attention to detail of the settings and characters is top notch all the way. There were very few times I thought the graphics didn't look next-gen and mainly those were because they were levels set at night. All of the particle effects and reflections and everything that makes next-gen so great, are there.The sound is great with the weapon sounds appropriate for the weapons and of course the musical score featured much of the two movies' soundtracks and also featured new music.The enemy AI was pretty good, and on default difficulty, it forced me to play smart and use cover instead of just running in and shooting. The takedowns were neat in the beginning, but there are only a few variations and by the time you are half-way through, they seem more like a gimmick than an actual necessity. Many of the enemies you really had to sneak up on in order to perform a takedown. Others you could by running into them from around a corner. I preferred using the weapons and environment to my advantage, though when doing something cool like a Bond move (i.e. blowing up barrels to kill a group of bad guys) there was no Bond music or indication you really did something cool, like in past Bond games. (Many of these Bond moments are shown on screen by reflecting objects you can shoot with a resulting action, so you don't really have to think like Bond--just look for the shining interactive objects.The levels are divided amongst scenes from \"Casino Royale\" and \"Quantum of Solace\", with, frankly, most of the really enjoyable levels being from the better of the two films: \"Casino Royale.\" The levels are also in no order and jump from movie to movie, making it a little confusing as to the timeframe. Also, the levels are a little too linear with not many alternate routes, if any.There was only minor slowdown and occasional choppiness, really nothing to spoil the game.The game is about 10-12 hours, if you take your time. Some may beat it quicker in the 8-9 hour timeframe. Multiplayer makes up for the somewhat quick playthrough. Also, there are bonus areas on the blu-ray where you can view concept art and other miscellaneous info about production--all standard fare.Overall, this is a great edition to the Bond games and clearly above average. If you like FPS's and Bond, this is a no brainer!4/5 starsPros:*10-12+ hrs. of gameplay.*Great graphics for the character models and levels.*Nice selection of weapons and using the PDA is pretty fun.*Most levels are constructed quite well and make you feel like you are in the movies.*Controls are solid.*It has the best scenes from both of the Bond movies it is based on.*Enemy AI is good.*Sound is good.*Has some replayability value due to just the overall fun factor (and trophy support).Cons:*Levels, while graphically sharp, are a bit too linear.*Enemy AI is not consistent and on default difficulty it can sometimes be too hard.*A few glitches and slowdown.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2009"}

Are you a fan of Castlevania games? If you are, you will really like this game. If you have not played a castlevania game before then consider this a beautiful gothic-dark fantasy 3rd person action adventure game with vampires and werewolves that you will probably like a lot. This is very far from a generic god of war clone as some will say. From a castlevania fan's point of view this is an amazing game. The visuals are amazing. The characters models and the environment are full of detail, the scenery is always something to stare at and the special effects are colorful and vibrant as they should. There is a huge variety of environments so nothing seems as if you've seen it before. The sound is crystal with an awesome orchestrical soundtrack (typical castlevania quality) and the voice-overs featuring Patrick Stewart and Robert Carlyle speak for themselves. The gameplay is excellent. It combines fighting, platforming, puzzle-solving together and it's varied enough that never bores. The fighting itself is deep and rewarding. No more mindless button mashing. The game is very immersive and features a beautiful story. Another big plus for this game is its length. I don't remember the last time I played a 3rd person action game that lasted up to 20 hours for a single playthrough. Quite honestly I don't understand what people want in a game any more. This is a beautiful game apparently made with love and care (cheesy but true) and every attention to detail as possible from people who really like the original castlevania games. Yet you will see reviews talking about how it doesn't feel like a castlevania game (not true IMHO) or how it borrows elements from other games.

The flow of combat is horrible: pauses all the time in mid-fight, sometimes you cannot draw your weapon, camera angles are from behind trees, new radial menu is super confusing. That aside, just getting around is less fun too: left stick will do some damage to your thumb as you spend an hour trudging through snow, the Full Sync requirements are too OCD for me to even think about replaying levels to get them (got them in AC2). The story does build nicely around the War and you get to upgrade your own house again.

Sacred 2 is a good game but after about 20 hours invested a bug corrupted my character (which is fairly common as I understand it). This happened twice. Being a console gamer I had only dabbled with the original Diablo when I was younger but during that time I wasn't heavily into ARPGs, not like I am now anyways. Sacred 2 gave me the ARPG bug so I had to find something. I always see ARPGs being compared to Diablo 2 so I decided to step out of my console comfort zone and give it a whirl. The good news - this game is addicting as ever and definitely scratches the itch. The bad news - this game is addicting as ever and I can't put it down!Despite being around 10 years old $30-$40 for the Battle Chest is an absolute steal. You get all the Diablo goodness you could want including the original Diablo, Diablo 2, the LoD (Lord of Destruction) expansion and a surprisingly useful strategy guide. This is potentially thousands of hours worth of gaming if you're an ARPG-aholic. Of course if that's the case then you've probably played this game to death. For those of us who were living in the dark or who are mostly console gamers like me - read on.Before I dig into the game I'd like to comment on the usefulness of the included strategy guide. When I first bought the Battle Chest I figured the strategy guide might be useful for a complete beginner and that it would soon become useless as I learned the ins and outs of the game. Not true. This guide includes nice detailed descriptions for every skill in the game as well as which ones are the most useful in general and which ones are useful for multiplayer (and which ones aren't all that useful). This is great because it allows you to dig through the guide and plan out a character build. It's actually really fun just to dig through the guide and try to come up with different build ideas. This part of the guide will stay relevant for as long as you play this game or at least until you can memorize every skill in the game! Something I'll never be able to do. Also the author of this guide has a good writing style. 5/5 for the guide. Other goodies in the guide include a walk-through, a catalog of all the baddies with their details, tips from the pros and more.Now the meat of this set - Diablo 2: LoD. I have to admit, I haven't played all the way through the original Diablo but most people aren't purchasing this set for the original. It's great that it's included and I do plan on playing through it eventually. That being said - this review will be more focused on Diablo 2: LoD. Note: you should go ahead and install Diablo 2 with the LoD expansion. You get all the great stuff from the original Diablo 2 plus all the goodies from LoD.Here, let me get the sound, graphics and story part out of the way real fast...Being around 10 years old we can't expect stellar graphics by today's standards. I still find them to be great though. They aren't high res or anything but things like spells still look great. The dungeons are randomized so they had to use generic environments which do get a bit repetitive. I do love the hand-drawn look. I did play Baldurs Gate on the PC way back and like those games Diablo 2 uses an isometric perspective. Your character does change visually depending on what you wear and wield.The sounds are good. Clinks and clanks all sound good, monsters sound good and the music is great. The voice acting is average most of the time.I don't like to give anything away story-wise but I have to say this one is rather basic. Nothing real epic here but it's not terrible.You're not buying this game for amazing graphics or anything like that. You're buying this game because you want a great APRG and this game delivers wildly beyond my original expectations. It's no wonder the community is still active and there are plenty of people still addicted even 10 years later.The beauty of this game is in its simple no-nonsense approach to character builds. ARPGs these days try to do way too much with the genre and ultimately bog down the game. D2: Lod is much simpler. You choose a character, you pick a handful of the many skills they possess and focus on leveling those skills up. It's really not wise to try and level up all skills because towards the middle of the game you will have a lot of low-level skills but they will all be very weak - so it's best to get an idea of the type of character for your chosen class, pick some skills that sound interesting to you and run with that (this is where the included strategy guide is extremely helpful!).With a total of 7 characters and each character having a robust skill tree (each character has unique skills) the possibilities seem endless. There has to be at least a few hundred skills total and most of them are useful in one way or another. The skills are great because you can actually see a lot of them in action - it's not usually a simple buff up - you're summoning things, pummeling things, shooting chain lightning spells - things like that. With each level-up you get to assign a handful of points to your attributes (strength, agility...etc) and you get to assign a skill point. This makes leveling up a joy because you really get the sense that your character has improved. Each and every point really makes a difference. As far as I know you can level up each skill as much as you want provided you have the skill points to do so. So essentially if you wanted to you could invest in a single skill and by level 30 your one skill could be at level 30 (plus maybe a few more if you find skill books) That one skill would be insanely powerful but your character would be very narrow. The other extreme would be to level up a different skill with each level you gain (more skills become available as you level up by the way). Your character would be extremely versitile but also very weak. The goal is to find a happy medium between these extremes with the skills that work for your character idea.Of course what would an ARPG be without a bunch of different weapons, armor types and other trinkets? D2: LoD definitely delivers here and then some. There has to be thousands of different types of weapons/armor in this game - maybe even tens of thousands of possibilities. There are a slew of amulets, rings and charms you can carry to help buff your character up as well. There are weapons and armor that have sockets (up to 6 slots) that allow you to insert gems and the like. Some of these gems are very powerful indeed! In short there is no shortage of goodies in this game - the possibilities really are staggering.The gameplay itself is relatively simple but highly addicting. You have a sash that carries potions (health, mana, antidote - things like that), which is mapped to your 1-4 numerical keys (you'll quaff a lot of potion) and your skills are mapped to your F keys (F1 - F8 for each mouse button so 16 total hot keys). Well not entirely true you can map scrolls and a few other actions as well but most will use the F keys for their skills. Some skills are passive and are constantly activated as long as it's your active skill and some are more active - like spells and offensive skills. You can map both mouse buttons. So for example you can assign your left button to an attack and your right button to a skill and you use the F keys to switch between the skills. There's a lot of frantic clicking but if you like to use different strategies for one character you can easily map everything so you can switch between different combat/defense strategies real quickly. Also worth mentioning is you can carry two different weapons/shield combos at the same time and easily switch between the two in real time using the W key (default). This allows you to come up with many interesting combat strategies.This game might seem like a simple point click at first but it can get quite deep, especially on higher difficulties where you need to use more strategy. As far as hack and slash action goes this game has virtually no negatives to speak of - not for me anyways. Some may create a simple barbarian who charges the field using powerful offensive skills. Others may prefer the sorceress and choose to invest in the different elemental magic skills ready for battles against all the different elements. Or maybe some will have a character that wields a powerful sword/shild as well as a bow so they can pick off enemies from afar and charge them when they need to (which is easily done thanks to being able to instantly swap between 2 different weapons/shield combos). The limit is your imagination and no game pulls this off better then Diablo 2.The game still not intense enough for you? Well, try hardcore mode and bring your character online. Normally when you die it's a bit inconvenient because if you have high quality goodies then you have to battle your way back to your corpse so you can retrieve them (good thing you kept backup goodies in your chest - didn't you?). You also have to rehire any hirelings you might have and you have to pay gold for your death. This is painful enough but for you truly obscene players you can try hardcore. In this mode when you die you die. You lose your character forever, your loot - everything! That should keep the battles tense enough for you! I've only played a little bit of a character on hardcore. Right now it's still scary for me because you can end up flushing many hours of invested time right down the toilet. I must say it definitely adds an \"oh crud this really matters!\" layer to the game and I'm sure many players wouldn't have it any other way.Another cool feature is the random maps. Yes they will all feel similar from game to game but they are random which means you can't just breeze through the game knowing where everything is located - that would be boring! The maps are randomized once for each single player game and randomized every multiplayer game. So if you clear half a dungeon then quit when you go back to that dungeon your minimap will reveal which part was already discovered and the dungeon will not be re-randomized (single player). The random map generator in this game does a great job creating nice maps - nothing stupid like the next level of the dungeon being 10 feet from where you started.Before I write a book for a review I want to mention inventory management. Some people may hate this but you are quite limited on inventory space. You have your character and a chest to keep loot in - neither one providing ample space. I personally love this because the game forces you to really think about what you need to survive - it gives the game even more strategy. A few items like chest-keys and certain potions stack and there are a few options to lighten your inventory like scroll tomes that allow you to store many scrolls in one tome. Mid-game you get a nice item that gives you 8 additional squares of space which doesn't seem like much but in this game it's a godsend. Eventually you will be careful about what you loot and you won't just grab everything you see. Some games allow you to carry a rediculous amount of loot making it a chore digging through all of it figuring out what you want to sell. Also worth mentioning is when items drop the labels are color coded based on rarity so it becomes easier to sift over the loot before picking it up. You don't just pick up everything in sight and then spend an hour going through all of it - with this game it becomes easy to know what you really want to pick up.There are a few small negatives I could mention but they are real nit-picky. There aren't really that many quests as most are geared for the storyline. Also you don't know the value of your loot until you go to sell it. There are probably a few other small things I could whine about too. This is really being nit-picky though and the positives FAR outweigh the negatives.Look, I could keep going into all the fine details of this game but this review has to end at some point. This game is easy to pick up and learn but at the same time it's very deep and engaging. You aren't bogged down with all the fluff like you are with recent games. I can't believe I didn't play this game years ago but I'm happy I didn't! Now I get to experience all of its greatness! I can safely say that even being 10 years old and me just coming into it recently - this may be one of the best games I've ever played and it's certainly the best ARPG I've played. This game is balanced perfectly between depth and ease of use. The replay value in this game is amazing! No wonder so many people have invested hundreds if not thousands of hours in this game! Be warned though - you may have a lot of tired days at work from staying up so late playing this insanely addictive game. Don't say I didn't warn you!Oh man! it's already 10:00 at night! If I start now I can get 4 hours of playtime and still get 4 hours of sleep... bye!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2009"}

I love Dead Rising 2 specifically Off the Record. The zombies in this game really grab you unlike DR2. Also, the survivors are extremely hard to save because the zombies 'trap' and surround them a lot. For those who never played this game, understand that it uses a lot of dark humor and you can't save the game whenever you want so save often! It's a simple game that's very challenging. If you want to beat the game easily, you need to get the shotgun. You will need to get a katana first to beat the boss guarding the shotguns. He's easy. Just use a katana and slice him continuously behind the bench. He will throw you but slicing him behind the counter prevents you from getting hit by his shotgun for some strange reason. To level up, you need to save survivors who are really bad at avoiding zombies so you will need to help out quite often unlike DR2. The controls in the game prevent me from giving it 5 stars like DR2. The controls are bad and really complicated. Glad they fixed it in 2. I recommend going to options and changing the AIM to 'Camera Angle' instead of 'Player Angle.' This will help a lot. If you want challenging, simple, and fun, this and Dead Rising 2: Off the Record is it","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00000JRSB","reviewerName":"Midnight Distortions \"Cloud\"","summary":"An Epic Adventure! Definatly ONE of the greatest games EVER made!","reviewText":"Its been a decade since this game has been released & all i can say is 'wow'. This game gets soo much praise (and well blasphemy too) & even has been hailed as 'Quite Possibly The Greatest Game Ever Made', however that's not possible, only to those who think this is the greatest game ever made. But i urge people to try this game out, despite the outdated graphics & no voice overs.You start off as a mercenary, an Ex-Soldier named Cloud who is working with a group named 'Avalanche', a team of members who infiltrates Shin-Ra's biggest Mako city, Midgar. Mako is destroying the planet & Avalanche (known as hippies or treehuggers) is trying to stop that from happening. What Cloud doesn't realize is he's closer to Shin-Ra then he thinks. And a mysterious man known as Sephiroth suddenly attacks Midgar after a tragic event that took place in..Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VIICloud must search for this man as he deals with Shin-Ra & the Turks. All while he tries not to lose his sanity.Ok in my opinion the best way to un-cover this story is to play the first half of Crisis Core (until you reach Nibelheim) then start playing FFVII (this game) until after you get past the part where you find out about Zack.  Then go back to Crisis Core, beat that then finish FFVII.  It doesn't really matter what game you play first & vise versa but if you play this game all the way through it pretty much spoils the ending for Crisis Core.  Although i still think it was exciting to see the ending in higher graphic quality i just knew what was going to happen.Anyways on with the review..Story 10/10:The story for this game is superb, although it lacks a few minor details that not even Crisis Core reveals it still has one of my favorite story-lines in the entire history of videogames or movies. I do recommend you play this game before Crisis Core (before Nibelheim) just because Crisis Core reveals what really happens to Cloud & then this game won't really keep you interested. Besides that though i really think this game is still considered one of the best!Graphics 6/10:The graphics for this game was superb when it first came out. No one still really cared too much about them yet & Square really showed them off for this game (this game was originally in production for the N64) except for the fact that you have blocks as hands! I believe the main game for the N64 wasn't completely scrapped as they were trying to make this for that system but then realized the potential of having CG clips for the PlayStation they went with that system instead. So for those wondering why the graphics look so cartoony in this one, im pretty sure thats your answer. The CG movies still look amazing for the ps1, granted that Square got better at it with FFVIII. Either way, Square is trying to get the original team from this game to pull off a grand remake (to make this game look REALLY NICE) which is still in question, however they have other games they're working on nowGameplay 7/10:Well, lets just say that its not hard but its not easy, of course the actual battles are fairly simple if you know what your doing. And leveling up your characters & materia are the only main factors you have to worry about in progressing in the game.  The problem with moving your character around is that your fumbling around with the directional sometimes because its not quite calibrated right. Or its just the camera view, however its annoying at times.Music/Sound (10/10):I enjoyed the music from this game, i still think it's one of the best ones Square did. Everything from the Bombing mission to Cid's theme this game has it done perfectly! Another good reason why Square wanted this game on the PlayStation, crystal clear stereo sound!Concept 6/10:While it took me several times to go through the game (and beat it) which for some people who don't understand the story will have to play it through a few times. The thing that people get most confused on is the materia setup.  While it was easy for me to grasp some people were like 'huh!?!?' It's like trying to teach a cat how to drive.  I thought this concept was easier then some of the FF games that came out after this one.  But yet again, easy for some, hard for others.Replay Value 10/10:Personally i think this game should have had a new game+ function (where you can go through the game again with stats, materia, items ect.  But maybe if Square gets a remake going they'll throw that function in. Only because i never get tired of this game & its one game that does deserve a remake.Overall, i did give this a full 5 star rating only because i still think this game is the best, despite its problems. And for those who haven't yet check out Crisis Core as well, great prequel to this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00BGA9YZK","description":"","reviewerName":"Courtney L. Osborn","summary":"Not What I Wanted, But Still Very Fun","reviewText":"Intro:Killzone: Shadow Fall is a launch title for the PlayStation 4 worldwide.  North America and Europe saw the game released on November 15th and 29th respectively and Japan will see it on February 22, 2014.  Killzone is a science fiction first-person shooter video game series developed by Guerilla Games that dates back to the PlayStation 2 in 2004.  This is the fourth game in the series to be released on a home console.I have said many times before and will say many times again: I am getting a little burnt out on first-person shooters.  I played through Killzone 1-3 earlier this year and came away from it more pleased than I had predicted I would.  Though not great, Killzone is a solid shooter franchise so I was pretty excited going into Shadowfall.Story:Shadow Fall takes place many years after the events in Killzone 3.  Helghan is uninhabitable due to the &#8220;terracide,&#8221; so the humans and Helghast formed a treaty that would allow the Helghast survivors to take refuge on the planet Vekta by colonizing half of the planet.  A giant wall is built to separate the Helghast and the ISA from each other (Berlin Wall anybody?).  This wall however does not completely separate them as they continually sneak over to try and finish the war started on Helghan.You play as Lucas Kellan, a human civilian from the planet Vekta.  After witnessing a traumatic event as a child while leaving the Helgast part of the planet, Lucas grows up and joins the ISA Shadow Marshals.  Lucas and the Shadow Marshals have to protect the Vektan civilians from the Helghast threat such as terrorist attacks performed by the &#8220;Black Hand.&#8221;Most first-person shooters struggle to have a compelling storyline.  They focus so much on having great gameplay mechanics that often the story in the game falls short.  This is exactly the case for Shadow Fall.  Guerilla Games established a GREAT premise and setting for the game but was never able to completely realize the potential the story could have had which left it lackluster.  Everything was so similar to the Cold War in Germany that this really could have shined had they fleshed it out more.  On top of this, they added some absolutely ridiculous sections to the story that just did not seem to fit in the game at all.  In fact, they made the story suffer even worse for it.Presentation:This graphics are where Shadow Fall is at its best.  This is one of the most visually appealing games I have ever seen and reminds me of the Crysis games.  Guerilla Games took the game to a new world with a whole new color palette.  Gone are the days of only using different shades of gray for environments.  There is now sunlight, grass, forests, water, trees, and snow.  Planet Vekta is absolutely gorgeous during certain sections of the game, such as scaling a mountain and looking down below.Gameplay:For the most part, Shadow Fall is exactly like the previous Killzone games when it comes to its gameplay mechanics.  Most guns are similar as well with a few new ones here and there that you will barely even notice.  The main difference with the shooting mechanics comes with how it is accessed on the controller.  The PlayStation 4 has new L2 and R2 buttons which are now more like triggers than ever before.  Shadow Fall was the first shooter I was able to use them on and I came away extremely pleased with the outcome.  It felt almost natural after the first few minutes of readjusting myself to it.The other major difference with Shadow Fall&#8217;s gameplay is the use of the OWL: a hovering attack drone that acts as your partner or just special weapon.  The OWL can attack or stun enemies for you.  This can be extremely helpful when surrounded by multiple Helghast.  Your OWL also has the ability to deploy a zip line that allows you to reach faraway places.  Another ability it has is to send out a scanner through the area that will highlight enemies and ammo/health packs for you so that you can locate them easier.  The final ability the OWL has is that it can hack and scan different terminals and alarms throughout the game for you.  The OWL was definitely an interesting addition to the Killzone franchise, but not one that makes the game special in any way.  It easily could have been made without it and it wouldn&#8217;t have changed a whole lot.The multiplayer portion of the game was very fun during the time I spent with it.  There are a total of 10 maps that come with the game.  For a first time player the maps will appear to be huge and confusing, but you will adjust and learn them over time.  Every user has all of the classes, abilities, and weapons unlocked from the very beginning which is different from most first-person shooters.  The class system includes Assault, Scout, and Support which make it much simpler to choose from.  There is an enormous list of challenges for each class that the player can unlock and complete in order to gain skill enhancements to make their character better.  Overall, the multiplayer is very fun but takes a little getting used to if you have been playing games like Call of Duty and Halo for the past several years.The Verdict: 7.5 out of 10Launch titles always have too much hype which in turn leads them to being such a letdown for so many gamers.  This appears to be the case for Killzone: Shadow Fall.  I really wanted to love this game.  In fact during the first few missions I said out loud several times, &#8220;Woah, this game is awesome!&#8221;  But as I got farther into the game and started running into the mindless shooter mechanics that are in so many other games, I started to lose interest.  On top of that and with the story starting to lose me, they throw in some ridiculously frustrating and stupid sections like Chapter 8, and I almost ended up quitting the campaign entirely.  The amazing graphics and addition of the OWL could not save the campaign.  Hopefully the multiplayer will end up being popular and will continue to hold people&#8217;s attention who found the campaign as disappointing as I did.  Guerilla Games had a chance to make a spectacular game with the launch of a new console and instead delivered a game that is just about average.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2013"}

Taylor","summary":"Stands on the shoulders of giants","reviewText":"Dead Space is an excellent first attempt by EA.  Yes, the EA that vomits out a new and unimproved Madden every year. This game is a step in the right direction for the company and I'm guessing a sequel is already in the works.Dead Space is the definition of survivor horror. The designers must have played tons of Resident Evil.  This game basically takes the best aspects of that series and adds a few innovations.Story:  The story for Dead Space is OK.  It is an homage to every classic horror movie and game you can think of. Monsters designs remind you of John Carpenter's The Thing; Experience Hell in deep space a la Event Horizon etc.. Nothing too special happens here.Graphics/Sound:  Both are great.  These are some of the best graphics around, not the best but close. The surround sound is awesome. You can really use your speakers to track those out of sight baddies. This game was made to be played in the dark with the volume up.Gameplay: This is the selling point for me.  Gameplay is very well balance. Though I've heard complaints of the enemies being all guys with claws, that is an understatment. Every creature has different moving patterns/attacks/weaknesses. Enemies range from infected fetuses to bloated walking larval sacs. Some enemies are on the cheap side. Dont just expect to shoot wildly at enemies till they drop.  That won't work and you'll waste all your ammo. The key to killing enemies isn't even headshots, the key lies in strategic dismemberment of the enemies limbs.  Sounds weird but it's quite do able with practice.There are a few things to upgrade(special abilities,weapons,armor etc.). These are upgraded by trading in nodes found around the ship or rewarded for completing tasks.  Take these nodes to shops found throughout the ship and upgrade your equipment. There are several weapons in the game ranging from the starting laser cutting tool up to a futuristic energy cannon.  I only used the starting laser(arguably the best gun in the game once leveled)/ flamethrower and cannon and had a blast with the game.Replay Value:  This is kind of lite.  The only unlock is a new suite plus the bonus of using all your items from your previous save. Since the game is heavily influenced by Resident Evil, I expected a RE style side mission game. Kind of like the Mercenary game in RE3 or the Ada Wong Game in RE4.In summaryPro-good graphicsgood soundbalanced gameplayextremely funCons-Some enemies are on the \"cheap\" side of things.Low replay value","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2009"}

After picking it up recently however, I can say that all the excitement was justified. I underestimated how fun this game can actually be! You play as a criminal betrayed by his girlfriend out to get some payback on the streets of Liberty City. The main objective is to work as a free-lance criminal for various gangs and crime orginizations...but you can go on rampages of your own at any time you wish. Bystanders walk the streets ready to be ran over, angry gangsters will fire at you, rip people out of their vehicles and watch them squirm as you drive away, and of course the police are there to bust you if you get too violent. You can even pick up hookers to increase your health. Even with all of this chaos going on in the city, the PS2 manages to keep it all at an acceptable framerate. The only real flaw I can think of is the rickety targeting system: Trying to aim at one person in a melee is almost impossible. Needless to say, this is definitely an adult-oriented item. WARNING: If you have young kids, you probably will not want them to play this game. But if you have alot of pent up road rage, or just a ravenous lust for violence, there's no better way to release your anger (that's legal anyway).

Why? Because BioWare's MASS EFFECT series is the BEST VIDEO GAME SERIES EVER. You know how I know this? I know this because I generally HATE RPG's and if I can be so obsessively devoted to a single gaming franchise that happens to be an RPG, then you can take that to the bank. As MASS EFFECT 3 stands, from a pure gaming standpoint, it's near perfect, and it's an improvement from the first two games. No more annoying planet scanning; a smoother combat system; no more ridiculous mini-games; tighter and more seamless graphics; epic battles.The real problem that almost everyone is having with this game is with the last hour of the game. And while I understand the frustration with that ending and even share it...It's time to stop.This is NOT a 2 and a half star game. It's time to stop with all of the outcry against the ending and having that be THE ONLY REASON you're all giving it one or two-star reviews. Before you get to that last hour of the game, you are in awe of everything that has come before it. The epic sensibilities of the conflicts; the engaging side-missions; the moving, dramatic stories of each character... you still LOVE that stuff. This is what makes the MASS EFFECT games worth playing. Did anyone moan and groan about how admittedly lame the final confrontation between Shepard and Saren was in the first game? NO. I get it. I know you're angry. When I was playing it, I was loving it. A few days later, I didn't like the ending. A few days after that, I hated it. I didn't feel like bringing back my FemShep from ME1 and 2 to run through her mission, since I had just done my Commander Shepard character brought from ME1 and 2 just to have her run into the same ending.I know where the anger comes from: BioWare promised us an epic resolution to possibly the most epic series of all time. BioWare also promised that just about every decision you make in this game will have an effect on the ending. They didn't completely live up to that promise so it makes it seem like all the decisions you made are for nothing.It's not. Despite the fact that you don't like the ending doesn't mean that the journey there wasn't TOTALLY worth it, because it was. It took me some time to come to this realization.Hopefully, before you give it the knee-jerk bandwagon reaction most of you are, you'll think about what an awesome time you had playing the game up front and not have tunnel-vision merely on the ending.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube. For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience.

Some of the reviewers on here did say that this game is no good but i dont really think they played Resident Evil to begin with. Even though that RE is 'survival horror' u do have a lack of ammo &amp; u have to save your ammo in order to survive.. well first of all how are u going to survive w/o killing every living creature that comes out &amp; attack you. You dont run from them.. &amp; one of my problems is since this game is in 3D you have a hard time on trying to avoid them because of the camera angle. In my opinion its much easier to just shoot anything that attacks you.. even though some zombies in this game are easy to avoid.. you still might lose life on trying to dash around them because your judgement is off which is like every RE game. Thats where the control comes into play &amp; i do have to say the control for this game can get annoying. Once that camera changes view, u get momentarly lost &amp; u forget that zombie u were trying to avoid. My solution is to cheat.. but does that really take the gameplay away.. probablly. The only thing i dont like about resident evil is its not all action.. you got puzzles.. oh u got to move this shelf over here to open a door. There is this one part in this game (that isnt in the original) that u have to push this statue over to this one corner while walls on either side are about to crush you.. it is scary because u dont know if u will die, but i spent 25min on it.. i died once &amp; had to do the dormitory level again. Took me about 10x b4 finally completing it..  i dint need a strategy guide cuz that wouldnt help, but its all due to the bad controls. Granted i got used to the control but, in some areas of the game it does become a hazard. Anyways enough of me blabbing about that, this game is really good compared to any other RE games out there (well besides RE 0). This game is soo realistic that it makes Final Fantasy X look like a paper mache. (not only that FFX wasnt too great, lack of storyline) anyways here is my grading system for this game..Graphics: 10/10 The best game has been remade to better graphics.. but not better, the best. I was very impressed by it.. people thought &quot;They have the new RE movie already???&quot;Plus the gore is unbelivable, its just an interactive movie. They dint need any videos for this game, just pure CG's did the trickSound/Music: 10/10 Ok, the original RE music score really does sound cheezy, were we playing RE or Supermario Unlimited here.. as for the remake, they really outdone themselves, i do like the RE2 music better but this one is just as good (like Silent Hill almost) As for the acting, it is very good.. i dont know why some people dint like the acting, i thought it was good &amp; is alot better then the original (although the original RE acting is fun to watch)Gameplay: 6/10 Its good but could be better, this is my only gripe cuz of the fact i could be the original RE game w/o cheating but with this one i had to in the middle of the game, i was running low on ammo &amp; plus i dint realize that zombies come back to life (as little &quot;Tyrants&quot;) after killing them. As most RE fans know is once a zombie is down, they never come back, but after playing this one.. u wish u never shot that one zombie, cuz that is the zombie that came back to life &amp; avenged its own life.Replay: 8/10 u could play this game over &amp; over again (well after 4-5x u get tired of it cuz u know whats going to happen) &amp; is a problem for RE games.. the games are too short (even though this one is pretty long) &amp; u get little extras.. plus the puzzles in the games just become a chore afterwards.Storyline: 9/10 Very good storyline, they improved it from the original versionOverall: 8/10 Overall this is a good game to play if u havnt played RE watch out for the controls cuz its confusing at first &amp; the GC edition is just a little worse then usual, but otherwise this is a good game. It has alot more the original &amp; the mansion is much more massive. I suggest buying this game if u like horror, action &amp; dont mind annoying puzzles","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2003"}

Nathan Hale.View larger.This sequel introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers.View larger.Resistance 2 takes up right where Resistance: Fall of Man left off. Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest. This unprecedented 60-player option could revolutionize online multiplayer game play and is sure to provide countless hours of action-packed fun.Resistance 2, set in the United States, is loaded with new weapons, enemies, and an unprecedented online gaming experience.","reviewerName":"N.

{"product_name":"B006WQR3V0","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Another way-too-late, single player only review","reviewText":"XCom is a turn-based, strategic action game where you command a squad of elite soldiers in a war against invading aliens. In addition to combating the aliens with weaponry, you also control vast global finances with which to build facilities and/or research new technologies to help the war effort.PROSTactical combatThe game&#8217;s focus and area in which it shines. XCom featured a solid variety of maps and enemies that allowed for great tactical and strategic combat.I enjoyed thinking about how to set up my soldiers&#8217; strengths against the enemies&#8217; weaknesses, how to use the environment to my advantage and keep my soldiers healthy while efficiently taking out the aliens, while also concentrating on secondary objectives (e.g. saving civilians, preventing damage to valuable alien tech, capturing enemy aliens, or escorting VIPs).Upgrade systemThe upgrades were well thought out and truly gave a feeling of progress to each soldier. Reaching the higher levels made each soldier far more capable in combat (but also more valuable, and therefore, more important to protect).*In addition to soldier upgrades, you could upgrade your weapons, armor and aircraft, study new technologies, and create a vast underground network of foundries, satellite hubs and research stations to enhance your alien-fighting abilities.Even after you made all the traditional upgrades, there came into play psychic abilities, one of the more memorable features. To be able to cause panic amongst enemies and even, at the higher levels, to control them, was awesome.Enemy varietyThe developers did an excellent job introducing new enemies at just the right times to give the campaign vicissitudes of adjusting and readjusting as the enemies got tougher. They ranged from simple, organic aliens with lightweight guns to heavily-armored mechs with laser cannons and support drones, and almost everything in between (with a range of tactics and abilities).CONSCoverIt was often confusing, in regards to off-center cover. In other words, how far did your cover extend to the sides? 45 degrees? 89 degrees? Did every single angle offer differing amounts of cover? That could&#8217;ve used further explanation.VisionI really didn&#8217;t understand how my or my enemy&#8217;s vision worked. Sometimes it seemed like I should&#8217;ve been able to fire at particular enemies, but couldn&#8217;t due to them not being in my line of sight. Perhaps with each potential move, they should&#8217;ve shown which enemies would be &#8220;fireable upon&#8221; before the move was officially made.StoryAliens attack earth. The world unites under XCom to study and eliminate them. That was pretty much it. Don&#8217;t look for a deep, emotionally moving story. This game is purely about tactical combat.No way to free fire despite destructible environmentIt was great to see environmental features that could be destroyed, creating dynamic situations, but since the game didn&#8217;t allow free firing (save for the rocket launcher), it prevented this feature from reaching its full potential. I.e., you couldn&#8217;t shoot at a wall/tree/car to expose the enemy using it for cover.No helmetsThe rest of the armor in XCom was pretty cool, but helmets would&#8217;ve been a welcome addition. I just thought about how cool they were in other action RPGs, like Mass Effect and Dragon Age; and it&#8217;s not like XCom&#8217;s soldiers ever showed any emotion, so why not?Couldn't switch gear with squadmates during missionThis frustrated me. On occasion, I wanted to switch weapons or gear during a mission, but this feature was sadly missing. I understand if it used up a turn (or partial turn) and stayed within the items&#8217; class restrictions, but it should&#8217;ve been there anyway.* One peeve is that I would&#8217;ve liked to have the upgrades shown (rather than hidden before being promoted), to better plan the soldier you eventually wanted to have.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0088MVPRY","description":"","summary":"Little improvements, BIG FIGURES","reviewText":"Having spent as much time with the original Spyro's Adventure as any other game last year I am happy to find some very important fixes in the sequel.  First off a wired portal was the answer to many battery sucking sessions, secondly the addition of five more levels to the level 10 cap is wonderful especially since it works with the old figures. Finally they added a difficulty level which allows for multiple play throughs with all your various figures.  I actually had more fun with the 3DS version last time around but this year the console versions trump the 3DS offering which is unacceptably short.  Tree Rex is a marvel while I was enamored with many of the LIFE figures before this new figure which is included with every version of the game is a must have.  He is powerful in the game with devastating power-ups and very cool looking on the shelf.  We tried to take our time and explore every corner but Giants is a slightly shorter game, at least the expansion sets will provide new challenges and levels.  While I might have actually liked the idea of Skylanders minis more,(the new giant figures are expensive) this game has impressive graphics, unlockables, music and voice acting, not to mention the addictive leveling and figure collecting. Another winner for gaming families and couples.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2012"}

Resistance 1 had great scenery settings(urban chaos to chimeran base interiors with huge structures), creative missions, it took forever to complete, and it was fun learning about all the chimera technology. Just a very \"BIG\" feel to it. Resistance 2 had the best visual appeal of all three (lots of colors and scenery)but lacked in length. The game was too short and that was it's only down fall. And now resistance 3 continues the downward spiral. The game is the short. The visuals are dull (almost the whole game has this colorless sepia tone to everything). The enemys are very repetitive. Lots of missions are in the dark with the gun flashlight being your only sight (sometimes cool for effect but not for 40% of the game). Overall it was just not fun for it's time period.

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

Ferrari","summary":"Could have been perfect but just missed it","reviewText":"Let me preface my review by stating that RPGs and Shooters are my 2 favorite genres of games.I struggled in my mind over 4 or 5 stars for Mass Effect 2.  I ultimately went with 4 stars for the reasons stated below.The game is outstanding and when taken as a whole is practically perfect in every way.  Gone are the texture pops from ME1 and the odd shadow effects.  The shooting has been greatly improved.  The dialogue wheel is as fluid as ever and voice acting and facial expressions are amazing.  I love the fact that each planet is unique (at least the ones you land on).  I'm in the minority here in that I actually kind of enjoyed the rover.  Music and sound are great.  Inventory system has been improved somewhat.  I wouldn't call this a major improvement, but it sure beats having 10 different assault rifles that all look exactly the same.  I would have liked more than 3 though.  On that note as well, the clips rather than having your weapon overheat is a plus.Now for my inner struggle.  ME2 loses points with me for the absolutely horrible levelling system.  The RPG lover in me was hugely disappointed with the way you level up.  In ME1 I would level up and get my \"talent points\" and would actually look at the skills and think about which ones I wanted to improve on.  In ME2, all I did through the whole campaign was hit \"Y\" to auto-allocate my points.  It really rips the heart out of the RPG side of this game.  Levelling up is the essence of an RPG and it was outstanding in ME1.  It is severely lacking in ME2.  It takes no thought or consideration at all, and I didn't see that it really made any difference at all.  Also a disappointment is the fact that you can't equip your squad with armor or change their armor for that matter.  Equipping your team is another staple in the RPG genre.  I really hope for ME3 they keep all the game play improvements that were made but go back to the drawing board on the levelling up.  A lot of people gushing over how \"streamlined\" the levelling system is now have blinders on, and the rest are straight up shooter fans who wouldn't know a quality RPG if it smacked them in the face.  Just because a game has a deep and immersive story line doesn't make it a great RPG.  One last minor gripe is the scanning mini-game for the planets.  It is certainly better than the first game, but becomes tiresome pretty quickly.  As a shooter it gets 5 stars, as an RPG it gets a pretty weak 3.  That averages out to 4 stars.  If they had just left the levelling system alone it would have been perfect.PROS+ Graphics+ Story line+ Conversation wheel+ Building Relationships+ Inventory System streamlined+ Upgrading weapons and armor is simple+ Combat is amazing+ Planets are variedCONS- Levelling system has been dumbed down to the point that it is almost non-existent- Very little armor customization for Shepard- No armor period for the rest of the team- Scanning for minerals becomes tedious- Little variety of weapons.***Update***I am now on my third play through of ME2 and I do have to say the levelling has grown on me a bit.  I still stand by this being a 4 star game as the more I play it the more little glitches jump out at me, but now that I've actually worked with it levelling system makes more sense.  I've read that you can actually finish the game without Shepard surviving.  Haven't quite figured that one out yet.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2010"}

What Blizz does,they do well but with all the cosmetic changes and the two new races,in the end, its still WOW. Those that love WOW will love Cata as well.

{"product_name":"B00005ULXN","reviewerName":"ffootballguru27","summary":"Another great Sonic game brought to a Nintendo system","reviewText":"Sonic Adventure 2 Battle is a great re-make of Sonic Adventure 2 for the Dreamcast. If you have ever played the Dreamcast version of this game, you know what this game is all about.Sonic is mistaken for an evil Hedgehog named Shadow who has been spreading danger across the world. The military and all police units are after Sonic and you need to escape Sonic from them and avoid them in many of the levels.There are many fun modes you can play in: Story Mode, Kart Mode and Chao Raising Mode. Story mode is the main game. You can choose to play as the Hero's (Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles) or the Dark villains (Shadow, Rogue and Dr. Robotnik).Kart mode is just like Mario Kart games for the Super Nintendo and Nintendo 64. You unlock Kart racing after you complete the first 9 stages. You can play in one player or two player and race as Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, Shadow, Rouge, or Dr. Robonik in 3 different courses.Raising a Chao can be frustrating sometimes, but it is also fun. You teach your Chao to do new things while being nice to it, but trying not to spoil it. This mode gets old after a while though.The levels in this game are amazing. Each level includes different missions that get more challenging as you get deeper in to the game. The graphics are very realistic and when the spins and jumps Sonic does look very smooth. The gameplay is a lot better than Sonic Adventure.Sonic also has new abilities to grind on rails, and swing form vines and bars. And there is also a newer helper Chao named OmoChao who gives you hints in each level.Sonic Adventure 2 is loaded with secrets to unlock. If you get All 'A' rankings in each of the levels many great secrets are unlocked. Also, getting all 180 emblems is very rewarding. There are many other secrets to unlock as well.There is also an all-new 2 player mode on this game and there are many new characters and environments for the GameCube.There are only two minor flaws in this game. The camera angles don't always show the direction you want to see and you can't play just as one character like you could in SA1 (on the DC).Overall this is my favorite Sonic game ever made and a great game for any Sonic fan who has a GameCube. This is probably one of this best games available for the GameCube.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2002"}

I hope I can get a replacement unit soon. Right now it's a very expensive paper weight.Well, not entirely. Since the system still functions, I was able to play around with the voice commands. Unfortunately my experience here isn't very positive either. Half of the time the system simply doesn't pick up the command, and sometimes it does the wrong command. Trying to see what's on certain channels simply doesn't work either.Another thing that I'm disappointed with is the controller. The X360 controller was near perfect, but the bumpers on this new controller don't feel right, and the sticks are very loose feeling.

The depth is incredible. While on foot, you play as one of five specialized classes (assault, medic, scout, antitank, or engineer) with varying equipment and abilities. The choice of vehicles ranges from a selection of tanks, jeeps, and other fairly standard mechanized land vehicles to exotic craft like battleships, submarines, and dive bombers. Best of all, you can pit yourself against your fellow man in objective-based online battles in four distinct WWII theaters of war: North Africa, South Asia Pacific, Western Europe, and Eastern Europe.

Where this game really starts to kick in is the quite spectacular scale of these engagements.Fancy yourself a pilot?  Hop into the cockpit of a Spitfire and...well...spit fire at the enemy from the clouds.  Always enjoyed the rumble of heavy armor?  No problem, find a shiny new Tiger tank with the keys in the ignition.  Don't like getting your hands dirty?  Swivel the massive guns of a cruiser and rain artillery on the baddies.  There's so many amusing ways to frag your friends and neighbours you'll be hard pushed to find more variety in a 3D shooter.While Battlefield does include a limited single player campaign, its in the online realms that this game really shines.  56k modem users may scrape by in the smaller battles, but you'll need a higher speed connection if you really want to get the most out of this game.  Battles can be up to 60 players, but personally I find the 32 player games hit the right balance between scale and teamwork...too many people, and you'll never find a spare tank to play with!Graphically 1942 doesn't really break any new ground...its certainly not as crisp and detailed as Allied Assualt, but more than makes up for this with the massive size of the playing areas.  There's some nice details, such as the swaying trees and dust kicked up by tanks, but you'll probably be too busy ducking from .50 cal fire to notice.  The sound is great, with the crackle of machine guns and the whine of dive bombers filling the air.  There's also some nice animation from an infantry point of view, whipping out a new magazine for your Thompson carbine and slapping it home, or sneaking up behind an unsuspecting sentry and letting your knife do your talking.On the downside this is a game that requires a fair deal of cooperation to be really fun...you will find yourself out numbered and outgunned more than once because your smacktard team is busy queing for planes on the other side of the map.Things can get pretty dull in the single player campaign where the computer AI is sometimes less than helpful (fortunately there are several patches for this game that clean things up a bit)But, when it all comes together you'll be whooping with joy as your tanks roll into the enemy base, supported by bombers and scout-directed artillery. The new Road to Rome expansion will certainly add new life to this game, plus the multitude of conversion mods that are available from the net, including the much talked about Desert Combat mod.There's just so many different ways to play, you'll be shaking your head with the scope of this title.  It's so well balanced, from crawling through the bushes as a sniper to take pot-shots at artillery crews, to buzzing the treeline with your P-51 Mustang...from the squealing gears as your Panzer IV shifts its gun turret, to the frenzied house to house fighting in the dusty streets of Berlin.  Everything you thought was cool about war movies is somewhere in this game...I recommend you lock, load, and deploy right now...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2003"}

{"product_name":"B001UWGCW2","description":"Singularityis a first-person shooter developed by the legendary Raven Software and utilizing the power and flexibility of the Unreal 3 game engine. Set in an alternate present of 2010, players take on the role of a US Air Force pilot who while investigating an extreme radiation signature, stumbles upon a top secret Cold War era Soviet program, run amok which not only causes monstrous mutations, but also threatens to alter nature of time itself..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Speed up time to reduce enemies to dust.View larger.Or gain from turning back the clock.View larger.Classic FPS gameplay.View larger.A revisionist Cold War storyline.View larger.StoryIn the dark, Cold War winter of 1949-50 Stalin, the brutal leader of the Soviet Union, had two super weapons: long range missiles and the atomic bomb. But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.PlayStation Network support including PlayStation Trophies.","reviewerName":"The Czar","summary":"Definitely worth a playthrough or two.","reviewText":"Read some positive reviews on this game and decided I wanted to give it a shot.

{"product_name":"B00BI83EVU","description":"","reviewerName":"Dredded Deuce \"Dredded Panthyr\"","summary":"Not quite the leap we were looking for but still not a bad game either","reviewText":"Let&#8217;s come right out of the gate and say it. If you have never been a fan of GTA, or open world sandbox gaming, then this may not be the game for you. To be brutally honest, I almost feel like the extra months needed to polish this game was also used to give enough breathing time between the latest GTA V and this game but this is just my opinion. So, on to the bigger question, was Watch Dogs worth the wait? You get a resounding maybe.Story:  The story itself is pretty much a very bland revenge story of Aiden Pierce who is looking for the people responsible for the death of his niece after a hacking heist gone wrong. He has a broken relationship with his sister and his nephew that he is trying to fix but of course it&#8217;s finding a balance between doing what&#8217;s right vs what&#8217;s necessary in order fix that relationship that comes into question. But doing so means that Aiden has to dip into his bag of hacker tricks to find the people responsible and that means hacking into Chicago&#8217;s &#8216;top notch&#8217; OS system to get what he wants.Gameplay: This is where things tend to get a bit sticky. It is very hard not to compare this game to the GTA series but you almost have to in order to see the difference and similarities of the two. The biggest difference of course is while this game has its own moral compass that players will have to hurdle, it&#8217;s not as seedy as GTA in the sheer and raw crimes against humanity that you can commit&#8230;but you can still commit some seriously raw crime on here. Of course most of that comes through the hacking opportunities that Aiden can do throughout the game. To a degree, you have almost too much freedom to hack because at any given moment you can listen in on any conversation, hack any gate and steal as much money as possible in a short amount of time and this is even before you really open up a lot of the skill trees that you are given. One thing that GTA was at least good for is that it slowly gave you items to work toward where Watch Dogs almost forces it down your throat and it&#8217;s easy to get distracted with side jobs which are more than plentiful and sometimes proves to be too much of a distraction. The one big plus that I did like was your approach to missions and this is where this game shines and thus differentiates itself from GTA. It makes you remember that first and foremost that Aiden is not a gun blazing thug. Many missions can be completed with zero to a minimal amount of lives lost if you know how to use the CCTV system to hack your way into vital systems in the game. You can do things such as shut down gates, cause plates to explode, open doors when needed and so on. Occasionally some objectives will eventually have you manually go in to open certain systems but the element of stealth sometimes works better than a straight shootout. This gives the game a flexibility that isn&#8217;t often seen in the GTA series but reflects more in Ubisoft&#8217;s other franchise Assassins Creed.Some of the quirks in the gameplay: As with all open world games there are bound to be some issues and Watch Dogs is no exception. While the hacking and side mission options are too plentiful at times there are other things that can be brought up.-  Car radio: other games have had this issue solved right out of the gate but for some reason, Ubisoft didn&#8217;t bother to differentiate on music genre when driving in the game. All the music is lumped together and you just have to right click through until you get to the song that you want. It&#8217;s annoying as hell so usually I turn the music off.-  Voice acting: one of the few games you can hear anything from a surfer boy accent as well as a faux Irish accent in the same game and most of them are not done well.-  Consistent radiant AI: This one is actually a good and bad thing and one I hope gets fixed in future games on these new platforms. I do like the fact that in some cases NPCs will take it upon themselves to call the cops when they see you draw a weapon or steal a vehicle but the issue is it&#8217;s not consistent throughout the game. I would like to see at times when an accident is caused or sheer amounts of mayhem is happening, that the cops are called as well.-  Access: While you can theoretically open up large sections of the game early on, unless you have certain skills, you can access some buildings right away and some you can&#8217;t. This gets confusing at times because I feel like some places you shouldn&#8217;t have access to so early on and others you should but some reason, you just do.-  Cover system: It&#8217;s a bit clunky at times especially during shootouts. It&#8217;s easy to get stuck in the wrong place because it&#8217;s times like these is when the controller gets a bit unresponsive when you need to get out of cover-  Weapons: I alluded to how some items are forced down the moment you start playing. One of the biggest imbalances in this game is that if you hack long enough and it doesn&#8217;t take long, you can have all the guns you need and never have to worry about buying a better one or running out of ammo so while for some, it&#8217;s one less worry, for others, it takes away the challenge and the feelings of being mortal because you never have to worry about not finding crucial items when needed because it&#8217;s one hack away.Graphics:  So the question on everybody&#8217;s mind is, how does it look on next gen systems? I have it on the PS4 and while I can say that it looks good, Infamous looks better. I am also still looking at the fact that this game was supposed to have been a launch title. There are things that graphically the game does well such as lighting and particle effects even some of the water effects are done well, but it&#8217;s still not quite screaming &#8216;next gen&#8217; as of yet. More of this is seen when you see some of the other character models that are around the main character and they low-res in comparison.Sound: One thing about games like these is that the sound is important. From the rumblings of the trains to the voices broadcasting the news to the public, Watch Dogs&#8217; sound stage does indeed shine but it&#8217;s not hard to do on most games like these.Overall: Watch Dogs is a game you would like if you want a slightly different pace from the GTA series. It&#8217;s not as ratchet or depressingly violent as GTA can be although the elements are in place for it. It is the big game that we have hoped and dreamed for? No, not quite but there is promise for this new IP that Ubisoft has put out. It&#8217;s interesting to a point but not quite as fresh as many of us were hoping. To be honest, this may be the game that has many of us questioning do we have to many open world games just like we have too many FPS&#8217;es and would this be the game that makes creators reconsider their approach to sandbox gaming. Some games don&#8217;t give enough and some too much. Watch Dogs gives just a bit much but some of it is just enough to keep players around to get through the campaign with more than enough distractions to keep one busy long after it&#8217;s completed.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2014"}

The only possible source of horsepower problems are with the video card, which is definately underpowered. In the big metro cities, where a lot of activity happens, I get some lag because my video card is not able to handle it fast enough.I also play games for my own personal enjoyment. I don't power-game, power-level, whatever. I haven't read any of the guides to quick advancement. I'm a newbie, and I like it that way, because I discover the game on my own terms, and there is an enormous amount to discover.The interface is fairly easy to use. Point-and-click. Left and right mouse buttons trigger different actions. Lots of keyboard shortcuts, so that you can really play with both hands on the keyboard. Related to the interface are all things like character analysis; inventory, skills and quests management. All these are easy to bring up, and fairly obvious once you start looking at them.The death system is also nice. You can easily die, but there's no devestating consequences due to a misjudged situation. Other games I've played have dire death system: you can loose EVERY item in your current inventory, including money; you can loose massive amounts of experience points even to the point of loosing  levels. Some of those other systems are so horrific that it's not unheard of to reroll a character even after one death.Here in WoW, death is unavoidable. But when you die, you can either rez at the cost of XP (never loosing levels); or run back to your body and rez at no cost. You will rez at reduced health, and you may rez in the middle of mobs or even a PvP battle, so there is still risk involved. You might even die in a place where you can't rez. All in all, a good way to handle dying.For now, the game is mostly quest-driven, and advancement seems to be much easier if you quest more than grind. Maybe at higher levels you'll need to do the grind, or maybe you're more into the PvP thing more than exploring the world. Whatever you like, WoW seems to have enough for everyone.Others have talked about how gimped some of the classes are (the warrior), but again, since I'm not driven by power-levelling, that doesn't seem to bother me. I play as a warrior, and have won and lost my fair share of duels, so at a low level, it all really depends on how tactical you are in playing.There's a lot more that could be said, but there's no room for it. Try the 30-day free period and see for yourself.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2005"}
{"product_name":"B0009VXAM0","reviewerName":"Brian Forrester \"Brian Forrester, Noblesville IN\"","summary":"Very happy with my PS3","reviewText":"The PS3 has received a lot of bad press since it's launch.  From complaints of the high sticker price, the lack of games and the initial hardware shortages, the PS3 hasn't gotten the strong reputation enjoyed by it's predecessors (PS1 and PS2).  Personally, I find much of the critiques to be unfair.  As a one-time Xbox 360 owner, I will say that I much prefer the PS3.  Yes, there are more games available for the 360, but the hardware is terrible.  I went through 2 hardware failures before I traded in my 360 for store credit which I used towards my PS3.  I haven't looked back.  Let's do a good / bad breakdown:The Goods:--Backwards compatibility to PS1.  This means your PS1 and PS2 libraries aren't worthless.  This alone makes the PS3 software library far from the junk it is made out to be.  I'm the type that only needs 1 or 2 good titles to tide me over for a few months.  I've been so busy w/ Oblivion and God of War II, that I haven't noticed the lack of games for PS3.--Blu-Ray:  Although it is blamed for the early hardware shortages (and the high price of the console), Blu-Ray, I feel, will win this gen console war for Sony.  I never owned a DVD player before my PS2, and DVD playback played a big role in my desire for a PS2.  Blu-Ray, esp. for HDTV owners, is great!  The movies look so much better than DVD.  It also lends a great deal of storage space to the PS3 games.  While X360 owners are swapping out 2 and 3 DVD-9 disks for a single game in the future, PS3 owners will never have to worry.  It also allows devs to leave more of the game uncompressed on disk, leading to fewer and faster load times.--Standard equipment:  PS3 owners don't have to pay extra for DVD (and BD) playback, Wireless adapter ($99 for X360) for their wireless networks, HD Movie playback (x360 has an HD-DVD attachment for $200, but HD-DVD is all but dead and you only get movie playback...it won't play HD-DVD format games).  It also has multiple USB inputs, SD, Flash, and other such memory stick support.  You can upload pictures, MP3 files, movies, etc.  Standard 60gb HD.  HDMI output, standard.-- Free online:  Yeah, Xbox Live is a well put together online community.  However, you'll pay at least $50 a year to use this service.  Sony's is free.-- Bluetooth wireless controllers:  The Xbox 360s wireless remotes use batteries.  This is a double-edged sword.  If you don't have extra batteries sitting around, you could find yourself in trouble mid game.  However, with re-chargable items like the PS3 remote, over time they may stop taking a charge, leaving you to buy a new controller.  We'll see how this plays out.-- Sony First party exclusives.  After Halo, the 360 has what, exactly?  The PS3 will be sporting \"Ratchet and Clank\" (one my personal favs), \"Gran Turismo\" (the driving simulator that all others aspire to be), \"Metal Gear\", \"God of War\" and a host of other great franchises.  Sony's consoles simply have more varied software than Xbox.  Xbox seems to favor First-Person-Shooters.--Hardware Reliability:  This was an enormous factor for me.  I've not had a problem with any of the Sony consoles I've owned in the past.  After about 10 months with the Xbox, I couldn't take it anymore.  I had two consoles fail in that time span.  The 360 was noisy, it scratched disks, and gives the dreaded Red Ring of Death.  Simply put, I just didn't feel confident to play that console for longer than an hour or so at a time.  I can sit and play my PS3 for as long as I desire without thinking twice.  I'd have to save my Oblivion on X360 every 5 or 10 minutes because I didn't know when the console would freeze next.  My PS3 hasn't frozen but one time in the 6 months I've owned it.The Bads:-- High price:  This can be justified, IMO, by all of the things you get standard with the box.  I can't say it enough...Blu-Ray is awesome.  For the price, you should get better AV cables with the machine.  Component cables for HD, at the least Sony!--  Lacking in software:  This issue won't last long, but it's the story of any console during the first 6 - 12 months of it's life.  Still, it needs to be noted.  The bulk of the games availble for PS3 are also available on X360 as well, with a few notable exceptions (and vice versa).--  Sixaxis controller:  I'd rather have rumble that the tilt controlls, and I'd like to see Sony redesign the controller.  It's time for offset analogs, Sony!  I used to dislike the original Xbox because I was so used to the PS controller layout.  Now I think it's time for a change, altough not a dramatic change.  They just need to keep the button layout and swap the placement of the D-pad and the L Analog stick.All in all, the Goods far outweigh the Bads.  My only complaints are very minor in nature.  Yeah, it's an expensive console initially (I wouldn't be suprised to see a price drop around the '07 Holiday season).  Yeah, the games available (although getting much better week in, week out) are a little lackluster.  Yeah, the Dual-Shock (Sixaxis now) controller design needs to go back to the drawing board.  But for any fan of the PS2, there should be no question which next gen console to get.  The quality of the hardware and the familiar Sony game franchises were reason enough for me.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00BGA9X9W","description":"","reviewerName":"Courtney L. Osborn","summary":"Hand-On with the DualShock 4","reviewText":"Today I was able to get my hands on the DualShock 4 (PlayStation 4 controller) for the first time! I am not sure anyone will understand just how excited I was. I was ten kinds of giddy when I found out I was going to hold one; giggling and smiling like crazy. Does this show just how far I have fallen into the nerd world? Yep, you bet it does.So first off, WOW! This controller is amazing, and that is not just my PlayStation fanboy-side talking. It literally kicks the crap out of the DualShock 3 in every single way. The moment it was actually in my hands I knew it was going to be something special.Weight:At first I thought the DS4 weighed less than the DS3, but I was deceived. It only felt like it was lighter because it&#8217;s a little wider; the weight was distributed a little differently than I was used to. When I say that the DS4 is heavier, I don&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s as heavy as a brick; it&#8217;s heavier by just a smidge which makes no real significant difference in the long run.Overall: Little heavier, but not bad in any way.Analog Sticks:This is one of the most controversial parts of the controller. People have been worried: will it be better than the DS3? Can it compare to the &#8220;amazing&#8221; Xbox 360 controller? My answer is both yes and no. Comparing the DS3 and DS4 next to each other, you can tell that the sticks are a little further apart on the DS4. This by itself is a huge improvement because gamers have been complaining for years that their fingers hit each other when they are playing FPSs. The tops of the analog sticks are no longer convex (dome shaped) like they were on the DS3&#8212;a trait that led to a slippery feel. The DS4 changes that by having the top of the sticks more concave with a raised center. This allows your thumbs to grab hold of the analog sticks at a much higher success rate. It feels really nice and I have no doubt it will please the FPS fans, as well as other gamers. The height of the DS4 analog sticks are also different from the DS3&#8212;they are closer to the controller. This means that it takes less time and effort for you to move each stick to either side. I believe this will make controls much tighter in games that need it, such as a high action FPS. There also appears to be more resistance to the sticks on the DS4.Overall: The sticks are amazing; a huge improvement over the last DualShock.Triggers:The second major complaint about the DualShock 3 was that the R2 &#8220;shoulder buttons&#8221; suck. On the DS4, they were also made to be concave like the analog sticks. They &#8220;bulbed out&#8221; like any normal button would; a trait that lead to many issues such as your fingers slipping off of the triggers unexpectedly. The DS3 used the R1 button on most FPS games because it was hard to shoot with the shoulder buttons. I was never personally bothered by it, but I know that it isn&#8217;t popular among most gamers. Hardcore gamers, you can rest easy; the DualShock 4 triggers feel amazing. They feel natural for some reason. The R2 triggers are now curved to be shaped like a trigger would be on a gun, or more like the Xbox 360 controllers triggers. This makes it much better for shooters. Killzone: Shadowfall will be the first FPS game on the PlayStation 4 and it has already made the R2 button the &#8220;shoot&#8221; button because of how much better it is.Overall: They are so much better than the sticks on the DS3. It cannot be expressed enough. This will change the perception of FPS games on the PlayStation.Touchpad:The touchpad is interesting. That is about the only way I can describe it. It is a slick giant button in the middle of the controller. I am not sure how I feel about it because I haven&#8217;t had the opportunity to play a game with it yet. Apparently you will be able to swipe your fingers across it if the game developers choose to implement it. This seems like a gimmick to me, but I may be horribly wrong when I get a chance to actually play with it. It doesn&#8217;t take up enough space to change how you play the game as far as I can tell.Overall: Not bad, will take time to determine if this is just a gimmick or not.Share and Option Buttons:There are now a &#8220;Share&#8221; and &#8220;Options&#8221; button on each side of the touchpad. These take the place of the &#8220;Select&#8221; and &#8220;Start&#8221; buttons that have been on the DualShock series of controllers since they started. Again, I am not quite sure how this will change gaming, but it is cool that they are trying to change things up. The Options button will now take the place of the start button for the most part and allow you to access most of the menus in games. The Share button is for showing off gameplay videos and pictures you took while playing.Overall: I like the idea of these buttons. It is cool that they are implementing the idea of streaming videos onto the controller now.Light Bar:The Light Bar sits flat on the top of the DS4. It takes up absolutely no space that you would need for anything because it is built inside of the controller. It was made so that the PlayStation camera can detect your controller movements better for motion control in games. It emits a light glow, hence the name &#8220;Light Bar&#8221; and can change colors if the developer chooses to use it. Killzone will be using it to show you how much health you have. Green will mean that you are at full health, yellow and orange will mean that you are being shot and losing health, and red will mean that you have died. That is pretty cool in my opinion, but I honestly won&#8217;t use it&#8212;I never look down at my controller when I am playing a game.Overall: This is something that probably won&#8217;t affect me as much as it could other gamers, but is still a cool addition to the controller.The Conclusion:The DualShock 4 is amazing. It is better than the DualShock 3 in every way. There may be a few things on it that will be unnecessary if developers don&#8217;t find a way to use them the right way, but that does not change the fact that it is awesome. I cannot wait to finally get to use it on games like Assassin&#8217;s Creed IV: Black Flag and Killzone: Shadowfall!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2013"}

This is why i like to play multiplayer, i love this game on multiplayer because its one of those first games that both people play at the same time. I love this feature like i said before. The only thing that is bad about this game is that you die really easy and hardly any save points. I dont even recall coming across any yet in fact. This is what makes it like a real arcade game.

{"product_name":"B007UM59AC","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Gave It A Chance And Ended Up Really Liking It!","reviewText":"Excited about the Reboot, I tried the demo... and hated it.  I thought, what the hell is this crap?  Who is this emo punk calling himself Dante and why does the combat suck so bad?  These graphics are terrible, too.  The game looks like concept art SKETCHES!  After seeing DMC on many Top 10 Game Lists, I gave it a try at the incredible low price of $15.Story: 9/10This is an origin story for Dante.  He's not the cool super hero Dante from the first series who rides missiles like skateboards.  At this point, he's a young punk with an attitude, but he talks and acts like a real person.  Hung over after a night of clubbing, the story begins in Dante's trailer when a mysterious girl exposes him to a hell dimension full of demons.  On the adventure, Dante learns he has a brother, Virgil, and that he and Virgil are Nephilim, the spawn of angels and demons.  Dante and Virgil must team up to slay the demon who killed their parents, battling through an army of demonic minions along the way.  Although it does feel like a show on the WB, the longer you play it, the more you like the characters.Graphics: 8/10They're highly stylized, but I'm not too crazy about the style.  The environments are varied from streets, to office buildings, to hell dimensions, to ancient ruins.  This is not a great looking game, but the environments are very dynamic.  They explode, twist, expand, collapse, strech...  They couldn't just use standard texture maps with baked in lighting, so I'm cutting them some slack.  The characters are very well animated and the creatures look like old dolls left to rot in hell.  They're creepy looking, instead of just looking like your typical video game monster.Gameplay: 9/10The gameplay consists of:10% Easy Platform Jumping with generous checkpoints.  Use an Angel Whip to pull Dante toward a grapple point or a Devil Whip to pull the grapple point towards Dante.1% Puzzle, which is pretty easy.9% Exploration, where you should revisit old levels when you have new powers.  You may see a ledge but have no idea on how to get there, and later you get an ability that makes it accessible.80% Modular Combat.The combat lock is gone and pushing directions to trigger Dante's moves has been replaced with a modular system.  They new combat system works like this:Dante has 4 weapons equipped at all times:A Sword. (Y,B buttons)A Gun. (X button)An Angelic Weapon. (Hold LT+Y,B buttons)A Devil Weapon.  (Hold RT+Y,B buttons)There are multiple types of guns, angelic weapons, and devil weapons and you swap them by pushing the D-pad.  Up toggles your guns, Left toggles your Angel Weapons, and Right toggles your Demon weapons.The combos for each weapon are very simple and a pause in the button presses differentiates the moves.  So, Y, Y, Y, Y is one combo, where Y, Y, pause, Y,Y, is another.The controls are:  A = Jump, B = some kind of launch attack, X = shoot, and Y is a melee attack.Hold LT to equip your Angel Weapon.Hold RT to equip your Devil Weapon.The beauty of this system is that the combos are completely modular and you can switch between them on the fly.Start with your sword, Y,Y,Y, switch to your devil axe, B to send the enemy skyward, use your guns to shoot it and keep it airborne, use your angel whip to pull yourself up to the enemy, perform a Y,Y, pause Y, attack in the air, switch to your devil weapon for a smash him to the ground attack.  How you mix and match your sword, gun, Angel, and Devil weapons are up to you.  Transitioning between weapons is exceptionally smooth.Because Y is always attack, B is always launch, X is always shoot, and A is always jump, it is incredibly easy to learn the combos.Mixing and matching weapon attacks is where the game gets really fun.There are some color coded enemies that are only weak to a certain type of weapon.  Blue enemies are resistant to angelic weapons, while red enemies need to be slain by devil weapons.There's a pretty wide variety of enemies, too.Leveling Up: 8/10As you kill enemies or smash objects in the environment, you get orbs.  These are used to buy new moves for your weapons.  There is a TRY (Before you buy) Mode which enables you to try out all of the weapons and their attacks so you can pick the upgrade / combo that you really want.  This is GREAT!Levels: 9/10You can replay levels on any difficulty at any time, so if you want to go back to level 1 and farm orbs, you can.  If you want to try out the tougher levels on harder difficulties, you can do that, too.  The levels are varied and there's a good mix of combat, platform jumping, and boss fights.  There's also quite a bit of spiteful dialogue between Dante and the Demons to keep you motivated.At the end of each level, you are given a score based on your combat style (switching weapons and combos scores much higher than using the same move over and over), the hidden objects that you find, and the time it took to complete the level.  This isn't the type of game where your health regenerates, so you will need to purchase health items.  Each time you buy one, that item gets more expensive.Sound: 10/10The acting is very good, the music is great, and the combat SFX punctuate the action.Maturity: MThis is a super violent game with lots of swearing, adult themes, and partial nudity.Replay Value: 8/10The game is 20 levels long and it will take you about 12 hours to finish.  When you finish, there will still be a chunk of unlockable moves and stat boosts for Dante, so you're free to play on the harder difficulties.  The game also has increased difficulty levels where the enemy AI is different and everybody (including Dante) dies in 1 hit if you want a challenge.Overall: 9/10I didn't think I was going to like this game, but I really enjoyed it once I gave it a chance.  I like the new Dante and he gets better as the story progresses.  After a while, I enjoyed the modular combat once I unlocked my first Angel weapon and my first Devil weapon.  This is a really fun game if you like God of War style combat.  To fully enjoy it, you do need to let go of the old Devil May Cry games and understand that this is a reboot, and not a remake.Buy it if you love God of War style combat.Buy it if you love teen drama shows on the WB.Rent it if you have about 12 hours to blow through the game on default difficulty.Avoid it if you need the target lock + directional push attacks that the old Devil May Cry games had.Avoid it if you can't get over the red saturated art style.Avoid it if you love the old series and can't stand reboots.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2014"}

I couldn't believe how much a simple battery operated shaking device could immerse me in the game, and it instantly ended up on my Christmas list along with Starfox 64 (which the the pak originally came bundled with, BTW).Nowadays, the novelty of rumble has largely worn off, but it still remains an important part of gameplay in many genres. The shooter genre was somewhat revolutionized when gamers were able to sense every time a bullet hit them, and take cover accordingly without even needing to look at their health bar. Racing games let gamers feel the rumble of the rough off-road terrain every time they took a wrong turn... Rumble had existed before the rumble pak, but it was the rumble pak that brought this nifty technology to the console front, and made it a standard for every controller from that day forward.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002I0GZ5Y","reviewerName":"B. Gann \"Video game junkie\"","summary":"Kingdom Hearts questions answered!..... Sort of...","reviewText":"Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep is probably one of the most high quality titles on the PSP to date. I write with the Vita already launched so its probably mute at this point that this is a great buy. To those who are familiar with the series this instalment meets all expectations that the brand Kingdom Hearts is known for. To those who are not, this is still a great pick-up no matter what. This game follows three keyblade wielders and their individual experiences throughout the timeline of events surrounding the game. This is perhaps the neatest touch to a KH game since 358 days over 2 concept of playing within the organization (for those of you who don't know they are the main villains from KH II). I'll break down this into many parts so please bear with me.Graphics: Probably the God of War titles and the Dissidia games beat out this game for me here, but this is really close with them. It looks just like KH from the PS2 and it was a great surprise to see that this game be as good looking as it was. (One reason why I favor Sony over Nintendo in the handheld market) Every visual you can think of was well put together and had great detail. (5/5)Environments: Like all KH games, this chapter has many different worlds. Most of them are new, focusing on the princesses from KH I that you dont really interact with (Snow White, Cinderella, Aurora) and two worlds that get a proper intro. I'm talking about the REAL Neverland with the actual island and lost boys (Not a pirate ship and Big Ben KH I fans), and stitch gets his own location with the space ship with the characters from the movie (Except Lilo, but thats actually a good thing, personally). Radiant Garden, however, is my favorite due to the locations you dont see in KH II. These are all great areas that are worth being in. (5/5)Characters: I'm pretty sure that there are those like me who saw the cover and said \"Hey there's Mickey and Roxas! (KH II) but who are the others? WELP guess what? not Roxas. Thats Ventus with Aqua and Terra. With all kinds of characters, the big surprises were seeing 2 different Soras, Kairi, and Riku. You also get to see Xeanorht (I know thats not how you spell it but I tried by sounding it out.) but he's not who you think. He looks COMPLETELY different form KH II and probably the single best thing about him is that he is voiced by Leonard Nimoy! Thats right! Mr Spock from Star Trek. Master Eraqus (I hope thats how its spelled) is my favorite because he is kind of like Yoda from Star Wars. Each character is well voiced and designed with awesome personalities. You will consistently see characters from games past here. I'm not spoiling it but you might want to pay attention to Radiant Garden when your there. (5/5)Gameplay: Movement, fighting, and other nuances are all there. The analog stick is actually of some use here as it did not feel that in the way for me while I was playing. The only negative about this game falls here, and thats the dice board. Its a great way to level up your attacks, but it is really time consuming. In the end it was worth it for me to have powerful attacks by the end of each storyline, but I probably spent half my time on the dice board. Its fun, but it wears off after a while. Otherwise, everything else is very polished and has great control. (4/5)Story: OK, Now the big kicker. I'm someone who loves to play games in a series chronologically (Except Final Fantasy where they are not related in universe [I dont count Dissidia]) so this is probably the first game you should play since its set before where it all supposedly began in KH I. As I said, the multiple points of view was the best touch as a story mechanic. With that being said, I'm not that big on how it turned out but it answers a LOT of questions from throughout the timeline. 1.) Where did Xeanorht come from? 2.) How did Sora, Riku, and Kairi became wielders of the keyblade? 3.) What is the meaning of the secret movie at the end of KH II? However, 4 really interesting questions that got answered floored me: 1.) In 358 days over 2, near the end, a cutscene involving Xigbar, Axel, and Xion takes place on Wonderland. What did Xigbars statement mean? 2.) How did Castle Oblivion come to be in Chain of Memories? 3.) At the end of the game in the single last cutscene, how do the three come together? 4.) The origin of the organization's founders. This is what had me ending this game with a smile on my face and a sense of satisfaction. Great story told only the way a KH game can, with a vast array of plot twists. (5/5)Pros:+ Great Story+ Memorable Characters+ Awesome Worlds+ Answers series long questionsCon:- Dice board can take some of the fun away.In summary if you dont have it: BUY IT. If you want somewhere to start the series: BUY IT. If your looking for just a casual PSP Game: BUY IT and you will possibly find yourself caught up in the series as a whole.

Penniless and shipless, you venture around a space dock until you find a ship and a job. You'll encounter a heady mix of canned missions that follow one main quest, and a million opportunities to make money or aggravate the various factions that co-exist in the universe. Like an online role-playing game, or Bethesda'sMorrowind, you determine who your enemies are and who your friends are by your own actions, and, in another nod to role-playing, you can customize your ship with guns, rockets, and equipment just as you would customize a RPG character with swords, bows, and magic items. Best of all, you can play cooperatively with friends or fight it out with enemies online.The backstory posits a future where various countries, divided by both nationality and, seemingly, race, have boarded massive colony ships and ventured into a wormhole that appeared within reach of our crude space technology. They found themselves in a galaxy far, far away and they got stuck there when the wormhole collapsed. They quickly colonized new home worlds and named everything with familiar locales that make navigation a breeze. In the American sectors you'll feel at home entering the New York system and landing at a spaceport called Manhattan, for example. While contrived, this device is used beautifully and it's far better than having to memorize a bunch of sci-fi names and remembering where they are, perfect for a massive universe such as this one.ThoughFreelanceris set in space, it is technically not a space simulation. The game was designed to be accessible to casual gamers. For example,Freelancermakes you use the mouse for ship control. This is quite a shift for a game genre normally known to require joystick control. But even old-schoolWing CommanderorX-Wingfans may find that the sacrifice of verisimilitude is made up for with gains in agility. The mouse controls your guns, while you use the keyboard to maneuver around the rich universe that developer Digital Anvil has constructed.

The game gives me a huge impression on the style of GTA San Andreas while certain elements were kept from the previous game, such as its nonrealstic, cartoonish-like graphics. Some improvements were made in GTA 5 such as driving, which was a big flaw in GTA 4, however, the graphics made the game look a bit cartoonish not as realistic as in GTA 4. This is a huge resemblance to GTA San Andreas as the same nonrealistic graphical atmosphere was produced compare with Vice City. Overall, it is quite an entertaining game. The biggest difference in this game is the choice of different players you can pick from which result in different story endings.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2014"}
{"product_name":"B000Z9A95M","reviewerName":"icomputered","summary":"Not as good as I thought","reviewText":"I bought this game because I heard all these amazing things about it, and I'm a huge Zelda fan and I heard that this game was similar. I have to admit, after hearing all the hype my expectations were set pretty high, but they were not met. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a horrible game, just not as good as people made it seem (in my opinion). It's actually quite boring.My first problem with this game was the controls. Many times to advance through the game you need to draw certain shapes using the wii remote. But around 80% of the time, the game doesn't register what you draw. This becomes problematic when you are in the middle of a battle and you need to quickly attack a monster by drawing. Also, to dodge attacks in the game you need to shake your nunchuck in the direction you want Ami (the main character) to go. But that hardly ever works; Ami ends up jumping in the wrong direction or not jumping at all.Another problem with the game is it's cut scenes. Many times they are just very long, and there is a lot of talking. Normally this doesn't bother me with a game, but in this game the cut scenes were pretty boring to be quite honest. You do have the choice to skip them, but then you get lost because you don't know your objective or understand the story. And I hated the sounds that the people made when they talked. I think the game should have either had voice acting, or no voices at all. It sounded like the animals from Animal Crossing, except more annoying.The story of this game was pretty good. I didn't go too deep into the game because of the other problems, but basically there is this wolf named Amaterasu who is a Sun God. Her goal is to remove a curse over the land. She is accompanied by this little bug like creature named Issun who is similar to Navi in Zelda, except with more of an attitude. What bored me in this game was not the story itself, but the boring way it was presented (the cut scenes, the ridiculous amount of speaking, etc.)One thing that I liked about the game was the art style. The game looks beautiful. There were many moments where I just felt like stopping and taking in the incredible view.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2012"}

Players will find familiar names like Glass Joe, King Hippo and trainer Doc Louis. These boxers come to life again in cell-shaded 3-D, complete with hilarious fighting animations and backstories that capture all the fun and flair of the originalPunch-Out!!games.The Wii's Motion SensitivityThe motion-sensitive controls of the Wii console mean that when players throw punches, Little Mac throws punches as well. Additionally, you can control hooks and jabs by combining motion control with control-stick movement. The motion-sensing Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers turn real-life swings into on-screen punches, so anyone can play. The game can also be played with classic NES-style controls by turning the Wii Remote sideways.CharactersPunch-Out!!features a total of 13 opponents for Little Mac to step into the ring with. 12 of which are returning from previous games in thePunch-Out!!series. Each have their own backstory and patterns of attacks to learn and learn to counter. Just a few of the characters you can expect to see are:Little MacSmall but extremely game, Little Mac is a young, up-and-coming fighter, who with the help of his trainer, ex-champion Doc Lewis, has set his sights on working his way through the ranks.Glass JoeA fearful French fighter due to his extremely weak chin, Glass Joe will crumple to the mat quickly with just a few well-placed shots, making him an easy mark and a good warm-up for the fighters to follow.King HippoKing Hippo is both huge and an immensely powerful fighter, but can be weakened with the right combinations to the head and body, giving you time to go for the knockout if you can survive his onslaught.Von KaiserAn old-timey fighter whose rumored childhood difficulties have left him eager to dish out punishment in the ring, Von Kaiser is a dangerous opponent, but one who will turn tail if you can find his weakness.Special AttacksPlayers can obtain special 'Star Punches,' which allow Little Mac to take more health from his rival in a single punch. Players can now use multiple stars in a single punch for an extra-powerful attack.Controller OptionsPunch-Out!!features multiple controller options. For players looking to take advantage of the Wii's motion control capabilities,Punch-Out!!uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers to simulate throwing punches. Use the Nunchuck to throw a left punch and the Wii Remote to throw a right punch. Fans of the NES version and core gamers will be excited to see Nintendo has also included the option to playPunch-Out!!using the classic layout from the original NES controller. Use the 1 and 2 buttons along with the cross pad to throw hooks and jabs or to dodge.","reviewerName":"Deimos \".\"","summary":"A classic butchered.","reviewText":"Punchout was awesome, had great controls and was a fun challenge.

{"product_name":"B0044SA734","description":"","reviewerName":"C.E.","summary":"A day of RECKONING indeed!","reviewText":"I play games for a variety of reasons.  I play them to relax, to get lost in a world, to hear/play a good story, and I play them as a way to escape.  This game fits the bill on all of those accounts perfectly.  As a mature (read: over 30 years old) gamer, I have a different set of expectations that have grown and changes as I have gotten older.This game first appeared on my radar as word of R.A. Salvatore being involved trickled out onto the web.  I have played another game he was involved in, \"Demon Stone\" for the PS2.  As with that iteration, this one is well written- the story takes the cake.  Intrigue, plot twists, friends, foes, allies, and antagonists all take center stage in a tale that is fun and engaging here.  The main quest is a good yarn in and of itself, but veering off the well beaten path takes you to other villages, characters, problems, and areas that you would just as easily miss if you don't look around.  Superb writing, plotting, and setting.  The story might seem kind of contrived and a mash up of genre staples...but Salvatore weaves it all together into something wonderful.  I would have to say this game is like \"playing\" a very ambitious fantasy novel.The combat is easy to master, but still presents a challenge as enemies scale to your level, the fighting can get intense, and there are several moves and tactics that unlock as you level up that make all the zipping around the screen fun and satisfying.  The weapon and spell effts are nice, realized well, and graphically pleasing.  Intense colors, good sound design, and a freedom of movement lends itself to combat that doesn't feel stale and challenges you to mix it up and see what happens.  McFarlane's talent really shines through in the creature design and world art.  From things that are creepy to silly- there a quite a few vistas, creatures, plants, and areas to look at.  It is very pretty, vibrant, and busy.  Other areas are appropriately dark, somber, and decayed.  All in all- the game looks as good as it plays, and in may ways, the setting of Amalur is a character in and of itself.Collectors of in-game stuff rejoice!  As this game is packed with all you would come to expect from Rolston- the mad genius behind some \"Elder Scrolls\" games.  There are scraps of paper, books, lore stones, items, journals, lockpicks, chests, loot, and tomes to collect, read, and discover.  The info is doled out well and comes at a pace that encourages exploration.  There are several times (as I am not done with the game yet) where I have been distracted with a side quest just because I want to know more about what is happening in the world around me.  It lends itself to a very fleshed out feeling, a world fully developed, alive, and teeming with secrets to discover.  Again, this game is superb in its presentation on all of those accounts.Getting down to the technical details, there are systems that feel familiar, yet lend their own flair to the game.  Crafting, weapon/equipment repair, and reagent gathering are all things that have been done before.  They are integrated well with this game and the feeling of familiarity is helpful at keeps the learning curve from getting too steep.  There is not a physical manual included with the game...it is added to the disc.  I don't find that I miss it, as info in pretty easy to come by and the interface is user-friendly and easy to navigate.  Taking the best parts of past games, throwing in new ones, and whipping up a recipe for something new is a welcome addition to both the genre and the world of video games in general.  I haven't experienced a single glitch, hitch, or mess-up with the game on my system.  Load times are forgiveable and don't take forever- but then again, with the amount of content and data I don't expect instant load times.  The world is vast, expansive, and feels that way as well.  With that, fast travel isn't a \"must have\" but is something that I use quite often, just to traverse the distances that soon become very apparent.Others might say this game is too similar to \"Fable\" or some other megalithic MMO out there.  While I see some of the similarities, I also see that 38 studios has crafted an entirely different, yet familiar feeling, monster.  They have poured passion, heart, blood, sweat, and tears into this game- and it shows.  Its massive, teeming with things to discover, and presented in a beautiful package.  Combat, crafting, exploration, leveling, and play styles are all as fluid as you would want- they (the devs) have really tried to make an expansive and all-inclusive game- and they have come as close to perfection as is possible at this point in my opinion.So- buy this game if you are looking for some amazing value for your dollars.  Buy it if you want to see where I predict the next generations of RPG's will be going.  Buy it if you want an awesome story, amazing playability, and some great art.  Buy it if you are looking to really get into a game and not be finished in 10 hours.  This is hands down- one of the BEST games I have every played.  Simply amazing- worth every penny spent and then some.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXFKE","description":"","reviewerName":"Real Raleigh Reviewer","summary":"Spectacular environments but big QA issues in gameplay","reviewText":"Okay. I absolutely WANTED to love this game. It took some time. It is buggy, the maps have lots of crags, tree climbing and wolf (or cougar, mountain lion) fighting is infuriating. But the environments, the destructible objects, the animal hunting, the voice acting... it's spectacular. AC series set an ABSURDLY high bar for quality and this game doesn't quite hit the quality in terms of fluid game play and error-free mapping. But it does provide such a spectacular, immersing environment... it builds and expands on the last. It is deep, thoughtful, breathtaking, engrossing. Damn. I'm loving this game.The sword fighting in this game is just FABULOUS, absolutely fabulous. Wait until you're about 1/3 of the way through. HOW COOL!!!I have to dock a star for quality control but my overall review is:1. Be prepared to be extremely frustrated by some errors and challenges that just don't respond to controls properly; but2. You have to play this game. You simply must. Even a buggy Assassins Creed is so dramatically superior in environment quality, depth, storyline, and overall quality.Basically, a 4-star Assassins Creed is worth a 5+++ star anything-else. Still. Buy it. Play it. I'm won over.================As a preface, I'm an ENORMOUS Assassins Creed fan. I mean like a salivating, annoy-the-crap-out-of-your-wife-because-a-new-AC-game-is-coming-out-in-six-months-and-you-won't-stop-talking-about-it, serious fan. There were detractors from AC I, but I only read the reviews after I had played it... and I LOVED the entire game. Some mildly annoying controls but once you got the hang of what you could & couldn't do with your character, it was just unprecedented, engrossing, spectacular in every way. A splendid fiction, alternate-history type of novel rendered in a life-like virtual world. Now... fast-forward 3 more installments.I'm playing this on PS3. Without going into tremendous detail about what the game is / does well, I'll just say, it's more of the same - big environments, grand, impressive.This is a major regression in terms of both mapping quality and controls, however. You can parry, but there appears to be a bug in the counter-attack where it simply doesn't work most of the time for most weapons. This has shown up in many blogs and forums and there is no patch for it. Counter-attack really actually just doesn't work most of the time. For certain weapons, it never works. The viewing angles are deeply screwed; you'll be trying to outrun an enemy, then perch on something and stop. You get \"stuck\". They catch you and slash you. You're running and dodge to climb a ladder... you jump on the ladder, and just stop. There's a fluidity to your ability to traverse environments in II and Brotherhood that is completely lost here; you really just have to hope that in a dogfight, you can counter (usally cannot); in a chase, you don't get stuck when you want to keep running. There are also more mapping errors here probably than every prior AC game put together. That means, you will get stuck inside a surface, in an odd shape, your character will start to shake back and forth but you can't move. I've only been playing the singleplayer for a couple of hours but honestly, this is the same controls and the same fighting dynamics laid on top of a map that was released with just colossal QA problems. It is virtually impossible in this game to fight a group of enemies, not because you don't have the experience or weapons, but simply because your moves don't consistently work, the controls are fidgety and you get stuck SO often, so you aren't able to position yourself, or to flee when necessary. Overall, it's a great concept to follow on to a spectacular series, but the quality of gameplay is an ENORMOUS disappointment. If you're a big AC fan like I am, please be prepared to both be impressed with the new maps (graphically), and to be unbelievably frustrated with how clunky the controls and how buggy the maps are. Some of this is like the first game 5 years ago; if not worse. I thought this one came out pretty hot on the heels of Brotherhood and that short time to market really shows through pretty much from your first mission.The missions are buggy. I've had several times where I needed to escort someone or reach a point and there simply is no result. I've had to re-start from checkpoint to re-initialize the mission and it works. Latest version (as I'm writing this) is to escort Sam to the Green Dragon tavern; but there's no objective, no result. Going to the tavern has the result that it says \"You cannot interact with this while on a mission.\"It's also worth noting that about four missions ago (but not at any particular point in the storyline) I am no longer able to block / parry. At all. I've restarted the system a couple of times, no help. It looks like either a bug in play-through, or some kind of config corruption that got cached in my saved game's progress. I don't even know what to try here, but I'm revising the review down one more star.In this game, the first warning that you're too far from an ally or target comes a mere few seconds from de-synchronizing because you're too far. I've found very consistently that it is virtually impossible in almost all cases to react, and recover the distance, before you de-synchronize. That makes the warning essentially meaningless; you may as well just kill the character and send them back through and say, \"Tsk, be more careful next time.\" Given that there is a warning, you need a wider halo around the target/ally to actually be able to get yourself out of a sticky situation, or just get through a tough environment, and close the distance. Again, this is essentially useless. Another disappointing regression from the foregoing games.In some of the cut scenes, the characters' mouths don't move while they're talking. It's just a bug; they move sometimes; but it just doesn't always \"hook up\" with the dialogue occurring. That obviously doesn't impede game play but it cuts against the kind of extraordinary polish the foregoing games (particularly II and Brotherhood) showed when they hit the market.(tiny spoiler) Climbing trees is a neat concept but this implementation is a disaster. The character won't catch on to ledges, gets stuck in mapping errors, can't climb up to the next ledge, and jumps past the next leap and right off the tree, making about 1 out of every 10-20 attempts successful. Once you get to the point where big trees are viewpoints... give up hope. It's just miserable. You will find climbing trees in this game somewhat hateful. :(Wolves will kill you. Unfortunately there is no way to avoid this in the game. There are key-press sequences you have to hit in order to (theoretically) avoid being devoured but the only buttons that appear to work are the ones where you wrestle off the attacking wolf and lose half your life. The \"dodge\" button sequences are entirely non-functional on PS3. I've hit the sequence with absolute perfection (.1-.15s interval) and it still does not register. So far I have been attacked by wolves a good 200 times and have not once dodged the attack. I'm not sure there's a point in having a sequence of keypresses that does not actually work.Sorry. Bigger maps aren't better if you can't play the game on them anyway. This is just a very buggy, clunky game for AC. Just like the others, the environments and the concept behind it are spectacular, but this one simply doesn't play through. I LOVE Assassins Creed. I love the concept, I love the background, I've LOVED every game so far, including the first, which some found too clunky and tough to control - I didn't. This one is the worst of the lot so far... and I'm sad. :'(All that having been said (and, in earnest), the map, the textures, the shadows, the character models, are all just spectacular. If the premise of the game was \"a leisurely stroll around late-18th Century Boston\", this would be a fabulous, ground-breaking title. Perhaps primarily among the octogenarian gaming crowd, but it's REALLY good. I have to admit that a lot of the building size, the alleys and dead-ends and layout of the city does sort of strike me as chunks of Rome, Constantinople, and the other cities we visited in the previous games, simply with a different set of textures applied. It's only the fact that you're expected to move (fast, fluidly), to sometimes be aggressive and fight hard, sometimes evade, and that you're driving towards a goal, and in that respect, the game is a machine that works towards a goal. The frequent mapping errors, bugs in the fighting style, just draw out ugly quality issues in the game's physics engine and map quality that detract from an otherwise awe-striking world.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2012"}

Now, for the first time, players can see true depth of their environment without the need for special glasses. Super Mario is a 3D evolution of classic Mario platforming featuring new level designs and challenges.","reviewerName":"MisterMusicFan","summary":"An excellent entry in Mario's catalogue and the best 3DS original game yet","reviewText":"Since its debut last March, Nintendo 3DS owners (the select few that actually bought it upon its initial release, before the much-needed price cut) have been eagerly awaiting that one game that really popped out at you-quite literally, given the console's promises of fantastic 3-dimensional fun. Up until now, we have received no such game. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D and Star Fox 3D were of course excellent, but they were excellent the first time around too, over a decade ago. They were and still are great games but remakes nonetheless, meaning we had yet to see a truly strong 3DS original title. Thankfully, the days of slumming around with Nintendogs and other random third party romps are over, because the much-hyped Super Mario 3D Land has finally arrived.Admittedly, upon viewing several of the trailers, I wasn't expecting much. After Mario Galaxy massively upped the franchise's ante with compelling new gameplay elements and gorgeous new visuals and artistic stylization, SM3DL frankly came off as...drab. Most of the trailers displayed a very typical-looking Goomba-stomping romp through nondescript plains and platforms. It essentially resembled a lazier Mario 64 with some minor modernized updates. Thankfully, although it certainly doesn't break any major new ground, Super Mario 3D Land is by far the best original game on the handheld console so far and will likely go down as one of its best titles overall. Like Kirby's Return to Dream Land, it is a return to form very intelligent and precise in its execution: it gives tribute to some of the series' most memorable titles, and therefore its most dedicated fans, without ever degrading into rehashed schlock.As with the past several titles minus a select few, there essentially is no storyline. Bowser has Peach, time to get movin', you know the deal. Admittedly, although Mario games certainly aren't known for intricate plot twists, this setup is presented even sloppier than usual, competing with New Super Mario Bros. Wii for the least explanation of anything before hopping into random gameplay. At least games like Mario 64, Sunshine and Galaxy added some frills to why, how and where it all went down that particular time around. I'm all for paying tribute to classics, but I honestly don't think anyone would mind if Mario took a note from the Zelda franchise and got a little more adventurous with its villains for once-even if it just means Mario is rescuing Peach from someone other than Bowser. Thankfully, however, the lack of a story or reason behind this adventure is a mere footnote in what is actually a very fun game.The gameplay is something of a mish-mash between New Super Mario Bros. Wii and Mario Galaxy; you'll control Mario through a series of many different worlds, structured similarly to both the galaxies of Mario Galaxy and stages of Mario 64. Like Mario Galaxy 2, there's a bit of a mix between fully expansive 3-dimensional worlds and 2D side-scrolling; the exchange and incorporation between them both are consistently effective. Astoundingly, virtually every type of landscape ever contrived in a Mario game is accounted for here: there are the grassy plains and sandy deserts of Mario 64, blizzard-stricken ice worlds, ocean floors set to dreamy soundtracks a la Super Mario Bros. 3, puzzling ghost houses and sky-high platform paths like Super Mario World, sunny beaches inspired by both Sunshine and Galaxy, classic fiery boss castles, and even the candy-themed cookie and cracker platforms of Mario Galaxy 2.Mario retains just about all of his trademark moves, able to perform various types of jumps and attain power-ups for unique abilities. The big recurring theme in this game is the glorious return of the Tanooki suit, a beloved power-up originated in Super Mario Bros. 3. As in that game, the fluttering brown Super Leaf allows Mario to perform spin attacks and slow his descent, all while sporting a cutesy raccoon-eared suit. It does not, however, permit the ability of flight as before. The iconic Fire Flower also returns, allowing you to hurl bouncing fireballs in various directions to ignite torches, ice or enemies. There is one all-new power-up, the Boomerang Flower, which allows him to hurl a boomerang to attack enemies or snatch nearby items. The Propeller Box is also technically new, but based very heavily on the Propeller Suit of New Super Mario Bros. Wii. The box encases Mario while in use, allowing him to, you guessed it, propel to great new heights and then slowly descend or slam down as an attack. It is notable that it works essentially like a third level power-up, meaning if he is hit while in the box, he'll just lose the box, not his current power-up suit.The other new and returning power-ups are moderately nifty, but most players will be unlikely to use anything but the Tanooki Suit throughout a vast majority of the game, given that once you're accustomed to the masterful handling and accessibility of controlled descents, it can feel like a handicap to go without it. Although the Boomerang Suit is pretty cool, more new power-ups would've really beefed up the gameplay experience. Mario Galaxy 2 may have been a tad rehash-y, but the Cloud and Rock Suits made for some of the plumber's most intuitive, exciting abilities yet. Also, although it may be referred to as the `Tanooki Suit' in advertisements and otherwise, the power-up you'll be offered in the first half of the game is actually the Raccoon Suit, which only allows for use of the tail, not the ability to transform into a statue, which the actual Tanooki Suit allowed for in SMB3. The legit Tanooki Suit is in fact in this game, however-you just won't gain access to it until the game's second and much more difficult quest. When you do, you will once again be able to transform into a stone statue, rendering you temporarily invincible and able to crush obstacles beneath your fall.The gameplay itself sports quite a bit of throwback; there is an entire level fashioned after the original Super Mario Bros., featuring straightforward side-scrolling elements as well as renditions of pixilated sprites of various characters (and you'll even get fireworks and a particularly memorable tune played as you slide down the end-of-level flag). Fans should also keep their eyes and ears open for the Legend of Zelda-themed level, which is a very notable delight. The game also marks the return of Boom Boom, the grumpy turtle mini-boss from Super Mario Bros. 3. Like the aforementioned Kirby's Return to Dream Land, SM3DL is essentially a big tribute, and something diehard Mario fans are quite likely to totally gush over. This is platforming at its best, and expectedly the Mario series' return to form sets a trailblazing standard for the genre.In addition, it is by far the system's best use of the 3D feature yet; the scenery quite literally pops out at you, and allowing a heavier sense of depth perception throughout the levels allows for very precise timing and accuracy with every minute movement-you're unlikely to suffer frequent deaths at the expense of stupid mistakes, the inability to tell how far you're supposed to fall or jump, or a misjudgment of how close something is to you. The increased depth perception also allows for a greater sense of realism, which really helps pull the gamer directly into the game. You'll feel compelled to explore every nook and cranny of the vast worlds around you, with several instances of freefalling onto skyward platforms providing some of Mario's most thrilling moments ever. The graphics themselves are also gorgeous and really push the system's limits-most of these visuals could in all honesty be seen on a home console and you'd be hard-pressed to find a naysayer.In a nutshell, although a stronger storyline and greater variation of power-ups would've really tightened things up (and incorporating Yoshi would've really amped the fun factor, as always), the game is an absolute must-have for any 3DS owner, particularly avid Mario junkies. This is the game we've honestly all been waiting for, and one that finally delivers the handheld console's big promise.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2011"}

While not the first game to offer enhanced control with Sony's  dual-stick analog controller,Ape Escapeis the first game to require either an analog ordual shock controllerto play. That requirement  ensures that players will have full control of their hero, Spike. One stick moves Spike in any direction,  while the other swings his monkey-catching devices.InApe Escape, a circus monkey named Specter stumbles upon a scientist's prototype  intelligence-enhancing helmet, turning him into an evil monkey genius. As Spike, the professor's young  friend, you must travel through time to clean up all of the monkeys Specter has sent back in his attempt to  repopulate the world. If that's not enough to make you laugh, then chasing his goofy monkey minions as  they scurry from your clutches will certainly tickle your funny bone. You'll discover a variety of gadgets to  help you in your quest, including monkey radar, a slingshot, and a propeller for flying. Spanning 25 huge  levels,Ape Escapeis approachable for novices, and offers added challenges for veteran gamers.  One such challenge is to lure a dinosaur near a rocky cliff, and then jar the monkey off his back and into  your net. Note: no monkeys were harmed in the creation of this game.--Jeff YoungPros:Unique control scheme brings new challenge to the PlayStationMassive game has plenty of replay valueCons:Unique control scheme requires some ramp-up time","reviewerName":"Chris H","summary":"Best platformer on the PS1","reviewText":"What can I say?

My kids love it! They have a great time playing and there is enough difficulty that it keeps them from getting through too easily. There is a variety of gameplay here, from free form type, go where you please, to structured, you must go a certain way kind of mission. There are quest type missions as well as shoot 'em up missions. A little bit for everyone. Some of it is a little lame, but what I think is lame, my daughter thinks is fun. This is a one or two player game. The graphics are great. Nothing ever slows down. It is a simple but fun game and should provide hours of entertainment. This really should be 4.5 stars, but there isn't enough to round up. The only annoying thing, and probably what keeps it from hitting a five is that it does have to stop and load more often than any other game I have (and I have a lot of games, PS3, 360, and Wii).

It still is a good game that continues Legend's storyline, and graphically it still looks really good.Overall, this is a great HD collection by Square Enix.  It also includes a PS3 theme and several behind-the-scenes videos for all three games, as well as PS Home costumes.

It's as close to \"art\" as games get in my book.I'm not going to go into detail because plenty of other reviews have done so.  But one of the things that I find so affecting is the premise that the main character must kill these giants in order to save his love, but this creates an undercurrent of sadness.  These giants are not destroying cities or harming anyone (that we see or know of), but they must be taken down to fulfill the quest.  A bit of a moral dilemma in my mind, and one of the things that makes the game interesting.The game mechanics are \"good enough\".  This is not finely-tuned gameplay, necessarily, it's a bit rough, but it's very playable and ultimately that roughness is part of the charm (sort of).  I don't know - it lends an air of human fallibility to the proceedings.If you're willing to still play PS2 games (which I do) and are looking for something different, give it a shot.  I always like finding quirky, odd titles, and this is one of them.

Weapons of mass destruction, deployed with complete impunity razed the land in the blink of an eye. The dire situation forced the two opposing factions to negotiate a cease-fire and an agreement was quickly reached, but although the war may have ended, its effects remained. With the deteriorating environment, Earth's population was drastically reduced and those who survived lived a confined existence trapped in underground cities. Eventually countries joined together to form the Greater United Nations and turned their eyes skyward, to space. With the establishment of the USTA, the Universal Science and Technology Administration, man began to seek new worlds beyond the stars.AD 2087...The first year of the spacedate (SD) calendar. Thanks to the success of Professor Trillas Bachstein's warp drive experiments, mankind's dream of a spacebourne existence has inched closer to reality and the USTA secretly began to implement its SRF project, the Space Reconnaissance Force. Now it is SD 0010, and the first official SRF mission and your adventure has begun.CharactersPlayers ofStar Ocean: The Last Hopewill meet and interact with a wealth of characters from different parts of the galaxy, each with their own history and weapons of choice. Just a few of the more prominent characters to familiarize yourself with include:Edge MaverickAlthough generally possessing good judgment, this young Earthling commander of the maiden deep space voyage of the SRF ship the Calnus, can be reckless. His signature weapon is the sword.Faize Sheifa BelethA young Eldarian committed to etiquette and logic, and capable of astounding feats of engineering, Faize is always honorable of those possessing abilities he lacks. His signature weapon is the rapier.Reimi SaionjiThe kind and levelheaded navigator of the Calnus, Reimi was born in an aristocratic Saionji family and has a shared history with Edge back on Earth. Her signature weapon is the bow.Lymle Lemuri PhiOrphaned on her home planet of Lemrick long ago, Lymle is mischievous, but friendly and inexplicably retains the appearance of a young girl. Her signature weapon is the wand.Gameplay and CombatAlthough Edge Maverick is the main character inStar Ocean: The Last Hope, players will of course experience gameplay action in the form of a number of different characters and utilize the signature attacks assigned to each. The game features a real-time combat system which allows for up to four party members to remain active in battle at a time. Improvements to the game's combat system include 'Rush Mode,' where players can switch out active members of their combat groups for reserve members in real-time; 'Sight In/Sight Out' which allows for timed evasive and counter moves against enemies; and the BEAT (Battle Enhancement Attribute Type) system, through which players can change a character's fighting style at will. Other actions players will master through gameplay include piloting of the spaceship Calnus, a first in theStar Oceanseries; item creation in the form of weapons, healing items and accessories; and Private Actions (PAs), a cause and effect relationship between character in-game actions and the acquisition of new abilities and scenarios. Through the increased flexibility mastery of all these skills provides, players should be able to more easily increase their team and individual team member's combat experience and status, and so unlock more advanced combat styles and linked combinations.Key Game Features:Series prequel-Star Ocean: The Last Hopeis a prequel in the classic series, combining sci-fi and fantasy elements, spanning multiple planets and the vastness of space itself to recount the origins of the Star Ocean universe.Exciting Battles- Exhilarating combat expands upon the franchise's famous real-time battle system, including the amazing graphics and visual effects only possible on Xbox 360.Compelling Scenes- The game features breathtaking CG movies by Visual Works, the cutting-edge studio whose previous work includes cutscenes for the acclaimed Final Fantasy RPG series.","reviewerName":"M.D.C. \"Tempting Reviews\"","summary":"Seems like some people need to get their TVs replaced.","reviewText":"\"Terrible graphics!!!\"That's what stands out when I read all of these reviews.  I find nobody that thinks these are great graphics.  Hmm.  I'll get back to this.Anyway, Star Ocean: The Last Hope is the fourth of the series.  Its roots are in space and time travel, and often takes place on faraway planets, though its protagonist is generally from Earth.  The first Star Ocean (Blue Sphere) never came stateside; instead, we got Star Ocean: The Second Story.  During a time when the first PlayStation was hurting for role-playing games, this was a breath of fresh air.  It introduced concepts that were new to gamers but taken for granted since: synthesis, cooking, and customization.  In truth, The Second Story was really a 100+ hour game if you wanted to accomplish all there was to do.What The Second Story also brought to the table was challenge.  Other games were hard, but TSS is known even to this day as having one of the worst final bosses in RPG gaming history, a man known only as Indalecio.  His original form was bad enough, but when you went to a certain private action, he became \"Unlimited Indalecio\", a true GOD that gamers were not worthy of.  Being level 99 didn't do you any good either.  That's not even counting the bonus dungeon's boss, Iseria Queen, who is even worse.  Bottom line - the game was blatantly difficult near the end.Star Ocean: Till The End Of Time was released on PlayStation 2, and it wasn't well received by gamers, mostly because for the most part it deviated from what made Star Ocean so good.  But what gamers don't see is that the third game actually added a piece of gaming goodness to the overall series.  It introduced a new character in Welch Vineyard, adored by fans, almost to cultish dimensions.  It also had a lot of small \"throwback\" things like science centers named after famous inventors in the previous and subsequent games, and bonus dungeon battles with notable characters from the past.  It wasn't a bad game really...and didn't get the fair shake it deserved.Not too long ago came two PSP remakes: Star Ocean: The First Departure and Star Ocean: The Second Evolution, based on the first and second Star Ocean games, respectively.  While the gameplay is identical, these are definitely remakes in that a number of things were changed, most notably the difficulty of the second game being toned down and the skill tree being a lot more friendly than before.  For those that never played the first game, First Departure was a great opportunity to find out what the first game was about, and when you play it, you get a better sense of the overall storyline.Enter The Last Hope.  This story takes place prior to the events of the first Star Ocean (using First Departure as a reference point), so if you never played the other games, a lot of the things you'll notice won't go over with you, but if you did play the others, you'll hear music that will remind you of each game, and meet characters that you either recall from the other game or who must be related to others from the previous games.  There's definitely a lot of fan service to be had here.Your protagonist is Edge Maverick, a young crewman on the Calnus.  A disaster on Earth has rendered the planet unsuitable for human life, and the SRF (the organization you belong to) has been ordered to seek out habitable planets to identify their viability as a new place to live.  If that story sounds familiar, at least somewhat, it's actually quite close to the story in Star Trek III: The Wrath of Khan, and one of the Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes where terraformers are attempting to find planets that would be suitable for colonization.  Unlike those however, a space \"bubble\" knocks you and your other ships off course, causing you to crash land on your first planet.  While the plan appears to be quite like Earth, there is a darker side (this story is commonly seen on the original Star Trek).  You can hopefully see where I'm going with this...there's also some instances of time travel that are quite interesting, yet infuriating at the same time.  You'll end up hopping from planet to planet to achieve your objective.Now that you have a sense of the basic storyline, let's get to the game itself.  As mentioned before, it spans three full DVDs; that's over 13GB of data, for those too lazy to do the math.  You can do the install to the hard drive, but be forewarned that there is a going speculation that doing so causes the game to freeze.  I did experience a freeze, but I can't confirm for a fact that the install was the cause.  I do installs to keep my drive from going out, and don't intend to stop anytime soon.  Part of the problem with the spanned disks is that different planets are so large that they literally exist on specific discs.  I know other games have the same issue.  The problem is that if you wanted to go back to an older planet (and you will have to, for mining and such), you need to insert that disc.  What I don't know yet is whether or not you can just install all three discs and avoid the disc swapping altogether.  I assume you can, but haven't yet tested that theory.  Seems though that you'd still need to swap discs, since the 360 requires the disc be in the drive in order to even access the stored data.The music in the game is quite excellent, but for the fact that the tracks are quite short indeed.  Older Star Ocean games also had short tracks, but keep in mind they were limited by the space on CDs during the PlayStation era.  Either they kept the tracks short in order to emphasize the nostalgia, or they just didn't have the space left over to accommodate the music tracks in full.  Of particular exception are the tracks from older planets like Roak (First Evolution) where the music from that game is playing, instantly inciting nostalgia.  The extremely short, repeating nature of these beautiful tracks is the only issue here.  As far as the voice acting, people are complaining about it, but I found it quite good, honestly.  I mean compare this voice acting to Infinite Undiscovery or Tales of Vesperia...and you see there is no comparison.  At least in this game, the personality of each character is brought to life extremely well, except for maybe Reimi (because she sounds like every other video game heroine).  Part of the measure of good voice acting is whether you are emotionally moved by the character when they're speaking about something - and yes, some people don't get moved at all by game characters - but when someone like Lymle is expressing how sad she is, in a way a child definitely would in the same situation, you can't help but appreciate the voice acting that much more.In terms of challenge, I found the game to be quite balanced compared to other RPGs of this style.  Regular enemies for the most part are not difficult; you do get multiple difficulty settings to choose from, but even on the harder settings you can still reasonably work your way through the majority of regular enemies.  They're aggressive, but your characters are even more aggressive.  Once you master all of the nuances of battle, you will find yourself breezing through the majority of battles without a scratch.  The challenge comes in when you encounter bosses though - these behemoths (and they're always behemoths, aren't they) will almost always give you at least a slight challenge, whether it's juggling you in the air, blasting you with flames or freezing you to death.  But that's how it should be, in my opinion: regular enemies are moderately challenging, bosses even more so, but neither so difficult as to throw your controller against a wall.Speaking of battle, the gameplay engine in The Last Hope is a throwback to the older Star Ocean games who really pioneered the action battle along with the Tales series...but The Last Hope threw in just a little bit of uniqueness to break the mold.  Here you control your main character as he hacks his way to victory, and yes, you can take control of your other characters as you see fit.  But this game offers some flavor.  You can do some short range jumps in the four directions; so to the left/right, toward or away from your enemy.  This is great if you need to dodge, or cut down distance to your enemy to effectively defeat them.  You can also transition from the jump into the Blindside attack, which allows you to quickly run behind your enemy.  If done correctly, not only will you dodge the attack, but you will surprise the enemy and do critical hits on their backside.  From there you can throw regular or special attacks; even chain special attacks together if you've got a skill that allows you to do so, racking up major damage.  Rounding out the feature is the Rush attack, which can be best described as a limit break.  When executed, you and another team member will unleash a flurry of blows to one enemy to multiply the damage dealt.  I found myself not really using this, simply because it takes a long time to build up the gauge that drives it, and the damage wasn't all that great compared to regular attacking and special moves.As you fight and pull of special attacks, you'll build up slots on the Bonus Board, which gives you various bonuses such as Exp and Fol.  It also can give you free SP which can be used to build up your skills, or HP/MP to heal you after each battle.  But be careful; the enemy can destroy part of your Bonus Board if they hit you hard or frequently enough, so you really can't just bull rush every single fight.  You need to pay attention and stay on the move in order keep the advantage.  The Bonus Board also apparently disappears when you save and cut the game off, which I understand, but don't care for.Making a return in a toned down fashion is the item creation feature.  In Star Ocean 1 and 2, you could create items anywhere you wanted just by having the skill active.  That meant cooking, alchemy, blacksmithing, etc...could all be done on the road so you could get stuff ready for that next cheating boss.  Star Ocean 3 (Till The End Of Time) did away with this and centralized Item Creation to Welch Vineyard, with some exceptions.  The Last Hope forces you to go back to the Calnus whenever you want to do any Item Creation whatsoever.  While this does increase the strategy, it becomes a bit of a chore, because not only do you have to do the creation back at the Calnus, but also the recipe creation (you can't just find the recipes out and about and you can't just randomly mix ingredients to make stuff like parts 1 and 2).  Some characters are better than others at specific skills, and unlike the previous games, you won't have a situation where the entire team can do blacksmithing or alchemy; each character has a specialty that they stick with, and while each character might have tendencies toward one skill or another, they will never do it better than the one who owns the skill.  It is good to see Welch back of course, but her \"edginess\" has been toned down from part 3.  No more witnessing her 'special dreams' here, as she's really just a holographic projection from Earth headquarters.The Last Hope boasts some rather massive landforms for each planet and expansive dungeons.  It will take you a couple of hours AT LEAST to complete a specific area, assuming you're not rushing.  This has to do with the size of the areas, but also some of the puzzles that are thrown at you, which honestly aren't bad as..say...Equinox (SNES game), but they're certain to get on your nerves.  What's funny is that often the item you need or the door you need to go into is just very cleverly concealed, and when you do find it, you'll likely groan at just how hard you made stuff on yourself.  That's what the game does well: force you to feel bad about yourself because it seems like something is really difficult, when it actually is dirt simple.Okay, boys and girls...the graphics.  I save the best for last.  All I've seen on every review is how the graphics are poor.  Quite honestly, I think people need to upgrade their TVs or they don't know how to configure their TVs properly, because on my DLP LED 61\" Samsung (http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-HL61A750-61-Inch-1080p-Powered/dp/B001415FIG/ref=cm_cr-mr-title), this game is as beautiful as they come.  I've heard people say Lost Odyssey looks better?  Nuh uh.  The individual hair strand detail of The Last Hope blows Lost Odyssey away, and at times the true 3D effect is so pronounced as to be mind blowing.  The draw distance is the best yet, and looking out on some planets makes you truly feel as though you've traveled to another place; Roak is a prime example of this.  I believe what people are having issue with is the bloom lighting effect; it is somewhat strong, but no more so than Gears of War, which is what this game looks like.  It uses the Unreal engine, I'm told...as did Infinite Undiscovery, another beautiful game - and the game is simply gorgeous, all the way around.  There are some intermittent places where the blending was not done properly, most notably in some shadowed areas, but it's the exception rather than the rule.  Setting contrast just below maximum, brightness at max, and sharpness midway results in just a striking game.  People...upgrade your sets please.So what are the game's issues?  In a nutshell, I wasn't happy with the fact that the Blindside doesn't always execute.  You'll follow the conditions explicitly, yet nothing will happen, and then you get put in a spot where you are getting pummeled.  Or you'll do the Blindside, it executes, but you get cut off by another attack that didn't even touch you.  Or my personal favorite, when you try to dodge enemies on the field, and get stuck behind an invisible object (hit detection issue with some of the scenery) and get attacked from behind.  All issues with the engine, and not the overall game, which I find to be quite excellent.  Not perfect, just excellent.In summary: I have no idea what these other cats are talking about putting this game down.  This game clearly pushes the 360's capabilities more than most of the other games that are out for the system, and hopefully KOEI and others can sit up and observe how it's done.  This is a must buy, in my opinion, and I hope to see other games like this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2009"}

The graphics, sound, and gameplay are all top-notch, and it has more storyline and history than you can shake a stick at.  If you haven't seen the demo or downloadable movie preview, download it or buy/rent Zone of The Enders and check it out.  You'll be hooked.  They've improved on the original Metal Gear Solid in every way possible; all the control and view issues I had problems with in the first game are gone, and the gameplay has more depth and new moves, weapons, and tactics for you to learn.  The story picks up a few years after the first (or rather, third) game left off, and some very interesting documents you can access from the game menus give a fresh perspective on the behind-the-scenes events of the first game.So what's wrong with MGS2?  Nothing, if you ask me, but a number of reviewers have taken issue with it being &quot;boring&quot; and having an ending that mostly consists of an hour of watching video cutscenes instead of running around and shooting things (although there's a decent amount of that leading up to the end).  This is *not* a shoot-em-up game.  It says right on the box: &quot;Tactical Espionage Action&quot;, not &quot;Vaporize Terrorist Scum&quot;.  You spend a lot of time sneaking around and avoiding people, listening in on conversations and the like -- your end-of-game ranking actually gets *worse* if you kill enemies (there's a tranqulizer gun available for those times when you have to incapacitate someone, if you don't want to kill them).  And on the higher difficulty settings, you don't have a choice; you'll quickly be wiped out if discovered and attacked.  The plot is long, twisted, and makes the one in Metal Gear Solid seem simple by comparison.  Be prepared for surprises.As for the ending, it isn't a simple &quot;they stop the terrorists and all live happily ever after&quot; affair -- and frankly, if you were expecting one, you'd be disappointed.  It is fairly long (though punctuated by several boss fights), but if you care about figuring out *why* everything in the game is happening, and who's really behind the terrorist conspiracy (and who this Raiden guy you've been playing as really is), it's very interesting.  After you've seen it, though, you'll probably have more questions about what was going on than you did halfway through the game.  I'm already waiting for MGS3.So, if you have some patience, feel sneaky, and want an incredibly cinematic gaming experience, pick up Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons Of Liberty.  Otherwise, stick to Red Faction, where you can blow things up to your heart's content.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2001"}

Mario Party requires you to unlock the games by playing and winning coins, which can be very tedious and time-consuming. Also, the menu system in Wii Party is excellent; you can tell which games can be played with X number of participants, and you can also very easily tell how long the games will take (in terms of minutes) so you know how much time you need to invest in each game type.All in all, I am very pleased with this game, and I'm having a blast bonding with my family!!

{"product_name":"B0047ODJAI","description":"","reviewerName":"Red Baron \"Rdeschain\"","summary":"Good Game Worth the Money","reviewText":"I just finished playing the game all the way from beginning to end on Zealot, it took a while but I eventually beat the game, and am headed back to beat the game on normal, some people think that all of a games flaws are highlighted when you play a game on the harder difficulties, and after beating this game I would have to agree. Certain parts of the game were extremely frustrating, and other parts were too easy, the flaws all shined like little angry gems. That being said, this is a great game I think it is a four star game, the collectors edition may not be for every one, I think it comes with an additional game, \"Dead Space Extraction\" but that may just be an hour long demo, I stopped playing it after five minutes to play the real game. Anyway, Collectors edition may not be for every one, then get the regular edition, You will be happy that you did, Or at least engrossed in the game for a number of hours.In Depth:Graphics: are good they are similar to the first game with a little bit more polish, the environments are engaging and you find your self in situations (if you were a fan of the first game) that add to the overall story and world that they were trying to create, instead of the same four walls over and over they give you an environment in a similar fashion to the Bio Shock franchise.Game Play: Was tough on zealot, will update when I finish on normal which should be a breeze on Game Plus, Cool feature is the the stuff carries over to easier difficulty settings, I do not think it carries up (like resident evil 5). Some of the things I did not like was the fact that you can not dodge and the number of times I was killed with one hit attacks from behind, but I did play on the hardest difficulty (besides hardcore). But on the plus side you can aim and move at the same time, a feature that Resident Evil Five did not have, even though you could hit square to dodge some attacks, so the long and short of it is, the game play is similar to the first game, with a couple of fun surprises \"don't want to ruin the game\".For fans of cut scenes this game has next to none, its pretty much all gameplay all the time, unfortunately sometimes you will find your self doing a certain sequence over and over, and their is no way to speed up this game at points, unless of course you do not die ten times as I did.If you are a fan of the over the shoulder third person shooter as I am, you will want to add dead space to you library, if your not interested in the little toy get the standard edition, a lot of amazon customers did not like the no batteries included policy, or have the brains to figure it out as you can see with all of the one star reviews which focus more on the trivial crap in the box, and less on the game itself, I am not a huge fan of the incidental junk and will probably save the 20 bucks in the future, unless of course they gave me a 15 dollar game as part of the bonus features, So, Thats the skinny.Will update after I beat the game on normal, Wanted to put something up after I beat it on Zealot, First play-through.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2011"}

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-Fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.Xbox LIVE support including LIVE Achievements.","reviewerName":"Q","summary":"Great idea and graphics, very poor implementation.","reviewText":"This game has a lot of -things-, little effects and cool ideas for abilities, however, the use of these abilities is incredibly linear. You have only particular places you can do -your thing-. Where, in any other shooter, someone would leave an ammo create, they leave a broken ammo create you have to restore. What does this add to the game play? A button push.Swapping weapons takes about 3 to 4 seconds, as does reloads. They attempted to make this game fast paced, however, these reolad and swap times don't support this. So you will find yourself running away from small explody insect dudes, who are one kill shots, instead of facing them down because the reload time/swap time is so pathetic.Healing suffers the same as reloading and ability use, they have too much freaking animation time. So you will get eaten by -little tiny, one hit kill, insect dudes in a swarm-, simply because, when you push the heal button, the character spends about 4 second animating the heal, unable to shoot, and WALKING SLOWLY whilst doing so.Same with the abilities. They use the same buttons for multiple abilities. This leads to issues where you want to zap a group of insect dudes, however, your other more pathetic ability kicks in and you simply zap the one dude. In this case, it's restart from save point, restart from save point.This all reminds me of getting into a combo move in street fighter, unable to break out of it, while getting the beat down by the bad guy.Story, meh.

{"product_name":"B00026RFI2","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"Third times a charm","reviewText":"Have you ever wondered what, exactly, millions of fans see in the Dragon Ball Z cartoon? To outsiders, it's all a bunch of grunting, name-calling, and \"powering up\" for half an hour every day with maybe the occasional punch thrown on the first and third Thursdays of the month. It's just this sort of outsider who should try out Budokai 3, though not only is it a fun, accessible fighting game, but it's also the first DBZ game to completely capture the feel of the TV show. The developers at Dimps have obviously spent lots of time polishing up Budokai 3's fighting engine, which is now closer to the anime's feel than ever before. As in previous games, every character has a basic set of abilities to work with,the typical punch, kick, guard, and ki blast,which can be further modified with skill capsules. Once you put a few hours into the single-player Story mode and score a decent enough skill set, you'll be able to unleash all manner of special moves in the classic dial-a-combo tradition.In Budokai 3, however, there's an entirely different and far deeper approach to defense. There are real counters now. For example, if you press the guard button and a direction at the right moment against an oncoming attack, your character will teleport out of harm's way (usually to the side of his opponent) and get a free crack at starting some offense of his own. This opens up an array of strategic possibilities in every match,teleportation takes up ki power, so you can't rely on it all the time, but countering is also one of the easiest ways to turn the tide of a particularly nasty combo.This counter system also comes into play during beam struggles if two opponents fire off beams at once, they'll lock in midair and you'll have to overpower your enemy's blast by bashing the buttons. The result is a much more balanced fighting mechanic, which serves both DBZ fans and gamers simply interested in a fighter that feels good to play. Of course, this isn't what makes Budokai 3 special. After all, there are dozens of well-implemented fighting games out there already. This game doesn't really shine until you check out the presentation,the toon shading looks better than ever, and the special moves, while not exactly the sort of thing you'll find in a \"serious\" fighter, look and feel like they're straight out of the TV show. It's a shame, though, that the Story mode still seems a bit unfinished: Although you have more freedom to explore the world and find hidden items, the story scenes look rushed and jump around without much explanation, making things confusing even for DBZ maniacs. Still, the weak Story mode is the only blemish on what's otherwise the best DBZ game yet. If you think you could produce a better DBZ show than Funimation, now's your chance,nothing comes closer to the feel of the original anime than this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2005"}

By no means did I think they were super awesome, but they were fun to play and the single player campaign seemed worth it.With judgment, something just feels stale. The single player campaign is short, and the story itself is lackluster. All you basically do is pick up a different gun and kill enemies in different ways in order to earn stars and other things based on different conditions. Gears of War has never been incredible as far as delivering memorable characters, but I had some fun seeing the interaction between Baird, Sam, Cole, and others in the previous games. With this game, I don't think that the new characters suck, but they were definitely not developed that well. I found myself becoming less and less interested on finishing it.In all honestly, I feel that the developers may have become too accustomed to how successful the other games may have been and did not really add a lot of value to this game. The graphics don't seem to have changed one bit. In fact, I found myself wondering why they looked subpar.The multiplayer is fun to a certain extent, and it was actually better than the main campaign, which disappoints me because I consider multiplayer to be an added bonus not something to outshine the single player experience.If you like a shooter with an under average storyline and a main goal to pick up different guns and kill, kill, kill, this is the game for you. If you're looking for more, maybe wait 'till the price drops.All in all, it is a decent game, but definitely not worth brand new game price. I really hope this doesn't mean that Gears of War will become like many other games that keep getting released just to have a game and have very little value added to them. It will be very disappointing to know another series has done that.In my opinion, I think it would be best to buy this game when it is on sale, and I mean big sale. It just didn't have all the elements that would warrant it a new game price. It saddens me to say it, but the game felt old.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2013"}

I previously owned several xbox 360's that all failed, but I heard they resolved the issue with the latest ones so I gave it a shot. While the kinect and dance central 2 was fun for a while, it wore out its novelty and soon I wanted to start trying out other games. So I figure I can just go pick up some of the big xbox games to play like Halo 4. It's a xbox game, and MS surely wouldn't be stupid enough to sell a ton of consoles that can't actually play their games right? Well that's where I was wrong, because thanks to the paltry 4gb of storage space I couldn't play Halo 4 multiplayer, Mass Effect 3, or any other game that requires enough space for even a moderate sized installation/download. I am told you can get around this by plugging in USB flash drive, but it'll get formatted in the process and can't be used for anything else. Nickle-and-diming has always been a MS policy with the controllers still requiring AA batteries instead of anything rechargeable like on competing products. Kind of ridiculous that you can't watch Netflix or Hulu without paying for xbox live, and I wasn't going to pay for Xbox live again when I couldn't even play halo 4 multiplayer.It's true what they say, you get what you pay for, and in this case you get half of the real xbox 360. At this point there's no point in buying a 360 now, not until the prices drop after the new xbox one gets launched. The controller feels nice enough, and it runs quieter than the previous ones, but I still ended up with a console that can't actually do its job. This definitely soured my experience with MS even further, and I would recommend anyone that's checking out the xbox to check out Nintendo or the PS3. I've personally bought the PS3 after my 4th xbox 360 died of a RROD and I have been much happier for it. The Xbox 360 is a fine platform, and the one to go to if you want action-heavy games like Halo and Gears of War. But I've found that if you want the real games built around fantastic stories and excellent production values - you have to look at Sony with games like Last of Us and Heavy Rain or Nintendo with classics like Zelda.Based on my long history with Microsoft consoles (owned the first Xbox and now 5 xbox 360's) - steer clear of them until they get their game together. Once they start putting the consumer first again and stop trying to squeeze more money out of you at every turn I'll give them another look. Until then don't bother.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2013"}

Rhodes","summary":"A Good Port With Some Good Extras","reviewText":"Pros:+Fairly good story+Very inventive battle system+Very good game; even better looking on the PS3+A Great soundtrackCons:-Very linear-Slow story-Lackluster voice acting-There are moments when the game is just all out preachyEternal Sonata was released on the XBOX360 in 2007 and was largely overlooked by gamers.  The game is now being given a second chance to appeal to most gamers.  For the most part you're getting the same game you got a year ago with a few extras.  It's a little hard to say whether or not it's worth getting a second time if you already played it before.Eternal Sonata is largely focused on Fredric Chopin.  He lies on his deathbed, unconscious and dreams of a world.  In this world, those who can use magic are terribly sick and dying of illness.  The citizens of this world are also in a bit of despair as Count Waltz continues an unpopular rule and stands against the people.  The story is actually not a bad one.  Unfortunately it isn't always presented as well.  In the first place, the voice acting just isn't the best out there.  Some of it is rather dry and emotionless.  The voices themselves aren't bad, but the emotion is almost non-existent in most of them.  The story also moves somewhat slowly, and that's strange given that Eternal Sonata is not a very long game.  Also, some will probably not appreciate that the game eventually becomes incredibly preachy throughout its final moments.While it may not present its story as strongly as it could, it's gameplay is still as strong as ever.  The battle system for Eternal Sonata is one of the most inventive in the genre.  It's a turn based game but adds an active element.  When a character's turn comes up in battle, they all have what's called an action gauge.  When their turn starts the action gauge counts down.  During this time you can do whatever you like until it runs out.  Mostly you'll be mashing on the attack button to get out as many hits as you can.  You can also execute special attacks.  It's a very easy battle system to grasp, but it's hard to master.  This is because the battle system never stays entirely the same.  You also have a party level that increases as the game goes on and it changes how the battle system works.  For example, at Party level 1 the action gauge decreases only when you move, and stops decreasing when you stop. When you hit party level 2, however, the action gauge never stops.  It adds a lot of variety to the game but also makes sure that battling is always interesting.The battle system also has special moves that characters can use, but they change based on whether or not you're in the light or the shade.  Some enemies will also change form depending on if they're in the light or the shade.  It adds some strategy to the game, but in the end Eternal Sonata still feels like a button mashing affair.  Along those lines, the game is not that hard.  When you really grasp the battle system and learn it, accumulating large amounts of damage becomes consistent.There isn't a whole lot that's been added to the PS3 version, but some of it is rewarding.  Characters can change their costumes, there are now two new playable characters who were unplayable in the 360 version and a couple of new dungeons.  On the other hand, Eternal Sonata is still short and largely linear game.  It's nice that there are a few more extras than the average port but they still don't make a huge difference in the gaming experience as a whole if you have the 360 version.  In short, if you haven't played Eternal Sonata and you want to, the PS3 version is the better choice.  If you've already played through the 360 version, however, there's not much here to entice you to play through it again.One huge noticeable difference between the PS3 and 360 versions, however, is by far the visuals.  The animations are smoother and more vibrant on the Playstation 3.  Eternal Sonata was already an incredible looking game to begin with, but the Playstation 3 brings out a lot more in the visuals.Musically, Eternal Sonata still has some of the best in the industry.  You'll even hear some of Chopin's own music at certain moments and get a little bit of a historical background on him.  Eternal Sonata's biggest strength is easily its soundtrack.In the end, Eternal Sonata is still a good game.  If you have it on the 360 it's not really that different, nor does it include enough new content worth making it worth a second buy, but for those who haven't played it, it's another chance to play a pretty good game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2008"}

It's a strange game tho, very japanese in nature and Chopin looks very young (15-17 years old) for someone who is supposed to be in his late 30's. Anyway it's a weird game but the gameplay mechanics seem good so far. I'm not far enough into it comment on longevity, but overall it looks great and plays great.My suggestion is turn on the Japanese language and turn on the subtitles and enjoy the game that way. Yes, you will actually have to pay attention to the story but the Japanese VA's are just so much better. (For me I prefer Sub over Dub)My wife and I are both major anime fans. We like to read our anime. She likes watching this game as it's like playing an anime movie, no blood, so far.Graphics are great, but I think the PS3 can do much better. This is also one of the closest games you can get on the PS3 to a true RPG.Amazon had a sale so we got it for like 32 bucks. It's well worth getting at that price.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2008"}

As these survivors' allies mysteriously fall victim to dementia, it becomes clear that protecting a young girl granting them a bizarre immunity may be their only hope for survival in a struggle that could have implications for all of humanity.GameplayAlthough designed to preserve the feel of the action of the original game, gameplay inExtractionis also quite unique. First, the player perspective has been changed from third, to first-person, placing all the action right in front of you. Also,Extractionis a 'rail shooter,' meaning a shooter game where most of the action engaged in and paths followed are programmed into the mission play, instead of the freeform wandering ability built into the considerably larger Next-Gen and PCDead Spacerelease. The combination of these two changes funnels the players focus onto the combat options available in the game. In dealing with the danger of the alien Necromorphs swarming the game space,Dead Space Extractionutilizes the precision of the Wii Remote in variety of ways. Weapons like the Plasma Cutter can dispatch these enemies from a distance by taking advantage of the remote's pointing targeting ability, while a quick wave can activate weapons like the Ripper, a guidable spinning saw blade. The Wii Remote is also handy for picking up items and hurling them at enemies using the power of Kinesis.Other gameplay changes include new play modes. The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn't become too easy. In addition,Extractionalso features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed. Taken together all these changes add up to more action, more fun and moreDead Spacefor players on the Wii.Key Game FeaturesAn All-New Prequel Exclusively for the WiiFollow the lives of several different Aegis VII colony members as they carve a bloody path to survival.Meet a new cast of characters, destroy fearsome new enemies, and wield brutal new weapons.Real TerrorStunning graphics, panic-inducing audio, and a frenetic first-person perspective thrust you headlong into the terror.Play through an engrossing, interactive horror movie experience that raises the bar for storytelling in video games.Intuitive ControlsStrategically dismember your enemies with pinpoint control using the Wii Remote.Wield a powerful arsenal of abilities and weapons to freeze enemies, manipulate gravity with telekinesis, solve puzzles, and fight off attacks from every direction in zero gravity.Co-Op GameplayTeam up with a friend to fight off the invasion on the USG Ishimura with jump-in cooperative play.Combine efforts on engineering puzzles or determine specific roles to create a unique experience with each play session.","reviewerName":"M. Keegan \"Keegs\"","summary":"Lives up to the Name","reviewText":"Many games such as Soul Caliber: Legends tried to captalize on its franchise but failed. Luckily Extraction lives up to the Dead Space brands and impresses. This game really innovates the light gun genre in more ways than one. It all starts and ends with great presentation done with well done scripted voice talent throughout the game making you feel more immersed in the world. All the signature elements from Dead Space is done extremely well in the game.The gameplay is impressive giving you more control than your typical light gun game by allowing you to pick paths during certain segaments and allowing some scenes for you to explore under a time limit to grab objects and such. The telekensis is back allowing you t be able to pick up objects and you still can slow things down by use of the stasis which is done great for many enemies and even for one boss battle, allows you to slow him down while the camera moves around for you to shoot its weak spot.The controls are done really well and are pretty precise. It does some unique things by allowing you hear the audio logs through the wii-mote's speaker and you can do a melee attack with the nunchuk and as you might expect, shoot with the wii-mote's trigger button, and the A button is used for you telekensis.Graphically, it can be a bit muddy looking but its still impressive and does a great job setting the eerie mood for the game. The enemies are well animated as are the characters that follow you throughout the game. Its a great Wii game. Its a game that doesn't have to captalize by being a mature game. Its a quality that is only hampered by its short game length. Either way, its worth a play through!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000FRU0NU","reviewerName":"Mark Hills \"Nobody gets me, I'm the wind, baby!\"","summary":"Finished the Fight too Fast","reviewText":"I want to first point out that it is possible to objectively criticize something and still like it. With that in mind, I still waited before writing my review of Halo 3 until I had played through it a few times so I could get a better feel and grasp of the important elements of the game. Having done that I can see now that the game itself is deeply flawed in several ways- story, dialog, and game features and functions. That said I still enjoyed it, it was still a lot of fun to me. What startled me the most was just how short it was, I completed the main campaign in less than six hours, which is roughly 10-12 hours less than time spent playing the first two games. That strikes me as being unreasonable given what I paid for the it and three years Bungie supposedly spent developing the game- there simply is not enough to do.What I noticed immediately was the dialog was very weak in several areas. I don't mean just the main thrust of the stories told in cut scenes, but everywhere- ancillary dialog of human soldiers who follow the Master Chief around on missions has most all of humor, the flowery dialog of the Sangeili Elites and the Prophets are gone, replaced instead with cliched lines we've all heard a dozen times before from other sources, as well they changed two of the voices who added so much to Halo 2, that of the Prophet of Truth and the Gravemind without changing the actors- Terrance Stamp still does Truth and Dee Bradley Barker is back as the Gravemind, yet they sound completely different. The way Halo told its story reminded me greatly of Soul Reaver 2 game- long cut scenes with tons of elocution that flows like poetry and a lot of that has been stripped out of Halo 3 leaving it almost lifeless. I thought for sure they had changed writers, but Joseph Staten is credited for Halo 3.The inconsistencies that struck me were the weapons- yes, they added a ton of new toys to play with, but also changed some of the main stays. The M-41 assault rifle from Halo, missing from Halo 2, is back for Three, but somehow holds 28 less rounds in its magazine than before. The needler, probably one of my favorite weapons from the previous two games can no longer be dual-wielded, and they cut its ammo capacity back, the same goes for the shotgun. The original Magnum is also back, but appearances are deceiving- damage and ammo capacity have been reduced. If these are the same weapons, why have they been changed so drastically and no justification given? I can understand it being done for game balance, but it's just done with no explanation at all. I'll ignore the most overriding gripe of there is no possible way the UNSC could have fought the Covenant for 10 years given their vastly disparate technology levels. It is simply unrealistic that the human race, given how primitive their weapons, ships, and everything else is could have survived that long against the Covenant.The story line is very simple, stop the Flood and stop the Prophet of Truth of activating the remaining Halo rings- a lot of work for basically one guy, but Spartan 117 is far from average. The game opens with the Master Chief crash landing on Earth after leaping from Truth's captured Forerunner ship and then hooking up with Sergent Major Johnson and the Arbiter in the jungles outside of what's left of New Mombassa. Your ultimate goal in the first half of the game is stop Truth from reaching the Ark- what the humans suspect is being dug out of a massive crater where New Mombassa used to be by the Covenant. It is instead a massive hyperspace gateway that takes Covenant forces to the true Ark- an enormous space station located outside of our galaxy and out of range of pulse radius of all the Halos. After failing to stop Truth and dealing with the Flood who crash a Covenant ship on Earth, the UNSC and their new allies, the Sangeili Elites, relocate to the Ark and go after Truth. All the while the Master Chief is plagued by visions of Cortana, held captive by the Gravemind.On the Ark the mission break down is roughly the same as on Earth- take out Covenant anti-air defenses so UNSC forces can move in. Here you get to fly the new UNSC fighter, the Hornet and continues the UNSC fascination with hanging soldiers on the outsides of things. It makes me wonder if the Pillar of Autumn or In Amber Clad had hundreds of soldiers on the outside shooting at Covenant fighters with their rifles. In any event, it was fun to finally fly some human aircraft, yet absent from the entire game is the flyable Banshees. Bungie also changed which Wraith tanks you can take over, making it impossible to steal certain tanks on certain levels using melee attacks instead of grenades. This to me smacks of bad design because it makes things seem forced and artificial. Rumor has it that it is possible to take over the coppery anti-air Wraiths, but I have yet to do it.Graphically, I'm torn. The game is very pretty, but it's not a quantum leap from Halo 2, certainly not `next generation' in my opinion, something the Xbox 360 has suffered from since day one with Perfect Dark Zero and other titles. One Bungie's curses is a lot of their textures look muddy, and they can't do metallic surfaces unless it's the Elite's armor, everything else looks like shiny lacquered concrete- the Forerunner structures especially suffer from this effect, and it was especially noticeable in Halo 2 and on human space stations which looked as though they were made form cement. Character models have been improved in some areas, but faces and uniforms on UNSC personnel look pretty much the same as they did in Halo 2. Lighting effects, weapons, and vehicles are first rate, the Flood infested levels are also quite excellent, especially the last one and everything has a nice creepy Cronenberg-esque look to it. They also updated the overall look of my favorite character, Cortana. I love how she appeared in Halo 2, but in Three she looks more human, with a different face and hair, she looks a little gothic with darker eyes.Overall, Halo 3 gets a pass, because it is fun to play, it just doesn't last that long. I have no interest in player vs player matches, because they lack the precision offered by a mouse and keyboard. The story is weak, but passable- the preview videos of developers talking so much about they were doing so much with the Brutes and integrating them into the story turned out to be so much smoke and mirrors. If anything, they have a less a role in Halo 3 than they did in Two. The Brutes are barely anymore important than Grunts or Jackals, just thugs with big guns that you get to shoot at because the Elites are your allies now. So, I finished the fight- a little too quickly, and I will be very interested to see where they take it now, because nothing is every truly over. So maybe in two years we'll be asked again to `Continue the fight!' or `Finish the Fight, Again!'.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000FRU0NU","reviewerName":"R. Jensen","summary":"A Mixed Bag For Me","reviewText":"Halo 3.... Pretty mixed bag for me. On one hand there is lots to like and then there's lots to complain about. On the like side, graphics and story are intersting and inflict a sense of desperation that Halo 2 didn't posess much of. The difficulty of levels is amped up a lot and there are a lot more swarms of enemies both Flood and non Flood. Scarubs are introduced as attackable and more weapons and vehicles are introduced giving more variety to the game. Also airel combat was finally used to a much grander level, which I liked. The ending is a good ending, remind me of Halo 1's ending.Dispite those likes there is much to not like about this one. Most weapons don't ever feel as if they pack lots of punch. In Halo I felt as if I could rely on whatever weapon I had and that it would do the job. Here I never really felt confident with any weapon, even the Assult Rifle which isn't that effective this time. Brutes appear to be able to kill with only a couple of rounds and 2 melee's, where as in Halo 2 it took tons of ammo to bring them down.The fact we are up against Hunters again really annoyed me as Halo 2 seemed to mention that they were with the Elites now (who gives about the Grunts). Also were as the first two appeared to allow me to get behind the eyes of the Chief, this one feels as if I'm not part of the character at all. It feels way more complex and like it's star wars battlefront but harder. Also the transitions between vehicle and on foot parts were not smoove at all.The first two games I played enough times to say I've vertually conqured Normal (but's its still lots of fun) this one I've played through on Normal twice and I don't think I'll ever really like it as much as the others. One of the items where I want to like it better then I do, but I can't.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2013"}

Ram","summary":"Play through the frustration, and you might become addicted...","reviewText":"Most of the points I'd make about VC have been covered by other reviewers, so I'll just touch on a few things I think are important:The first few missions in the game progress pretty swiftly, as you guide 2-4 characters through some short maps as you get the hang of things. Then all of a sudden you're given a bunch of new menus for the 20+ characters added to your squad, each of whom have strengths and weaknesses (though thankfully all members in a class level up together). It's a bit overwhelming at first, but eventually you get the hang of things and start to connect with your favorite characters and find the best strategy for each level.Speaking of which, most of the missions in the game are pretty much trial and error. You play through it once with a mix of units only to find yourself making the wrong moves of getting slaughtered from the onset. Then you fine-tune your member selection and make better use of your movement and action points each time until you are ready to play through it for real, which can be tedious at times, but does bring greater satisfaction when you see that big OPERATION COMPLETE banner and hear the victory fanfare.Several missions (especially 7, 14, 17 and 18) are painfully difficult, almost impossible to figure out without a walkthrough. Sometimes it's because the game is cheap or doesn't inform your of things, other times it's because there's some special weak point or trick to beating a mission more easily. In a few missions, you can win easily by exploiting your knowledge of what's to come and blowing the enemy out of the water just as they appear...which is necessary several times.Even with all the annoyances, the game can be highly enjoyable. The storyline is interesting throughout, and several characters grow and change and you find yourself wanting to know what will happen to them next. There are several bonus missions, skirmishes and other goodies that can be bought or unlocked in the game, and after you beat it, there's a new game plus mode with harder maps to play through.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2010"}

I have no played any previous title in the series so I cannot comment on how this game compares to the other games in the series.Days of Ruin is easy to learn, has a great story, plenty of missions, and the right amount of challenge and fun.  The game took me over a month to beat and I only played a handful of the training missions.  So there's plenty to do for single-player.Most of the earlier missions I did correctly on the first try, most of the later ones took me a second try to beat.  I love the ranking system, for each mission completed you get a C, B, A, or S rank and are free to replay earlier missions at any time to improve your score.The last mission took me about a week to beat, I must have tried it about a dozen times before I figured out the right way to do it. That was probably the only frustrating mission in the whole game, but it was so rewarding when I finally beat it.Definitely recommend this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2009"}

Rhodes","summary":"Familiar Territory, But a Fun Game Nonetheless","reviewText":"The Good:+A really good story+Good graphics+Strong voice acting brings it to life+Familiar free flowing combat is still satisfying+Lots of side missions to keep you busy+A strong multiplayer componentThe Bad:-Gotham City feels strangely lifeless-Some of it is just a little too familiar.  There's nothing here that builds upon what Arkham City established before it.  This isn't necessarily &#34;bad&#34; but the experience feels far too similar---When Batman Arkham Asylum came out, it was a burst of fresh air and a relief.  For the first time in a very long time the Batman license was put to good use.  Arkham City then turned out to be a really good sequel in its own right with a fantastic story and a fantastic open world, building up on what Arkham Asylum established and managing to feel different just the same.  Now we have Batman Arkham Origins.  A prequel that is set in Gotham just two years after Wayne has dawned the cape and cowl.  It's a good game in its own right, and is really only hindered by the fact that it does little (if anything) to set itself apart from the game that came before it.  But then again... Arkham City is a hard act to follow.The criminal Black Mask has put a 50 million dollar bounty on Batman's head.  As such, assassins from all over are coming to Gotham to take that bounty on.  In conjunction with that, the police aren't sure if Batman is helping to escalate crime or if he's actually stopping them.  Origins actually has a really good story.  It doesn't reach the heights of Arkham City, but it's good nonetheless, establishing the relationships that Batman has with some criminals and with some of the characters we've come to know and love.  The production values are as top notch as you'd expect.  The voice acting, despite a different cast of voice actors for Batman and The Joker, is quite good in its own right.  The game also has a good graphical presentation, making for a good looking game.  Although the one problem I have with it is that the game gives a pitiful excuse as to why there are no citizens wandering the city--a curfew.  In a way it sort of drains Gotham of life and more or less just makes Gotham seem like a bigger Arkham City.  There are side missions but none of them ever really involve saving citizens.  Usually just going around beating up criminals.Speaking of that, the free-flowing combat is exactly the same as you remember.  This isn't such a bad thing.  You'll be beating up thugs and have a chance to counter them just as you always have.  You get weapons that help you in your beat downs, but aside from that this is the same familiar combat system you've always known.  Which is fine and dandy, although this doesn't make boss fights exciting on any level.  In the previous games some bosses there were very specific tasks that had to be done.  The fight with characters like Mr. Freeze in Arkham City come to mind.  But here it's mostly just like fighting another thug.  The boss fights here just aren't that exciting to play.Like in previous games you'll find lots of gadgets for Batman to use.  However, just like the combat, there's not really anything new here.  At some point a lot of ground just feels too familiar.  The new studio behind Batman Arkham Origins seems to have gotten caught in the trap that many developers get caught in.  Certainly you don't need to fix what isn't broken, but there are times when Batman Arkham Origins feels like it's lifting far too much from the previous game without laying down any new track.  It's not really building on the foundation set before it, This isn't quite as bothersome in many regards, but it makes the game feel like baby steps from the previous game as opposed to great strides.  Many of the side missions you'll come to expect such as the Riddler trophies or just running around the city to beat up thugs.  But there are some pretty cool side missions that actually do add to the story and give you the sense of the relationship that Batman has with his adversaries.  That's not to say there is nothing new.  You can actually access the Batcave here.  You can get some advice from Alfred and you can change your suit and go train.  It's nice to have a bit of a hub area this time around.What actually works out surprisingly well is the multiplayer.  I never pictured the Arkham games as needing a multiplayer.  And a lot of the times when there's a multiplayer component added to a game that was clearly not built up for one it's usually pretty poor (Tomb Raider comes to mind).  Here it actually works.  You play as either Batman and Robin or as thugs trying to take them down.  It's actually really intense and quite fun.  Batman and Robin employ various takedowns while thugs have guns at their disposal.  It's surprisingly fun to play.Arkham Origins exceeds on a technical level, having some really good looking character models and good looking environments.  As mentioned it doesn't feel as alive as it could be, but it's not a bad looking game by any means.  The soundtrack is one of the biggest rewards here.  It's a really good one.  About what you'd expect from an Arkham game.  The only thing that keeps Arkham Origins down is that so much of it feels like a retread of familiar territory.  There's nothing here that really tries to build on the foundation of what was already established in the game before it.  Arkham City did a good job of building up on what was established in Asylum despite having a lot of familiar gameplay.  It feels like the developers here were playing it safe.  The good news is that Origins isn't a step back.  It's just not a big step forward.  It does have it where it counts, though.  A strong story and a good narrative to accompany it.  If you liked the previous Arkham games then Origins is worth your time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2013"}

Jones","summary":"Bioshock Gangers Edition","reviewText":"Can a game where \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" presented in full be a bad game? Nay-nay, I say. In fact, can a game where you control a ninties-themed gangster dressed like a matrix fan and Korn fan be bad? Possibly, but that's not the case. There is a level of depth in this game that goes farther than your simple first person shooter and a simplicity that goes beyond your standard fare of game.The game as a theme of loss throughout and a sense of loyalty along with never-ending revenge. This could have been a good gangster game on it's own. But it wen the way of supernatural powers and dark design. You control an up-and-coming gangster in a sort of sixties or seventies setting. You Uncle Paulie decided you aren't worth the effort and seeks to slaughter you and everything you love. In doing so he unleashes a demonic force calling itself the Darkness from you. This parasitic organism is not well explained but it is explored through the game as you develop powers and skills.Your powers are a means of solving puzzles and fighting the masses of bad guys. Despite having two eel-like tentacle monsters coming out of your shoulders, they are very weak against light and that serves as a challenge. The light is your enemy and you must use your resources to douse the light and fight the masses of crooked cops, vile gangs, and undead abstracts.The game presents an interesting narrative that I would compare to the excellent Bioshock Infinite. If you like Bioshock you should enjoy this game as well.Now the issues. Mouths do not move well when people talk, especially your character. The online is useless now as no one is on or the servers are down, so completing the achievements is virtually impossible. The replay value is limited, collectables are fun to find but some of them are just difficult. The difficulty of the game is unimportant unless you are a die-hard gamer and must play it on hard mode to make yourself fulfilled. Some of the levels are unintuitive and require a great deal of probing and exploration to solve while others lead you on just to drop you off where you started. The game is also relatively short. I beat it within two days.If you need a number score then I give it a solid 8/10. It has a great deal of content, a great range of emotions, and a narrative worth watching. Plus the in-game televisions showing old cartoons is amazing. I didn't think games could do that, but the proved me wrong.

Controllers suck, the A,B,X,Y buttons are all the same size and have no raised identifiers on them, so I'm always hitting the wrong button.  The controller itself seems large and cumbersome, kind-of &#34;clunky&#34;.2. The machine itself is HUGE, with modern technology as it is why do we need such a large box cluttering up the joint?3. Front loading CD/DVD tray:  This might be a good idea on a computer system that sits in a cabinet or on your desk, but not for a game machine you take with you to your friends house.  I have seen people get a disk jammed in there doing just that.4. Cheesy DVD player: Yes you can play DVD's with this system, great, but will it play DTS encoding? no, DTS sounds much better than dolby digital, couldn't they have included this decoding in such a large system?5. Wires, wires, wires: well Microsoft feels they have done you a favor by making the wires longer, why not get rid of them altogether? With such sucessful products like the Wavebird wireless, why hasn't MS made such an item? I know there are after market ones, but lets face it, the after market controllers are no where near as good as the ones made by the manufacturer.6. Games: you knew I was getting to this right? Most of the good games for XBOX are available for all platforms.  The one game &#60;halo&#62; that most XBOX'ers feel is the best game for this console is mediocre to not very good.  Most people that rate halo as being very good are only playing it in death-match, they aren't playing the actual game, which would be great if you've got alot of friends with XBOX's and LAN connections.When I bought my XBOX I had high hopes of really great games based upon the hype in the media and other forums, but as you can see there are not very many good games for the machine.7. The top of the XBOX is rounded slightly, making impossible to put another component on top of it, this is a little bit perplexing to me, MS put the front loading disk tray in so that you can put the XBOX in your entertainment center, but why make the top rounded? this defeats the purpose.PROS1. You can take it back to the store if you keep the box and packing materials in good shape.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2004"}

The story picks up about two years after the Battle of the Citadel and the defeat of Saren Arterius.  Overall, the storyline is very well written, and the characters are strongly developed.  There's sooo much dialogue in this game that it could easily fill up a 300+page novel rather easily.  The language can also be harsh at times; we have the inclusion of the four-letter F word here (which was not in the first game at all...thank you, Jack.)  It took me about 50 hours to complete the game, and every single second was well worth it.However, I gave this game 4 stars (like for the original Mass Effect) because of the derived nature of the storyline.  Again, all the ideas were clearly borrowed from other epic sci-fi franchises (Star Wars and Star Trek, to name a few).  Basically, whatever I said in my original Mass Effect review about the borrowed nature of this series holds true here, so you may want to search my profile page for that review.  With that said, I'd just like to add that the final Reaper boss fight made me think of The Terminator so much that I should add that franchise to the list of BioWare's creative pool of borrowed ideas.Three other explicit instances of the unoriginal storyline concept to the game include the following:  the Illusive Man is clearly modeled after the cigarette-smoking man in the X-Files; the Krogan race is clearly modeled after the Klingons of Star Trek lore (and hey, Michael Dorn who played Worf in Star Trek TNG actually voiced one of the Krogan in this game!!  hint hint!); and Mordin, the Salarian scientist, broke out singing a Gilbert & Sullivan song (much like Capt. Picard & Worf did in the movie, Star Trek Insurrection).  The influences are loud and clear!  BioWare, I'm totally onto your psychological, creative line of storytelling, and frankly, I should be a writer on your team.  Your sales would probably skyrocket even more than your current profit margins would indicate, but I digress on that...Anyway, one minor note to make in this PS3 version:  the dialogue cuts out occasionally at the end of certain speeches....not harmful to the game, but it can be annoying.  As of this review, I just started Mass Effect 3, and it's amazing.  This time, BioWare decided to go all-out with borrowing heavily from The War of the Worlds....BioWare, e-mail me or call me :-)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2012"}

There was a great challenge of finding the right mix when going on a mission.Cons1.  I was looking a for a strong villian like Saren from the last game.  I never got that feeling.  The collectors were just a cult group who were like the Geth in my opinion.  I mean the reapers are there, but I wanted a physical being in front of me like Saren to be the boss.2.

In my mind, the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 vary in more ways than just hardware. Both consoles have very interesting and entertaining exclusives. While the Xbox 360 has made excellent action adventure/ and first person shooter games in Gears of War and Halo, the PlayStation 3 has differentiated itself by making games that are mature and very story-driven. Heavy Rain, Metal Gear Solid 4, the Ico games (granted, those were last gen), among others.The Last of Us continues, expands, and pushes the envelope in this regard. Where Heavy Rain was very much, high-concept gameplay with very compelling story, and Metal Gear Solid 4 was classic gameplay bogged down by hours upon hours of cutscenes, The Last of Us finds a great midpoint which mixes classic gameplay (with some compelling twists), and a story that can rival the best of any medium. To put it simply, Naughty Dog has created their masterpiece here. This is a game that will join the likes of Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda. A game that transcends the word \"videogame.\"The Last of Us is not a fun game to play in the traditional sense of the word. You will not feel invincible and you will not experience much happiness while playing it. Bad things happen to good people all the time. At every point in this game, I was subjected to the most gut-wrenching feeling. I found myself dreading to continue. But, The Last of Us pulls you in so completely that it's extremely difficult to put the controller down. Joel and Ellie are the two most interesting characters I have ever met in my life. They are layered and full of interesting tidbits. You don't doubt that they are human. Joel is flawed, and for better or for worse you have to live with the decisions that you make as Joel. Ellie is what truly brings this game to life. Ellie is perhaps the most compelling character in gaming today. You can feel her vulnerability, but it does not define her. You can feel her fear, but it does not define her. She is a teenage girl, but even that does not define her. What defines Ellie is her wisdom, and strength. She is not hopeless without Joel's help. In fact, many times, you get the feeling that she would do just fine without Joel around.This is probably the PS3's swan song. A game that pushed it to the limit and then some. I, for one, am glad I was able to experience it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2013"}

Lazy developers simply give away trophies for completing chapters, leave collectables on boxes, warn you to upgrade with mini-bosses etc. There is no one of those.

There are only few developers like Rockstar and naughty dog who go out of the way to cover every single aspect and make it so much more special.

I'm going to make this a brief review.The storyline continues right where MW2 left off. You have a target. You switch between different characters constantly. If you're playing on hard expect a few deaths that probably should not have happened. Expect a couple of levels where you just need to follow orders and snipe the right guy in the face at the right time and duck when they tell you to do so. Expect to have to crawl with your left and right trigger (man that's getting old).Special ops: I love this mode. Well, I love the survival mode and playing with my friends. It can get a bit repetitive and I don't like that the difficulty changes from level to level. I'd rather just plan any level of my choosing and set the difficulty level myself. Either way this is the part that I enjoyed the most.I don't really get too involved in the multiplayer aspect. I used to play competitively in different games and I just don't enjoy playing with a bunch of children anymore. I also don't have the time to sit on there for hours every day and memorize the maps.Was it worth getting? Yes. I enjoyed it as much as MW2. Does it deserve 5 stars? No, it wasn't really innovative. It was better than Black Ops, but that was a different developer (although Treyarch is getting better).Edit: I've since played the multiplayer extensively. I'm currently ranked pretty highly in the world with about a 3.2 kill/death ratio overall and a weekly that is about 6-8 depending on my week. I played around a bit much with the throwing knife in the first couple of months playing online. I can say that it is still much like previous games, but it is pretty fun. This game is definitely centered around the multiplayer experience I guess. I'm just still not that heavy into playing with other people as I constantly get harassed by potheads and basement dwellers that get upset when I dominate them.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2012"}

With the flashlight being the only source of light for the vast majority of the game and the eerie backdrop, FEAR became one hell of a freaky title that ranked VERY high on my scare-the-crap-o'-meter.  FEAR 2 and FEAR Files were equally freaky with the ending in the second installment forcing me to wake up every night screaming for two weeks for fear I unwittingly made Alma pregnant with her next 'child.'With all that in mind I expected FEAR 3, the alleged ending to the franchise, to answer all questions, finish well, and scare the excrement out of me in the process.  After having beaten the game in under five hours and playing a little bit of the co-op and multiplayer I find myself shaking my head in disbelief that I paid full price for this severe letdown.Let us begin.Yes, you read correctly; I beat the game under five hours.  I thought the end-boss on the end-level was a lead-up to one final showdown with Alma, the main protagonist of the series, given how the story was finally beginning to progress.*in best Bill Lumberg impression*Yeaaaaaaaaaaaah... about that memo.When I got the achievement after beating a VERY easy final boss I was in complete disbelief that I had already completed the campaign mode (bleep bloop?).  The campaign felt like a long campaign from Left 4 Dead 2 than the usual 6-12 hours that first-person shooters typically run.  I was then treated to a very brief ending that was closer to a cut-scene where your score is put against your partner in order to determine what very short ending you would be treated to.  If you scored more points as the \"Point Man\" protagonist you get his ending whereas, concurrently, if you score more points as the other 'hero' Paxton Fettel you get his ending.  How cute.It wasn't as though the ending solved all the questions of the overall story arc either, even with both endings.  The ending made me raise my eyebrow and simply give off a four-worded response: \"No way in hell.\"  Two years of waiting for the conclusion and I get another non-ending that more-or-less opens it for a sequel.  It is this kind of BS that makes us gamers less inclined to get new titles opening night.  And the BS didn't end there.As mentioned earlier, FEAR 3 was not scary at all.  Perhaps I am desensitized by the exploding babies from Dead Space 2, an equally disappointing game, but there were no moments that were genuinely scary since most of the game took place during the daytime with lots of lighting.  In fact, the second mission took place in a VERY lit favella in a place that looked strikingly like a particular game mission in Rio di Janeiro (I bumped into \"Soap\" BTW, he says, \"Hi\").  I used the flashlight attachment less during FEAR 3 than I used ambient lighting in the first FEAR.Truth be told, FEAR 3 felt like an arcade shooter and, like Dead Space 2, a dramatic deviation from the previous installments.  This is not necessarily a bad thing as there were some redeeming aspects to FEAR 3.  The melee attack system proved very entertaining as, like Mortal Kombat, the foot sweep proved to be the bane of the existence of many an enemy in the game.  No BS, when I played through the game again as Fettel, I beat the first level on the \"fearless\" difficulty setting and only got hit five times as I spent literally the entire level utilizing foot sweeps.  They were virtually one-hit kills on most enemies.  I even had a blast with jump kicks (the jerks removed the roundhouse kicks from FEAR 2: Project Origins).  All the while I was whistling \"Kung Fu Fighting\" by Carl Douglas.  Yeah, the game was THAT easy.Another nice aspect was the utilizing of power armor, which made a small cameo in Project Origins.  You not only get one more chance to pilot the amazing piece of machinery but FOUR chances that are relatively long.  To make this nicer, the control schemes were virtually identical to the previous installments so it was pretty simple to get acclimated to playing the game.Lastly among my favorites was the co-op features.  This was what everyone got excited for and it's obvious that is where the vast majority of the emphasis went into.  It was well executed and balanced as the abilities of both Point Man and Fettel compliment each other (which only do so in co-op) as the latter can suspend enemies while the former guns them down.  My partners-in-crime online enjoyed this feature, and we tried doing the other multiplayer features that closely resembled Nazi Zombies and Left 4 Dead, but that didn't last very long.  We were hoping for a scary game, not an arcade shooter.In short, the game play was as solid as FEAR 2: Project Origins, but completely without the scary features.  Worthy of a rental or if the game seriously goes down in price.  I akin this game to Dead Space 2 albeit with the exploding infants.All in all, a 75%.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2011"}

I was playing almost nonstop.  The atmosphere of the game reminds me of Far Cry and the game play itself reminds me of Uncharted.  I enjoyed the puzzles as they were challenging but not too difficult.The beginning of the game throws you into a game play with very little character building or beginning story to give you a real background. However,  it does build as the game progresses.Seeing Lara in this type of setting whet she grows as a character was really fun and seemed to capture me the more I played. Weapon usage and character movement was perfect.  I thin they did a great job on that. I liked how fluid they made the cut scenes to game play and vice versa.I think this game will have a nice long franchise","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2013"}

Though I didn't care much for Heavenly Sword (too rough, but showed potential), Enslaved is one of my absolute favorite games of this generation. Sadly it ended up being criminally overlooked, selling so poorly it would never get a sequel. Now for DmC, it too is not being given a fair chance by a lot of gamers simply because of its new look and new developer.I was very skeptical when I heard it wasn't being developed internally at Capcom Japan, but knowing Ninja Theory, I had hope. From first looks of the game early in development, I thought I'd hate the new Dante- but it turns out he's actually quite likeable, thanks to some excellent writing (one of Ninja Theory's strengths). Suffice to say DmC is how a series reboot should be done- I'm not going to go into specifics which have been covered elsewhere, but it adds a lot of new elements, adds a new perspective on the characters, but still feels like a Devil May Cry game. It is easily the best game in the series and I urge people to give it a try.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00GG4BBUM","description":"","reviewerName":"Jared Burdick \"JBurd\"","summary":"Graphical Mixed Bag - Still Amazing","reviewText":"I'm an every 2-3 season guy on sports games. This is the first iteration of the show I've purchased since 2010. As opposed to offering comparisons on years past, I want to offer those opinions based on the PS4 experience for the folks that are may be picking this game up for the first time or many years like myself because it's now &#34;next-gen&#34;First and most discussed, the graphics. I have a very different opinion from many of the reviews. The player close ups are almost universally terrible. My 11yr old gave the best possible description; they look like clay. The much touted &#34;hair&#34; is simply awful. I've had the good fortune to attend 100's of games in several ballparks over the last decade and with regards to some of the stadiums I've spent time in, they are very good and close to their counterparts. The crowds are lively and there are many more &#34;models&#34; in the stands to make it feel real. The skylines however are not. When you catch a glimpse of the structures that were rendered outside of the stadiums for example, rudimentary 3d models are present. Minute Maid park for example, is completely missing the Houston skyline that rests just outside of the stadium walls. That is a huge part of the park's character.The reason that these are important is becuase the game in motion is so fluid. The players on the field are amazing, the view from the second base while watching a pitcher engage a batter is absolutely amazing and very lifelike. Unfortunately, you can quickly be pulled out of those moments when there is a close up of a random player that may have black skin and a bushy blond beard like a Duck Dynasty reject. It truly is a mixed bag, some things are beautiful, some are just plain ugly.I never play online sports, so I cannot comment on that. The best and quickest way to describe The Show from a gameplay standpoint is customizable. Virutally every single facet of control on the field is easily changed, manipulating rosters, player stats, game sliders; all quickly manipulated to find that sweet spot to make the game fun. It's also incredibly deep but completely playable if you just want to use a more basic control structure. The quickplay features are also terrific. A game that would have taken 90 minutes in MLB:10 can be done in 45. Still a time commiment, but better if you are trying to relax for an hour.Finally, the modes. I really dug into the &#34;Road to the Show&#34; for the first time (since my home team Astros are historically bad) and all I can say is I'm hooked. Only playing the parts of the game with &#34;my player&#34; takes about 10 minutes. You get all of the stats and rotisserie info you could dream of and can play through a month's worth of games in a couple hours. It's the most fun I've had in a sports game in many years.Overall, The Show is the best baseball game on the market. Even with graphical flaws, you simply will not find a more engaging and customizable MLB experience short of playing the game in real life. If you are looking for a graphics showcase for your PS4, NBA2k14 still is the benchmark...by a wide margin. For all things baseball, The Show is the best.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2014"}

Link \"wildfirelink\"","summary":"4.5 stars - A classic which will be greatly built upon","reviewText":"Sonic The Hedgehog(1991). The first official Sonic game on the Genesis.Most people who have lived around the time that this classic came out remember back in the early 90s when gamers everywhere held tightly onto their NES's and shouted \"Mario! Mario!\" all over the world... Okay, maybe not, but that's how the one SMB3 commercial went anyway. So it seemed that with the (then)recent release of SMB3, the plumber would always dominate 2D platforming... or would he? The Sega Genesis had been out for a couple of years by this point, and while there were many classics, no mascot was there to stand up to all the koopa troopas and toadstools of the big N. Enter Yugi Naka and crew to come up with the true origin of the battle between the 16-bit giants Nintendo and Sega: the creation of Sonic The Hedgehog.So what does this new blue hero in red shoes have to offer that a fat mushroom-eating plumber doesn't? Well for one, Sonic is FAST. Not nearly as much as in any of the sequels, but for 1991, this kind of speedy sidescrolling gameplay was unheard of, and drew many crowds. I remember being taken by storm when my cousin first bought a Sega with the original Sonic game. It brings back so many memories of middle childhood. The gameplay is rather basic, with only a run, jump, and spin attack to combat the levels, but really that's all you need here. For new gamers that have just started playing the recent Sonic games, THIS is the game that introduced rings, TV Powerups, loops, animal-freeing, chaos emeralds, instant-death spikes, Dr. Robotnik, underwater drowning, bumpers, catapults, springs, and the Green Hill Zone. Plus, the game is divided into different zones, and within each zone are several acts, which are merely just stages. With all that it has going for it, how does it measure up to its sequels? Let's look at the pros and cons:PROS:-While the SNES probably had better graphics, color palettes, and scaling effects, I still have yet to see a SNES game with as smooth of the gameplay framerate as any Genesis Sonic title (I'm talking about normal in-game play that's NOT a special FX chip or anything like that).-NICE BALANCE OF DIFFICULTY. The first few zones aren't too difficult to get the hang of, though once you reach the Labyrinth Zone, it does jump quite a bit.-LARGE NON-LINEAR STAGES. Although the sequels get a lot better at this (especially Sonic 3), these zones all have original and varying environmental themes and seem just the right length for the pace that the platforming has set. It lets you speed through most of them in little time, and also lets you explore their depths as well.-And speaking of stages, this one of the FEW Sonic games with three acts per zone as opposed to two.-CHAOS EMERALD COLLECTING GIVES THE GAME SOME REPLAY VALUE. In the Mario games, you could collect all the secret powerups in the game, but the ending would never change. Not so with Sonic. If you manage to collect 50 rings and reach the end of a stage, you can jump through a giant ring and tackle a special stage to collect one of six chaos emeralds, which if acquired, enables a better ending.-GREAT VARIETY OF ENEMIES. A lot of the robots you fight here are classic staples of the series, such as the crab, hornet, and caterpillar. The bosses are rather interesting as well.-I can't end the pros without mentioning that this game has AN EXCELLENT SOUNDTRACK. The Greenhill Zone, Scrap Brain Zone, and title themes especially WILL get stuck in your head (Thankfully all are memorably good!).CONS-The TIMER for each stage can be an annoyance for those who like to explore the levels. It's usually only useful for getting points in beating the levels fast, but you will ALWAYS die whenever the clock hits 10 minutes.-Since the speed dash ability isn't here yet, the game will seem a bit slower-paced than all the others. Just to warn any newcomers.-The SPECIAL STAGES ARE TOUGH FOR MOST PEOPLE. I'm not complaining so much because I enjoy a good challenge, but for the sake of beginners it's waaaaay too simple to lose in the special stages. Interestingly enough, it becomes a mini-game in Sonic & Knuckles, a few years down the road.-THE INSTANT DEATH SPIKES!! I guess the programmers of the original Mega Man game got together with the Sonic team here because what both games have in common is the way their spikes kill the player even while they're flashing.-NO CHARACTERS AND VERY LITTLE STORY. Tails wouldn't show up til the sequel, Knuckles and Amy Rose were down the road a bit, and everyone else was just a thought. So that leaves just Sonic and Dr. Robotnik. The plot basically boils down to:\"The animals have been captured by Dr. Robotnik. Sonic is here to rescue them.\" That's it. Supposedly, I heard that the Death Egg ship was being built during this game's timeline, but it was never officially mentioned, so I'll consider it separate from the Sonic 2, Sonic 3, and S&K; continuous stories.Other than that, Sonic 1 is a classic Sega staple. Pure and simple. It's a 5 star game in comparison to other platformers, but I'm just giving it 4 stars when standing up to the other games in the series. So if you have an old Genesis, or if you bought the Sonic Mega Collection, and if you happen to be a fan of the games, DON'T SKIP OUT ON THIS ONE! It made the series what it is today, and serves as important history for video games. PLAY IT NOW!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2005"}

Seems like everyone else had this on their list to play too because the game sold an insane amount of copies and got a lot of hype and anticipation. Well nowadays the game has gotten such a bad reputation thanks to its repetitive mission structure and maybe too ambitious for its own good but with the sequel coming out in just a month's time, I thought I'd revisit the game and see whether or not the game really is that bad or whether people just overreacted. I'd say personally that everyone overreacted because they expected a masterpiece and they got a good game instead.Story: It's 1191 and there's a conflict going on between Crusader and Saracen forces with 9 men in particular really being the key major players concerning the turmoil to the lands. Al Mualim, leader of the Assassin's Guild, entrusts arrogant and recently demoted member Altair to kill the 9 men and help the conflict and bring some kind of resolve. But the real reason why Altair is doing anything at all will be revealed and it turns out it has nothing to do with the problems in the Holy Land. The story got criticized for being a bit too ambitious concerning its plot twist, it's unfinished-feeling ending and for some people, the lack of coherence since there's no subtitle option to get into the larger plots concerning the intended targets but it's an interesting story, just I guess not properly told.Graphics: One thing you can never fault - well, least not frequently - is Ubisoft's lack of graphical prowess and Assassin's Creed is the kind of game that not only has a really beautiful and unique look and aesthetic but the horsepower behind the engine as well with incredible draw distances, crowd animations not only in groups but on individuals and especially Altair's parkour animations, Assassin's Creed is certainly a beautiful game which unfortunately gets marred when some screen tearing pops up but it's minimal. But doing the Leap of Faith where you drop practically 10 stories down to a bundle of hay in one camera move is quite impressive.Sound/Music: The music isn't necessarily buy-worthy but it's a likable soundtrack with some of-the-times type pieces but for the most part it's all the crowd din as you hear the rustle and bustle of the city and it's all incredibly realistic and really puts you in that place. However, the voice acting is incredibly spotty with the intended targets doing admirable jobs with their roles yet Altair is one monotonous and unlikable bugger who really needs a kick in the ass (and who sounds strangely American for a Middle-Eastern character) and the repeated lines will drive you crazy. That one beggar woman who constantly cries out \"just a coin, sir I'm sick, I havent any money\" will most likely have you wanting to put her out of her misery more than once, in addition to the lines civilians say when you rescue them. How many times have I heard that the whole city will hear of my sacrifice? 50 times too many.Gameplay: The city has been described as an open-world game which basically means \"do whatever you want\" but in a way, Assassin's Creed doesn't fit the mold. Whereas a lot of these kind of games offer you plenty of variety of things to do (Grand Theft Auto series) or a massive map to explore (Fallout 3), Assassin's Creed gives you huge areas to explore, just not as much stuff to actually do in them. When you come across the 3 key cities, Acre, Jerusalem and Damascus, it's predominantly the same thing in each city: view points to help fill out the map, saving citizens from brutish guards, eavesdropping missions where you sit on a bench and listen in, pickpocketing people's pockets (yay, alliteration) or roughing up someone for information. There is a tad bit of repetition but it isn't so bad but people might not and didn't like how same-y it got. The other gameplay extender is flag collecting and if you're one of those types that hates finding stuff for achievements than Assassin's Creed will drive you batty because there's 100 flags to collect and not just in one city either and unlike say Infamous which had a similar thing but gave you a radar to locate them, some flags are so well-hidden you practically need a map and cross them off.A large part of the game is parkour where Altair climbs up down and around buildings to get to where he's going and it's one of the more funner elements of the game since not only does it look so realistic and easy to use (though too many platforming games have me pressing Jump to climb higher that I keep jumping OFF buildings whereas this game just requires you to hold the Up button) but it for some reason actually feels that fun. But should you run into guards on your voyages is where combat comes in and this is where it gets a bit dodgy since you get to counter attack, grab them and throw them away, sometimes straight off cliffs and high roofs too, but face multiple ones at the same time but the AI has a habit of just standing there and sometimes they even pose, as if they don't want to attack you so much as mock. In addition, it's way too easy to actually start a fight and more than once you'll be riding on your horse and people will assume you're up to no good and chase after you and bizarrely they actually don't stop so you can ride 2 football field lengths away and eventually they'll be right behind you slicing your horse's feet and it's like \"go away already\". City guard AI is worse since sometimes they don't even see you assassinate a guy right near them and yet you can be on a ledge above the street and be like \"assassin!\" and you'd be like \"what did I do, haven't killed anyone for....3 minutes\" but it's way too inconsistent.One of the low points of the game though is strangely part of what's actually not set in the Holy Land but rather the future. While I don't want to spoil the entire story and its concept despite others having done so, the segments where you're not controlling Altair are so linear and really just walk around, chat to chick that you wonder why this wasn't just cutscene. Is this a fun game? It strangely is when your brain isn't thinking about what wasn't included, why one was etc so it's not an outright bad game and maybe not deserving of the huge amount of hype people put onto the game since that kind of influenced what we were expecting but I did find it fun, just maybe not flawless.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2009"}

Assassin's Creed I believe captivated us all from the beginning, what with its stunning graphics too beautiful to not enjoy and its realistic plot and gameplay.

The cutscenes were long but they were necessary to the game's plot so it's a good idea to listen to what the characters talk about. Other than that there seems to be no other flaw to me.On a good note, though the game was repetitive in some ways the assassinations were different and interesting from the rest. I liked that.PROS: Stunning graphics, realistic scenery and people, wide area to explore. This game is definitely based off its graphics and storyline. Everything from people's responses to you to the way the horse you ride moves is so realistic. Near the end of the game you got to fight more and it was actually pretty fun. I didn't die once while seeking Robert. It was fun but I gave it four stars because sometimes if I slipped up for something so little then the guards would be after me and sometimes it takes forever to outrun them and hide.When the storyline wraps up and you see what Desmond sees at the end of the game you're just like \"What the..\". And then the credits start rolling and you're confused. I was but that shows that it leaves it open for a second game. Once I started thinking about it the game really is kind of freaky..what with the end of the world thing and controlling people and whatnot. Overall Assassin's Creed was a great game, though it seemed short and was very easy, it shocked us all. It's very different from other games and I think that many of us thought that it would be similar to Prince of Persia. While Altair does have acrobatic skills like the prince this game is far different from Prince of Persia, which I think is good because Ubisoft succeeded in shocking some people with this deep and very different storyline. And they also took the risk at making this a religious game, which in today's society, will cause controversy. This game is fun, beautiful, and very interesting. If you don't own it rent it. It's worth trying at least once.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2008"}

Though with the exception of Mass Effect, none of their games are really that technically impressive. What brings you into Bioware's RPG games are the stories and characters and this is very much true of 'Dragon Age Origins'.Like the other Bioware titles, 'Dragon Age' lets you build your character from the ground up (with a nice character model editor). You then choose from three generic classes: Warrior, Mage, or Thief (there are also specialization classes) then choose from one of six origin stories (or general begining/background stories). Like most RPG's your character's race and/or background, while interesting, basically sets the feel for your character rather than drastically change the gameplay experience. Aside form how the game starts, your character's race/background really don't effect the game progression. I don't think this is bad thing but is does limit the appeal of replayability somewhat.When your playing the game the system is VERY much borrowed from KOTOR's realtime-ish combat system. Your battle animations are varied and if you're into hack-and-slashing things (like I am) you'll feel right at home. There is also a wheel pause and play feature that brings up special moves you can pull off in the battlefield. You'll be bringing this up ALOT if you're a magic-user, though thankfully there's a TACTICS system which gives your party AI for combat(very much like FF12's gambit system). There's also a LOT of inventory micromanaging and if you're not into moving things around in your inventory (like I am) you'll probably find yourself frustrated alot.As said before Bioware games are story-heavy and I think this is their heaviest one yet. I love the characters in this game and how the general story plays out and for me this is what keeps me and others coming back to this game. Unfortunatly if you're NOT into story-heavy videogames there's not alot here for you.My one big complaint with this game is the graphics. Not only does the color scheme seem dull compared to the XBOX360 version but there's the usual clipping errors and bizarre glitches (some, but not alot of characters lose their voices or just disappear). Don't get me wrong it's not as bad as Fallout 3 was but you will notice.So like I said before I love this game. I love it for probably the reasons alot of people will hate it. If you love Bioware games like I do with great characters and stories this game is a MUST. If you're not, save your $$$.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000MJB0H6","description":"Pokemon Diamondis a traditional Pokemon RPG that takes place in a region called Sinnoh.In the Sinnoh region, there are two Pokemon that symbolize the region. They appear in the Sinnoh reigon's myths and old folklore. One is called Dialga, and is said to have the power to control time. The other is called Palkia, who is said to have the ability to distort space. The sinister organization called Team Galaxy is trying to rule the region by utilizing these two Pokemon's power. During your adventure to complete your Pokedex and become the Champion, these two Pokemon, and Team Galaxy, will intertwine into the story and lead you on a fantastic journey across the Sinnoh region.When you set off on your travels, you'll be able to play as either a boy or girl Trainer.

Rhodes","summary":"Beautiful Pearls","reviewText":"After countless spin offs the real deal is here: Pokemon Diamond and Pearl.  The Pokemon craze has been around for years.  Ever since the Red and Blue versions hit way back, Pokemon has been huge.  It's tried and true formula has worked for over ten years, and it's pretty apparent that the formula isn't going to die now.  Pokemon Diamond and Pearl are a lot like the Pokemon games that preceded it, but they've really thrown in some good touches here.  Still, most players who've been playing since the Gameboy days, or even as recent as the GBA days will still get a \"been there, done that,\" feeling.  Still, the game is good, addictive and it will keep you busy for hours on end.As I said, Pokemon Diamond and Pearl have a \"been there, done that\" kind of feel.  You begin as a rookie trainer in a village, and under some circumstances, you are asked by a professor to go and collect Pokemon data  using a Pokedex.  On your journey your goal is to collect as many Pokemon as you can and train them to take on other trainers, and to get all the badges from the games various gym leaders, while you've got a rival who is out doing to same thing to prove he's better than you.  In addition, there's an evil organization called Team Galactic that has plans for a new world order and to do that they need all the Pokemon they can get.  If all this sounds familiar, that's because it is!  It's the exact same formula that worked for the original Pokemon games on the Gameboy, the games on the Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance.  The story, of course, is simple and charming, but where Pokemon has always managed to shine most is it's fantastic and addictive gameplay.Pokemon is actually really strategic and in-depth.  That is to say, it requires a lot of thought, and believe me, some of these battles (especially against the new Pokemon that are introduced in this version) require a lot of your skill.  Battles are turn based, where you select a command and then watch a round of combat.  There's a paper/rock/scissors effect here, however.  Each and every Pokemon has a type, and some of the attacks they use reflect its type.  This makes up what deals massive damage, what deals no damage and what deals just normal damage.  Grass may be strong against water, for example but grass is also weak against fire, but in turn, fire is weak versus water.  This effect plays through with seventeen and different types, and there is no best type because every type has a weakness.  It's because of this element that Pokemon is so much fun to play.  Just trying to construct the perfect team will take you more than a day, and with over 100 new creatures to collect, you can form endless amounts of teams.  Just catching all the Pokemon alone will keep you busy for well over 50 hours.  To add to the effect you'll face several other trainers as well, and you never know what they'll throw at you.  Your strongest Pokemon may very well become your weakest in certain battles just because of its type.The battle system itself is made even simplar by the touch screen.  Where as before you were scrolling through menus, battling can simply be done by touching the different options on screen.  It makes battling a lot faster, especially because the icons are pretty big.  Luckily, there's never really a point where you have to use the touch screen if you don't want to, and battling can still be done the old fashioned way if you so choose.As with Ruby and Sapphire there are also moments of two on two battles.  Usually they come with either two trainers taking you on at a time, and you'll send out the two Pokemon in your top roster, or you'll be with another trainer who will send out his or her Pokemon with yours.  It adds to the strategic feel of the game, but the moments of two on two battles are pretty few and far between.In your journey you'll also receive a nifty watch that works based off the time of your internal clock.  This means that much like Gold and Silver, it'll switch between day and night.  Some Pokemon come out only in the early morning, others come out late at night.  Some Pokemon only come out on certain days.  Either way, those itching to catch each and every Pokemon will enjoy this aspect of it.As I said before, Pokemon Diamond and Pearl have added some new things.  The most important new thing however, is how much easier it is to trade Pokemon and battle with your friends.  Using Wi-fi on the DS is far better than the various link cables or having to go out and buy the wireless adapter for the GBA.  You can battle with people all across the world, and do other things as well, such as trade with them.  Of course, in order to enjoy the full benefits of this you'll need the friend code to do it, and sometimes.  In order to get the full experience of the online gaming world in Pokemon, you'll need to register friend codes.  If you don't you can't enjoy some of the better perks, like being able to talk to a friend using the microphone of your DS as you battle.  Still, the combat is enhanced greatly when playing online.  If you don't want to play online you can easily connect to another DS and battle it out that way with your friend simply sitting in the room.Pokemon Diamond and Pearl are also full of little secret goodies.  There are the legendary Pokemon, Pokemon contests, and of course, even after you've finished the main story there's more to be done.  You can transfer Pokemon from your GBA versions by sticking it into the GBA slot of the DS.  No matter how you slice it, Pokemon can easily keep you busy longer than several RPGs combinedI wish I could say the graphics and sound are absolutely amazing, but they're really not.  For as much fun as this game is, it's certainly not the best as far as graphics go.  The same goes for the sound as well.  Pokemon has never really been a game you go after for eye-candy, though.  There are some moments where some 3D effects come out, but not very many.  The sprites are more or less the same sprites they've been using since the Red and Blue versions.  Ideally, the game doesn't look all that much of a step up from Ruby and Sapphire, and they were not fantastic looking games either.  It's really colorful, but the DS is capable of so much more than this.  Likewise, in battle is still as horrible as ever.  Fun to do it, but the Pokemon still only flinch to attack, and there aren't a lot of animations going on, and we're still looking over the Pokemon's shoulder.  Essentially, the combat engine hasn't changed since the series first outing in 1998.  There are some move animations that look really good, but aside from that it's hard to look passed the simple fact that the game's combat engine hasn't really evolved since the original games came out way back in 1998.  This isn't the original Gameboy, this is the Nintendo DS.The sound is also no exception.  A lot of it sounds really tinny.  There are some tunes that definitely sound Pokemon like, but again, it's using old technology on a system capable of a lot more.  Most of the sound effects such as the Pokemon's cries are ripped straight from--you guessed it--the original Gameboy versions released in 1998.  That's not to say all the tunes sound bad, it's just to say that a lot of what you're going to hear is recycled.Despite the games graphics and sound, Pokemon Diamond and Pearl are still excellent games.  There's a lot more depth here than people think, and a lot of stuff to keep you busy for a long time to come.  Even those who are tired of the same simplistic plot and formula will find something great here.Pros:+Simple, yet addictive gameplay+Deep, strategic combat system+Touch screen controls make battling easier+Wi-fi connection works well+Over 100 new Pokemon join the roster+Simple storyline that anyone can understand+Being able to battle trainers all across the globe and being able to trade with them is fantastic+Game can keep you busy for hours with all there is to do, easily over 80 hours worth of gameplayCons:-You can still only save one file-Graphics and sound are horribly outdated-The formula works, but there are bound to be gamers out there who are sick of the same old storyline","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2007"}

You shoot progressively bigger monsters with progressively bigger guns until you find the bad guy and shoot him for while (sorry, spoiler alert, you fight a bad guy at the end)...  Okay, so Bulletstorm doesn't bring much new to the table, but I promise you, you're not gonna care.  It takes the tried and true formula for a first person shooter, moves it forward at a double time and lets you try your best to keep up.  It's an old school roller coaster of a game, linear and almost totally on rails, that is well worth the price of admission.It doesn't start off so hot, though...  actually, it's starts off BRILLIANTLY, with your character drunk off his ass and interrogating a bound and bloody bounty hunter who was hunting a price on your head.  But it doesn't take long to devolve from there, as we get into some of the worst dialogue and story-telling I've heard in years.  There's an awkward flashback, then a jump in time, some terrible voice acting and me left wondering just what the hell is going on.  Not that it matters - it's pretty clear from the get-go who the bad guy is and his untimely betrayal comes as zero suprise.  Then I'm on some... resort?  Like, an entire planet that's a resort?  Is that what it is?  With tough chick side-kick and cyborg side-kick.  And there's gangs of guys and then gangs of... zombies?  I don't know, a bunch of things that look like Gollum with a gun.  Nothing is set up, things are kind of explained after the fact but not really; it's a narrative mess is what I'm getting at.  Early on I was having some dangerous and upsetting flashbacks toCall Of Juarez: The Cartel, which is an ugly path I didn't want to walk down again.  Bulletstorm, of course, doesn't take itself nearly as seriously as and Call of Juarez game; it knows it's borderline retarded and doesn't hesitate to wallow in that.  It's a brave and bold game, even if it does eat its own glue-stick.But where Cartell failed miserably, Bulletstorm exceeds.  The gameplay is frantic and addictive, putting a couple of new spins on space marine FPS.  There are a couple of gimmicks in this one that work out pretty nice, first among them being the 'leash'.  It's a beam of blue... energy?  Mind powers?  Who cares, you grab bad guys with it and fling them around.  Once flung (by anything, actually, not just the leash) the baddies spin through the air in a sort of slow motion, letting you plan some sort of grizzly demise for them.  You've also got a dedicated 'kick-in-the-face' button, which you'll use as much as any gun.  You see, bulletstorm is littered with environmental hazards (spikes, frayed wires, lava pits, cliffs) and you're rewarded with points for finding clever ways to kill. In fact, there's an in game list of well over a hundred different ways to explode (or what-have-you) a monster using your weapons, the environment, or some wacky combination of the two.  Harder combos yield more points and, since you need those points to buy bullets and upgrade your weapons, you spend most of your time not thinking about surviving but about how to most creatively dispatch.  It's a strong point for the game as well as a weakness: bullets are hard to come by, so you better get creative if you want to get heated at the next drop-box.  Constantly having to link up to dropboxes to resupply and monitoring your point intake gives the game a needlessly choppy feel and pulls you out of the action time and time again as you're constantly trading out weapons to ones you have bullets for or just ones that might fit the fight better.  In the end, though, that's a small hiccup and the swift and often brutal ways of maiming your opponents (maybe I'll light him on fire, shoot his leg off and kick him into the electrical wire?  It's been that kind of day, why not?) remain the highlight of the game.  And the more efficient you can become with it, the more satistying it is - leading to a healthy amount of replay value.Which is welcome, because the game is rather short (8 hours?  something like that?).  That, and the ending is incredibly unsatisfying, with the ending fight completely failing in comparison to some of the games more awesome and cinematic moments throughout.  Listen, I know you want to set up a sequel, but COME ON, give me SOME kind of final fight!  With a game this insane and a story as weak as this one, it would not be hard to BS your way into the plot for a second chapter once you've wrapped up this one.  Seriously, give me a satisfying final fight; I'm not in this for the plot at this point (looking square at you Halo 2).Even with its failings, I have to recommend Bulletstorm.  It's a lovely take on a FPS and a juicy dose of the old ultra-violence.  There are even some pretty gorgeous landscapes and truly cinematic moments scattered here and there that would be worth checking out all on their own.  All in all, it's an excellent title to keep on the shelf for a rainy day... or just any day you feel the need to light someone fire, fling them through the air and then impale them screaming onto a giant cactus.  You know, one of THOSE days.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2012"}

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization.

Not as tight as COD4 or Left 4 Dead, for example.  The other quibble is what I imagine MMO and RPG players call as \"grinding.\"  I understand RPGs and loved games like Fallout 3 but after a while the scags get to be a little dull.Still, this is a different kind of game.  Really, it stands alone.  It does so many of the little things right.  It saves everything.  You lose virtually nothing, no matter when you quit.  You can drop in and out of any game with your character, keeping cash and loot and exp you gather along the way.This seems so obvious, but it's something other games fail miserably at.  Are you listening Bungie, with your half-arsed ODST effort?  Why could I only play with friends and recent players?  Why couldn't I drop in on another person's game?  Why did we have to be in a lobby first?As far as the story--is there a story?  I find myself heading from quest to quest and waypoint to waypoint but I couldn't tell you what this is \"about.\"  Which is OK, it doesn't have to be \"about\" much of anything as long as you're having fun doing \"nothing\" which I do.I like the comic-book slightly real/slightly cartoon look.  It COULD have looked like every other Unreal Engine game out there, but they added a nice flair.Again, this is a one of a kind experience.  If you were a fan of Fallout 3--well, this ain't really like it, but sorta.  If you liked COD4, it ain't really like it either, but sorta is.  Get the picture?  It takes elements from multiple genres and mashes them up quite nicely.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2009"}

While I don't think it sucks as bad as a lot of reviewers here, I'm not all that thrilled with it. It's CoD4 with a WWII skin. It really doesn't bring anything to the table that the last one didn't. The graphics are pretty good, some of the cinematics are cool (the beginning of the sniper level is amazing) and it's got a little more gore than most WWII games which gives the game a good gritty feel. Other than that it's pretty much a run of the mill WWII shooter that we've all seen a hundred times. The multiplayer is fun and worth playing a few times, the single player is OK and very short. It can be beaten in a day or two. While not a bad game, it's one you will play for about a week or two then be done with it. Keep that in mind to decide if it's worth the $$$ to you. I got it free with my new video card, not sure if I would have been happy shelling out full price for it.+1 stars for nazi zombies!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2009"}

There's no doubt about that. This game contains a mass amount of complex riffing alongside a fairly high difficulty level (compared to other music games like this one). Personally, I love that about this game. The crowd this product is marketed to will find it immensely enjoyable for both reasons.The reason I'm giving the game 4 stars is because the onslaught of challenging metal here is something I can only take in small doses. It quickly overwhelms most people I know who play it for very long. But that isn't to say this isn't a fantastic game, because it is. There are probably more than a few Metallica songs you'd hope to find on this disc which aren't here. But that's to be expected when a band has made so much music. Hell, they still manage to fill guest spots as well (which are also mostly all amazing).In short, if this type of music isn't your cup of tea, then you're better off not diving into it. And those the game is marketed to should know ahead of time that it's an unrelenting amount of metal with a spike in difficulty compared to other games like it. If that is what you're looking for, then look no further.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2012"}

But then I got hands-on time with Wii Sports that has now peeked my interest in the system. It certainly isn't even close to being anywhere near perfect, but it will provide cheap thrills for hours of entertainment.WHAT THE GAME IS: A game packaged with the Wii console containing sports like Tennis, Baseball, Golf, Bowling, and Boxing. The games are very short and require minimal effort to be good at them.GRAPHICS: This sure doesn't show off any capabilities of the Wii, it would have looked mediocre on last-gen consoles. The sloppy textures, the unremarkable childish animation, and the boring level designs bring down the experience at times.MUSIC: Annoying and repetitive.SOUND: The sounds match the sports they go along with, but it seems too quiet.GAMEPLAY: The gameplay generally works fine, but there are times when it feels like it doesn't respond in time. Tennis works by simply swinging the Wii-mote like a racket. Baseball is the same situation, hold your Wii-mote like a baseball bat and swing. Golf, use the controller like a golf club and swing. With bowling, hold down the B-button and toss the move the controller like you'd move a bowling ball in real life. With boxing, it requires both the Wii-mote and Nunchuck and you frantically fling your arms forward like a boxer. The game itself feels too short to last a long time at all, the experience is generally better if you bring a friend along to play with you. The game will entertain you for awhile, but I look for beefier games with more content, and unfortunately Wii Sports misses the mark and is too short for its own good.OVERALL: If you get a Wii, you're getting this game. It will entertain, and people who've never played games before will get a kick out of it, but more hardened gamers will look for an experience that provides more entertainment.THE GOOD: The sports are easy to pick and play, and playing with friends.THE BAD: The graphics, the music, and the game is too short.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2009"}

And yes, it's entirely positive.1. BEST LOCALIZATION OF A JAPANESE GAME EVER: The voice actors are phenomenal, and the fact that each of them was allowed to improvise a bit in order to make the dialogue more natural drags the adaptation from awesome to inspirationally badass. Closed-minded anime fans be damned... Catherine is an awesome game in English.2. ADDICTING GAMEPLAY: If you sit down and play a bit of the puzzle game in Catherine, you'll stay for the classical remixes. Once you've played more than an hour, you can't stop... it's just that much fun. I mean, you're Troy Baker in his skivvies with a pillow, climbing a staircase of giant blocks. By the time you pull yourself away to work or sleep, you have the Tetris Effect; you know, where everything you see seems like blocks which you can move around and stack. Except this time, your publication's paragraphs must have the words pushed around such that you can climb to the top of the page! (True story.)3. BOOZE AND SEX: The downtime, when you, you know... AREN'T climbing blocks in your boxers... you're boozing and dealing with relationship issues. What a good way to pass your time! Every so often, you get to respond to text messages in a surprisingly interactive way, which is fun. And if you can't wait to go back to climbing blocks, there's always the bar's arcade game which provides a long series of untimed block-climbing puzzles for your perusal.If you like being a badass in your underwear, twisty \"WTF\" plots, semi-realistic relationship drama, block-based puzzle games, hard classical remixes, or drinking and going home with good-lookin' chicks voiced by Laura Bailey, you should play Catherine.

Jefferson","summary":"Finally Finally Finally!","reviewText":"I have been anxiously awaiting this game, ever since E3 2005 when it was announced. I personally wasn't a huge fan of Smash Bros Melee, as I never owned a Gamecube. I bought a copy when I got my wii, but really haven't played it much. The wii version, however, I couldn't wait for. I know for a fact that many people bought a wii specifically for this title. I waited in line last night to pick up my copy and subsequently play in a tournament at my local Game Stop. I had seen lots of info online and in the SSB Dojo, but was still anxious to see this game in action... and let me tell you: I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. This game has proven to be SO AWESOME that I wish that I had given other Wii game reviews that I did in the past fewer stars... since now a 5-star rating takes on new meaning with this title! Finally, a Wii game that got it right... all of it right! No doubt this game will get plenty of 5-star reviews, so I won't bore you telling you how awesome it is. Instead, here are some reasons I love it, and why you should buy it:1 - FREE ONLINE MULTIPLAYER: This takes the game to a whole new arena. The online multiplayer is done wonderfully. Also, there are several game modes available. I was able to connect and begin playing right away. Also, you can choose to play with people locally, nationally, internationally, or in your friend list. Nicely done! Also, one really cool feature for the online system on this game that differs from the other wii online titles is that more than 2 people can play online from your console at a time, rather than only allowing a single player to play online per console (unlike MX vs ATV or Call of Duty).2 - Multiple control options: I LOVE that the wii games are starting to incorporate this. Having to purchase 4 wiimotes and 4 nunchucks to play 4-player games would cost a hefty sum.... But if you are like me and own 2 wiimotes, 1 classic controller, 1 nunchuck, and several gamecube controllers, you are in the game! You can use ANY combo of controllers you would like. I personally opt for the wiimote+nunchuck, as I don't like the gamecube controllers. However, my friends can come over and play with my GC controllers, no problem. Also, when you create a profile, your control schema choice is saved, so you don't have to set it up each time.3 - Special Brawl: This feature seems really cool, though I haven't had much time to play around with it. Basically you can customize your character and game type. Lot's of potential here. Not to mention there is also a STAGE BUILDER! I think this there is a lot of potential here. Again, since I am writing this early in the morning on the first day I picked my copy up, I haven't had much time to experiment.  That being said, it also seems like you can save your stage, and SEND IT TO A FRIEND to play on his console! As if that isn't enough, the rumor is that Nintendo will also be allowing you to submit your stage to them via wiiconnect24, and will, in turn, send certain stages out to subscribers via updates so you will end up with loads of stages to play on! Better upgrade that SD card, eh?4 - Finally! Co-Op Mode: Well done, period. Haven't had a chance to get much accomplished here, but it is simple and straight forward enough. For some reason, past Mario titles have been unable to fathom co-op. Even Galaxy has a weak co-op option at best, if it can even be called co-op. Smash Bros finally got it right.5 - Rotation Mode: Basically, this looks like it was built for controller hogs (like me). You enter the number of controllers that are connected (4 in most cases) vs the total # of players in the room.... And then WAMMY! Instant tournament in my living room! We played this for HOURS already, and it is pretty cool.Anyway, this game was obviously well done. It is simple enough to attract novice gamers and \"button mashers\", and content-rich enough to attract fans and more hardcore gamers. They have taken an already great game and made it even better. I plan to log COUNTLESS hours on this one. PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR: Buy it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2008"}

I've always slowed my pace down to sit back and enjoy Tom clancy games-especially the Rainbow Six series ones. Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 2: rogue spear and it's expansions along with Tom Clancy's: Ghost Recon plus Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell really impressed me and not just because of the engine they used-but because of the hyper seamless real-time game play and storyline and tatics/physics and so on that really made the Tom Clancy games a true hit. Splinter Cells special point? Graphics, Physics, Audio, Environment, etc. Ghost Recon? Similiar to rainbow six, just a lot harder with better graphics ;-). rainbow six? real-time game play tatics and much more. After playing the Rainbow Six 3 MP demo, I was very impressed. The Graphics were very impressive since they were using the Unreal II engine, having it require a p3 600 with 128 mb of ram and a modern 3D hardwat t & L acceleartor(such as the geforce 2/radeon 7500 etc series).

The reason why I give this four stars is because #1: It ain't perfect. #2: It's only MP in this demo. #3final: It can be fustrating. And a few other reasons I don't want to explain in this review. Ran decent on my system. My system is aging compared to the communities' though....:/. Oh well soon I'll be buying a NVIDIA GeForce 4 Ti 4200 128MB DDR SDRAM + for it :) and 256 mb of pc800rdram, and soon after I'll be getting yahoo sbc dsl and a bit more :D! Well what does it matter. Lets just say the demo is great! I suggest it for tom clancy fan gamers :-)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2003"}

I have been amazed at the realism that this game has.  From the various stances and batting styles, to the actual execution of fielding, pitching and batting, I have thoroughly enjoyed this game.  Teams can be managed or actually played.  The Home Run Derby as a pitcher or batter, fielding, pitching or batting skills can be practiced in subsets of the games.  Graphics, sound effects and physics are excellent.  The interface with the controls are responsive.  Replay factor is high.  I find this game to be one of my favorites in the library of Playstation Vita titles.  It would be nice to see Classic Teams from the beginning of the rich history in Major League Baseball.I look forward to future versions which can only get better.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2012"}

Hill \"CFH\"","summary":"Fun For All Ages, It's \"Animal Crossing\" - Recommended","reviewText":"If you have never played \"Animal Crossing\" on another system, you will almost certainly find something to like about this game. My whole family (son 12, daughter 16, wife 46, and me 42) play it for hours on end. Other than the occasional rude animal that might call you \"stupid\", there is little to nothing objectionable. The game is open ended in that your character can pretty much do what you want, when you want. My wife enjoys fishing, I like fossil hunting, and my kids like bug hunting. The only real \"goal\" is to expand your house and collect furnishings. There are also a lot of date driven events, like contests (catching the biggest bugs, for example), fireworks, etc. We also enjoy being able to visit other towns via Wi-Fi, a very cool feature that works very well! The game is very fun and somewhat addicting.For those that have played Animal Crossing on the DS, the Wii version really doesn't add that much different to the basic game. Sure, there are some new characters and most of the shops are now a bus ride away but the overall game of collecting, fishing, selling, and buying is the same as on the DS. Where we were very disappointed is in the lack of local multi-player support. With the DS version, all four of us could go to the same town at the same time. Since the Wii version is not fully compatible you can not use your DS characters interactively. Sure you can import you base character, but it's still single player. In some ways, the Wii version is a step backwards for multi-player fun.Overall, a great game! Highly recommended!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2008"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E5OE","description":"","reviewerName":"Leohlyon","summary":"Ten reasons why I traded Madden 12 in.","reviewText":"Each and every year I tell myself that I'm done with Madden. And what do I do? I get suckered in and buy it. But this is the last time, I traded it in, this is the first time I ever traded in a Madden game.I remember playing the franchise mode with every single NFL team, and having a blast. This game has consistently went downhill for years. The franchise mode sucks, plain and simple. I couldn't even make it through week 8, I just couldn't take it anymore. Don't get me started on online gameplay.....Reasons why Madden 12 sucks:1) Where is the half-time show with highlights during franchise mode? How do you have the audacity to call this 'real football' but you're too lazy to implement a half-time show, yeah that's real football.2) Why is the franchise mode interface so darn confusing? It's so much work to navigate around the franchise mode menu just to look at things like 'stats'. If I'm done viewing passing yards leaders and I want to look at rushing leaders, I have to exit out and go back in again, why? On NFL.com I don't have to do that.3) Why is it impossible to complete a pass to a WR running a deep post? Although Madden has tons and tons of passing plays, there are only a few that are actually worth running. It's impossible to complete a deep post in this game. It's either batted down or intercepted. If you have ever played Madden, you know what I'm talking about.4) Why do I get sacked EVERYTIME I play-action pass? This has been the case for the past few years, attempt a play action pass, and you'll get sacked 1 second after you finish the play fake.5) Why does just about every deep throw end in an interception, broken up, under throw, over throw, or thrown out of bounds? (notice that completed was not one of the choices) If I'm playing online and I see cover 0, I'm going deep to Megatron because it's man to man with no safety help. If I throw it 10 times to him, he catches 1, yeah, that's the way it happens in the NFL.....6) Why does everyone online use the exact same defense? If you've played online, chances are that you've ran into the infamous cover 0 defense. The best way to combat cover 0 is to throw it deep. Well, not in Madden 12. First of all, if you try to run a regular pass play against this cover 0, you're sacked. If you run, you're stuffed in the backfield. If you run a pitch outside, you may gain a couple of yards. If you throw it deep, like you should, you won't complete it (see #5)7) Why do I disconnect from the EA servers and get charged with a loss even though it's not my fault? This problem has plagued Madden online for years and continues with Madden 12. There is nothing more frustrating then being up 31-3 in the 4th quarter and BOOM, lost connection..charged with a loss.8) Why do I feel like Im on roller skates when playing defense? I usually play with a CB and it's hard as heck to cover WRs in this game. I understand momentum, but this is ridiculous. It's impossible to cover a WR man to man, even if you have Revis. If their WR makes a cut, your momentum takes you in the other direction as if you're on roller skates or something. Not fun playing as a defensive back....9)Why did everyone that gave this game 5 stars, only write 2 sentences about it? Go into detail like the 1 star reviewers do. I'm just saying...If this game is so great, give us something more than \"This is the best Madden on Earth\". Tell us why.10) When are we gonna wake up and realize this game will never change for the better as long as EA has exclusive rights to make it? I long for the days of 2K5, I'll leave it at that.I blame myself for this, I need to stop buying the game. Perhaps I've finally learned my lesson.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2011"}
