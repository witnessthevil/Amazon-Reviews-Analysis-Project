I felt they were decent.  I played the demo on 360 and dropped $60 to get the game.  The graphics, presentation, menus, playbooks/playcalling are all outstanding.  The passing is pretty good.  I do not like the defensive line play in this game. The controls are harder for me to rush the QB than past games. I had to really get used to the run blocking in this game.  It is good once you figure it out.  I like the speed of the game and how quickly you can get into the next play without all the cutscene animations.  I can see how some people love this game.  I had to go back to All Pro 2K8 though.  I played Madden 13 and 2k8 first on a 20\" screen.  I recently purchased a 32\" screen and realized that 2k8 still has the gameplay that I prefer.  The run blocking, passing, defensive line all are superior in my opinion.  The field of view is so much wider and clearer in 2k8.  You can see the receivers come out of their breaks so much clearer.  The flight of the ball is so much better to read on offense and defense.  The kicking system is still better on Madden though.  The Madden players look like they are skating while 2k8 looks like they are really running and dragging defenders.  2k8 will be 5 years old in two months and I am sticking with it for now.  If EA improves upon this I may give it another shot.  I wish that EA & 2K would join forces and call themselves \"EA2K\" or \"2KEA\".  That would satisfy every video game football fan around the world!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00004YUWA","description":"Icoweaves the tale of a young boy trying to escape his  imprisonment in a large, vacant castle. Along the way, he discovers another  captive--a beautiful princess named Yorda. Players control Ico with the goal of  escaping the castle with the princess safely in hand.Although it looks like an adventure game and has some rudimentary action  sequences, Ico is mostly about solving puzzles. Players will run, jump, and  climb their way through the gargantuan castle as well as figure out which  objects and environments are interactive. Yorda is very much a damsel in  distress, and isn't nearly as capable as Ico. A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike. The  ambient soundtrack and simple controls let the player focus on the tasks at  hand. Sony has crafted a very unique game that anyone can play. Few games are as  elegant in their simplicity as this puzzler from Sony.--Raymond M.

That is, until recently. This weekend I popped it back in to my PS2 and finished it off...and boy, am I glad I did.ICO is an absolutely wonderful game. It has impeccable art direction, superb gameplay, and a very charming story. I was blown away by the scope and design of the environment. Even today.The story is simple. ICO is a small boy out to rescue a fair princess in a huge, daunting castle. Finding your way out of the fortress is just half the battle, as you are able to do things and go places the fragile princess is not. You must figure how to get her out, too, while fending off the dark spirits out to steal her back. The game is a moderately-paced fairy tale in the absolute best sense. From opening to closing credits, this game is top notch.If you like puzzle adventure games, you have to play ICO. It's vast, cinematic, and wonderfully played out. At it's current retail price it's a bargain. The used prices are just too good to pass up.Really. Do yourself a favor and play this game if you never have. It's an early PS2 title, but it's still one of the best, and probably one of the most genuine games you will ever play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2003"}
{"product_name":"B0000A9Y11","description":"Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

This case only holds 12 games and for that number it seems big. It is not thick but it is long compared to my sons DS case.  His case holds 16 DS games (larger game disc as well for DS) compared to the 12 for this unit.  His case is about 1/3 smaller in length than this case.  On the positive side, this case is slim so it can fit into a coat pocket without being too bulky.Upon first use one of the clips that hold games in place broke so now it can only hold 11 games.  I didn't even know it broke off until I closed the case and the game came loose.  I soon found the little plastic clip that holds the case on the floor but it had broken off so I wasn't able to fix.So although this is an ok case for the money I think it is too long for the number of games you can carry.

Roman","summary":"Raccoons are cool, RC cars aren't.","reviewText":"I missed out on the Sly Cooper series on the ps2 because that period in my life was my gaming hayday, and I just plain missed out because I was busy with so many others. It was a series I definitely had interest in though, and when the HD collection came out, I made sure to buy it. My daughter showed a lot of interest too, and we played through all 3 games together. She's 6 years old and had a blast playing through the games with me, and got irritated at the same parts I did (read- the third game). The bottom line is that this is a fantastic deal, getting three full fledged games for the price of one, with improved visuals, load times and plenty of trophies to boot if you're a trophy hunter.You play as Sly Cooper, a master thief, and he travels the world looking for various treasures or specific items he's after. In the first game, he's trying to collect pieces of the Thievius Raccoonus, which is a kind of family history book that also holds secrets to help him become a better thief. He'd joined by his two friends Bentley and Murray, who help whenever possible. Bentley is the brains of the operation and does all the computer hacking, while Murray drives the getaway van. The first game in the series has you playing as Sly 95% of the time, with a few levels where you get to play as Bentley and Murray. Sly's stages are of the action-platforming variety. You'll jump, sneak and attack enemies with your cane while trying to get back pages from the Thievius Raccoonus and restoring your family's name. In the second and third installments, a little more variety comes in with more levels to play as Bentley and Murray, as well as several additional characters in the third game.Playing as Sly is a blast. I loved using his special abilities like placing decoys, jumping and landing on small platforms, sneaking around ledges and even slowing down time. There are lucky horse shoes scattered around the stages, which grant you an extra hit before losing a life. Yep, this is one of those games where if you get hit once or fall off a cliff, you're out. It helps encourage the player to be more sneaky, rather than running head first into combat, swinging your cane around like a maniac. Honestly, I didn't die that many times in the first game. There are only a handful of enemies in each level, and the bosses have a pattern that you can get down pretty quickly for the most part. Level design is very good and exploring the areas to find more coins and bottles was always fun. I mean it when I say that there's nothing at all that frustrated me about the first game.The second game is where things get taken in a slightly new direction, allowing you to play as Sly's buddies. It's still fun, but the third game is where everything goes downhill big time. Here's where they add too many characters. You can argue all you want about how this \"adds more variety\", but the problem is that none of them are fun to play as. I knew I was in for a bad trip as soon as one of the stages with Murray required me to bounce around the city to get to my destination. Seriously, I mean it- you have to roll into a ball and bounce through the city. Every new area usually requires that you play as every single character at least once, to meet up with the rest of the group. A new one, who I won't say the name of as to not spoil the game, takes forever to load his special weapon and is a sitting duck until it's ready. He's a great character, and even gets a good amount of character development within the story, but my god did I hate having to load his weapon. Another new character you play as, is only used for the very small number of underwater missions and nothing else. Controls for these sections was atrocious, especially when you had to fight a boss who can kill you in 3 hits. The other two characters are used a bit more. One is Guru, a cool little koala that has taken up a life of peace and refuses to resort to violence. He gets through levels by transforming into objects so enemies don't notice him, and also by jumping onto the backs of enemies, and controlling them to go places. When controlling an enemy, they automatically take off like Road Runner and don't stop until you get off of them or they crash into something. It's a pain in the caboose, and guess what. You get to do it many times! It sucks when a cool character is given such poor gameplay. The real kicker is later on when Guru actually DOES resort to violence to an extent, and controls a giant squid, smashing enemies on a pirate ship. So much for that.What killed the game for me to the point where I refuse to play through it again though, is Penelope. She's Bentley's love interest, being a techno junkie just like him. Rather than playing as her, you get to control her RC car or helicopter. Because younger kids might be reading this, I'll use the nice term and say that the RC car handles like donkey. Every single time Penelope showed up for her levels to start, I could feel my blood boiling. My daughter would sigh loudly as well, and she initially liked the character. It's a miracle that I beat the game instead of giving up out of frustration. I came -very close- a few times, yet I managed to pull it off. The worst part is that these stages go on for much longer than they should. As for the helicopter, it'd be a lot more fun if the level it's used in wasn't so full of enemies and targets that you have to protect. I've heard that she shows up in the new Sly game, and I hope to god that something very bad happens to her.Visually, all three games look very good for being as old as they are. The visuals change from game to game, with the first one looking the most basic in terms of character models and such. There was never any slowdown, no matter how much was going on. As for the soundtrack as a whole, it's not very memorable, but definitely not bad either. There are only a couple of tracks I can remember...mostly the more jazzy ones. Voice acting is hit or miss, with Sly and Bentley's voice actors doing the best work. Murray's voice was good in the first game, and yet they got the most wooden, tough-guy voice actor they could find, probably from some 3rd string anime dub.Despite how much I hate the third game for losing focus on the main character, I highly recommend The Sly Collection. The first two games are just plain fun to play, and two of the few games I've had fun with playing the stealthy way. I got my daughter Sly 4 for Christmas, and can't wait to play it with her, and see what the new team was able to do with the ps3's hardware.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2013"}

Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Move Primer","reviewText":"Sports Champions came was included in our Move bundle and we've been playing it a lot, at least some of the events.Besides providing a suite of entertaining games, Sports Champions is meant to show what Move can do vs. what you can do on the PS3 with a DualShock controller and to show how much better the Move happens to be when compared to 'the other guys' when it comes to motion control. In these respects, it succeeds but it also shows how a Move-based game could be great or... not and it makes it quite obvious that TWO Motion Controllers may be needed to fully enjoy some of the Move games.THE INCLUDED EVENTS AND WHAT THEY ARE ABOUTA game such as the included PING PONG shows Move's nothing short of amazing ability to track its controllers position in 3D space and, better, even detect moves such as wrist rotation and to track acceleration as 'force' and do it in real time. Playing Ping Pong is challenging, fun, frustrating and addictive. My entire arm, from wrist all the way up to the neck hurts already and I'm not even done with the Bronze Medal challenge yet (almost there).ARCHERY is probably second most popular, at least in our household. We like it because, unlike PING PONG, we don't sweat a lot while playing it. ARCHERY is also one of the 3 included games that make it quite clear that you will be much better off with TWO Motion Controllers. Some of the challenges look quite cheesy - shooting at floating money bags but we've spent some time playing it and it's likely that we are going to play some more in the future.The GLADIATOR SWORD FIGHT game, even more than ARCHERY would benefit from TWO Motion Controllers - one for the sword/axe and a second for a shield. With one controller only, you must pull the trigger to raise and use your shield or use the sword otherwise. Yes, Sony gave us BUTTONS but the game is ten times more realistic when you actually push your shield forward the way you would actually do it in real life rather than pull the trigger to raise the shield and, at the same time push the Move button while making a 'push' motion.BOCCE... ever played it? I have a couple of times. Plays well with one controller but it can be a little boring. Good simulation.FRISBEE GOLF is not bad. Actually played it in real life on the course we have at the nearby state park. It's a little slow but it's good relaxation after you sweat yourself out on PING PONG or GLADIATOR.VOLLEYBALL, again, can be so much better with two Motion Controllers. Also, be careful if you play in a room with low ceilings or anything that hangs from the ceiling like a ceiling fan or a priceless crystal candelabrum.MY OVERALL IMPRESSIONThis is an early game and it's sort of a demo so my expectations are not that high. As I stated already, some of the games are fun, some will need two controllers to be enjoyed to the fullest.Discussing the games themselves. I would have preferred if they were a little more realistic or if they have a 'realistic' option.In all modules, you are playing or rather remote-controlling one of the game-provided avatars who, presumably, have their own personality, gender, talents and motivations. This can be a little frustrating when you want to be YOU playing there. In other words, as capable as the Move environment can be to track whatever is going on both in the game space in in your own real world, the game will make you more or less effective depending on 'who' it is that you are playing.The above was something specific to this game. Hopefully, future games will allow at least one 'realistic' option. As fun as it may be to play as a muscular Samoan in a Roman gladiator arena, I would really like to be able to play as myself. Especially when playing other 'real' players.Something that has to do with the Move protocol, probably not likely to be improved soon is the need of frequent calibration. It only takes a few seconds but it can be distracting and it can unceremoniously pull you out of the game universe and sometimes spoil the fun.Finally, still calibration-related. I don't know if this only manifests on this game but we experienced several instances where calibration failed when playing at night. Had to turn on all lights and try several times. I am noting it because, once calibration completed the game could be played without a problem with half of the lights off. It would be good if the calibration requirements could be toned down a little to a level that makes the game possible and not any higher.MY RATINGI had this game as part of a bundle so I'm glad there is SOMETHING I can use with my brand-new Move controllers at this time but... would I buy this as a stand-alone a couple of months from now when, hopefully, there will be a lot more games to chose from, hopefully better designed and with more depth? The answer is 'probably not'.I believe that something like PING PONG and maybe GLADIATOR could be a successful PSN download somewhere in the $10 range. ARCHERY may be viable if it sold for a little less. The other three games... I'm not so sure.So, for TODAY's rating, I'll have to rely to Amazon's 'star' guidelines which says that 3 stars mean 'It's Okay' and 4 stars means 'I like it'. Looking at it this way, I can say that TODAY 'I like it' so Sports Champions is reluctantly awarded 4 stars. A few months from now, if Move turns out to be successful and some 'real' games become available, this would be a 2-3 star game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2010"}

The voiceovers by the actors who played Sauramon, and Gandalf add a very nice touch to the game.

I assumed this would be temporary, but no - the non-skippable \"cinematics\" and speeches are a painful part of this game.That said, to call Unreal 2 a sequel would be an insult to the original - Unreal being a great game, from both visual and entertainment perspective. The new levels are good looking, but, like many have noted, short, linear and non-expansive. Compare this to the first Unreal, in which every level was large and varied. In addition, levels in Unreal connected very well together, and the bits of information pulled from electronic diaries were enough to understand the plot of the game; while Unreal 2 is quite the opposite - after every level you end up on the mother ship and have to take off to another planet (if you can sit through another boring \"briefing\" by someone who looks more like a Playboy Playmate than a member of military personnel).Yes, Unreal 2 is very good looking, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it should be a shooting game, and not a sad attempt at a half-arsed RPG. People shouldn't have to sit through 5 minutes of speeches just to start the stupid game - it's a shooting game for god's sake, not Final Fantasy.This game does have some redeeming qualities - the weapons are very interesting, for one thing. The levels are also different from one another visually. Also, the idea of having extra firepower on hand (Marine assistance) is fun every now and then. And... sorry, I can't think of anything else. The rest are cons - long, winded speeches about nothing in particular, weak plot, extremely long loading times (even for a machine less than a year old), linear gameplay (very little freedom) and restricted level structure. The game is also painfully short - it really can be finished in the matter of hours. I managed to actually finish it on my work computer within a week, playing half to an hour a day.The original Unreal was very impressive, as it ran circles around Quake, visually. While this one looks nice, it lacks serious innovation. Sure, the poly counts are higher, but what else? Not much, apparently.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2003"}

JAGELLA","summary":"We need a true sequel!","reviewText":"I've been a big fan of the Unreal games since I first started playing Unreal in 1999.  I absolutely loved it, and I'm still playing the single-player campaign (I must have played through it 25 times or more).  I was very pleased to see that Return to Na Pali did a great job of extending the Unreal adventure without ruining it.  Unreal Tournament was a blast to play as well even though it didn't include a single-player campaign.  So with all this Unreal software that made me so happy you can imagine how I felt when I heard that Unreal II was in the works.  But as they all say, &quot;Don't believe the hype.&quot;Unreal II was hyped up all-right, and a prominent PC games magazine said, &quot;It's gonna change computer gaming as we know it.&quot;  How ironic considering that Unreal II has very little new to offer except for the graphics which almost a year later may still be the best out there.  It's a good game, but it has very little to thrill me.  More than anything else, I must take Legend to task for taking so much out of the game that should have been left in.  Unreal had great monsters as well as great levels to battle them on.  Legend, for some strange reason, only left the Skaarj in, and even the Skaarj in Unreal II arent't as great as the original Skaarj.Unreal II, however, does get a few other things right.  Some of the new weapons are good.  The shotgun is very effective, and the grenade launcher which can fire different kinds of grenades is cool.  Perhaps the best new weapon is the flame thrower.  It spouts a very effective and attractive flame, and I must wonder why the older Unreal games didn't include a flame thrower.After playing Unreal II, I soon realized that a REAL sequel to the first game is in order.  Bring back all the elements that made Unreal so great but with state of the art graphics and sound.  Sure, add new gameplay characteristics, but don't throw the baby out with the bath water.  That is, don't call a game &quot;Unreal&quot; while making it unreal to its fantastic pedegree.  Epic Games, do you hear me???","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2004"}

{"product_name":"B001HWB68K","reviewerName":"trashcanman","summary":"New Mombasa by starlight.","reviewText":"First off, that's pronounced Oh-Dee-Ess-Tee, fellow gamers.  The game store clerks wish to punch you in the face when you attempt to say a game's acronym as an actual word.  Trust me. Anyhow, \"Halo 3: ODST\" is a separate Haloverse story that strips itself of the series' iconic hero Master Chief.  There are no super-powered Spartan cyborgs to pull humanity out of the fire in this one.  Just you and your squad of Orbital Drop Shock Troopers standing between the hostile alien alliance known as The Covenant and the death of humanity.  No pressure, though.  The game was originally formulated as a mere add-on toHalo 3, but eventually grew to full-fledged game status.  This has offended a lot of sniveling whiners who ran out and pre-ordered their copies  based solely on the typical Halo hype and then sobbed themselves to sleep because they have no concept of story and ran through the game with 3 friends on Easy difficulty and found it too short on action for the money they spent.  Real gamers will find that while the price tag may be a bit high if you already paid for all of the downloadable maps and don't gather your friends together regularly to partake in the phenomenally fun \"Firefight\" mode.  But if you plan on enjoying this game to the fullest, you will not be disappointed.As a single-player game, \"ODST\" runs a bit short and may be less bang for the buck then one might hope for.  However, the manner in which the story is told is absolutely phenomenal.  You begin your ill-fated mission hurling towards the Earth (which has just been invaded by Covenant forces) on a special-ops mission.  But something goes wrong and your pods are separated and crash in different locations all over the Covenant-occupied African city of New Mombasa.  You wake up as a trooper known only as as \"the Rookie\" many hours after hitting the ground in the dead of night.  From there you search the city for clues about the whereabouts of your comrades.  Each time you find a clue (such as a fractured helmet or bent sniper rifle) the game flashes back to a different member of the squad and you play out the scenario as that character and witness the events leading up to the object finding it's resting place where it will be discovered hours later by The Rookie.  In addition, there is another side story littered throughout the city in the form of 30 audio files that chronicle the adventures of a young girl caught in the middle of the invasion.  It's quite enthralling and I found myself looking forward to finding more pieces of that puzzle even more then the main story.  \"ODST\" is a masterpiece of storytelling in that rite and it's why a lot of people won't enjoy it.  They prefer to skip past the story segments and run around with their friends teabagging each other along the way.  To really experience the game as it's meant to be played, you need to go it alone and absorb the atmosphere,loneliness and ambient noise of the ruined cityscape.  Half of this game is enjoying the tension of relying on cover of darkness, using your excellent night-vision visor to it's utmost, hearing the amazing soundtrack, and exploring the city looking for audio files or finding the best ways to get the drop on roving patrols of enemies or the entrenched Covenant forces.Same old Halo gameplay here.  That is to say it's as good as first-person shooters get.  But since you are not a Spartan, there are differences.  First off, no shield.  Your armor can take a few hits before your screen will turn red, indicating that you are fatigued and are taking damage to your health bar.  To recover, you must stay out of combat for a time.  It's not a lot different from past games, but you can't take quite as much punishment.  You also no longer have gravity-defying jumps or one-hit kill melee capabilities, and no more dual-wielding.  Don't go jumping off any cliffs either.  Wipes your stamina right out.  You also get one new Covenant race -whose mystery turns out to be central to the story-, a brand new weapon in the form of a silenced SMG which quickly became a favorite of mine, and the extremely welcome return of zoom capabilities on the pistol.  I was hoping for more of a focus on stealth aspects, but Bungie couldn't help but make most of the levels typical shoot-em-ups.  This definitely diminishes Master Chief's importance as I felt I kicked as much or more tail as an ODST compared to when I played the penultimate Spartan.  But I sure as hell did have a great time doing it.  There's also plenty of vehicular mayhem to enjoy.  They could have easily recycled the epic score from previous games, but instead they crafted a new one that is as good as any they've done.  And that says a lot considering every Halo score is among the greatest in gaming.Okay, enough about single-player.  Games likeGears of War 2andLeft 4 Deadgave us a new mode of gameplay where you are challenged to take on wave after wave of increasingly difficult enemy attacks and survive with a little help from your friends.  Not to be outdone, Bungie has crafted their answer in Firefight mode, which can go on for hours at a time if you're good enough.  If the campaign wasn't action-packed enough for you, get three buds together and get ready to be dropped in a very defensible position with a set number of lives (more can be gained) to endure endless waves of attack from every baddie in the game.  Watch those snipers!  The longer you survive, the more difficult the game makes it for you.  It will start turning on \"skulls\" which make the game harder by decreasing ammo drops, empowering enemies, or otherwise making your life harder to keep.  This mode is ODST's crown jewel, for sure.  They've even added extra kinds of medals for you to earn based on your performance in battle.  Firefight is unlimited fun and a FPS fan's co-op wet dream, plain and simple.  If that still is not enough, the second disc of the set contains \"the complete Halo 3 multi-player experience\"  which consists of every map ever made for the game and three brand new ones.  24 in all.  That is a ton of maps and seeing as they run a few bucks apiece if you download them from Xbox Live that is a large value if you've been holding out.  Even if you haven't bought Halo 3, you can join in the fun and madness of murdering complete strangers and then desecrating their corpse while they are forced to watch with all of the extra content using this bonus disc.  If you are that guy, then this game is a steal.  But I don't know that that guy exists.Killer story: check.  Awesome action: check.  Multiplayer badness: check.  New additions to the ever-growing Haloverse mythology: check. Incredible soundtrack: check. Yup; this is one fine game.  Haters, keep on hating. Bungie gave the hardcore fans a treat with this.  I'd have liked to see it priced about $20 cheaper, but I also want my very own Spartan armor and that ain't happening either.  The fact is, I'm happy with this game in spite of it's brevity and the fact that I've already purchased most of the maps.  If you've no interest in the story and mythology of Halo, I'd suggest you pass on this.  The campaign is no challenge with 4 player co-op even on Legendary difficulty and there often are not enough enemies to go around so you will have to look for trouble to find it at times which will enrage many a fratboy.  Firefight mode will still be a blast, but one can hardly be expected to shell out $60 for a single gameplay mode.  And considering their is no matchmaking on that mode, you can only play it with people on your Friends List which is a pain.  ODST isn't perfect, but it's obvious a whole lot of care went into it and it's a great experience all around.  Plus, with a dream team cast featuring aFireflyreunion of Nathan Fillion, Alyn Tudyk, and Adam Baldwin plusBattlestar Galacticasex goddess Tricia Helfer and voiceover mainstay Nolan North -who has provided the voice for Deadpool and various other animated comic book characters- who the hell can really complain?  It's more Halo, and that's never something to whine about.4 1/2 stars, rounded up for a new wrinkle in the series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0047THYWC","description":"","reviewerName":"Schwe1nehund","summary":"An abyssmal failure of epic proportions","reviewText":"PROS:- Voice-overs: excellent voice-acting, especially Hawke, who is one smooth cat.- Script: Bioware's dialogue and writing is still among the best in the industry (script does not make the story).- Skills: The revamped skill trees add a lot more diversity to your chosen class (rogue, mage, warrior).CONS:- RPG mechanics: practically non-existent or not in sync with established norms. A perfect example is how a dual-wielding rogue dishes out more damage than a double-handed axe-wielding warrior (huh?).- Story: non-existent 'main story.' Its actually a hodge-podge of side quests - most of which are so ill-structured that one has to wonder how they had the balls to charge $59.99. The quest structure is too simplified and like the rest of the game, utterly boring. And then there are the filler quests. All of them have you stumble upon a random item (e.g. someone's hat) and turn it into a random, characterless person (e.g. a monk) with nothing more than a 'this looks like it belongs to you.' Ridiculous. Had this game come out for a mobile device or an ipad, it would have been great (but also, not on my radar). Angry Birds on my Android provides much better entertainment than this stinking mess.- World: The biggest disappointment is the use of the same areas ad nauseum ad infinitum. I practically quit playing the game for more than a week after entering the Wounded Coast for what felt like the 100th time. This is shameful when considering the fact that it took me about 70 hours over a period of 10 days to finish the original game.NEUTRAL:- Combat: Its fun at first, but glaringly different from Origins. I did like the old system better. This one's just got too much blood everywhere - and the most shameless use of repeated death animations ever. Hit someone with a mighty blow and the dude/dudette explodes in a shower of gibblets. What's more, females undergo a sex-change in the instant before death and land in a heap of distnictly male body parts. Yes Bioware, I can spot that bald head and those bulging forearms.- Music: Not bad, but not particularly memorable. A few recycled tracks from the first game - which both hurts and benefits the game. Truly neutral on this point.OTHER THOUGHTS:Accoridng to Steam I have spent a total of 364 hours on Origins and another 30-something on Awakening. Rest assured that'll never happen with DA2. Providing actual entertainment was clearly the lowest item on the developer's priority list. Where Origins was a work of love and a proper homage to the Baldur's Gate series, DA2 is simply the result of EA pressing Bioware for a quick profit. DA2 is to Origins what Justin Bieber is to Pink Floyd. I'm not buying anything from Bioware that's got Mike Laidlaw at the helm (Sorry to single you out Mike, but if this ship's going down I'm holding the captain responsible).I can't wait to get my hands on the real RPGs that are coming out later this year.

{"product_name":"B00113JSCG","reviewerName":"ChomskyKnows \"ChomskyKnows\"","summary":"crazy camera, crappy controls","reviewText":"One of the most disappointing titles of 08 is Alone in the Dark.Pros:- good visuals (but you often won't be able to appreciate them due to a crazy camera)- good effects (fire and electrical)- good soundtrack- good (looking) inventory (it's only good conceptually though, NOT good in practice)- a nice rebuild-a-world concept. Eden did this incredibly well with Test Drive Unlimited. I suggest you buy that game instead.Cons:- EVERYTHING ELSE- the camera/view/perspective is insane and simply uncontrollable. This game has a 1st person/3rd person/3rd person (forced) perspective. It switches back and forth between these perspectives every 5 seconds against your will (you have no choice), disorienting you, and when the perspective changes the control layout also changes which is even further disorienting. This means that if you are looking around in 1st person (with right thumbstick - like every other game in the world) and the game sudden changes to 3rd person (because they think it's a neat cinematic gimmick), that right thumbstick no longer functions as it did before. In combat, it gets worse. that same thumbstick changes yet again depending on the weapon. Wow, that, is, nuts.- first person view is too slow- controls are insane and uncontrollable. As described above, they keep changing and you have to unlearn everything you just learned and relearn what the h*ll everything does based on what perspective you are in and what the situation is. That's the problem. Your brain will still be using the layout you were able to use 2 seconds ago, because that's natural, intuitive and the way most good games work. h*ll, even really bad games have consistent controls.- there is NO option for the gamer to map the controller as in other games. If they'd put the controls in the gamer's hands, maybe this would have been a 2 or a 3.- even if you master the constantly changing controls, they are still slow, clunky and unresponsive. Doing things like jumping and just trying to pick something up can be goofy.- While the inventory system is interesting and has a professional looking interface, it functions like everything else in this game, with poor unintuitive controls. Beyond that, the inventory doesn't pause the action, so you'll get your butt kicked in combat trying to figure out what to do with the inventory...nice- the use \"fire to kill everything\" gimmick is overused and seems a bit silly. Fire isn't ubiquitous in real life.- dialog not really inspired- story not really engaging- don't really care about the characters- driving is horrid. I won't even talk about it.- combat is tedious, long, difficult and silly using the clunky controls. and again, UNINTUITIVE and utterly inconsistent.- All of the above means POOR GAME TESTING. Somebody, somewhere at some point must have mentioned the camera and controls. My guess is that somebody did, they weren't the boss, and the boss never played the game.Usually with bad games, you have things like bad AI which runs right at you, low-rez textures, bugs, poor collision detection, stuff like that. These are hallmarks of low budgets, rushed titles, noob programmers, etc...Alone in the Dark is very bad is UNUSUAL ways. Like they had a big budget, decent developers, and had good tools in their hands, but still managed to create a monstrosity. That crazy show \"Cop Rock\" comes to mind.

I love this series and am so happy that Brotherhood is more of the same.  There is so much to do in the game and the length of time to play through everything is staggering.  For instance, I just completed the main story and it took 18 hours to do that without spending too much time on the side missions.  I've easily put another 5 hours in just going back and completing the Leonardo missions and doing things like looking for treasure, feathers and flags.  That's why I love this series.  I have not played one second of online multiplayer and have well over 20 hours of playing time with this game.  I hate spending money on a game that I can beat in a weekend and the only way I get more playing time is to play online or play the game again.  I can see AC3 easily hitting 30+ hours to complete everything. A great value for the money.Most of the changes to the game work really well too.  I didn't know how I would like the whole \"training assassins\" part of the game, but I enjoy having them do my dirty work for me almost as much as I like doing it myself.  It's so easy to be running around the rooftops and then just call an Assassin to take out the guard on the building across the way instead of having to find a way over there to do it yourself.  You don't even have to stop running.  Using an arrow storm to take out a group of guards is pretty awesome and if you find yourself really in a fight, you can call them in to help you.Overall, if you like the last game then you will like this one.  The changes are minor and it feels and plays a whole lot like the last one, which is a good thing.  Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000MUW98O","description":"InBurnout Paradiseplayers are treated to a rarity in the video games universe: a complete reinvention of an established franchise that equals, if not betters any of the previous games in the series. Yes, this is a large claim, but one that can be explained in a single phrase: Next-Gen Freedom.Driver's heaven is a wide open worldIn Paradise City even cars can fly.View larger.Go for broke in 'Marked Man' Mode.View larger.Nothing is off limits, even head-on crashes.View larger.Start a race any time with 'Easy Drive.'View larger.Although theBurnoutseries&#146; over the top mobile action has been its calling card since it ignited audiences on the PS2 in 2001, and later on the first generation Xbox console,Burnout Paradiseis the first game in the series that has been designed specifically for play on Next Generation consoles. This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Phantasmagoria","summary":"Solid Six Axis motion control driving, finally.","reviewText":"Burnout Paradise shines from the start the gamer isn't inundated withoptions and load screens, you are merely ushered to your seat in your intial vehicle and given the gas pedal. What is great is that this is all you need to begin enjoying and exploring the fictional but vividly realized Paradise City.  The music is eclectic but intially adds to the rush of the driving experience which after you master boost and drift becomes second nature.  The sheer speed of FZERO GX is coupled with the open city of Driver, with a little Crazy Taxi/stuntman comboing thrown into the mix. But none of this really matters as all the races and events can be ignored if you simply want to explore until your free will runs out of will.  All of this is balanced on a simple yet effective control scheme that is surprisingly better in its SIX AXIS motion control mode than traditional analog.  The game hasn't stalled or hiccuped on me in my 10+ hours of exploring and racing nor has any kind of bug reared its head.  The save system is always active so you never lose any accomplishments and other than the mild load time your gaming time spent here is just that gaming time.  It is evident that this game was crafted with more thought and care than your average racer or smash em up, and it shows in almost every detail.  I would have liked to be able to use my unused o button for the EBRAKE but other than that there is nothing here to complain about.  If you like driving games with over the top action and sensational amounts of speed then you are in for a treat, this game is excellent for novices and speed junkies alike as there is so much to do around every turn.

I have some gripes, but some are subjective. You may or may not agree.CONS1) [...] There are too many little distracting blips, shapes and colors on the screen. Some serve absolutely no purpose whatsoever; some served a purpose at one time (enemy vehicles) but don't anymore (empty enemy vehicles) yet they remain onscreen and are distracting.2) too many command options and options in general. There are too many things you need to do, buttons to press to get something done. I forgot which button to press half the time or pressed the wrong button. Not completely intuitive. The tutorial level would help IF there were not so much of this.3) friendly AI (your squad) is dumb. Previous GR games had your squad killing most of the enemies 5 seconds before you even knew they were there. Now they are often painfully dumb and all of them end up getting shot 10 seconds into any mission. You'll be patching them up OFTEN. I ended up often not sending them anywhere because I knew they would just get shot.4) GRAB COVER. This is a new feature of many of these next-gen games (such as Gears of War). Go up to a wall in this game, you get glued to it. I get what they're trying to do here, but it's difficult for me to get used to. You get glued to a wall in inopportune close-combat moments, can't move freely fast enough and end up getting killed.5) No \"Save Anywhere\" ability. This is a major gripe, because you'll be repeating the same damn thing over and over and over again, and perhaps not because YOU did anything wrong - maybe your stupid teammate did or a VIP stood out in the open waiting to get shot.6) Grenades. Awful. They suck. This is actually a downgrade from all other Ghost Recon and Clancy games IMO. There is little control (uses a color system) over the exact distance the grenade will be thrown and it needs to be very close to an enemy to do damage. Ubisoft (and other games) uses an intuitive grenade system for Splinter Cell, why can't they do it here?1&2 criticisms above are basically that the game is \"too busy\" - and this is coming from a seasoned veteran of Ghost Recon and Clancy titles in general (played 'em all for xbox). But that may be the point of the \"advanced\" part of the title, so the criticism may not be valid for you. 4) Again, I don't like GRAB COVER, you might. I especially don't like AUTO-GRAB COVER (used in this game). Give me a choice to do it or not.PROS1) solid next gen effort2) appreciate the variety of items/vehicles. Tanks, UAVs, helicopters, and you can control them all. They took away things like lazing targets, but that's okay.3) I like the helicopter gunner missions. Feels like I'm in Full Metal Jacket.4) even though i find the HUD distracting and busy, there are some genuine upgrades over past GR and Clancy franchise titles...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000TT4GBG","reviewerName":"Timothy Lovett","summary":"Rocking Out with Rock Band","reviewText":"Rock Band is perhaps the greatest party game to ever reach the console market.The game allows up to four players at one time to play along to a song and has a large assortment of songs to choose from with the option to purchase more online as you need to (they are nickel and diming you but even with the normal selection you have enough songs 58 to live off of without downloading any others).One of the most engaging pieces of the game is the ability to develop characters who are completely customizable. From shades to tattoos you can make your character look as close or as far away from you as possible.In terms of the gameplay, each instrument gives you a completely different experience. Fans of Guitar Hero will likely pick up the bass and regular guitar parts of the game more easily because it's a very similar interface --- you use your left hand (or right if you're left handed) to hold the colored buttons down and you strum a bar with your right hand to activate the guitar.As for drums, it's very similar to real drums in the sense that the sticks themselves are real and you have four pads to hit along with a foot peddle (which is hard to coordinate when you first start).Singing is somewhat trivial and as long as you know the general pitch you can manage to sing each song fairly easily. As long as you're seriously singing and not just humming with the right pitch you should have fun though. There are some songs which are near impossible to sing and I think it's kind of weird to expect you to be able to handle all range of vocals from Metallica to REM but it does allow all sorts of people to find songs they like.There are some major annoyances with the game as it is right now, however, regarding XBox Live. The chief complaint I'd have is the fact that the Band World Tour (multiplayer mode with a career) does not currently work online. You cannot add friends to your band and just play. Likely, in a rush to get the game out, they put this off. There has been some talk on web forums that they plan on perhaps patching the functionality in but until we see it I don't think anyone should pay much mind to that.Another annoyance with XBox Live is that when you do the Band Quickplay with others online (the only online mode available right now) and select a song the microphone can only be heard locally. So even if you have a singer online you cannot hear this person if you're not in the same room as them. You can make it so the lead singer can be heard but you have to hold down the left or right trigger on the controller for the singer. It's just an annoyance and doesn't make sense why they decided to do it this way.The Band World Tour is fun, however, if you have people over. You're given the ability to progress in your band, earn fans and money, and generally continue to gain notoriety as you continue your quest to the top. As you get more fans and complete gigs other locations and cities open up to you allowing you to progress more and sing harder songs. Challenges of varying forms also appear from time to time which is always fun and nerve wracking if you're unsure if you can perform the song.The solo mode, on the other hand, seems like it was just thrown into the game to give whoever owns it something to do when they're friends aren't around. You play songs with the solo tour, buy new clothing, and just move onto the next gig without the need to do anything else. It's a shame the same system of building up a fan base wasn't applied to the solo tour but again the game isn't the sort you should be playing all too often alone so it's not that big of a concern.All in all, it's a great game that brings people together and even after you're good at the songs replay value is fairly high. If you can take a hit in the short term to pay for the special edition and get the drums, the guitar, and the microphone it definitely will pay itself back in terms of enjoyment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2008"}

I mean I'm like anyone else when I get a new gadget, there is a honeymoon period.  It's called 'new toy syndrome'.Also, this review is for the hardware and software we own here and now, not for some speculative future potential of the product.My POV:I love technology and gadgets.  Also, I recommend, when reading Amazon reviews, concentrate on the negative ones first.  Read them and see if the reviewer is reasonable and whether the review brings up things that are important to you.  Also, check their other reviews to see if you agree with any of their other reviews regarding stuff you might both own, or if they have the same taste as you.Cost:Here is what we spent to get the kinect: XBOX 360 250GB Console $300 + Kinect (with Kinect Adventures) $150 + Kinect Sports $50 + Kinect Your Shape $50 + Kinect Dance Central $50 + Joy Ride $50 TOTAL (including tax) $700My conclusions (YMMV!):1)  SetupYou must have a min of 2.5m (8 feet) for one player, and 3.5m (11 feet) for two player.  Set up is a breeze, the software and documentation will hold your hand through the whole process.  This is designed so a child could do it.2) The honeymoon period:It is great fun to get it set up and try some of the neat stuff, like voice recognition and having it scan your body.  And playing some of the games for a little while is pretty cool It is always the same when I get a new gadget.  Like  when I got my first gps, first touch screen interface device (ipad), first smartphone, etc.  And I imagine the same thing happened in the past when people bought their first wireless tv remote control, or cordless phone.The new becomes old, and the device's success must succeed or fail on its abilities.3) Post honeymoon:The tech in its applied form (i.e. how it is actually used) isn't particularly compelling.  I'll get to the games in a minute, but right now I'll just mention menu navigation.  The voice and motion kinect hub nav is slow, and not integrated into the rest of the dashboard nav system.  In fact, it is an irritating waste of time.  Controller nav is way quicker and more efficient.  Call me crazy, but I would only call something advancement in user interface tech if it made things smoother and quicker.And controlling an onscreen image with your body is not big deal once you've done it for a few hours4)Kinect Games:DANCE CENTRAL: Who would have thought dancing could be fun? -kidding-  Dancing is of course fun, so it's no surprise that a dance video game is fun.We also have the wii, and have spent more than a few nights laughing and flailing and sweating in competitive glee to the Just Dance games.The Kinect dance game is fun too, but for us suffers from one fatal flaw, you cannot dance together.  You can take turns playing it, but you cannot do it together.  Playing at the same time is waaay more fun; when you're dancing and and trying to catch up to your patner's score, or keep your lead...it's great fun, so much more than turn based play.  So we prefer the just dance 2 player mode, even though the wii controller method isn't as nearly good as the kinect's controlerless.ADVENTURE:These are incredibly shallow, very easy, wave and hope games.  There is minimal skill involveAdventure mini games half the shelf life of a fruit fly.  If the idea of plunging leaks in glass sounds like long term, repeat play fun to you, you'll love Adventures.SPORTS:Kinect Sports isn't the revolutionary experience that Wii Sports was, though it does have its own charm. Seeing Mii-like Avatars in the same brightly-lit bowling alleys, soccer fields, and boxing rings diminishes from whatever freshness the title might otherwise have had.Most of the games in Kinect Sports require you to do nothing more than stick out a limb in a particular direction. Motion and momentum don't matter as much as hitting the correct point in space. For example, to play soccer just stick out a leg in front of you and hold it there. The ball will continue to be passed forward and kicked into the goal as it moves from player to player. To change directions, just point your foot in a different direction. Defense demands a bit more variation, but just barely.In fact, the game does a better job of recognizing what it is you're trying to do when you play this way. If you try to play it as it was designed--by doing a full kicking motion--you more often run the risk of the camera not detecting the correct movement. The other games in this collection all suffer from similar shortcomings.Unresponsive inputs and confusing prompts also make the volleyball more frustrating than fun. It has potential with proper controls, but as is it's too difficult to tell if the action prompts - which tell you when to hit the ball - are signalling you or your AI partner. Connecting with the ball when you mean it feels good and hints at the promise of body-controlled sports.However, more often than not we missed shots or wondered what the hell was going on even when we did nail a game-winning spike. It's tough to recommend Kinect Sports to anyone who owns Wii sports.The worst is Track and Field; like the real-life sport it requires lots of running and jumping, but because you're playing in your living room, these activities must be performed in-place. Unless you're a hyperactive toddler on a caffeine bender, this isn't much fun. Discus and javelin challenges, which have you mimicking the expected gestures are as boring as they sound. Hurdles, which mixes the run-and-jump routine, offers some moderate entertainment.  The results also are random.  For example  in the javelin, I get to anywhere from 25 - to 80-meter throw, even though I used the exact same throw.Bowling is a complete mess. Rather than trying to duplicate the motions of actual bowling as in Wii Sports, bowling in Kinect Sports works instead by a series of obtuse and imprecise gesture combinations. Aiming the ball is clunky, and since you can't see your bowler's feet, you can't tell where you're standing. There's none of the impressive and unexpected finesse found in Nintendo's motion-based bowling game from four years ago. Worse, to add any spin to the ball, you have to swipe your entire arm across your body. Clearly bowling in Kinect Sports wasn't designed by anyone who has ever actually bowled. Needless to say, The Dude would not stand for this aggression, man.Lag in detecting motions makes boxing and table tennis unplayable with any seriousness. Volleyball and soccer are the two non-dogs here, but your tolerance for them will depend entirely on how entertained you are by simply pointing your limbs at points in space.JOYRIDE is the least interactive Kinect launch title. Instead of the full body movement seen in games like Kinect Sports or Dance Central, Kinect Joyride is controlled simply by holding your hands out in front of you, gripping an imaginary steering wheel and miming your turns. There's no need to accelerate or brake - that's taken care of by the game.It is the worst racing game I've ever played.  You cannot control your speed, you cannot brake into corners. The steering sensitivity is a mixed bag, even on straight roads expect to be taking detours through trees most of the race.  Not that it matters, grass and dirt don't slow you down and trees, fences and other barriers go down with no ascertainable impact to your speed or the car.Accuracy means very little in Joyride. That means that the game is easily accessible to the players Kinect is marketed towards.  Was made that way for marketing or because of the limits of the techYOUR SHAPEKinect might be a killer exercise aid.  Yourshape shows some of the promise that Kinect has in this area.  And nothing sells like the promise of losing weight in the USofA.  But this is not the Kinect's killer app.The first few times you play it, you will really enjoy it.  The body analysis and immediate form correction are great.  And seeing yourself onscreen is pretty cool (although some people might not want that).  But the meat and potatoes of the game are sparse, and not personalizable.But I want a fitness game to make we want to come back day after day, give me a hard but enjoyable workout, and be flexible enough to accommodate my fitness whims. Ubisoft describes the motivating rewards:  \"The better you perform, the more you are rewarded with interactive effects such as paint, water, light, ink, confetti, and more. You'll stay motivated and excited - you never know what's going to happen next!\"  woohoo, paint water and confetti.SUMMARY:Kinect as it is right now is underwhelming.  Once the novelty wears off, it will be a dust collector in our house.The games have little in the way of replay value and are aimed at people who very causual gamers and kids.  I imagine kids will find them quite fun, but really don't kids have fun doing anything that isn't homework or school?Maybe in a year this review might be totally out of date.  I'm really hoping for a dance game we can play together, and some compelling exercise games.  But until that vapourware materializes, this a 2 star $700 novelty system. YMMV.EDIT ON MARCH 27: We recently purchased a PS3 move bundle.  Although we bought it mainly for the blu-ray player, we have been pleasantly surprised at the 1:1 nature of the move system.  Fight: Lights out is a great although flawed 1:1 fighter, and killzone is a great 1:1 shooter.  The number of worthwhile games though, is quite limited, so you might want to think about whether you want to spend the extra cash for the move because you will need 2 controllers and probably the nav controller and blu-ray remote in addition to the bundle  (total cost for the items not included in the bundle was $140-1 extra controller, 1 remote, 1 nav controller, 1 charging station).","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2010"}

I know that sounds ridiculous, but it works in the game.  Dante's lovely wife Beatrice lost a bet with Lucifer and Dante battles his way through the nine levels of hell to rescue her soul.  The descriptions of hell and its tormented souls are very interesting. The story is told through 3D cinematics and roughly animated flashbacks.Graphics  7/10Hell is black, red, and very dark.  There isn't much variety in hell.  It sort of looks like the inside of an old BBQ pit with some cool sculptures of sad people.Gameplay  7/10There's combat against enemies, boss fights, puzzles, platforming elements, and exploration.  The combat is identical to God of War.  You fight enemies with a variety of combos and trigger brutal kills that you activate with button presses and movements of the analog sticks.  Dante gets is upgrades by collecting orbs and new moves can be purchased through the Start Menu.  The Boss Fights are all interesting and imaginative... There's a 300 foot tall undead Cleopatra who shoots bladed unbaptized babies out of her nipples and a ginormous faceless Cerberus that hacks up hairballs of stiff corpses.  Some Boss Battles are more fun than others, but overall, they're good.  The puzzles are identical to God of War.  They all rely on hitting switches and pushing a box onto a pressure plate or using it as a platform.  Although the puzzles are fairly simple, a lot of them are not intuitive and can be frustrating.  There are annoying platform elements where you must jump onto ledges, or the floor just falls away and you die.  It gets really annoying because it's never telegraphed and you feel like the game is taking cheap shots at you.  Fortunately, most of the checkpoints are generous.  There are exploration elements, too.  You search around for hidden souls.  But this clashes with the platforming elements.  At times, you don't know if you're supposed to run for the door because the floor may collapse, or stick around and try to find bonus souls.Level Designs 7/10Some levels are better than others, but after a while, they all sort of look the same.  None of the platforming elements are actually fun, so they end up hurting the levels.Sound  7/10From the wails of the damned to the fiery explosions to the John Williams-esque soundtrack, it's all pretty good.Replay Value 6/10The game is about 9 hours long and there are 4 Difficulty Levels and a Bonus Area where you fight waves of minions with a time limit.Overall 7.5/10The gameplay is not original, but if you don't have a PS3 and you want some God of War action, then this is your best bet.MaturityThis is for adults or very horny teenagers who like violence and gore.Buy it if you're a huge fan of hack and slash games and interesting stories.Rent it if you want to kill around 8-10 hours battling Lucifer's minions.Avoid it if you think the platforming elements will ruin your fun, you don't like mature games, or you didn't like God of War.If you like this game, check out Ninja Gaiden 2, Devil May Cry 4, or Bayonetta.God of War Checklist:Classic Mythology mixed with Violent Action +Tormented Main Character who wears a reminder of his sins on his flesh +Two types of Cutscenes, one 3D, one animated  +Bladed weapon with extended range +Arcing attacks, Heavy Attacks, Grappling, Launching Enemies into the air +Brutal Finishing Moves Activated by timed button presses and sticks +Right analog stick to evade +Authored Camera +Encounters are a mix of lieutenants and grunts +Cinematic Boss Fights +Puzzles that involve pushing a Box and Switches +Crawling on Horizontal Cables +Wall Climbing +Health Orbs, Power Up Orbs, Magic Orbs +Buying New Moves from an Upgrade Screen +Mashing a button to open Doors and Chests +Wall Climbing +Magic Powers +Boobies ++","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2010"}

I have played and finished every Ratchet game released to date and Crack in Time (CiT) is my favorite.  CiT has a fantastic story, easily the best story to date in the Ratchet series.  The only real problem with the story is how heavy it is based on previous titles.  It would be best to have played the older titles to really understand some of the finer details.  Many of the characters that appear in CiT are from previous titles.  Having said that, for those who haven't played previous Ratchet games, one can still pick the game up and follow the story, a bit of the humor may not make sense though.  CiT is incredibly well acted, Nefarious is perfection.  The game features great cut scenes and is easily the funniest game I have played.  Graphically the game has a unique style and looks brilliant.  The game is intense and never slows down.  The sound and controls keep the same pace and work perfectly.  The game is a bit shorter (10 hours or so) but offers replay value with difficulty levels and good trophy support (just recently got platinum).  Included in the replay value is getting all 40 Zoni and all 40 Gold Bolts.  I found this game to be perfect, I have no complaints.

{"product_name":"B003ZHMMEM","description":"","reviewerName":"Enjolras","summary":"Fun and frustrating","reviewText":"I've never played a game that's both so frustrating and so fun at the same time. Here are some thoughts a bit more than halfway through the game:The GOODThe graphics are gorgeous. WhileDonkey Kong Country Returns' graphics don't have quite the same \"wow factor\" as the originalDonkey Kong Countrydid for SNES, Retro Studios did an amazing job. Some of the cutscenes almost look like Pixar films. The music really evokes the classic soundtrack, with some tracks lifted directly from the original.The best part of the game is the ingenious level designs. For 3-D platforming,Super Mario Galaxyis still king, butDonkey Kong Country Returnsraises the bar for 2-D platforming. Levels aren't simply linear 2-D routes, but have several foreground and background layers that interact with you characters. The most famous example is the giant Octopus on the beach, which launches its tentacles as it tries to attack you. Other stages feature moles in mine karts that drive parallel to your kart and throw bombs. Meanwhile, the bosses are far more complex than the old SNES goons and can change their strategies according to your actions.The BADFirst of all, there are no Kremlings. For a Donkey Kong game, this is a travesty. I can understand that Retro didn't want to simply copy Rare and rehash King K. Rool, but the Tikis - which look like giant drums - are just underwhelming as villains. Most of the villains you do encounter are simply animals, such as parrots and bats and frogs.Speaking of animals, I also can't understand why Rambi and Squawks are the only animal buddies to make a return. What about Expresso, Enguarde, and Rattly? At least Retro could have created a few new animals. This was disappointing.More seriously, the game is really hard. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about a challenge. But, even though you get up to four hears, there a lot of one-hit kills in the game. For example, in the SNES version, you had at least two hits on mine kart levels, whereas inDonkey Kong Country Returnsa single crash kills instantly. Furthermore, the DK barrels are few and far between - sometimes there are not even any near the halfway point. This simply makes the game more frustrating than necessary. Fortunately, the Super Guide feature really helps and allows players to progress in the game even if they can't overcome some of the more difficult stages.The MIXEDThe control scheme isn't always intuitive. I definitely think the roll and jump roll should have been easier to execute. This becomes worrisome when you have to make careful jumps. It works well enough, but takes some getting used to.In balancing platforming versus exploration,Donkey Kong Country Returnsdefinitely emphasizes the former, even more than the SNES games. InDonkey Kong Country Returns, the bonus stages and hidden items are fairly easy to discover - the tough part is getting them. There aren't many barrels throughout the game, so no more running around with barrels throwing them at every wall to find secret chambers.Overall,Donkey Kong Country Returnsis a true heir to the SNES classics. However, definitely don't get this game if you're impatient or have high blood pressure. I promise you, you will release a stream of expletives at some point in your quest. In fact, I'd highly recommend simply ignoring all of the puzzles and secrets during your first run-through, and instead just enjoy the graphics and sheer originality of the levels.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2010"}

{"product_name":"B007C72F2U","description":"","reviewerName":"genocidal_maniac","summary":"Too little, too late","reviewText":"First of all, yes Gods and Kings does significantly improve the baseline civilization game. I really would not recommend spending any time on Civ V unless you also had the expansion pack.Secondly, it doesn't really fix the main problems with the game.The changes in the game amount to more ticking counters, not unlike your culture tree meter. Think of it like a cooldown in an RPG. That's essentially what this is. Multiple cooldowns before you get goodies.The cooldowns take a while, but are interesting. With some careful planning you can find a good synergy between your religion and your play style. Like, some religions are meant as a way for small empires to colonize other civilizations with their missionary units. The religion might give bonuses for every follower outside of your civilization. Or, the civilization might give you bonuses for cities within your civ. Or you might buy units with them. LIke culture bonuses, the more you buy improvements with religion, the more the next upgrade costs.Other changes make unusable civs actually usable. Ships can now capture cities. This is a pretty significant difference from the first, and it makes civs like England with +2 movement for naval vessels much more powerful. Furthermore...it stops the annoying cycle of barbarian tiramies shooting an ai unit over and over in a loop.The espionage system is kind of like the religion system. it's basically another cooldown for when you can steal technologies from other civs. Every civ gets a spy unit with the Renaissance age, and each subsequent age gets another spy.But there isn't much you can do with spies. In Civ 2, spies could sabotage production and bring down walls before invading armies.Here, they can only really steal technology.Sometimes the cooldown on that is like 53 turns.Furthermore, there isn't really any way to boost spy production. Every civ is pretty much equal in spies. The only thing you can do is construct buildings which make enemy spies take longer to steal tech.That's it. I usually end up stationing my first spy in my capital city and wait while he kills enemy spies to level up. Then I send him abroad to steal tech.So here you basically have another set of cool downs to mess with. Still, fundamental problems of the game are not fixed. AI doesn't seem any better. You still have endgame bloat.There also isn't a real sense of urgency ever in the game. In Civ 2 and Civ 3 there often was urgency, like for instance if an enemy civ constructed a launcher to Alpha Centauri and launched it. Then you have like 20 turns or so to take their capital or else you lose the game.That never happens here.Another example is Civ 3's Apoloptic (I spelled it wrong) palace. it basically allowed a diplomatic victory in medieval times. That made for urgent scrambles to where it was and capturing it.That doesn't happen here. Like in Civ 5, this expansion pretty much has you winning effectively like 66% of the way through a normal play through and then you choose how you want to win. There's no real scramble down a specific path because all of the victory paths (with the exception of conquest) lie deep towards the end of the tech tree. The UN is like the last wonder that can be constructed, so there isn't really much time spent going back and forth. It just comes at the end and you usually win within a few turns. The space race option is also near the end, just like the UN.Really this game should be considered basically a gardening simulation. you essentially cultivate a civilization and wait over several hours for it to blossom. There's no real simulation of factions within your civ, or of economic trade flows, or of changing climates resulting in famine, nothing at all. You don't see seasons change or the night. It's always summer.The thing is, there are better games out there and I've played them. A good one is King Arthur the Roleplaying game, which I found to be just as involved economically as civ while giving you a good sense of balancing different factions, and with stunning artwork to boot, and a great storyline. I've played Civ games since Civ 2, but no more. Paradox games are smarter and better balanced.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2013"}

You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or braving it solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support.Multiple Controller SupportMonster Hunter Trifeatures a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes. And finally the Wii Remote allows the ability to save your character&rsquo;s information directly to it, just as is possible with Miis, so you&rsquo;re always ready to play at a friend&rsquo;s house.Key Game FeaturesHunt Together- In the hunt, you&rsquo;re never alone. Hunt together with up to 4 players online or take on arena quests with 2-player split-screen action. In single player mode, you even have the ability to hunt with AI-controlled characters named ChaCha.Communicate Online- Because communication is key in coordinated huntsMonster Hunter Trisupports Wii Speak and text chat.Monsters with Unique Abilities and Attacks- Monsters have unique and dynamic personalities, abilities and defenses, increasing in complexity as the player progresses. They camouflage themselves to ambush hunters, but will flee or call for help if outmatched.Immense Living, Breathing World with Ecosystem- Monsters interact amongst each other in a living breathing ecosystem, complete with food chain. Monsters have stamina, migrate and even attack one another, the strong feeding on the weak.New Underwater Maps- For the first time ever in anyMonster Huntergame, you will be able explore land and sea and hunt monsters of the deep.Fully Customizable Equipment- With ten weapon categories &ndash; including the all-new Switch Axe &ndash; and new armor and weaponry created from the remains of slain monsters, there are almost limitless opportunities for equipment customization.Choice of Controls- Play with either the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, with the Classic Controller or Classic Controller Pro.Take Your Character with You- The ability to save your character to your Wii Remote lets you engage in multiplayer hunts anytime on a friend's console.","reviewerName":"Nate","summary":"Lots of fun, but needs work","reviewText":"Great game over all! To be honest I was not expecting an rpg for the Wii to be this fun. Lesson learned. Gameplay borrows from Dark Cloud a bit, but that's what I liked best. Item creation system rocks, graphics are nice, and some pretty solid gameplay to boot. Now I haven't played the new remake on Wii U yet, so it may be wise to get that version instead of this one. Reason being the Wii version has quiet a few issues that I personally thought holds monster hunter tri back from the golden 5. For starters the nightmare swimming controls, no lock on targeting system, flexing your muscles for two seconds after using an item in the heat of battle, farming monsters is too time consuming which becomes a chore, character is too vulnerable to attacks despite armor and weapons. That last one is especially frustrating when you spend so much time upgrading your gear only to find out you can still be throw around the screen like a rag doll by any boss in the game. Remember how in Skyrim you can kill a giant with ten toes, but could usually only harvest one or two from the corpse? That's monster hunters farming system in a nut shell. Spend fourty minutes trying to down a dragon only to walk away with a tooth, some pieces of hide, and a few bones. Great! Now fight another dragon for fourty minutes because you still don't have enough materials to make that awesome battle armor you want so bad. Five dragons later you still don't have the materials you need because for some weird reason the game wont let you harvest talons off the stinking thing. Only by chance are you allowed acquire these types of items. man is it frustrating! That is what was meant by the word chore mentioned earlier. These issues and a few more held me back from giving monster hunter tri a perfect score, but hey I still consider it a great rpg with lots of replay value. 3.85 stars in my book. No doubt the Wii U version has fixed many of these issues plus you can play online on the Wii U, so snag that copy instead because this is a really fun rpg. Dark Cloud fans must try! Peace.Also on a side note, if you get anxiety easily I highly recommend skipping this title if you plan on playing it solo (not online). Reason being is every boss mission is timed with fifty minutes. This seems like enough time to down a boss, but not in monster hunter. Can't count how many times while playing I've been out of potions, food, sharpening tools, stamina, health, and with five minutes left on the clock. Meanwhile the boss is limping away from you to buy some time to rest and recover. Let me just say after missions like this my palms are sweaty and I need to breath a little. Only other game I can compare this feeling to is Dark Souls. So just be careful when purchasing because it can get a little tense at times. If playing online then I bet these kind of missions aren't that bad. Ok I'm done writting now.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2013"}

The music score was soothing and enjoyable to go with the game.  Puzzles are cool!  Graphics were well advanced for 1986!  Like Metriod, it does'nt fool around for one minute.  You can't mess fool around and explore like you can in Mario or Zelda.  You gotta know what you're doing or else \"you're finished.\" I am still trying to get past the second level so I really suck.  The passwords are just as hard as playing the game itself (this was when passwords were a new thing in video games) so make sure you jot them down correctly or get yourself an emulator.  Even game genie won't get you that far (I know its cheating, but I don't care as long as I get the satisfaction of completing the game while I get a lasting enjoyment of shooting enemies with my advanced arrows).This game was so good that they had to mess up Kid Icarus' reputation by creating a \"lame\" version of him on the Captain N series in the early 1990's along with \"lame\" versions of Simon Belmount and Mega Man.  I gotta go and finish the second level so I strongly recomend this game for the NES or spend some Wi points on it if you don't have the NES!  Its hard, but its worth your money.

How can I? I look at this game and think, \"I've never done LSD, but I feel like I know what it's like\".If you've played the first game in the series, \"Katamari Damacy\", then you have a fair idea of what to expect with this one. Yes, it's \"second verse, same as the first!\"The plot line is slightly different. In the first game, the King of the Cosmos, your dad, got naughtily drunk and smashed all the stars in the universe. Your job was to roll up enough katamaris to rebuild them.In this game, you did such a good job rebuilding the universe that the people of the world want you to roll up more. Apparently instead of being terrified at this midget from the skies coming down and rolling up entire landmasses, they are accepting of your odd behavior, and even enjoy your father's strange quips.And so it's time to make more stars. You roll, and roll, and roll. You roll mice, you roll rocks, you roll cats, you roll snow drifs, you roll gods, you can even roll up the King of the Cosmos! Not too shabby!There's also a dandy two-player mode, but since I'm insular and don't play well with others, I haven't tried it yet. I could try to play with myself, but, frankly, I'm working in DRUG references here, not any other sort.The cutscenes are somewhat different in this game. You don't get a young girl saying, \"Oh! I feel it! I feel the cosmos!\", in a way Timothy Leary might approve. No, what you get instead is the unfolding saga of the King of the Cosmos when he was a wee lad. It's pretty cute.Sound-wise, the sound effects are pretty basic. The music is its own genre, however. It takes the music from the first game and really runs with it.Ultimately, I highly recomend this game. It's got some flaws, but it's a good game and fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2007"}

Where have you gone? You were shining extremely bright in the 90s. Then, in the 2000s, (almost) everything fell flat in the middle of that decade. We see a human girl smooching off Sonic to give him Chaos Emerald power, a giant fat cat that everybody hates, and entire games in which a hedgehog wields a gun or a sword. Sonic was practically dying all this time. Luckily for the famous blue hedgehog, the 2010s are bringing him back to the spotlight with Sonic Colors!Sonic Colors is a step in the right direction. It is complete with 2.5D-3D gameplay, (mostly) funny cutscenes, and gimmicks that actually work correctly. Those gimmicks are the aliens known as \"Wisps\". The Wisps serve as power-ups, something that was never featured in pretty much any of the Sonic games (Unless you count shields and Chaos Emeralds)The graphics are mind-blowing. It's Sega's creativity at its finest! Everything looks pretty darn flashy and colorfully (no pun intended) detailed. Simply put: It's eye candy. The environments are crazy, too, for the most part. Sometimes, I'd just think \"How could they have pulled it off so neatly?\"The gameplay varies from 2.5D to 3D segments. You would probably think that it would fall flat as it did in other Sonic games. Fortunately, however, it manages to be a fun result. This is what we were all begging for from Sega: A good modern Sonic game that has very appealing gameplay. Plus, it doesn't all rely on speed. There are lots and lots of platforming to do....and I had a blast playing through. Sorry, 360 and PS3 fans...you kinda missed out.Lastly: The cutscenes. Is the dialogue bad like in some of the other Sonic games? No! In fact, there were some pretty good jokes in the cutscenes (Although few are moan-inducing). Some happen to be pretty random, such as how Yacker (the first Wisp Sonic befriends) identifies Dr. Eggman as Baldy McNoseHair. As random as it was, I cracked up.Overall, if you think Sonic is seriously going downhill, you should pick this up. It will change your mind about the series's downfall, and you're gonna love it. While we Wii owners won't be able to get Sonic Generations (Though it'll come on Nintendo 3DS), at least we still have a Sonic game that lets us forget about the blue hedgehog's troubling past.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2011"}

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away.

{"product_name":"B00003E4EB","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo-Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$110 recommended retail price for a console with two controllers, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"An amazon visitor","summary":"A great entertaining system!","reviewText":"I remember the first day I got an Nintendo 64.  I was all excited, with the console all wrapped up with controllers and everything.  The first game I played and had beaten on this wonderful and entertaining system was Super Mario, and although it was an incredibly easy game, it was fun and I was satisfied with it right until the end.  I had nothing on N64 except that game, so I must of beat it a million times.Then I got podracing.Then I got gauntlet legends.Then I got mario Golf, Mario Racing, Podracing, and Zelda.  All of those games that I have just listed above are indeed worth the money, especially gauntlet legends and Zelda.I have enjoyed this system for years.  I know that with all the other \"New\" and so called \"Advanced\" systems, such as Xbox, PS2, and plus Gamecube, you might be thinking that \"Why buy an outdated system?\"  Well, it really isn't outdated.  I think that Nintendo is still making new games for it, and plus it's an awesome system if you have a hundred bucks cash with you.Anyways, get it.  You won't be dissapointed.  If you're thinking about buying a playstation one, think again.  Nintendo 64 has 64 bit graphics on it.  Playstation one only has 32 bits.

I wasn't dissapointed. The game opens with what is one of the neatest animation style openings ever on the DS, with several other animation clips to play at specific intervals during the game. The backgrounds were very nicely done & the characters were simplistic, but well drawn. The games run from being very complicated to incredibly simple. Some of the puzzles will have you smacking your forehead at their simplicity. The storyline is basic, yet surprisingly complex for what is ultimately a glossed up puzzle game. It wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if the Professor Layton trilogy later developed into an animated movie further on down the line.However, once you've played the game once, there isn't much replay value unless you are trying to find & play all 120 puzzles (not including the bonus puzzles). The other two issues I had were that 1) the soundtrack tended to grate on my nerves after a while, & 2) sometimes you couldn't immediately locate some tokens.

Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"Excellent, despite a premature release by Sega","reviewText":"Mike Thorton is the newest recruit to Alpha Protocol, a clandestine American security organisation operating with maximum deniability. When an operation goes wrong and Thorton is targeted for assassination by shadowy forces operating within Alpha Protocol, he is forced to go undercover, expose a devastating international conspiracy and clear his name.Alpha Protocol is a combat-focused, third-person RPG from Obsidian Entertainment, the developers of Fallout: New Vegas, Neverwinter Nights 2 and the recent South Park: The Stick of Truth. The game is more than slightly reminiscent of BioWare's Mass Effect franchise, with its reliance on cover-based combat and dialogue choices having a huge impact on how the game proceeds. Unlike the team-based mechanics of the Mass Effect trilogy, however, Alpha Protocol's hero Mike Thorton is a lone operator who has a wide array of stealth options to enhance his combat repertoire.The game is structured around a series of missions in certain cities, including Rome, Moscow and Taipei. In each city Thorton has a home base where he can catch up on email, watch news reports (periodically updated to comment on the chaos caused by his latest operation) and buy new weapons and equipment. From each base he can rally out to do missions, which are sometimes nothing more than short cut scenes as Thorton tries to wheedle information out of someone else but are sometimes long and elaborate infiltration and combat operations. For each mission Thorton can attempt to achieve his objective through sneaking into locations without being seen, going in all guns blazing or attempt diplomacy (or some combination of the three). He also has the ability to hack security systems, remotely unlock doors or set traps. A levelling-and-skill system also gives Thorton a wide array of abilities he can upgrade to improve his chances of success.The game is also heavily focused on characterisation. Thorton has a reputation with every character in the game, even enemies, and he can improve that reputation by saying the right things to them in dialogue. You can generally engage in conversations aggressively (inspired by Jack Bauer), suavely (inspired by James Bond) or professionally (inspired by Jason Bourne), with occasional extra options available if you have researched the right info about the character. Intelligence dossiers (bought through the black market or found on missions) hold clues as to how people will respond in certain situations, allowing you to manipulate them into helping you out. It's a clever system, enhanced by some satisfying dialogue (written by the mighty Chris Avellone) and some terrific, unexpected outcomes which radically change the way the story develops.The game's reactivity is probably its best feature, with characters living or dying (sometimes taking entire storylines and occasional missions with them) based on your actions, or how you go about doing things. Alpha Protocol rewards replaying more than most games for this reason, with real consequences to your decisions.Unfortunately, whilst the plot is excellent and the characterisation is strong, the actual gameplay is occasionally wonky. Infamously, the game was released by Sega in a highly unpolished state, as they had refused to give the game a full QA or testing pass after taking the initial build off Obsidian's hands. Minor bugs - clipping, jumpy camera controls, the physics engine occasionally going berserk - occasionally blight the game but are easily ignorable. More severe are problems with the game not reacting properly to your actions. For example, my usual approach to a mission was to attempt stealth but by around 50% of the way through each mission I'd given up on that and was resorting to gunplay. Yet my version of Thorton soon gained a reputation as a ghost, with other characters reacting to my ability to slip in and out of places undetected with awe. Considering I'd left a trail of blood, fire, chaos and bodies across most of Eurasia behind me, this didn't really make sense. There's also the fact that - especially on PC - the hacking minigame suffers from such poor and unresponsive controls that it's almost unusable.Combat is reasonable, although pouring points into stealth soon makes you almost invulnerable, able to attack targets at will and hide almost in broad daylight. The stealth part of the game is fun but also made too easy by unconscious enemy bodies vanishing after a few seconds, meaning you don't have to worry about them being discovered. Instant takedowns (lethal or not) are also possible if you take the target by surprise. Played the right way, combat can be trivially easy. There's also periodic bossfights which, depending on the game's whim are either brutally hard or ridiculously straightforward: many areas have blindspots where the bosses can't see you, allowing you to shoot them with impunity.Alpha Protocol does have a reputation for being heavily bugged, although I did not find this to be the case. Minor bugs abound, but on only two occasions was I forced to reload. Out of a 15-hour game, that's not too bad at all. It's a game clearly in need of a few more months of polishing, but it's still perfectly playable to completion.Alpha Protocol (****) is a fun, clever, well-written and smart game hampered by minor-but-constant gameplay flaws and a few broken systems. The game is highly replayable and has some great ideas, but in many ways it feels like an early prototype of a style of game that would be achieved with considerably greater skill by Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Alpha Protocol is flawed and underrated gem that is definitely worth a second look.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2014"}

Spider-Man was even funnier than ever and the villains were okay also( but my vote for best villains still goes to the original game \"Spider-Man\" for the PS1). There are a few villains returning from the other 2 games along with some new ones(although this game is technically a prequel to the PS1 games). Meaning, this is the first time Spider-Man meets the villains presented in this game. The old favorites Shocker and Scorpion have returned and the new ones are the Vulture and(ofcourse) the Green Goblin. The voice acting in this game was great and the levels were incredibly realistic and lifelike. One of the coolest (and hardest) levels in the game is when Spider-Man goes to Oscorp and fights their ultimate weapon: the Super Mech! This robot was beyond huge! It was at least twice the size of a Gundam mobile suit!

I found myself bored with it. I traded in the Guitar Hero's because I felt that Rockband was getting the gameplay right and in my opinion the songs were much more catchy. That may be because I listen to more hip-hop than anything and when i do hear rock music it's usually on MTV. So of course they have alot of that music in there games. BUT ON WITH THE BEATLES ROCKBAND!This game is very authentic for the band. I only know because one of my best friends loves the Beatles and I have learned some things about them since then. I like the fact that the game tweaked alot of different things on the visual side to make this game look kind of like the 70's era. Examples- when you hit a note small stars spark up from the track, The notes at the bottom have a more squared vintage look, and the characters and atmosphere are very authentic to what you could see at a Beatles show. The game really has the 70's trippy look, lol. If you know what I mean. Especially when you get into some of their songs where they depict what the song is about in the background. Such as being under water for Yellow Submarine. It's a very cool feature that made this game very different.As far as features go, everything as the other Rockband's are the same. There is a new feature where you and 3 friends can use the mic and instruments also. That is very cool feature but it's one of the only ones that I have noticed.The Story mode takes you through the biggest performances of The Beatles. With each venue there are screaming fans and huge crowds to set the mood. the more you collect 5 stars you recieve photo's of the band and everytime you finish the 4-5 song set you recieve a challenge. Which is pretty much a high score challenge to do each song in a row.That's pretty much it for the review. I feel that Harmonix really captured the band in a great way compared to the 2 prior Guitar Hero titles Aerosmith and Metallica.

Needless to say, Nintendo did it right this time, and they are keeping on a great franchise that I hope exists for a long time!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00D6NPFDK","description":"Embark on an exciting new adventure with theSkylandersand theSWAP Force. For generations, theSWAP Forceprotected the volcano that replenishes Skylands&rsquo; magic. That is until an epic battle caught them in an eruption that blasted them apart, sent them to Earth and gave them the ability swap powers. Only you can&nbsp;mix and match their tops and bottoms, put them on the newPortal of Powerand help save Skylands.","reviewerName":"Jen \"Geek Girl\"","summary":"Even more co-op fun","reviewText":"We have been Skylanders fans since the first iteration of the game, and I can easily say this one is the best yet. The graphics are a clear improvement, and while they retain the colorful, family-friendly vibe, the environments have received a fair bit of realism that really adds to the experience. The music also seems far more varied this time around and builds on an already enjoyable (if not forgettable) soundtrack with a number of melodies from certain areas that are hauntingly beautiful.The most important part, however, is the gameplay. I have always played the Skylanders series with a large group of family and friends, including my 8-year-old son who happens to be my main gaming buddy. While we've loved all the Skylanders games, Swap Force adds even more co-op into an already co-op heavy game. The door puzzles which were once single player are now fully two-player, and even more fun with two. The mini games that were also once single player are now two-player as well, making the entire game seamlessly multiplayer from start to finish, with no one feeling left out and no arguing about who gets to play Sky Stones this time! I really loved this aspect of the new game and is easily my favorite among all the new features.The kids' favorite feature is clearly the ability to swap the characters and create new and unique characters. The upper part of the character determines your actual abilities, while the base gives you a single special ability, like faster movement. So you can continue leveling up your favorite &#34;top&#34; piece while switching out the bottom pieces to suit your needs. The kids absolutely loved filling in the in-game grid of all the swap possibilities. They also quickly memorized all the names and burst into fits of giggles when they manage to find a particularly silly sounding name. It's added a whole new level to gameplay and makes the figures far more interactive than they used to be.As always, the old characters are all usable here, too. Even though they can't gain any new levels with Swap Force, it's still fun to bring out the old favorites. We've been finding ourselves picking up the newer &#34;poses&#34; of the older characters just to be able to level them up again. It's definitely a money grab, but the characters are so much loved by everyone that I don't see it as any different than collecting Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or Barbies, which are easily just as much (and more) expensive than the individual Skylanders. I noticed this year they're even bringing out physical play sets for the Skylanders, which may be an even further expansion into physical play with the toys.One thing I was concerned about was that Giants would be forgotten with this game. No one really picked the Giants unless they had to because of the way they lumber around at a snail's pace, but I was happy to see they've added some parts to the game which still require the Giants, so they are sure to feel useful in the new game as well.Overall it's been a really fun experience to enjoy with the family. There are a lot of really cool new characters this time around. With Giants, we were &#34;ho hum&#34; about a few of them, but we love all the new additions to the Skylanders family, especially some of the new lightcores like Smolderdash and Star Strike. The only complaint I have about this game is the amount of storage required to house all the Skylanders! I just picked up the door hanging storage system for half off at the big giraffe toy store, and it easily holds all our Swap Force characters so far and frees up a ton of space, so I highly recommend that at the sale price!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2013"}
{"product_name":"Assassin's Creed III Liberation PlayStation Vita Wi-Fi Bundle","description":"","reviewerName":"Mark Carson","summary":"Great system, good game, just a few kinks for Sony to iron out","reviewText":"I got this bundle for Christmas and have really enjoyed my new Vita.  The current games lineup is definitely quality over quantity, but in addition to the included ACIII:Liberation, I also have Uncharted, Escape Plan, Hot Shots Golf and Unit 13.  The ACIII game is in my opinion above average (but not great), I would probably give it 3.5 stars.  Like the other AC games I have played it starts slow but gets more interesting as it moves along.  My main complaints with the game are similar to my issues with the AC series in general...parkour is not as good as in games like Uncharted or Infamous, combat not as satisfying (or fun) as in Arkham City or the like.  All in all though, I would say it's a nice early third party effort on the Vita.As for the Vita, I will agree with many of the other reviewers and say the Vita is an amazing little piece of hardware.  I have played on the PSP, DS and even Gameboy way back when.  The Vita is far and away my favorite handheld and definitely has the potential to deliver on the promise of \"console quality on the go.\"  It looks great, feels great, plays great.  There's not much more one could ask from the system itself.Still, there are good reasons why these little gems are not flying off the shelves.  Not the least among these is Sony's marketing of the Vita to date (or rather, almost complete lack thereof).  Other than this, I see four main weaknesses of the system: 1) Current price point, 2) Low install base/Vitas \"in the wild\", 3) Lack of third party support, and 4) Those ridiculously expensive (but absolutely necessary) memory cards.  The good news in my opinion is that these are much like dominos in a row waiting for the first one to fall.  Sony must recognize the Vita's best price point is somewhere closer to the Black Friday deals...a price drop is sorely needed at this point.  Lower price means more Vitas bought, more users hopefully attracts third party developers of quality games like Bioshock, Dead Space, GTA and some decent first person shooters (am hoping Killzone reverses the current trend of mediocrity in this area).  The memory card issue is not an easy fix, but with more users will surely come companies that will produce cheaper versions of the cards at least.To sum up, the Vita is awesome and has some great games.  I highly recommend it, but hope future users can pick it up at a more attractive price!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2013"}

If you haven't played the Yakuza games before, this game is reminiscent of Japanese titles with a concentration on boss battles which are all pretty fun.  The game isn't too difficult--I actually died more from the boat mission and quick time events than the actual combat.  The robots in the game are pretty imaginative and the destructibility is pretty impressive.  The controls are good overall, but as aforementioned a bit stiff and you'll be diving at times when you're actually looking to get into cover. Some of the level designs are recycled, but not a major detraction.  It's about 6-8 hrs in length depending on whether you choose to skip the cutscenes.

But the loading time...?","reviewText":"I have been following the Crash Bandicoot Trilogy since the very first game on the first PlayStation. Most of the games are pretty good and fun. \"Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex\" was one of the best of the \"Crash\" games for sure. There aren't many changes in this game from the previous(adventure) games of Crash, except better graphics, moves, and a way better storyline. This game and \"Crash Bandicoot 3: WARPED\" are the 2 best games of Crash Bandicoot, neck and neck. \"Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back\" is the 2nd best of the games and then after that is the 3rd best game, \"Crash Bandicoot\", the very first one. \"Crash Team Racing\" was okay, for a racing game, but \"Crash Bash\" was definitely the worst of them all!! The only major complaint I have about this game is the loading time. I mean damn, what was up with that?! It literally took like a minute and a half for that game to load up every time you beat, leave, or quit from a level! It made the loading time for \"Medal of Honor\" seem short in comparison!Still, the game is very cool, and what I definitely love most about it is when Crash Bandicoot gets to pilot those two mechs( the red fire-proof one with the water cannon and the yellow one with the fruit cannon).When I heard that Crash Bandicoot gets to pilot a \"giant\" mech, I was overjoyed, but that changed a little bit when I saw just how \"gigantic\" the mech really was. I was hoping I would be like the size of those big mechs from \"Gundam Wing\" or something, but either way, the mech is really cool. Also that thing with Crunch the Super-Bandicoot merging with the Elementals to become more powerful was really cool. I would of given this game 3 and a half stars if I could(mostly because of the loading time), but instead I gave it 4 stars since it's too good to be given a 3. Plus, I love Crash too much to put him down like that.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2002"}

The only few new additions are the quick time events(button prompts that appear out of nowhere they are fine additions but done poorly) and the other new addition is the spidey sense which predates the batman detective mode thats now popular. You'll still have fun web swinging and the combat is fun for awhile but it gets too archaic later on with larger groups of enemies.

{"product_name":"B000U34SYQ","reviewerName":"Christopher Lankford","summary":"One of the best tactical games ever","reviewText":"This game is easily the tactical RPG with the best replay value of all time. Let's see why.PROS:-Storyline is better than Path of Radiance, even without knowledge of the first one. (I went back and played it afterwards!)-High level of difficulty for first-time players, especially those not used to permanent character death and limited resources such as gold and experience; eases out after the first playthrough.-Soundtrack is excellent, exceeding the best of Final Fantasy.-Very deep gameplay system which must be mastered in its entirety for advanced play, such as \"hard mode\" runs or performing the side events required for certain ending scenes.-Huge amount of replay value; see \"biggest highlight\" section below.-Great 2D art, good 3D art.CONS:-It's hard. This was my first Fire Emblem, and I got a game over like five times on one of the earliest levels. But I'm masochistic, so this isn't a con in my book.-Art is awesome, but the actual execution in the 3D graphics could be better.-No voice acting, barring the pre-rendered movies with mostly terrible voiceover.BIGGEST HIGHLIGHT:Differences in unit usefulness not necessarily clear to first-time players entice the return player to challenge him/herself to build strategies around the high-potential but hard-to-level characters... the game has a built in risk/reward system in that way. Combine this with the absurdly-difficult-to-achieve hidden bonus objectives (they change the ending scenes), and you have a winning formula.All-in-all, the game gives you a hammer, some scrap metal, and hell to pay, then leaves it up to you if you want to struggle to make a gun or just fight for your life with what you have.RECOMMENDED FOR FANS:Valkyria Chronicles: Incredible tactical RPG for the PS3.

{"product_name":"B0056WJA6M","description":"","reviewerName":"Dr. D","summary":"Glitchy Beyond Belief","reviewText":"I pre-ordered my copy of Darksiders II: Limited Edition with the full season pass from THQstore.  Now, I was a huge fan of the first Darksiders, and I still am, but this sequel leaves a few things to be desired.For one, the number of glitches I encountered in this game was unparalleled to any other game I've ever played.  And I'm talking about game-breaking glitches to the point where the screen and my PS3 system would entirely freeze.  These glitches occurred while I was opening in-game menus, upon hitting destructible objects, and during the Wailing Host boss fight.  These oversights on behalf of the developers are inexcusable.About the combat and controls:  I personally feel that they could have done something a helluva lot better with the camera angles and targeting system.  Not only does it make you dizzy trying to target your enemy(ies), but you really should be able to physically BLOCK to defend yourself in addition to just hopping to the side or backwards.  If there was a block action in this game, the combat would have been so much better.  Also, getting Death to jump where you want him to go is of extremely poor execution.  When he's grabbing the handholds after having jumped to them, it's like you have to wait 2 seconds before he stops moving in order to jump in a given direction.  Not good!Lastly, the storyline was decent throughout the crux of the game, and I thought that the dungeons were beautifully designed, but the ending was just awful!  It seems like game developers these days are suffering from the \"Mass Effect Dilemma\" (MED).  Something more conclusive and less of a \"selling out\" would have been preferable.Overall, 3 stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2012"}

Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience.

As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new modified game engine,Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.","reviewerName":"desorbod","summary":"RPG fans only!","reviewText":"Just can't get into this game... if you like RPG you may like it... picked it up mutiple times and just can't get into it!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2013"}

However, I feel Civilization IV is most definitely not an improvement overall. In other words the sum of the parts does not equal the whole. I have had the game for only a few days and have basically decided that I have wasted $50. I was under the impression that this game was awesome (according to ign.com and many reviews). They rated it at a 9.4 out of 10. I don't know how they came up with that but I'll tell you what I think it should be rated at the end of the review.First off, I will state the good things about Civilization IV. The graphics are most definitely improved over the previous version. Recommended units for cities to build are given in the itenerary for each city. You are allowed a great deal of freedom in choosing how you want the Earth to appear--climates, land type, world size, how much water, etc. In general the cities are complex, you have the growth rate of the city, the culture of the city and its resources. Also, the game camera allows you to zoom in and out variably, instead of just three levels of zoom.Now for the things you really must know about the game before you buy it. Far and away this is the worst game I have played yet in terms of hardware requirements. Granted I have a laptop, but my hardware is:1.6 GHZ Gen II centrino512 Mb of DDR RAM40 GB hard drive2GB of virtual memory128 Mb ATI Mobility Grpahics card running on dedicated memory!I say requirements because I mean you need much more than the minimum to even run the game without falling asleep waiting for anything to happen. I pressed alt+tab one time and it took well over 5 minutes to get the game back up again. It runs painfully slow and the thing that bothers me so much is why I could possibly need hardware better than mine just to get the game to run smoothly. Someone else had a review on here that had a more powerful system thatn mine and the game had crashed on him multiple times. I play Guild Wars and it doesn't need near as much memory as this game does.I feel I must edit my review in light of a recent review. The following words were written by Adam Folkerts:\"First off this game is great. It sucks you in and you lose track of time playing. the graphics are good, the gameplay is smooth, the AI is very well done. this is a definate buy game if you like the civ series or simulations in general.For previous reviewers who have issues with this game, I have had none. I do have a high end machine but you have to with the newer games out now. I wouldn't think about having an enjoyable game experience with a computer that is over 2 years old.I would reccomend atleast 1GB of ram, a newer generation video card, something past the ATI radeon 9800pro or nvidia FX5950. also you'll need a decent cpu. you'll need a higher end athlon XP in the 3000+ range or higher for AMD, I would say a newer 64 bit cpu if you want to really run this game right. Since I don't use pentium chips I can't say what will run this smooth.It's true the minium on packages are sometimes misleading but if you plan on buying the newest games you have to be using hardware that was made in the last 2 years generally if you don't want issues. My system is an A64 3500+, 2GB pc3200, an nvidia 6800GT and I had no issues and no slow downs. Get the latest drivers, they are always improving code to make things faster and fix bugs.If you have a decent computer and want the game go ahead and pick it up. If you are using hardware made 2years or more ago get the game and spend some money upgrading your computer, you'll be glad you did.\"Saying that you can't have a high end experience with a two year old computer is accurate, however, Adam if you would have read a few more of the reviews you would have seen that people were running systems just as powerful as you with the game. I myself have a computer that is less than six months old. Secondly if 1GB of RAM was needed, that should have been listed under recommended requirements. Unfortunately they wouldn't have done that because then nobody would have bought it. The system requirements being misleading is an understatement. Apparently we need a $3000+ computer to run Civilization IV. Also, when I buy I game I don't expect to have to download drivers the very day I get it. I'm not a game tester, this is supposed to be a finished product. It sounds like you work for Firaxis or 2K games to me.The second greatest downfall of Civilization IV is the gameplay. It is un-inspiring. You basically feel like you are just clicking and waiting for something to happen and nothing really does. The game doesnt even get interesting until you reach the end of the 5th millenium. Battles are inconsistent. Sometimes a weaker unit can overtake a stronger one and sometimes they can't. Finally the main reason why I don't think you should purchase this game is the utter lack of creativity. All of the military units are the same. The countries are almost all the same. Battles still occur on a tile-to-tile basis meaning it could literally take you decades to get troops from one side of the country to the other. By the time the 20th century came around I was completely bored with the game. It was years since the inception of Civilization III and this game seems like more of an update than a new game. Aside from the graphics and camera controls, this IS Civlization III. The game is a serious dissapointment to me and I imagine most anyone who has played previous versions of Civlization.I'm not trying to be a poster child for other games, but I feel I should let people know what I would recommend in this game's place. Rise of Nations is an excellent game which has about the same graphics, but doesn't need 512 mb of memory. You could probably run it on 64 mb. Because of that, you don't have the huge waiting time for everything and it's not turn-based so things happen at a reasonable time in the cities. Moreover, everything is in scale for the most part, no one hundred foot tall people in Rise of Nations. It is also very similar to Civilization IV, but you could probably find it for about $10. Therefore, would I suggest buying Civilization IV. No. I probably wouldn't even buy it a year down the road when it's cheaper. Be smarter than I am and check multiple places for ratings and reviews of games. I lost $50 because of it.

{"product_name":"B00005QDPZ","description":"Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron IIfeatures some of the  best graphics ever seen on a home console, and it is a proper, old-fashioned,Star Warsgame. If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will.

{"product_name":"B000SSPH3E","description":"","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Remake of a PS1 Classic","reviewText":"This review was written by my son, James SheaA remake of the hit game for the PS1, Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions updates many of the little pieces of the original game in addition to carrying the game over to the Playstation Portable platform. It has been 10 years since the original's release; now the update brings it to a new generation.As a refresher for those unfamiliar with the original game, Final Fantasy Tactics is a turn-based tactical game using many of the abilities and classes made familiar in the Final Fantasy series of games. The story takes place in the kingdom of Ivalice, where civil war has erupted following a great war against foreign enemies and the death of the old king. The main character, Ramza, must navigate these mazes of treachery and deceit to discover the true secret of the ancient prophecies that govern the kingdom.The English translation to the original was notoriously bad, with such lines as \"I got a good feeling!\" and \"Bracelet\" used instead of \"Breath\" (as in, a Dragon's breath). The main thing done by the remake was the rewriting/retranslating of almost the entire script to be much more period-appropriate. For the most part this is a good thing, matching the epic, elegant scale of the story, though certain fan-favorite lines were lost (\"Don't blame us! Blame yourself or God!\" and \"Surrender, or die in obscurity!\" being two of those). Many names were also changed; besides the re-familiarization of characters (for fans who got used to the old names), the only other problem is the abundance of \"th\" sounds to replace \"s\" sounds (\"Algus\" becomes \"Argath\", like how \"Aeris\" from Final Fantasy 7 became \"Aerith\" in later games).In certain scenes, illustrated cinematics were used to replace the game-engine cutscenes or CG cutscenes used in the old versions. These cinematics have a distinct art style and coloring scheme and are very well done. These scenes also have voice acting, which is done with English accents similar to much of Final Fantasy XII. Several new scenes are also inserted to either add backstory to the game or to establish a new character. On that note, two new characters from other Final Fantasy games are recruitable through the story (much like Cloud from FF7 was and still is): Balthier from FFXII and Luso from the upcoming FFT Advance 2.  Two new classes are also obtainable for regular (IE non-unique) characters. Onion Knight is gained by gaining levels in the two basic classes (chemist and squire) while, on the other end, Dark Knight is gained by gaining a high level of classes in many specialized classes.The War of the Lions also adds a multiplayer mode, accessible through ad-hoc wireless (the PSPs must be within range of each other; no online mode is available). Through this, two players can either fight head-to-head or work cooperatively on unique missions. Characters do not die permanently in this mode, but there are treasures that can be gained from it, including some unique equipment. While it isn't as developed as it could be, its addition is certainly welcomed.Graphically, the game is the same. While the older sprites might seem dated, the smaller screen means that they seem more artistic than pixelated.  The only troubling spot is major slowdown when spells are cast or abilities are used; this problem is recurring and noticeable, but such is only to be expected with the transition between systems.Final Fantasy Tactics is still acclaimed as one of the best games of all time. With this remake, there were a lot of worries that the original formula would be watered down. Fortunately, this is definitely not the case; the additions are almost entirely good, and make for a much more serious, solid experience. This game has done a great service in many ways to this classic game, despite occasional troubles.Rating: 9/10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2008"}

Its success was so great that Nintendo apparently saw fit to release a sequel, and that is exactly what Mario Galaxy 2 is-it is a sequel follow-up in every sense of the word, mimicking many of the aesthetics, gameplay, and basic mechanics to a tee. Not since the original Japanese Super Mario Bros. 2 has a Mario sequel so closely mimicked its predecessor. Then again, there has in fact been no direct sequel to a Mario game since Super Mario Bros. 2 (although its Japanese and American versions were vastly different).Sequels, whether they are video game, movie, book, or just about anything else, are frequently plagued by the swift possibility of an encroaching sameness early on into their run time, so obviously there has to be something new, something to add to what there was before. Mario Galaxy 2 doesn't seem to dwell on altering or diverting from the formula of its predecessor; it would in fact be very easy for players to assume they're merely playing an extension or downloadable content of the first Mario Galaxy.There isn't much of a storyline to speak of; one very un-sequel-like aspect of Mario Galaxy 2 is that it essentially plays out as if the events of the first game never happened (possible spoiler alert: minus, arguably, some of what occurs in the ending sequence); Peach is kidnapped by Bowser yet again, a Luma joins Mario and once again gives him the ability to spin attack, and there's some sort of involvement of a tubby Luma named Lubba, none of which is clearly explained. The last time a Mario game had a truly engaging storyline was 1996's Super Mario RPG, but the one provided here feels even more slopped together than usual, which adds to the troubling possibility of many gamers writing this one off as a total rehash.The premise is admittedly very similar to the first Mario Galaxy: Mario must complete missions in different galaxies to collect Power Stars and ultimately defeat Bowser and rescue Peach. The Lumas, Launch Stars, gravity-defying planetoids, and Star Bits all return, and everything works almost exactly the same, but there are some new features that do a decent job of spicing things up.Naturally the most relevant one is the addition of Yoshi, who always brings a nice dazzle to any Mario game he manages to appear in. Although sorely underappreciated and making a pitifully low number of appearances in the much-hyped Mario Bros. Wii, Yoshi actually plays a major role in Mario Galaxy 2, and players will have the pleasure of making use of his handy abilities quite frequently. As usual, he can make quick work of most enemies with his sticky tongue and flutter jump long distances, but one of the most unique additions to Mario Galaxy 2 are the Yoshi-exclusive power-ups. There are several different types of berries, all of which give Yoshi different abilities, such as floating in midair, lighting up seemingly invisible platforms, and running at high speed up walls or across bodies of water.The new power-ups are in fact some of the biggest triumphs of this sequel; the new Cloud Flower allows Mario to bring forth clouds which he can walk on and use to reach new heights; the ability to create your own platforms is obviously not only useful, but extremely fun. The Rock Mushroom, meanwhile, allows Mario to transform into a boulder and roll across or over platforms, enemies and obstacles like a bowling ball. One stage in particular requires you to trek across a series of loops and platforms as Rock Mario, which is very exciting gameplay indeed.Unlike its predecessor, MG2 has a retro stage selection setup in which you move progressively across a 2D map to reach upcoming levels (or galaxies, in this case). Although this gives things less of a modern, RPG-like feel, it makes it significantly easier to keep track of your progress and where you should head next. One other aspect of MG2 that makes it strikingly similar to the last Mario sequel is how it is essentially a more difficult version of its predecessor-right from the beginning, players may become quickly aware that things are not as simplistic or easygoing when the game starts out, and a handful of the later missions younger players could potentially really struggle with. Most of the truly challenging missions are not required to beat the game, but completists will more often than not be given a run for their money.Unfortunately, however, certain things that seem to be attempts to make the game `harder' are essentially just more tedious, higher-stress versions of the same missions, such as having to reach a hilltop whilst collecting 100 coins in under 2 minutes instead of just having to reach the hilltop. This has been a progressively common trend in recent 3D Mario games; I can't speak for all gamers, but I don't personally find having to destroy hundreds of enemies or collect hundreds of coins in miniscule periods of time in stages I've already seen over and over particularly `fun.' It's truly disappointing that instead of a larger quantity of all-new missions and worlds to explore, the content is cheaply expanded with dull rehashes.The game maintains several of the same aesthetic charms of its predecessor, but oddly things feel generally less visually impressive than before, and it becomes somewhat obvious that certain sprites and skeletal blueprints of stages or characters were hurriedly reused. The camera also feels less cooperative than MG1's, and players will in fact frequently be at the mercy of whatever single angle the game requires at particular moments. This can be particularly frustrating during inopportune moments when the camera needs to be shifted frequently and quickly during difficult missions, and can ultimately be responsible for jumps or movements that lead directly to an enemy's path or worse, a fall into space.While this may sound like a lot of griping, MG2 is in fact, for the most part, a very enjoyable game and just about anyone who desperately craved more after repeatedly beating MG1 will burn a lot of hours on this one. Where MG2 really shines is in its more innovative additions to the gameplay and strategy; there are now certain galaxies (or portions of certain galaxies) in which the dimensions shift to 2D, diverting to a side-scrolling platformer instead of a 3D adventure. The only other time gamers were treated to both a 2D and 3D experience in a single Mario game was Super Paper Mario, but it's put to even better use here, allowing MG2 players the best of both worlds in the Mario universe.Like the first Galaxy, there's also a 2-Player option, but this time around it's a far more engaging experience. In MG2, the second player isn't just in charge of the pointer but can in fact control a Luma that follows Mario around. Player 2 can retrieve faraway coins, Star Bits and some other items, stop enemies dead in their tracks, and even initiate his or her own spin attack to defeat them. This is likely the most interactive 2-Player experience offered in any 3D Mario game.Essentially, the key thing that makes this sequel worthwhile is what it adds to the Mario Galaxy experience; it takes everything that made the first one great and builds upon it, takes it to the next level. The game starts out moderately slow, but as things progress the gameplay gets much more exciting, and the missions more complex and intense. The ending of MG2 is also in many ways more fulfilling and engaging than its predecessor, and although MG2's story is initially presented vaguely and somewhat sloppily, things are wrapped up nicely by the game's end. The `game after the game' content is also a big plus; there is in fact an entirely new world filled with new galaxies (several of which are quite fun) to explore after the final battle with Bowser. As a standalone game, MG2 is lacking and feels retread-y, but as an expansion of MG1 it serves its purpose very well and will please just about any big Mario fan. Had the brightest assets of MG2 been included in the first (or available as DLC), the collective result would have been nothing short of masterful.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2010"}

I had never played any of them, but after recently purchasing a PS3 and looking at the incredible praise people have given this game, I bought it for an incredibly cheap price around Christmas time. My opinion after playing the game for a week or so?Many people think the only thing that matters to a racing game is the actual driving; if you are one of those people, go buy this game NOW. The handling feels spot on, and it is a challenging experience, to say the least. However, everything else in GT5 feels dated. For starters, the menus. I found myself actually turning off this game simply because the menus frustrated me (yes, they are THAT bad). You have to go through dozens of menus that are in an incredibly poor layout (Ex: it tells me I need a 1960's Japanese car. When I go to the dealer, I can't even find any.) This is a real shame because Forza 4's menus feel so perfect. What went wrong?Another poorly executed element of GT is the damage physics. When I run into a wall at high speeds, I expect at least a dent on my car, accompanied by a bone-crunchingly awful snap. However, all you get is a &#34;thump&#34; (similar to throwing a cardboard box off your roof), and a little bit of paint scratched off. I KNOW they could've done better here. Maybe I'm being picky, but I expect more for the &#34;real driving simulator&#34;.The visuals inside your car are INCREDIBLY detailed... on the more &#34;high end&#34; cars. Inside almost every other car of GT's incredibly large roster (to the point that it is almost intimidating) is just a dull, dark shadow with a wheel and a speedometer. Sure, this isn't a problem for people that play the game with the camera outside of the car, but this lack of detail leaves me scratching my head wondering why people say this is the best racer out there.Bottom line, fans of the series have probably already bought this (as it is quite old at this point), but new comers to the franchise like me will be wondering what the hype is all about, especially with other games that DO have that attention to detail.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2014"}

First of all, the combat is very boring. There are not many camera options so you're stuck in this psuedo behind-the-back view. You can barely zoom out, nor can you go into a more immersive first-person view. The quests are boring - usually fetch quests or kill-a-thons. Like in most RPGs, there are a million useless items in the world (e.g. food, wine, crafting materials).ProtagonistGeralt is a pasty-white man. I do not have problems with pasty-white people in real life. Oh hell no. But I do not want to play as one in a video game, when it is a role-playing game. You are playing the role of your character - in this case, a white man. I would rather have the option of creating my own character. I can not relate to Geralt at all, nor do I aspire to be like him, which I am pretty sure the Polish developers CD Projekt RED STUDIO did when they designed him. Make no mistake. It is their game and they can make their protagonists however they want. However, continuing to make him a white guy and abstaining from allowing options will not earn them future sales from me and people who feel the way I do. Now, do not get me wrong. I have played white protagonists in video games before, and I had no problems with it. However, there is something about Geralt that I really dislike and find highly unrelatable. Is it the pasty-white skin or perhaps it is the long-flowing white hair? Perhaps it is the way he treats women.Geralt is also a misogynist man who has sex with any willing woman. This objectification of women is disgusting and wrong. Sex in video games is certainly not a new thing. This doesn't mean that all previous games with objectifying sex, like GTA or God of War was right in what they did, or excusable. No. Those games were wrong, too.ConclusionThe Witcher is a racist, sexist game, which, if even those elements were fixed, would still be a boring, typically inane RPG.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2011"}

I was able to finish the tutorial even though it was running slow.  I then tried to play a real game.  The list of existing games kept failing. I tried starting a new region and after many attempts, it finally let me play.  While playing, the game kept saying it lost connection to the servers.

Needless to say my game and progress were now gone.I hate EA and have for years and refused to buy any game they had their hands on.  My love for SimCity is stronger though, so I set aside my hatred to EA just this once. An obvious mistake that will never be repeated again.  It is not that they had problems as many do during launch. It is not even the DRM that I am never fond of. It is always how a company reacts when there is a problem.

{"product_name":"B00005V6BB","description":"Medal of Honor: Frontlinemarks the debut of the Medal of Honor franchise on the PlayStation2. InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"EMAN NEP","summary":"THE BREAD IS DELICIOUS","reviewText":"The reason why this game doesn't get 5 stars is because of the following:1) CLIPPING PROBLEMS: Yes, I know, every FPS has them, but in this game its really bad in areas. Specifically, while I was playing the Arnhem Nights level I was walking atop a piece of rubble and somehow fell INSIDE of it. If I walked around I could see the outside of the level. Anyone who has worked with Worldcraft knows that that is not a good thing. But what was even worse, was that when I managed to jump back in the level I couldn't get to where I was supposed to be. There were several windows with the glass broken out. But the game wouldn't let me jump through them. Americans aren't THAT tall, are they? And you would think that you could blast an unhinged door out of the way--but no, it's a non-interactive object. The only way I got back to where I needed to be was by USING THE CLIPPING PROBLEM TO MY ADVANTAGE. I had to walk outside the level just to get to my proper place. Now that was pathetic. And frustrating.In another level (towards the end of the game) I got STUCK in a wrap of barbed wire and even in a tree once. You can not get out, even detonating your own grenades nearby won't unstick you.MINOR clipping problems I can tolerate, but this . . . .2) DAMAGE: One time, I took my BAR and pumped 5 rounds (BOOM!BOOM!BOOM!BOOM!BOOM!)into a German's chest at point blank range. Shortly after, this crazy Nazi gets up as if nothing more than a bee bit him and assumes his firing stance. My goodness, even the sound emmited from a BAR at that range should be able to hurt you. I often pop Nazis in the HEAD with a pistol and they STILL LIVE??? Waitaminute here, I thought I was playing Medal of Honor, not Return to Castle Wolfenstein.3) AMONG OTHER THINGS: Levels--and the game itself--are as linear as a railroad track. They should have made it more like Starfox (SNES) where you can pick different branches to get to a common destination. Also, I noticed some CONTINUITY PROBLEMS. You end one level with, say, your pistol, a sniper rifle, and a machine gun. But you start the next level--which is just a continuation of the last--with only your pistol. Why would any soldier just toss out two perfectly good weapons and leave himself with only a pea-shooter?AS FOR THE ISSUE OF BLOOD: I recall reading in a video game magazine that the makers of this game wanted to target a large audience. The best way to do that was to avoid the \"M\" rating. So they took the blood out. But seriously EA, you could easily have had a \"Blood? Yes No\" option. But no, they didn't. Don't worry, it's not that big a deal.Look, I know I'm making this game sound bad, so let me get to its redeeming aspects.SOUND: This is one of the few games that has really OUTSTANDING sound effects. The lovely and lethal sound of your sniper rifles, the drum-like beat of your BAR and the music itself, which does a VERY good job of setting the mood.LEVEL DESIGN: Apart from the (ahem) clipping problems, the levels are vast and varied. You'll see everything from beaches to bunkers, towns, villages, mines, hangars, docks, and mansions. My favorite level, though, was ROUGH LANDING, where you're in this beautiful village filled with towering windmills.HUMOR: I'm in this mansion, blasting Nazis with my shotgun. I'm in the kitchen to be precise. Well, as I walk up to this table I get a message up top that reads THE BREAD IS DELICIOUS. Just the thought of shooting Nazis while eating some good French bread . . . . Then there's this one part where you actually start a bar fight (the drinking bar, not the Browning Automatic Rifle) by pouring beer on this Nazi's head. The two Nazis start punching each other while you sit back and laugh. And finally, opening a bathroom door to find a Nazi sitting on the toilet. And yes, you can flush the toilet after you flush the Nazi out.HISTORY: Between levels, you'll get to see actual black and white footage of WWII, while a commentator in the background tells you what is going on so far in the war.Although this game doesn't escape this critic's war of words unscathed, it does come out in decent enough shape to warrant at least a medal and a purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2002"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J5UQ","description":"","reviewerName":"DanD","summary":"A solid gaming experience, but heavily flawed.","reviewText":"I bought L.A. NOIRE because I was such a fan of RED DEAD REDEMPTION (I've never played any of the GRAND THEFT AUTO games).  That, and I love noir; it's dark, provocative, and fast-paced.  To actually live the noir experience, as REDEMPTION made you live the western experience, is an offer I could not refuse.Here are the perks: Is NOIRE stunning?  Oh yes.  The graphics are great, the shootouts are fun (walking around blowing perps away with a shotgun, feeling just like Bud White?), the interrogations are deceptively tricky but engaging (good luck determining when a person is lying or when they're hiding something but not telling the whole truth; this gets tricky, and it's perhaps the game's fault, not yours).  The linear progression through the ranks is interesting, interspersed with flashbacks of hero Cole Phelps's war experience.  The voice acting, too, is top-notch, far superior to anything we've seen in previous games (including REDEMPTION, where, let's face it, a lot of the voice acting was sub-par).  There's also the nice \"consequence\" factor: if you ask a wrong question during interrogation, or take on a Street Crime while on your way to interview someone, you can set your investigation back.  This does require some careful planning, and some sacrifices as well.But there are flaws.  Driving is a pain in the you-know-what; your mini map doesn't have street names, and the streets don't have signs, which means you have to repeatedly pause the game and look at your larger map to determine where you're going.  Good luck learning how to reverse, too; I don't know who's bright idea it was to make the \"reverse\" button the same as the \"brake\" button, but it certainly results in several hilarious accidents.  Also, things get a bit mundane after a while.  Is Cole Phelps an interesting character?  Yes.  Is his progression through the department fun to follow?  Yes.  But it's not always fun to perform--examining evidence is repetitive.  Not a whole lot of thought process behind it, either; go around picking stuff up, determining if it's useful, discarding it if it isn't.  It gets old fast.  The Street Crimes that pop up offer nice distractions, but they only last for a couple of minutes, and you usually have to drive halfway across the city to get to them.Perhaps the biggest shocker is how short the game is.  I'm only about 4 hours into it, and I'm over 20% done with the game.  Compare that to REDEMPTION, which was pretty much the RETURN OF THE KING of video games (i.e., never ending, in case you managed to miss that movie).  Granted, I got annoyed with how long REDEMPTION lasted...but NOIRE is going by a bit too fast.  And I'm not sure there's a whole lot of replayability here.  It's fun, but it's just not THAT fun.  If you're a video game buff and want to see the latest greatest thing, then by all means, L.A. NOIRE is perfect for you.  But if you're a more casual gamer like me, then you might want to wait for a good deal.  It's worth a play through, but probably not more than once.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Modern masterpiece of the genre","reviewText":"At first I was very hesitant about this game.  It seemed, on the surface, that Capcom had changed so much that how could it possibly be a Resident Evil game?  Having just finished clocking in about 16 hours into the game I can say it is RE redefined.Some people have complained about the direction in the series, but having played all of the mainstream RE games, I welcome this new change.  The RE games had become redundant, nothing had been done to really mix up the gameplay.  This is why I think RE4 has been so successful.  It breaks you of what you have been taught in previous RE games.  In the beginning I was so afraid of using bullets, but bullets are so abundant that I realized the point was to infuse you with frantic gunfights.  I loved the faster pacing of the game instead of trying to run from everything to conserve bullets.From the very beginning its like the first time the dog jumped through the window in the first RE.  The townspeople don't just stumble toward you and let you shoot them.  They dodge, they flank, they throw grenades, the do everything in their power to kill you.  And kill you they will which brings me to another point.  Save points no longer take ink and when you die you don't automatically start back at the save points.  Nicely put checkpoints help you along so that if you die you don't have to backtrack and go through the same things over and over again.  Thanks Capcom!When you barracade yourself in the first house and hear the chainsaw reving, I challenge you to not sweat.  From the opening moments onward, the game excels at raising the tension a notch, then allowing you a chance to rest.  And those welcome moments of uneasy calm will be needed.The bosses are amazing and varied as well.  With the exception of one, I didn't find the bosses to be cheap.  Hard, yes, but not cheap.  What's interesting is that the last section of the game, the last location, is so very RE.  In fact, I felt the need to conserve bullets was back as well.  By that time, my bullet supply was running low and I moved from encounter to encounter with just enough to keep me going.  Another way in which RE tried to break up the norm.Graphically, the game is beautiful.  There's some clipping issues where flames can be see through walls or hands will reach through closed doors, etc, but over all the game is beautiful.  The sound effects are great, especially if you have a receiver that supports Pro Logic.  The voice acting is spotty, probably because of the sometimes silly things they are saying.  The story does a nice job of starting a fresh new series while at the same time bringing in the past and tying this game to the franchise.I just can't say enough about this game.  It's longer than all of the previous REs, in fact you could fit a couple of them into this game with room to spare.  The one thing that I really missed was the \"cheap scares\" from previous REs.  There really aren't too many jump out at you moments.  But the intensity of each and every encounter made up for it in spades.  If you like action video games I would doubly recommend you picking this game up.  If you are a Resident Evil fan and an action fan, what are you waiting for?  Get it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0088I7KYU","description":"","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"Good game but needs a more serious tone/story","reviewText":"This review is from a person who is not much into fighting games.  I purchased this game solely because I liked the story leading into this game and flashy devastating attacks by different characters I saw in the trailer. After finishing the story and few missions, this is how I felt.******************************Pros**************************************-Great stage settings: Simple I liked the background design of different stages. From Batcave to Fortress of Solitude, I loved how they include different characters and objects from DC comic universe. Also liked how in each stage you can run to an end of the screen, deliver a punishing blow to your opponent leading them into a different part of the stage.-Interactivity with background: This is the best thing for a guy who doesn't like fighting games. You can use various objects in the background to your advantage. If you are a super-powered character then you can slam them into your opponents, if you are a more human character then you can bounce off and get behind the opponent. Pretty interesting-The characters and their designs:  You have decent selection of characters with popular ones like Batman, Superman and Joker to some only known to DC comics fans. For most part I liked their designs and different skins the game provided.- The story  (good): I had the highest expectations for this, but it didn't quite meet it. It is still good for a video game story.-The fighting mechanics: I won't be a good judge for this, but as a noob I enjoyed it and people who like fighting games say that mechanics are pretty good.-Missions and online play: Both of this add great longevity to the game.******************************Cons**************************************- Childish PG-13 tone: This is the worst thing about the story. When you read comics leading to the story, you have Superman punching through Joker's body, crippling someone dressed up in Iron man suit, but in actual game story they leave blood and violence out for the most part. Someone actually get their brain fried in the story but animation for it is so childish, it doesn't bring any seriousness to the mood. Very disappointed.-The story ending: Another thing that just didn't do it for me.******************************Conclusion**************************************I definitely liked the fighting gameplay and story up to the certain point. Online matches and missions are also good, but I got bored after a while. If they make another game, they should definitely make story more serious instead of cartoony. I would give this 8.2/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00004U5VF","description":"The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.--Jeff Gerstmann--Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Christopher Manna","summary":"Awesome Concept and Fighting system!!","reviewText":"In my opinion, I think anyone with a liking to action games or rpg's will like this because its both combined.

Geeze was I wrong. I got maybe 8 hours out of this and that was with discovering like every possible thing you could do in the game. I will try to be as unsubjective as possible. This was supposedly a groundbreaking new RPG that was going to be amazing. First the good points. The customizability of the game is pretty cool and the types of armor, swords, and skills was definitely more than I expected. Another thing that I really liked was that you could make your guy physically larger. Now for the bad news. The graphics in general left me with a N64 feeling instead of xbox and came off as cartoonish with the large hands and feet. The only thing that was detailed was the main character. Everything else was quite pixelated. Secondly, the ease at which I beat this game was unprecedented. Quite possibly one of the easiest games I have ever played. And the story was pretty unoriginal. The thing that dissapointed me the most was this could have been an excellent knight type of RPG if it was: 1. 2-3 times longer 2. the graphics had a significantly larger amount of time put into them 3.

{"product_name":"B00BGAA0SU","description":"","reviewerName":"John S. Dean \"John\"","summary":"Excellent visuals, but not a fan of the controls","reviewText":"I've absolutely LOVED the Infamous series.  I received the first after the Sony data was compromised, as a free game from Sony.  I was instantly hooked, and it was perfect timing since the day after I finished it, Infamous 2 was released.  I had never heard of it prior to that, so it was a great \"accidental\" find.There were things in Infamous 2 that I loved and didn't like as much, mostly centered around the controls.  But this isn't an uncommon thing, just ask any Halo fan about how those games jumped back and forth and couldn't seem to settle on anything.I've played Infamous 1 and 2 so many times, both good and bad karma, and it's always been right up there with Halo for me as something that never seems to get old.  I was a bit uncertain about the new character though during the reveals and trailers leading up to the game's release.  But I was happy to find that I fell into the game without any problems, and the character change isn't an issue for me at all.  There are times when his \"altruistic selfishness\" is downright charming.Graphics are well done.  I've not had any issues with tearing or stutter or anything so far.  It's very visually appealing.And the powers are enjoyable as well, a nice change of pace from the electrical based Cole.  I do miss the ability to get little charges from so many sources that you could as Cole though, since with Delsin you're limited to burning things - i.e. cars on fire, or chimneys.  So there are fewer chances to charge up.,The shards are still present, and you collect them to upgrade your powers.  But I wish there was a little more clarity in the upgrade paths.  But I do like the menu for those upgrades, a nice flowchart tree branching powers off of the different core powers.However, some of the things with the controls I wish they had done differently.  For example, the \"hover\" bit is done by pressing the X button to jump and hold it.  But you really have to press it twice, once to jump, then a second time to turn on the hover.  I would have preferred a shoulder button for the hover since it would be a more natural and easy thing rather than always having to double tap it.  Also, having to click the touchpad to pull energy from the smoke - this is awkward, and anything that takes my thumbs off of the joysticks to me is a bad thing, since it impairs quick movements especially when you're in the middle of a fight and recharging.  I did some digging to see if there are alternative layouts for controls, but I couldn't find any.  But even though they can be annoying, just like any other video game franchise that swaps controls around between installments, you *DO* get used to these and they don't seriously impair gameplay.As expected though, even with my dislike of control choices, this game is a pure pleasure to play.  Cole seemed to be easier to control scaling up walls and such, in this one it sometime doesn't have Delsin \"grab\" things as well like window ledges and such, but that's a small complaint when you're leaping from the tops of buildings and see the incredibly well done graphics of the city spread out around and below you.  The story flows well, and as you progress, you start to get the side missions any Infamous fan is familiar with.  One different thing, as you take control of an area, it isn't suddenly just empty - there are \"showdowns\" you do in each district once it gets below a certain percentage of DUP control, where basically it's you vs. a bunch of them in a \"final\" battle for that area.  I really enjoy these as this is where some of the best fighting ends up getting done.Picking up other powers from other conduits is really slick, and a nice change.  By absorbing different power sources then you change between which conduit's powers you want to be using.  The only downside is some have things you love and things you don't, and you can't have all at once, so you can't pick between the best of each to make a single mix of the best things.  But that's to be expected, and it makes for a nice change of difficulty when you absorb another's, and haven't gotten all the powers unlocked yet.  Fortunately for me, my method of gameplay (inadvertently) makes this easier, since I clear all baddies from all areas before I go and do any of the boss fights or character changing missions. So by the time I've absorbed another conduit's powers, the areas are like 3% under UDP control, so I have little to worry about while finding more cores and such.All in all, it's definitely a worthy third installment of one of my favorite games, and if anyone has played the first or second, this one is a must have.  I had no intention of buying a PS4 when they came out, since almost all of my gaming is done on the Wii U or my Xbox 360 and Xbox One.  The only reason I got the PS3 was for Little Big Planet for my young son, and then I was happy I had it when I discovered the Infamous series.  And when they announced Second Son as a PS4 title, I knew I would have to cave in and get one.  So clearly the Infamous series is a compelling enough game if it was the only thing that was able to \"force\" me to buy a PS4.  I'm looking forward to as much replay on this one as I've enjoyed on the other two installments.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00009WAUH","description":"As renowned as theFinal Fantasyseries has become over the years, the release ofCrystal Chroniclesbrings with it an air of unfamiliarity. Although many of its elements tie into the greaterFinal Fantasyuniverse, this is but a faint echo of what you have come to know and love.While it can be argued that this is a new direction for the series, and therefore shouldn't be put on the same level as the other games, fans have come to expect the best fromFinal Fantasy, and with each passing release, Square has delivered.Crystal Chroniclesmay break new ground, but it lacks the creativity and passion of its role-playing brethren.As stylish as the character designs may be, they are completely void of personality. The story is just as ambiguous. Never once did I feel attached to my character, nor did I care what twists or turns the plot would make. TheFinal Fantasygames are renowned for storytelling, but it seems like an afterthought inCrystal Chronicles. Cinematic flair is also noticeably&nbsp;absent.The gameplay is just as careless and jagged. While the quest can be played single-player, it's meant to be tackled by a group of people (preferably four). Since each player utilizes menu screens often, Square and Game Designer's Studio decided that you could only play multiplayer with a Game Boy Advance attached to the GameCube. Hence, all menu management is done on the GBA screen, and the action on the TV is unaffected. In theory, this is a just solution. As it turns out, though, I found it to be more detrimental to the quest than anything.When a player accesses the GBA, their character on the TV cannot be controlled. Not only does this leave them open to attack, it more or less halts any progress that the group can make. So basically, you still find yourself sitting around waiting for your buddy to make preparations, but instead, you're doing it with a controller that has fewer buttons and dying batteries.To make matters worse, players must also keep an eye on a bucket. To prevent characters from scattering and trying to run in different directions, the bucket emits a field of energy that covers roughly 80 percent of the screen. If you go outside of this barrier, you'll take damage. So you basically must stay huddled together as one person carries the bucket throughout a stage. Without question, this is one of the stupidest ideas in the history of video games.When it comes to the basics of gameplay, the combat is respectable, but by no means great. I really like the timing-based combo system that accompanies both magic and general hack n' slash, yet I absolutely despise losing all of my magic with each new area that I enter. Hence, classes are not defined, and you never really get the impression that your character is growing in power.There's little here that truly excites.Crystal Chroniclesplays like an experiment gone awry, and is unfit to bear the sacrosanctFinal Fantasyname.Concept:A hack n' slash with inventive, yet highly aggravating GBA-based multiplayer connectivity, and a worthless bucketGraphics:Stylish character designs, gorgeous particle effects, and awesome boss designsSound:Not the familiarFinal Fantasymelodies, but memorable nonethelessPlayability:Steers away from button mashing with timing-based chains, manual spell aiming, and multi-person combosEntertainment:A cookie cutter adventure with a lackluster story, poor character growth, and frustrating playReplay:Moderately HighRated:7 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Crystal Chroniclesis here to remind us that every so often, Square Enix actually puts out an average game.

Combining spells with your teammates is awesome, but half the time it's less effective than two individual castings, and you lose all of your magic between areas. The effects and character models are cool, but downtimes really drag and many cutscenes look awfully similar. The worst part, though, is that character advancement is the slowest I've ever seen. Beat a boss and get your choice of +1 to one of your stats! Thrilling. There is certainly some enjoyment to be had here, but it's sprinkled somewhat thinly among all of the lame and boring parts. On a console with a lot of great four-player titles,Crystal Chroniclesdoes very little to distinguish itself.Rated:7 out of 10Editor:Adam BiessenerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Tso Haven Hei Wan \"Havenough Dupont Randall-B...","summary":"A very promising return of the FF series to Nintendo","reviewText":"The Final Fantasy series which originated from the Nintendo platforms finally marked a return to its roots this year with the Crytal Chronicles landing on the controversial GameCube platform.To distinguish itself from the numbered series that now prosper on the Sony consoles, Crystal Chronicles mark a huge diversion in terms of game play and design. Musch emphasis was placed on the multiplayer module that allow up to 4 players to play at the same time with their GBA connected to the GameCube. The most stunning aspect of this multiplayer mode was there is no split screen but all characters are limited in movement by the crytal cage that protects everybody from the poisonous mist in the world.The single player mode which was less mentioned in fact offers the same degree of satisfaction for players. Instead of having friends carrying the crystal cage, a moogle (an FF icon) carries it for you (but from time to time will tell you it is tired and you have carry for it to maintain a good relationship with the moogle). Battles are in real time action similar to Kingdom Hearts but you have more strategy involved rather than hack and slash. You can power up your attack with a target ring, but you need to predict the moves of your enemies to score your hit. This is the same for magic used in Crystal Chronicles.Magic are obtained through magical orbs dropped by enemies or found in chests, but they can't be kept in your possession after your left the area. This might cause a bit of nuisance to traditional FF players but since they are so readily available, you won't be missing out too much. However, the annoying part will be you have reassign the command slots that you need to scroll with your L/R button in every area you enter to your advantage for battles. Nonetheless, the game will remind you to do so before you enter the area. If you want to keep the magic, you have to find the magic rings and equip them to your characters. Certain magic like Gravity are resulted from orb combination, but the game will tell you when you assign them side by side in the command slots.In terms of levelling up, it is done through acquiring different type of antiques in the Crystal Chronicles world. There are heaps to collect and they are dropped by enemies or found in chests. However, you can only keep one of the antiques after you clear the area, so if you want the whole collection for a lot of levelling up, then you will need to visit and clear a particular area again and again until you get them all. This could cause a bit of nuisance for some people. Nonetheless, you can always eat different kinds of food to boost your magic, strength and defence temporarily.Each character has a family business which in return will be a necessity for different forms of levelling up. Different families provide different unique services to you such as food, weapons and armours that you can use to level up your character. Any family that are not assigned to a character yet, their house hold will be occupied by a moogle instead until you \"inhabit\" every single one of them.In terms of control and game play, it offers more handy experience to players when compared to Kingdom Hearts but as mentioned, the reassignment of command slots can cause a bit of nuisance. Nonetheless, if you assign a Phoenix Down to one of the slots, it could revive your character immediately when it is killed, which could be handy for difficult boss fights.The graphics is stunningly detailed and designed. It was afraid that the return to the style similar to FF 9, which is not that successful, would hinder the game a bit, but it turns out it works really well with the environment and the world of Crystal Chronicles. A lot of details have been attended to landscape, water effects and light effects - you can see the defracted image of your character from the crystal cage when the miru water is filled to a certain level.Storywise, it is unfolded during different encounters on the road and during the initial description of the areas your first visited. So the more encounter you made, the more you would know about the story.In all, Crystal Chronicles is a very promising return of the franchise to the Nintendo platform and surely it will provide you a whole new experience in the Final Fantasy series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2003"}

Race a motorcycle against a large truck, and see who comes out on top!The graphics in this game are just stunning. The details in the canyon ridges, the scrubs and shrubs along the path, the tiny details on the vehicles, are are rendered in amazing detail. We sat and watched MANY crahes just to marvel at how well done the physics were, how the tiny pieces of the vehicle sprang apart and bounded along the path.The sound is a heavy metal rock beat. This will be great if you love this kind of music - or will get quickly very annoying if you don't. The solution is of course just to turn down the music and play your own if you're not into it. Problem solved pretty quickly.Gameplay is fascinating because of the wide variety of vehicles involved. Most games have buggies against buggies, or racecars against racecars. In this one you can choose motorcycles, ATVs, buggies, race cars, trucks, jeeps, and a variety of other vehicles. The tracks are set up with a high, medium and low path. The heavier vehicles can plow through the mud and take the easier route. The lighter vehicles need to skirt along the canyon edges, taking advantage of their small size.This is super in theory - but in practice there are only a small number of courses, and each type of vehicle really only does well on its own set track. So unlike some racing games where there are a variety of paths and options you can take for victory, for here it's more like there are interweaving tracks and you have to stay on \"yours\" if you want to win. It's still fun of course, but it could have been much better by really giving you multiple options.Another real downside here is that there is NO LOCAL MULTIPLAYER. The package says 1-12 players but they mean solely online. I really think packages should list local and online separate on their packaging so there is no confusion. I opened this up wanting to have some fun races against my boyfriend - but we couldn't! To me, that really takes away from the fun of a game, if it's this sort of multiplayer game but the only let you play online.Still, if you're the type of person who only plays single player - or someone who thrives in the online environment - this game really is a LOT of fun. The physics are simply amazing. You could use this game in physics classes to explain various actions and interactions.Great fun - but I'd really like to see a Motorstorm 2 that had local multiplayer and more courses.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2007"}

Rhodes","summary":"Lord of the Rings Meets Final Fantasy","reviewText":"Pros:+Some good graphics+Fantastic Music+Simple to pick up and play+Allows for multiplayerCons:-Unbalanced leveling system-Incredibly short-Not enough side areas-Generic characters devoid of any personality-Tedious ability system-In short, the game doesn't feel like it belongs in the RPG genre.  The entire game itself is very generic, only putting in the most basic of basic RPG principles.  Yet there are no towns, or NPCs to talk to.  The game feels like it should've been an action/adventure game... not an RPG.Lord of the Rings The Third Age is what you would get if you mixed The Lord of the Ring with Final Fantasy (in particular, Final Fantasy X).  The end result is a game that feels less like Lord of the Rings and more like a game trying to cash in on a popular genre.  Lord of the Rings hardly feels like it should be an RPG to begin with. If the developers wanted to develop an RPG for Lord of the Rings, they probably shouldn't have done it within the trilogy and perhaps had it in the same world but as a side story.You are Berethor who is out to find Boromir.  Your quest takes you through the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  You are, throughout much of it, just one step behind them.  In short, it's the Lord of the Rings trilogy, only not played out by the cast featured in the films.  This isn't the only problem with the story.  Most of it is narrated by Gandolf.  In fact, so much of the story is told by Gandolf instead of your characters that you begin to wonder what your characters are even doing.  The characters do very little to drive the story forward.  They're also very generic.  You don't care about the characters who join you because they're so generic and devoid of any personality.The gameplay doesn't do much to save it either.  Much of the games battle system feels almost exactly like Final Fantasy X.  You roam around until you are thrust into a random encounter.  While in battle, there's a gauge on the side that shows you the turn order.  Again, it works almost exactly as Final Fantasy X does.  Your characters all have an obvious class and a set of unique abilities.  Characters can learn more abilities the more they use them.  The game also has a gauge beside your characters names.  When it fills up you can initiate perfect mode and pull off an incredibly powerful attack.  The end result is a system that eventually becomes tedious rather than unique.  There isn't much customization outside of equipping characters with different items either.  At the very least the game puts an emphasis on using different characters for different situations.  But another thing that borrows from Final Fantasy X, is that you can swap characters out of battle on their turn and bring in someone to substitute.  The game's level up system is a little unbalanced, though.  You'll level up quite a bit, and very fast.  What makes it unbalanced, however, is that your characters who partake in the battle gain more experience based on how many actions they take, and who they finish off.  A character who does nothing in a battle loses out on a lot of experience while characters who partake can gain two or three times the amount a character who sits out gains.  You'll have characters fall behind before you know it.As a bonus the game is also multiplayer so you and a friend can play.  Unfortunately, the only thing your partner can do is act in battle.  Outside of that he can't roam around the land with you or interact with anything.Interacting doesn't really mean much anyway.  You won't be visiting any towns.  All your items, equipment and such are granted to you through finding them in chests or hoping that an enemy drops them in battle.  The entire game is one giant dungeon.  It tries to throw in some quirks.  For example as you roam you'll run through certain snippets of the dungeons where the eye of Sauron is in the corner.  When it fully forms you get into a battle whether you're moving or not.  It seems weird, but you won't be complaining about battles for too long.  While the random encounter rate is through the roof, there are save points scattered almost everywhere.  Save points aren't few and far between by any means and they always restore you to full health.In terms of production values, The Third Age isn't so bad.  The voice acting (particularly from Gandolf) is brilliant, and even your characters don't sound bad when they speak.  The graphics are also nice.  Not the best to grace the Playstation 2 but good nonetheless.  It's not a bad game to look at.  You get a little tired of some of the animations for when enemies attack, or for certain abilities, but it's a small price to pay.  The only other bothersome thing about the graphics is that there just isn't enough originality put into the game.  No creatures they decided to make up.  Everything you battle was in the films, but that leaves for little variety in the enemies you'll face. On the other hand, you do get clips directly from the films, which is nice.The music, however, is easily the best part of the game.  It's all ripped directly from the films and it all sounds very good.Lord of the Rings: The Third Age isn't a great game, but for what you get it isn't bad.  The biggest problem with the game is that it's an RPG when it clearly isn't suited to be one.  You play as generic characters not even featured in the films on a quest that's better suited for a different genre.The experience doesn't last long either.  In the long run, it'll take you less than 20 hours to complete the game, and there aren't very many things to do off the beaten path either.  It's very straightforward.The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age comes off as more of a game that wants to cash in on a popular genre.  It doesn't feel like it should've been an RPG in the first place.  It isn't a bad game.  It just feels out of place by being in the RPG genre.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2008"}

As I write this review, nearly three years have passed since the release of Bioshock. Dozens of shooters have been released in that time, several of which I've played, and Bioshock itself has a sequel on store shelves (which I've not yet played). So, three years later what's the verdict?If anything, time has proven that Bioshock was not just another hyped-up title. It truly was, and remains to this day, a great achievement in gaming. It's not that it was particularly challenging or even revolutionary. The \"plasmids\" concept had been done, in different forms, by games before (Deus Ex's implant powers, for example) and even the hardest setting had few, if any, nearly impossible stretches. What set Bioshock apart back then, and which still makes it so engrossing today, is the depth and detail of the city of Rapture and the excellent story and characters.Sure, the graphics will eventually show their age, and the concept will be redone and reworked by various sequels and knock-offs, but Bioshock has earned a place among other milestone shooters like Doom and Half-life. Definitely worth picking up now that the price is coming down a bit or if you waited to upgrade your computer to get the full effect of the graphics.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001QXNBJM","reviewerName":"Colin Brown \"Colin Brown Microsoft MVP\"","summary":"Better than MW2?","reviewText":"I bought this game for two primary reasons :-1. I enjoyed the first Bad Company game2. I was sorely disappointed with MW2.So with that in mind how is this game?  to me the single player game isn't actually as good as the original Bad Company game.  It seems as though Dice has been looking at the Call of Duty games and tried to incorporate bits into their engine. The original Bad Company game had a fairly expansive battlefield that you could roam around on and do fairly much whatever you wished, whilst the game still pushed you towards your goals.The battlefields in BC2 are a lot more restrictive. You don't seem to have the freedom you had in the original which was disappointing.The single player game is also fairly short, taking roughly 6-7 hours to complete. It's also quite frustrating at times as you'll be playing along and suddenly there's a cut-scene. It takes the fluidity out of gameplay.  The cut-scenes however are very nicely rendered and do add to the storyline. There's also quite comical remarks as you'd expect if you played the original.Single player however is still fun and takes you through the maps that you will be playing in the multi-player/online game so it's good familiarity to play the single player game first.Dice however seem to have focused their attention on the multi-player game and they have done an excellent job with it. Lots of hours of fun can be spent playing the different types of multi-player games available, with more maps and add-ons coming in the next few months.If you're looking for a good single player game that lasts a long time and that you will come back to, look elsewhere, there's better ones out there.If you're looking for a combination of decent single player game but will spend more time online then I'd definately recommend this.OverallSingle PlayerGameplay : 8/10Graphics : 9/10Longevity : 5/10Sound : 8/10Overall : 7.5/10Multi-playerGameplay : 9.5/10Graphics : 9/10Longevity : 9/10Sound : 8/10Overall : 8.5/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2010"}

From the moment you pop the first CD in, you are nothing but impressed. I wish all games started out the way this one does--with a BANG! You are Cloud, a selfish newcomer to a resistance group known as AVALANCHE. You don't care about the planet. No way. As soon as this job is done, you want to get your cut and split. The dialogue is truly something else. And the storyline, WOW! The whole idea of a city on a &quot;plate&quot; was really original and appealing. Great movie-sequences. I could go on and on praising this game. Even after playing Final Fantasy 9 I can't help but go back and play this great game. Yeah, it is more science fiction than fantasy, but it is science fiction done RIGHT. Although the game is only three CD's long, the game lasts anywhere from 40 to 80 hours. In the first CD, you spend 6 hours in the huge city of Midgar alone. Then you go on for another 10 hours or so, before going to disc 2. This game has great music, especially the ending boss music. That song is called &quot;One-Winged Angel&quot;. By the way, Sephiroth is pronounced, &quot;Sea-fee-roth&quot;. At least that's how they pronounce it in the song. Speaking of Sephiroth, he's really cool. Definitely the best villian I've ever seen. Overall, this is either the first or second best RPG I've ever played. First place might go to Final Fantasy 6. Sure, the graphics are way outdated on that game, but the storyline more than made up for it. Anyway, buy Final Fantasy 7 RIGHT NOW.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2001"}

Great game, better Multiplayer","reviewText":"Star Wars games have always been great.  And Jedi Knight was one of the first games to use 3d rendered characters.  It was a great game that many people loved and spent many hours on.  JK2 is a great sequel that has brought back the great fun of sabering and hightened everything.Pros: Sabers!  Great and fluid use of the Quake3 engine.  Incredible Multiplayer fun.Cons: Weapons almost don't serve a purpose anymore.  The stoyline was good for a while... but the... oh i won't ruin it.Genre: First Person Shooter.Gore Level: Low... unless you modify the damage cuased my a saber, no blood.Bots:  dumbOk so here we have one of the greatest games back again for a sequel.  And wow, it is an amazing game.  We have SABERS!! the greatest Melee weapon ever used in a shooter.  And now we have even more ways to use it and it is now a twitchy skill instead of a lucky strike as it was in JK1.  The guns a bigger and badder, but we have SABERS!!!  The enemies are tougher... smarter... but we have SABERS!!! and the maps are larger and cooler... and we have SABERS!!! ok so the saber is definitely the greatest aspect of the game.  PCGAMER- \"The guns are cool...  ...but you'll never go back.\"  And honestly i didn't and no one has either.The game features three modes for battling sabers, medium, light and strong.  Any motion you make with the character affects the way the saber goes.  It can do damage at any point it's on... so running into a friendly with the saber up will do damage.  A plus.  But it doesn't provide a cheap light like it used to in JK1... and there is definitely a few areas where that would have been a lifesaver... literally.  There are also special moves to be done with the sabers, and throw, a better one than any mod and better than MOTS.And to accomodate the increase in saber use several evil cloaked saber weilding Fallen Jedi appear now and then between herds of Saber fodder (e.g. Stormtroopers and stuff)  You have to get good at the saber too, or else it is all over... and the game just isn't worth it.Ok the guns are cool too.  We have some returns, repeater, bryar pistol, rifle, bowcaster, thermal detonator... but some new arsenal.  Like a snipper rifle... Concussion Gernades... Missiles with homing and a Flechette.  But all can be blocked and utterly rendered useless with a saber, of course.The force powers are back with a lot to talk about.  I'll keep it short.  The Jump is now controllable where you kinda of fly to where you want to go and stop.  Kinda nifty... but really weird looking.  Speed in Single player pulls this matrix slow thing and doesn't last as long as it used to... but it's better.  The grip is far more powerful and lightning doesn't cost so much to use anymore.  Healing is progressive and requires you to stop moving to heal over a period of time.  Enhancements make healing eventually instant.  There are many new and great powers to be used in multiplayer too.  Like a combo Lightning, grip and drain.The Multiplayer is the best element of hte game.  And with q3's engine the Bots are now taking their step into the arena (as opposed to the multiplayer in JK1).  Though they aren't that hard... they do provide everyday fun for slaughter and massacre.  But something that will keep the Gunners happy is that the ability to block a shot with a saber has become a force skill that must be earned.  Yeah... like i found that out the hardway.  Stood head to head with a guy armed with a rifle... me with my patched up flame saber... soon he paniced started backing up and firing at me.  Before i knew it i was respawning... and there are 3 levels to the skill.  Adds a whole new element to the game.  Since the game is on the Q3 engine... expect to see many many mods popping out for it... i've already seen and tested many myself and have found them all to be worht it.  That's what helped make Q3 popular was the easy way to add Mods.What's best is that i ran a P3 800 with 128mb RAM and managed to kick some serious newbie butt with a fluid and graceful image across my little ole 15\".  Yeah i got a bigger one now (1.8 with 1g RAM) but i can assure you lower end owners and gamers with a budget that it will work on your 600Celeron too.  A 500 is pushing it though.  But does it ever look pretty on a higher end.Give it a whirl and you'll never go back.  I would recommend maybe upgrading above 56K though...[ Press SHIFT + `... for the Tilde (~) key.  It brings up the console.  Type in \"helpusobi 1\" to enable editing mode (cheat mode).  Then type \"g_saberrealisticcombat #\" where # is any number.  0 is default.  1 will set the saber damage to a more realistic setting... where it acutally kills in one hit, but you can die too in one hit.  Setting it to 2 will enhance it's damage to high that running into characters kills them.  Going -2 is a good challenege.  Try a game with -20 for fun.  ]","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2002"}

It's not an original game, but it combines all of these elements very well.You're part of a small patrol sent to find out why the communications systems of a planet buster suddenly went dead after finding an alien artifact.  On your arrival, you discover that the crew has been transformed into super-deadly-alien-zombies!The aliens have two purposes:1)  Make Living Things Dead2)  Harvest Dead FleshThe aliens aren't the only problem.  The ship is near an asteroid field and parts of the ship have been destroyed.  Power, Gravity, and Life Support systems are out in parts of the ship.  Assisted by 2 members of your team, via hologram-intercom, you must find a way off of the ship.Gameplay - 9The gameplay is very good.  What sets this game apart from most is that you can access a map that shows you the path to your next objective.  It literally draws a line on the map from your position to where you need to go, so you will never get lost.  You can deviate from the path as much as you want to explore, gather weapons, health, ammo, and unforunately encounter more aliens.  But you will never get lost or stuck wandering around levels like other survival horror games.The weapons are good and fun to shoot.  You have a pistol, a machine gun, a buzz-saw gun, flame thrower, etc...  all of them pefect for dismembering aliens.  The fights with aliens are fair.  It's very rare that you die and it's not your fault.  It's also rare that you die in the same place repeatedly.  If you happen to die, the checkpoints are generous and you never get set back too far.There are weapons, ammo, and health all over the ship.  There are also stores that you can access to buy or upgrade weapons.The aliens come in all shapes and sizes, too.  The combat never gets boring in this game.There are some Zero-Gravity areas.  These are incredibly cool.You also get telekinesis and stasis (which temporarily slows down objects and enemies) for puzzles and combat.Graphics - 10From the flickering lights, to the gore stained walls, to the breathtaking views of space, it all looks great.  The aliens look like creatures from John Carpenters' The Thing.Sound - 10The sound effects will make you jump.  The eerie background music sounds like a mix of the TV Show Lost and the movie Aliens.  It's perfect.Story - 7The reasons you go from objective to objective are good.  The acting is good, but there are a few plot twists that feel a bit odd.Immersion - 10There is no HUD in the game.  Instead, the health is on your character's back.  All of the information that you need to know, shows up as holograms in game.  If you see an item in a dark corner, as you approach it, a holographic window appears telling you what it is and how to pick it up.  Your inventory and map also appear as holograms.  The absense of the HUD makes the game feel more immersive.The camera is pretty close to your character which allows you to be ambushed by aliens and unlike first person games, you can actually see what horrible things are happening to your character.Scary - 9It's scary.The game is rated M for Mature for Violence and Gore and Violent Gore and Gory Violence.  Severed heads, gore, dismembered limbs in zero gravity...  The works.Replay Value - 8The game is composed of 12 Chapters that can take you 8-12 hours to finish, depending on how much exploring you do.  Once you finish the game, you get a ton of upgrades and cash and can replay the game as an action game.There are 4 Difficulty Levels from Easy to Impossible.If you want a Scary Alien Game, you have to pick this one up.  You don't even have to be an experienced gamer to finish it, either.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2008"}

They improved on the Civilization 4 platform and modernized and improved it.  Same style of winning as before where you can either win the science race, or diplomatic, warlord etc.  Seems like you have newer things to pick to build and newer war based units to build as well.My only real complaint of the new game is it is ran through a platform company called Steam.  And you can only use one product key per game unlike Civilization 4 where both my wife and I could upload it onto and play on our computers i.e. laptop and desktop or laptops.  You can upload them on as many computers as you want.  However who creates the steam account using the product key is the only person that can play the game using the product key.  So if you have multiple people wanting to play the game you have to buy a product key for each person.  That's my only real complaint.  Other than that it's a great game and recomend for purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2012"}

(still, the smoke is simply amazing).one more negative - artillery.  artillery is a feature where when you reach a certain rank, you point with your binoculars and planes drop huge bombs on the enemy.  for the most part it's cool, except there's simply too much artillery and when one team uses it on the other team's spawn point, the game is virtually over, because you can't stop from being killed by it.  this is a stupid oversight on the part of the makers of UO.other positives - new types of games, especially capture the flag, my personal favorite, greatly add to the fun, instead of playing old boring team deathmatch.  also, make sure you turn your search filter on to search for \"mods\" so you can play new modifications and maps that people created.  this adds to the freshness and excitement of the game.  also turn \"auto-downloads\" on so you can download these new maps when you click on the server.despite the negatives, i still play this game almost every day.  even though i've played it for countless hours, it's still sooo fun.  i think this qualifies as the best video game created to date.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000JLIXIG","reviewerName":"A. C. Ege/Acedoh \"acedoh\"","summary":"The must play PS3 game","reviewText":"I have never been a big fan of first person shooters.  To me most of the games seem to have the same revolving storyline with you being the hero.  The FPS genre has become the sure fire top game seller over the past several years.  So it was no surprise to me when Sony announced that their biggest launch title would be Resistance Fall of Man.  I was less than enthusiastic about it and was hoping for something a little different to help persuade my buying decision.  When I eventually bought a PS3 last week I reluctantly purchased this game.  The positive reviews are what caused me to hope for something good at least.  When I eventually got a chance to sit down and play the game I became more than enthusiastic.  Resistance is a very well put together game with excellent physics, A.I., and graphics.  Now I am not going to compare graphics or gameplay to other shooters.  All I can say is this game has excellent visual effects when watching the destruction take place.  Some of the environments are amazingly detailed with a sense of watching a good sci-fi movie set in the 1950's.  I was captivated with the excellent storyline and the larger than life plot.  Nothing about your character is average...but he is also not some superhero that looks like he works out everyday.  The A.I. is amazing in this game and it shows how well the enemy can anticipate your moves.  I was having problems in a building because everytime I thought the enemy was moving in the other direction he would come right up on me and open fire.  Hopefully this an indication of what developers can do on the cell based architechture.  We will see.  Now as far as graphics are concerned.  I would say this game was not a show stopper.  It's presented in 720p and is set with numerous dark Earth tones.  I believe this was the intention of the developer when setting the mood.  Obviously chilling would be a key word.  Some of the textures are amazing and the explosion and smoke effects are superb.  Although playing this game also helps me realize they still have a long way to go on taking the PS3 to it's limits.Playing online is very impressive.  The times I have played it never had trouble finding me a room which had several people playing.  If you are looking for an intriguing story and generally a very good game to keep you busy over the next month or two then this is it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2007"}

Although I would like it for Star Wars Battlefront from PS2, I'll live.  It's the same price as the 80GB and that's the only difference.  For the same price, you get 40 more gigs of storage which is a lot to fill, but I'm sure I'll find a way.  This system is much lighter to carry, I almost didn't think it was in the box.  It's skinnier so it looks nicer.  Doesn't make as much noise.  The push buttons are better than touch because you can't accidentally hit them.  It's also a matte finish so it doesn't show finger prints as easy.  When PS2 was slim, it was the best version of the system, so I have no doubts this is on the fast track to the best PS3.

Yes, this is &#34;arena combat&#34;, but it's not really that simple.  The premise is that Ratchet is a contestant on a game show where you battle bots and, ultimately, boss battles with other star gladiators.When you enter a level  you generally battle in small areas then there are platforming elements where you move on to other parts of the level.  It doesn't really feel like you're trapped in an arena for the entire game.It's a quick game, maybe 8-10 hours or so.  My son has played through the game much more than I have so I can't recall how long the full story mode takes.  But the good part of this, and what my son loves, is that the weapons continue to upgrade if you continue with the same game save and restart at the beginning.  So your character and weapons continue to improve, which greatly enhances the replay value.  To my mind it's long enough, and it's not an issue at all.You can also play splitscreen multiplayer, either against each other in various standard game types, or co-op through the story mode.  The only complaint is that it gets hard to see what's going on.  That may be my aging eyes, but I think my son has the same issue to a lesser extent.Still, a fun game.  The R&C; games are top-notch, and easily some of the best on the PS2.

Nathan Hale.View larger.This sequel introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers.View larger.Resistance 2 takes up right where Resistance: Fall of Man left off. Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest. This unprecedented 60-player option could revolutionize online multiplayer game play and is sure to provide countless hours of action-packed fun.Resistance 2, set in the United States, is loaded with new weapons, enemies, and an unprecedented online gaming experience.","reviewerName":"GC \"GRC\"","summary":"A Huge Disappointment After The First Resistance Game...","reviewText":"I loved Resistance: Fall of Man but hate this game (note-I have not finished the single-player mode, I got halfway through and quit out of frustration). Why? While Resistance: FOM was original, strategic and exciting, this game is a boring, frustrating copycat FPS. The only ways this game has been enhanced are the graphics and multi-player.Let's start with the good, shall we? The graphics are GREAT. They're truly beautiful. Everything looks realistic, even the arms and legs of your teammates. There have also been a few, small gameplay improvements. 1) Your teammates are more effective. They died very early on in the missions in RFOM. 2) You can now use the Auger more effectively because you can see, in limited fashion, through walls while using it. 3) Some of the new weapons are quite cool. The plasma cannon and Marksman are two of my favorite new additions.I have to admit that I don't much care for multi-player in FPS games. If you play this online and find decent people to play with or against, it won't be half bad.Now comes the bad and there's a lot of it. The health system from the first game has been replaced by a Call of Duty style rip off mode, in which there is no health bar. Instead, the screen flashes red if you take a hit and you must take cover to regenerate health. Other problems are noticeable as the game goes along. A particularly annoying features is that in many missions, there are simply tons of enemies. None of them are particularly hard to kill, but there will be hundreds in some cases and they ALL will make a beeline to you. They don't even see your teammates, it's completely bizarre. This problem did not exist in RFOM. The scenery is also overly bright and cheery. Gone is the dark look and feeling of dread from the first game. Also missing is the time consuming searching around a level to find the switch you need to continue. Some people didn't like that about the first game, but I did. It was a nice break from non-stop shooting.The insanely high number of one-hit kills is a large part of what makes this game frustrating. There are many cases where you MUST run from an enemy, because it is literally unkillable. The Chameleons are not what I'm complaining about either, they don't frustrate me at all. I'm primarily referring to the Fury and the Swarm. You just can't kill them and will constantly be one-hit killed if you don't sprint away. Nathan Hale also sounds a little different to me, am I imagining things? Despite supposedly being on the brink of becoming a Chimera, he sounds the same. Furthermore, the game really suffers without any narration. There are also subtle little changes I hated, such as not being able to view intel documents you've just acquired without pausing the game. You'll also notice that gone are the missions where you can drive/pilot a tank, stalker or the like. That was really a fun feature in the first installment and makes this game feel too repetitive. Even the change in music was bad. When you die, you'll hear something that sounds like a miswritten theme for the epic Shogun, not a sci-fi based shooting game.Despite it all, perhaps the worst feature is the ability to only carry two guns/weapons at once. I understand that techically adds realism, but what other part of this game is real? The imaginary guns or the virus that turns humans into alien-like creatures? It's excessively frustrating because you'll have to constantly drop a weapon you know, without a doubt, you'll want back later on.Bottom line: If you want a good-looking, generic shooting, you'll love this game. But if you loved RFOM and want more of it, avoid this game like the plague.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2010"}

It plays like halo, and is not a bad game, on legendary on my first playthrough, it took about a week solo. I was playing slow to get every single player achievement. It is interesting, and if you like halo, you should buy it, especially if you have the others in the series. For a first effort by 343i, it is good and went in a few new directions, but it plays like halo and if you need your halo fix, this will give it to you. There is a new part called spartan ops that you can play co-op or solo which you have to download, but it is free and will add hours of playing so it is definitely worth the money.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2013"}

Shimkus \"Movie Manji\"","summary":"science fiction war driven story with competitive multiplayer but feels stale.","reviewText":"I own this game and play it on LIVE with friends who since launch day have tutored me on becoming a better online player. I'll try and talk about the MP first. If you own the 4GB kinect ready console you will have to buy additional storage. I used a 30GB flashdrive. Get disc 2 installed and you can throw it away if you'd like. DLC so far must be purchased. That divides the online community. Most people use the BR for small maps, and use the DMR for bigger maps. Do what you will. I don't see many people use the plasma pistol for a secondary even though it disables vehicles, because most people like to charge vehicles and kill the driver by climbing it and performing removal surgery. You wear battle armor and shields, but a melee can insta-kill; go figure. You can crouch, jump, run, and you must do your best to lower the accuracy of your opponents but most just stride side to side. Understanding jump spots and the layout of maps usually is the difference between great players and good.The game has excellent presentations and has some long video to watch. The story is lacking for me. I have read so many stories filled with the same plot devices that I guess I'm hard to please. Science fiction has really become less about technology and story telling, and more about how to write epic heroism in war using cool weapons against aliens races and bad guys. Not my bag any more. I'm worn out.I'm not disappointed because it is what it is, another Halo game. You get what you ask for as a consumer. People buy these types of games and expect more in the future. The mystery of Halo was incredible. What was the Halo ring, and who built it? You learn how amazing master chief is. But there's nothing new here.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2013"}

Peavey","summary":"Halo 4 the Reclaimer saga begins","reviewText":"Halo 4 is an awesome game and it shows no contest as a great game. 4 reasons why this game is good. 1 story, 2 characters, 3 controls & weapons, and lastly 4 music.Story:Four years after the events of Halo 3, still floating in space, Forward Unto Dawn drifts towards Requiem. Cortana wakes Master Chief from cryonic sleep shortly before rogue Covenant forces board the vessel. The remnants of Dawn are caught in Requiem's gravity well and pass through an opening on the planet's surface to crash-land on its interior.As Chief and Cortana explore Requiem, fighting hostile Covenant and Prometheans, Cortana malfunctions. She reveals that she is past the usual operating period of an AI, and is becoming \"rampant\", a declining mental state where AIs slowly \"think\" themselves to death. Chief promises to get Cortana to Earth, believing that Cortana's creator, Doctor Catherine Halsey, can prevent or reverse Cortana's condition.Chief and Cortana pick up garbled transmissions from a human ship, Infinity, who have picked up Dawn's distress call. Cortana attempts to warn Infinity away from Requiem's gravity well and directs the Chief to deactivate what she believes are communications jammers. Instead, Chief releases the Didact, an ancient Forerunner warrior, from imprisonment. The Didact takes control of the Prometheans and Covenant and attacks Infinity after it is dragged into Requiem.Chief makes contact with Infinity and brings the ship's weapons back online to repulse the Didact's attack. Chief and Cortana recommend attacking the Didact while he is vulnerable, but Infinity captain Del Rio orders them to destroy the gravity well so the ship can escape. In the process, Chief is contacted by a Forerunner known as the Librarian; the wife of the Didact, as well as ancient humanity's protector. She explains that the Forerunners were split on how to combat the Flood. After failing to discover a way to immunize biological beings from the parasite, the Didact used a device called the Composer to convert the warriors under his command into digital versions immune to infection. Requiring more soldiers, the Didact forcibly converted captured humans into Prometheans, before being stopped and imprisoned by the Librarian. The Librarian, who has guided humanity's development, accelerates the Chief's evolution; this grants him immunity to the Composer. After destroying the gravity well, Del Rio orders a retreat back to Earth, doubting the Chief and Cortana's testimony. The Master Chief disobeys orders to stand down and relinquish the malfunctioning Cortana, and stays behind to oppose the Didact. Infinity XO Commander Lasky gives Chief an armed transport and wishes him luck.Chief and Cortana attempt to sabotage the Didact's ship before he leaves, but when they are unsuccessful they follow the Didact to a Halo ring, Installation 03. The Composer has been moved from the ring onto the nearby Ivanoff Research Station, which the Covenant attack. The Chief defends Ivanoff, but the Didact retrieves the Composer and uses it on the station, composing every individual except the Chief. Chief and Cortana use a fighter to follow the Didact's ship through slipspace towards Earth. Aided by Infinity and the UNSC home fleet, the Chief boards the Didact's ship with a nuclear warhead. Cortana inserts copies of herself into the Didact's computer systems to overwhelm the Didact's shield, but not before the Didact directs the Composer at Earth. With the help of Cortana, the Chief defeats the Didact, who falls into a slipspace corridor generated underneath the Composer.Chief detonates the bomb, and finds himself in a blue realm where Cortana appears. She explains they were successful in stopping the Composer and that she saved Chief from the blast, although she cannot return with him. Cortana touches Chief's armor, backs away and disappears; the Master Chief is found by a UNSC rescue team and is taken back to Infinity, where he, mourning the loss of Cortana, talks with Lasky about Earth, duty, and what his duty as a soldier means. Lasky repeats something Cortana said earlier about not being just a machine driven by duty to protect humanity.In a post-credits cutscene, UNSC forces descend on the city of New Phoenix, the location the Didact used the Composer on, to find its inhabitants dead. In a narration, the Didact proclaims the Forerunner's role as custodians of the galaxy having to bear The Mantle of Responsibility, and humanity as the greatest threat in the galaxy. Master Chief removes his armor aboard Infinity; if the player completes the game on Legendary difficulty, the Chief's eyes are briefly shown.the characters are well designed and voice acting really shows greatness new enemies, old enemies, and lots of character development.Master chief is the same voice actor thats awesome same with cortana before her utter demise.the control is amasing the control shows the improvement with this game and it's awesome.Weapons: the weapons have improved or have been customized. thats saying alotmusic: Music is great with a little halo theme music outside installation 03 though i would have a little longer Halo theme.There's terminals just like in Halo 3 and the Halo Combat evolved annivarsary these terminals give back story on the forerunners and the Halo rings also the flood. if you have played the other Halo games then this game should be a cake walk if you just started with this one and haven't played the other games the first terminal will give insight on Master chiefs adventures in the previous Halo games its located n the first misson Under master chiefs cryo pod.Story 5/5Characters 5/5Controls 5/5Weapons 5/5Music 5/5total 10/10 = A+This game is great and I can't wait for Halo 5 and Halo 6.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Burns \"Slackjaw\"","summary":"From a Reach junkie that reached Inheritor ranking..","reviewText":"Greetings and thank you for reading my review.  I have to take a little time and create this review because I am a little shocked by the reviews I'm seeing given a game as polished and complete as Halo 4.  I have played all of them going back to the original Xbox. I was an inheritor in Reach. I loved Reach probably most out of the group with Halo 3 close behind. Anyone giving this game one star is simply out of their skulls (slight Halo punn).So what is Halo 4 in relation to it's predecessor? Is is a new experience? Is it worth your time to explore its offering?The short answer is a resounding YES!  The gameplay is tight and clean like previous Halo titles.  It shines in production value.  I like the new enemy types and the heightened targeting of enemies (that have weakness spots to take advantage of)  I like the mixture of Covenant and habitat based enemies (that fight against one another actively around you)  I'm speaking of specific levels of the 8 sections offered.  Similar to Halo Reach,  those sections are LONG so don't believe the hype of people compaining about size.  The size is good and the spacing seems better than Reach... by this i mean that you will feel sections of the game are different based on enemy types and environments.  I am just about done with the Campaign and it has been perhaps the most enjoyable experience in the Halo universe for me.  There are some tense sections within the game where you are escaping and climbing out of danger and unlike others opinions I have read, I found these to be a welcome diversion to draw you back into the plot and change things up a bit.  Overall the Campaign is a tight enjoyable experience that builds on Reach. Coop is still a blast and is FUN!  Length is similar to Reach but I don't find myself getting the stale boredom of similar levels and ideas as in that last offering. New guns, new technology, new enemies, new environments.  Master Chief is back!Multiplayer is just what you would expect from Halo with a few additions,  Loadouts of weapons and perks that give you advantages in battle similar to COD.  This has been spoken about quite a bit but just to give you my experience,  I felt some nostalgia for some of the level build outs and the game plays pretty much the same as past with these new features integrated.  Halo always offers a strong list of multiplayer options and without going into too much depth, they are all here in this package.  There is much more under the skirt of this game that I am looking forward to trying but I wanted to give an opinion from someone who maxed out their character in Reach.This game is an excellant successor and I fail to see how any human being not banging two rocks together abstactly can find this to be any less than 3 stars.  The production values and pacing are great. The Multiplayer is strong as always and there is already committment for 3 more map packs.  Given this annoying habit of companies offering a pay forward \"pass\" gone are the days of buying a game in one transaction but I would venture to say that Halo is one of those franchises that just gets it.  The system couldn't continue it's success without a robust offering since this is the Xbox exclusive answer to PS3's strong lineup.  It's a console mover for sure and a can't miss title this holiday.  I played Reach just yesterday. Still has a rabid base (though you may find some people not working with the same tool kit you are using)  For 2 full years plus it occupied a spot in my rotation and I had to replace my copy 4 times due to wear.  It was the one game that made that insurance a valuable asset.  I would say it would be good to do the same here as this game has tremendous replay value and polish.Do yourself a favor and ignore the haters.  This is Halo and if it's differnent in some ways - how could that be a bad thing.  I got a little tired of nailing my 5 daily tasks everyday and am happy to be wasting countless more hours on this game as well.  The only problem is with so many great options right now it tends to put other games out of business around my house.  Halo is an event for those that get it and you should GET IT NOW!Thank you for reading,","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2012"}

One of the characteristics of this game is that it adds even more styles of action, besides firearms and swords, to the mix. Players are free to choose your own fighting style by customizing Dante to your advantage.","reviewerName":"nemesis","summary":"....  party time...!","reviewText":"Well, capcom has made an attempt to wipe from our memories the mess that was Devil May Cry 2... and have done a pretty good job of it. Here we have DMC3, a prequil to the first, legendary game. Lets start with the good stuff first: The game has great controlls... a fusion from the first and second games, this instalment has a control scheme that just feels natural. You will find pulling off slick, super stylish moves almost second nature. The story line is more involved this time, but is still nothing too impresive... this is a hardcore action game after all, so a great story isn't tradationally required, but you can tell the developers spent more time on the story for this game then they did for previous installments. Also, and probably most improtantly, you have RPG elements in this game. Think back to previous games..... what did you like the best? The awesome sword play and killer combos? The barking blasts of gunfire you could lay on your enemies from all directions? The awe-inspiring acrobatic moves that allowed you to dodge enemy attacks? Well, now you can have more in this game with the \"my Dante\" system, that allows you to pour attribute points into any of 6 catagories (2 of which are secret and need to be unlocked) including gunslinger, swordmaster, and trickster. This allowes you to customize Dante with more of what you liked about the past games, and offers more replay value. Now to the not-so-good stuff...  The game has some pretty bad graphics. Sure, the PS2 is ancient, but still, the second game looked smoother than this. Also for some, the \"stylish crazy action\" may be a little over the top, as cut scenes have Dante doing things and saying things that are so over the top, crazy and insaine, they may make you cringe (think Neo meets Shinobi). Now... the game's largest downfall... the difficulty. Don't worry, the game is not too easy like the second game, but rather too hard. The first game was insainly difficult for newbies, but it offered fair challenge. This game is equally as hard, but crosses the line between changeling and cheep by throwing wave after wave of fast moving, strong enemies that have an extreme advantage over you. The funky camera doesn't help either... although mysteriously, the camera seems only to have awkward angles in the begining half of the game. Sure... just like the first game, there is an easy mode, but there is very little difference between easy and normal, as both are just as frusterating. Don't let this steer you away however, as you can now revisit past levels at any time to level up your abilities and collect more currency to purchase power ups (believe me... your gonna' need 'em)and the game is still one hell of a ride. Some of the most intense and visceral combat ever witnessed by human kind is locked inside this game. Once the game sucks you in, you will have very little problem looking past the flaws the game has. more or less, the game follows in the footsteps of the original while offering enough changes to make it different and memorable in it's own right. just expect to be cussing and swearing at the game as much as you love it.  If you have the spare cash however, I highly recomend it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2005"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission. Train and equip your team to survive insurmountable odds.Explore the Galaxy- Scan planets to uncover unique secret missions in theMass Effectuniverse.Integration with OriginalMass Effect- Players of the firstMass Effectcan import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

In ME2 when you scan a particular planet and you find a transmission or if its a planet that you know a mission is located on, you are dropped right in that spot and I don't like that.  I wish Bioware would stop listening to a few whiny nerds and bring planet exploration back from ME1.  Bring back a better version of the buggy and let me drive around and blast things and also get rid of that TERRIBLE, GOD AWFUL way of finding resources on planets.  They made it into sort of a mini-game that is boring and a complete waste of my time.  Also, get rid of the ammo for god's sakes that's one of things that made ME unique, although combat has been improved with better cover system and and the heavy weapons so it kinda makes up for some flaws but hopefully I will at least get my buggy back for ME3 and resource scan/probe crap taken out or I won't be buying it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2010"}

And that's vaguely satisfying.MoH:The Rising Sun is a terrible game stemming from what seemed like a great Idea, I mean it looks so awesome on the commercials, but it really isn't that great, MoH:RS (Rising Sun) is very short, only a couple of missions.The graphics are maybe a little better than they were in Frontline but not noticable to the untrained eye.Really MoH:RS had loads and LOADS of potential, but it was put out onto the market not only too early, but too expensively, I mean the game is just a little bit longer than a demo for SOCOM or MA:GitS, its a terrible game, that seems like there was barely any effort put into it.RENT this game if you are interrested, but as a warning, it's not really worth the rental money. In summary MoH:RS is a great concept carried out terribly and severely poorly made, this game was a waiste of time and money to the producers, and a waiste of money to you and, if it was long enough, a waiste of time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2003"}

Like Pharoh and Caesar III, this is a game ofdesigning buildings and walkways to keep your people happy. In this case the people are not residents, although with some staying in your park for 60 days or more, you have to wonder where they are sleeping! And, like all games, you start with rather easy missions and work your way forward.You begin by planning walkways that make sense for your visitors, and putting down inexpensive but entertaining rides. Each visitor has his or her own sense of what's fun - something exciting, something laid back, something truly wild or something mild. You need to set up food, drink and restrooms, and put out benches and trashcans. You hire repairmen, sweepers, entertainers, and security folk. Vandalism can strike, and rides can break down.The game, once set up well, can almost run itself. Your various minions roam around your park, cleaning and fixing items. You earn money based on quite a few variables - how much you charge at the gate, how much you charge for food, how much you charge for each ride. Rain comes and visitors are now buying umbrellas, and avoiding the open rides. Marketing campaigns can help your draw, although coupons might affect profits short-term.There are great graphs to help you manage the economics of your strategy, and the graphics themselves are quite fun! The merry-go-round spins, the roller-coaster cars fill with little people and go around the tracks. You can customize colors, add statuary, research new theme decorations like Egyptian and Roman buildings. You can raise and lower terrain, building raised walkways and underground roller coaster tunnels.The game will run quite well on a low-end system, which can't be said for its rival, SimThemePark. It's easy to use, and quite satisfying to play. You can name the park, name each ride, and even name each individual visitor! It's easy to get attached to your creation, and sit for hours tweaking it.The game was entertaining both for me and for my 11 year old son. We both found the options varied and fun. My son especially enjoyed when you accidentially cranked a roller-coaster's speed up too high - the practice run would set the cars careening off the track, warning you to decrease the speed a bit!Our only complaint has to do with item placement - if you raise and then lower a piece of land, it double-charges you for each phase of the change. There isn't really an undo feature, so if you make a mistake (which can be easy, sometimes) there is no simple way to just go back to your previous state. With blocks of land easily hid behind other blocks (despite their many view options), you often have to lower whole regions of land simply to &quot;get to&quot; the blocked one, wasting hundreds of dollars.Also, with no 'fast forward', you often have to go eat dinner or watch a movie before your park, which has met the 'winning criteria', finally gets through the years required for the trophy. It'll run itself all the while, but it can get quite tedious.With that small amount of inconvenience, however, this is a great game for computer users of all ages, and with the varied terrains available, one able to always offer a new challenge!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2000"}

Will it feel like its predecessor is not as difficult to grasp as World at War.I think about the multi is said to be better, balanced.The same feeling of using any weapon but feeling that much of the strength of the balance is the only good weapon *I'm sorry*.(I think there will be minor fixes and patches in the future)Significant players are waiting Tessuru angle, etc. There is also a weakening of the ghost and that release of 55.Ru potato potato with people, people who are attacked but attack.I'm speaking in favor of those who are waiting for so Tessuru making of maps that are finely branched, such as doorways and passages of the building advantageous,,,,It is a feeling that can not be released because the corner waiting to rely ghost players this time will not increase to a weakening in the previous level.Is in relation to the severity of the usual lag.I think Japanese do not change much even out.I honestly can not win even if the line is bad and do so on what team you are taking the line that wins.It is done in the development of depression after 1-2 would have shed away from 5-6.There are also quite lose to sub-machine gun shoot at considerable distance.I think easy compatibility out of line, but only good bad BO COD series is to play through the series I do not know what will be better in the patch.Is also a problem with the patch that was delivered today, but now you can play normally server problems from the day after the release date is fixed.I do not go in and maybe there was that anti-freeze is also included.Here is the part of the previous issues and bad bitches products.Freeze occurs several times in a day after purchase Release Date.

I've never been big on online multiplayer, but I have dabbled in it with Warhawk and Resistance.  That being said, I think UT3 is helping me become more and more interested in this weird online craze.  UT3 is quite astonishing to look at.  The environments are beautiful and the textures look about the same as Uncharted and Gears.  I would say the graphics are about the same as Gears of War (made by the same developers).  The ability to get into a match sometimes takes a while (10 to 20 seconds for me), but if that's fast enough for you then great.  The single player campaign is rather weak.  There really isn't much of a substantial story, but rather it's more practice for the main event, online multiplayer.  This is where UT3 shines.  The action is fast and frenetic.  The weapons (both primary and secondary fire) are satisfying.  I experienced some lag until I fully installed the game on my PS3 (you can either fully install or play from the disc).  After installation, everything was smooth sailing.  I enjoyed the ability to fully customize my character's appearance (boots, chest plate, helmet, you name it).  I'm giving this game 4 stars mainly due to its weak single player campaign.  That's my favorite part of FPS's, so I was a little disappointed in UT3's campaign.  All in all, it's a great game.  It looks and runs great.  Do yourself a favor and experience it on a PS3 if you haven't already picked one up (and no, I don't work for Sony).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2007"}

I got the collector's edition, as I was chomping at the bit to finally play this game ever since I first heard about it in 2006. Like most collector's editions, the extra material isn't really worth the trouble, but that's par for the course with most games. I later got the first downloadable pack when it became available during the summer and the second when it released a few months ago. I've cleared the game's full gambit of achievements, part of which involved finding stuff (damn you, thermoses!) listening to radio and tv shows, shooting piles of tin cans and of course, manuscript pages. I've gone from one side of the Dark Presence to the other and back again to help the eponymous character regain his fractured sanity and face the demons that he created for himself.You'll probably notice that I don't focus a lot of time on the graphics, sound and controls; my main emphasis is on the story and the characters. There's a reason for that. Even if I didn't already believe that story and characters are the most important aspects of a video game after gameplay, Alan Wake is story-driven game. If the story falls flat, it doesn't have the crazy, over-the-top gameplay Gears 2 has to fall back on. Nor does it have the branching gameplay decisions that you'd have with a Fable or Mass Effect game. It's  a very linear game; you go from point A to B to C to D and the game will pretty much play the same way out each time. Perhaps worst of all, it doesn't have a lot of replay value (more on that later.)  So, without the story, it's really not much of a game.So how was it? We all know how the game didn't sell too well, but was it good?It's best for me to get what I don't like out of the way first. Like with a lot of games, it's short. Even when taking into consideration the amount of time it took to collect everything and the few extra hours the DLC packs added, Alan Wake is a short game. It's also not a very difficult one, even on the hardest mode. The mechanics for the game are very simple. You're going through the dark, and you need light. This works out in many interesting ways for the puzzles you come across (especially in the DLC packs) but fights are pretty similar to one another. Point your flashlight, wait for the darkness to burn away, shoot the enemy, dodge the attack from the other enemy, point your flashlight at him, pop a battery or two in, and you're good. Once you have these basics down, there aren't too many encounters that will prove difficult. And you probably already know about Verizon. It was bad enough that they had billboards, but an actual achievement to watch a Verizon commercial? Seriously guys? Also, the second chapter could've really used a start point after the scene with Mott, given the number of collectibles in that part of the chapter. And the third chapter was long. Really, really, really long. More than once I found myself saying \"Are you effing kidding me?\" as it became obvious that I *still* wasn't done with that chapter. Yeah, the game as a whole is short, but this chapter went on a little bit too long, especially since the latter half of said chapter had very little story development. Fortunately, when you do get past the third chapter, that's when the story starts to pick up. Ultimately, though, once you've collected everything, there's little to come back to, as, again, the game is so very linear.Remedy was clever when it came to roping in us completionists, as some of the manuscript pages can only be found on the hardest mode of difficulty, and this can only be unlocked after playing through the game on one of the two easier modes at least once from start to finish. There is no shortage of people who criticize one of the plot twists towards the end of the game. I would ask that those critics play through the DLC packs, as a dialogue in the second makes it clear that there's more to that twist than what meets the eye, which ties in with the fact that Remedy from day 1 has said that there's a larger story than just the one game. The story itself is a very unique video game story, and the voice acting is very good. Alan himself is a conflicted man who wants to do the right thing and loves his wife, but fights his temper, alcoholism, fatalism, depression, insomnia, self-loathing, fits of rage and just in general being a bit of a donkey. His wife is on her last nerve trying to find someway to get Alan to snap out of his rut and return to being the man she married, which leads to them going to Bright Falls. I enjoyed listening to him narrate his story as he fights against the darkness as well as his own personal demons. As he's a writer, he's used to getting in the heads of his characters, figuring out what makes them tick. Now, he's the character in his own story and he's got to find a way to finish it.The stock game ends on a cliffhanger which has polarized the gaming community. I personally liked it, and to those who don't, I also suggest playing the DLC, as the story truly finishes. You can complain all you want about Remedy \"forcing\" you to pay to get the real ending, but let's not forget these facts:1) Remedy is a business. They're not your spouse, your friend or family member. Remedy is a business, and businesses are in it to make money. This notion that you've somehow been \"betrayed\" by them because they want a little more money for the fruits of their labor is far more asinine than Wake could ever hope to be.2) We have at least one thing in common; you didn't make the game. Nor did you put any of your time, money and energy into it; instead, you're enjoying the finished product that other people, not you, made.3) You're *not* being forced to pay for it; either don't buy it, or find a friend who did buy it and play it on their system.4) Finally, it's really not that expensive, anyway. Especially if you got that token that let you get the first pack for free.The DLC is truly bizarre. The stock game takes place in the real world (even though there isn't an actual Bright Falls) and many references to the real world are made. Alan, his wife Alice and best friend/agent Barry are New Yorkers through and through. Stephen King is mentioned in the opening scene. There are also references to The Shining, other authors like Dan Brown, James Elroy and HP Lovecraft, etc. The DLC, on the other hand is in this weird zone known as the Dark Place, and reality there is as steadfast, reliable and reproducible as that of a dream. It's always shifting around, and the further Alan goes into it, the more bizarre it becomes. Early on in the first pack, Alan finds a page, but reading it doesn't net the same result as one of the real pages in the real world does. Instead of reading a clear, coherent page, Alan hears himself saying disjointed, seemingly random fragments. This is to be expected to some extent, though, because the Dark Place is presented as a dream-like realm, and the part of the brain that you use to read is shut off while you're asleep. It also gives what is - from that point on - the main gameplay mechanic (aside from the light/dark aspect) the proper introduction it deserves. While introduced at the end of the main game, the whole concept of shining the light at a word to have it create and/or do something comes to the fore here, and this is where the interesting light/dark puzzles come into play. That's not to say that they're complex; it doesn't take a whole lot to work out how to move forward. But they are interesting and I look forward to seeing what else Remedy can do.Ultimately, Alan Wake ends on a high note. The main game and especially the first DLC pack end on low notes, but the end to the second pack is very satisfying. Alan's journey isn't over; far from it, but he is bound and determined to do what he must to survive and rejoin Alice's side. He now knows just how far he fell from being the man he once was. He's been at rock bottom and is now going to use that rock to stand back up so that he can climb out of the hole he's dug for himself.Humor is sprinkled in rather well here. Most of it comes from Barry. He has a monologue that simply cannot be missed in the latter part of the game, and I nearly peed when I saw him after he left the general store to met up with Alan and the sheriff. There's a line not long after this that Alan gives that's also great.Graphically, the game has a very unique feel to it. This is definitely a Remedy game. The shaking of the trees, the darkness looming, the active cameraman, all of comes together quite well. And I couldn't help but love how towards the end we see the actor who provided Wake's likeness on a mock TV show; thought that was a nice touch. The soundtrack is simply amazing. My favorite song is War by Poets of the Fall, who also provided the music for the game's fictional band. There's even a radio broadcast that pokes a little fun at this. I get goosebumps every time I hear that song. The controls are pretty easy and straightforward; the only thing that takes a little getting used to is the fact that Alan couldn't do a marathon to save his life. He can run for a little bit but gets winded easily. But as long as you shine the light on your pursuers before taking off again, they'll get stunned for a moment, giving you a window of time to get closer towards the light.So all in all, I don't regret purchasing this game and should Remedy proceed with the sequel I'll probably get the limited edition of that too. I know, I'm a glutton for punishment; what can I say? So give it a rental, it's a real love it or hate it kind of game. Now, if you're excuse me, I have some more thermoses to find.....","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2010"}

Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Much more repetitive than it should be","reviewText":"I'm disappointed in this game. I think it's repetitive and difficult, but it looks as though I am in the minority as nearly all the other reviews I can see are raving about it. This third game in the Onimusha series seems to me to be the least developed in regards to it's story. The first two games had me really interested in Samunouske (or the bloke in the second one) and the war they were raging against evil Nobunaga, but this time round I just don't care. The time travel plot seems completely arbitrary, it's just a way to spice up the game with a new location (Paris) and have dual characters. Where or whoever you happen to be in the game though, there's basically very little to do except hack and slash at everything you see until they are all dead and then move onto the next area. In my opinion this makes it little more than a progressive beat-em-up...at one point in the Paris sewers, I was almost convinced I was playing Zombie Revenge! OK, it is a little more sophisticated than that, but the core gameplay is seriously one dimensional.It's also pretty unforgiving as far as control goes, and I started to get really hacked off around the time I reached Mont Saint Michel. The enemies are pretty good fighters and clearing a room of 10 or so can be a tough job. It's made harder and more frustrating by a fixed camera, which can make you lose your sense of who you are aiming at, and a poor auto-target system that makes the character turn to face an enemy that may sometimes NOT be the one you intended to take a swing at, so that on some occasions I went into my attack pattern facing thin air while the enemy I had intended to hit had plenty of time to come up and paste me from behind. The scenery also has the annoying habit of having invisible boundaries that cause you to get stuck in \"corners\" you can't see, which can mean you promptly end up on the floor. The recovery control for getting up after a fall is also awful.I haven't even got started on training mode yet. This little mini game seems fun at first but I completely failed to understansd critical evades, deflect attack critical hits, and some kind of ten-string critical chain attack that I have never even seen. The timing and on-screen prompts for these attacks working are non-existant as far as I'm concerned. I can't master any of them, and am now wondering whether it is worth trying to finish the game if my characters have no advanced skills to help them!  Being able to jump would be a godsend, but despite the complex attack combos created, this simple option was completely ignored.All this of course may be just a cover-up for the fact that I am not very good at this game. It's probably partly true, but I never liked beat-em-ups, where it's all about timing and lightning-fast accurate button sequences, and I didn't think I had bought one with this game. But now I'm starting to think that I have. All the important critical attacks are probably required to get the most fun out of this game, but they are all escaping me totally and I'm stuck swinging my weapons around like a crazed loon, which as any seasoned player will tell you, is not going to get you much further than the easiest stages. If I cared a little for the story, I might try harder, but I don't. The characters are all very shallow...they all play the same, just kitted out with different weapons.The game does look great, although as usual the play areas are conveniently defined by silly little conventions that stop you from straying outside the required street or patch of land, most notably those lame little boundaries around the Arc de Triomphe. The opening CGI movie is breathtaking, very realistic. The music is also ok, but Jacques, his son Henri and Michelle all get their native French tongues replaced with\"Hollywood blockbuster\" American accents once they meet Samunouske, and the fairy helper Ako grants that they must all be allowed to understand each other, and this really grated on me.Sorry to be a fly in the ointment, but I'm really bored of this game. Whacking dozens and dozens of constantly re-spawning demons is making my thumbs sore, and the gorgeous graphics are not doing enough to bring me back to this for much longer.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2005"}

Of course, some enemies return and Samonosuke returns as well. Also, the game now features two main characters with the ogre gauntlet.Basically there is a rip in time, and genma have traveled 500 years into the future, into Paris. Samonosuke gets sent to Paris, while Jean Reno gets sent to Japan.Visually, the game is stunning. The graphics are great and the cinematics are probably the best ive ever seen. The game also features that really cool whip of Jeans and his gun.The combat is basically the same. Samonosuke has pretty much the same style of combat as always, but with some new swords. The new combat stuff is Jean Reno's whip and gun. Jean can whip his opponents and throw them. He can also shoot them but he can't do that from far away. He has to shoot them on the ground or grab them first. This is still cool and makes the combat more fun. They also kept those really cool white counter slashes. The first boss is fun because Samonosuke can slash the room up and the environment looks spectacular. Also, like the other Onimusha games, the heroes get help from NPC's which are relatively good at fighting.The story is pretty good. The interesting part is how the past affects the future. You can travel through time to distribute items or when you successfully changed the past. This system works well and is fun to use.The game is pretty much like the other two games. It isn't really creepy anymore, and there are less of those \"Find the key!\" puzzles. It is more of a hack and slash but doesn't have that town thing like Onimusha 2 did. This is still good. In fact, the game resembles MGS2 at times with the constant cinematics. They rock though so it's fine.The only bad part about the game is the downshift in creepiness. I was expecting to go through a tight corridor mansion slashing monsters and such, but now it is more slash- away fighting. The other bad part is near the begginning of the game, Jean's voice changes. He no longer speaks French and all-of-a-sudden has a completely new voice actor. You will probably say, \"This is retarded\". It is, because Jean's voice rocked, but just near the begginning they completely changed it. It is kind of annoying because the new voice doesn't sound like Jean.Still, the game has some specials for completing it. It also kept those cool white counter slashes which let you decimate foes. I would reccomend purchasing this game if you enjoyed the other two. 4 stars!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2004"}

Great you get to fly around on dragons right? Well yes you get to do that, but let me tell you the frustration this game brings will make you want to eat your PS3 controller. Lair is a pretty game, the graphics are quite good, though they are a bit buggy at times, as in you end up inside of mountainsides or halfway into objects and the like, however I can live with that, for the most part the game is pretty to look at. The music of this game is amazing, it has that dramatic, inspirational score that you would expect from a high fantasy type story. The problem with this game is all in the control.Now most of Lair's game play is done on top of your dragon. The story is a rather typical fantasy storyline, you have a good king, a evil advisor, lots of dragons and brave warriors. Note when I say typical here I do not mean bad, the storyline is actually quite good, I would say it is this game's redeeming feature. Often when me and my hubby was playing and we wanted to just smash the game and the PS3 because of the idiotic controls it was the involving storyline that made us want to continue playing. What I mean with typical is that it is rather clich&eacute;, however there is a reason why some concepts have become clich&eacute; in the first place they then to work. Expect nothing new from this story, but if you like high fantasy then I think you will non the less enjoy the storyline in Lair. Anyway back to the controls, most of the game your character, a brave soldier fly around on his powerful dragon trying to save his nation and his king. Now the way flying is done is with the Sixaxis controller, this is the only way to control your dragon which means the game responds to the movement you make with the controller.Lair attempts to be a flight simulator of sorts, and it is obvious that allot of time and energy went into creating the game's physics, your dragon feel like if it has weight and using the motion controller is a neat concept for a dragon flight simulator. However here is the rub it just do not work well enough. Sometimes the dragon reacts wrong to the way you move the controller and fly all over the place and that other times it reacts to slowly. This get annoying when you on some levels need precision flying or when you die for the umpteenth time because of bugs in the controls.Lair is a mixed bag. The controls are awful and the game is so frustrating you want to scram at times, however when the controls works the game is fun and it have a good storyline and nice environments to make up for some of the frustration. I still think Lair is a good game based on the graphics, storyline and music, but the controls nearly ruins it and takes it from what would have been a top notch fantasy game to a two and a half stars passable one. Or in other words, everything is good about this game except for the actual game play.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B002I0K780","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason","summary":"Great Sequel but Lacking in Great, Robust, Challenging Platforming like the First LBP","reviewText":"The sequel to LittleBig Planet goes in some great new directions, but has left behind what made me fall in love with LBP in the first place. LittleBig Planet was an innovative side-scrolling platforming game that was whimsical, fun, great co-op and on top of it all, allowed you to be creative designing levels from numerous shapes, textures, stickers with motors and ropes and all sorts of things you could dream up.LittleBig Planet 2 seeks to continue the legacy that LittleBig Planet started in a play, create, share policy.  I hoped that LBP2 would be bigger, better, prettier, more robust and more fun than Little Big Planet.  The makers at Media Molecule behind the LittleBig Planet universe did numerous things to improve the franchise.This time around there's a storyline behind Sackboy's universe.  This gives him a reason to traverse the various planets of the LittleBig Planet universe.  There are cut-scenes and some very interesting characters along the way to meet in your journey.  These add to the story mode but while the story is interesting it's not reason enough alone to play LittleBig Planet 2.My biggest gripe here was that the levels themselves weren't as interesting or inventive story-wise as Little Big Planet, it's hard not to compare the sequel to its' predecessor and it really did have a lot to live up to.  I was hoping the story levels would be bigger and better, but all-in-all I think they're not as good.However, everything else is better and more.  There are more things you can use in Little Big Planet 2.  There's a grappling hook, there's the creatinator, the grabinator and several other one-at-a-time powerups similar to the paintinator released in dlc in the Metal Gear pack.  These things increase the options of things Sackboy can do in the LittleBig universe.  Then of course there's the controlinator allowing creators to design games that aren't even plat-formers or side scrolling.There's a downside to all these changes as much of what LittleBig Planet was seems to be left behind in favor of newer and different fronts.  I commend the people at Media Molecule for their efforts, but it seems they wanted to make the story-mode of LittleBig Planet 2 a showcase for what could be done with these new directions where the game can be taken.  They're fun diversions but ultimately at the end of the day I felt the main storyline wasn't as robust and interesting as the levels found in the story in the first LittleBig Planet.In every way the creation suite in LBP2 is much superior to that found in LBP though I found it more complicated and and also more confusing though the tutorials were more accessible, I still found myself at a loss of what I could use the various tools for to accomplish various goals of \"real life\" applications to show what could actually be done in the level maker.The community level sorting is truly much better than the first.  In many ways many parts of how this game works are much better than the first, menus, everything is much slicker and the creation area is more thought out as well, I just wish they had made the stroy modes as great as the first LBP.All-in-all, I would recommend LittleBig Planet 2, but don't expect the story-mode to be as full or robust with interesting puzzles and levels as found in the first LittleBig Planet, and while LBP2 goes in some great new directions, what it has left behind is what made me fall in love with LBP in the first place. Which makes LBP2 not as good of a stand-alone game but more of an add on to the original.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2011"}

GTA online isn't even that fun and is completely ruined by microtransations. Not only that but, it's to glitchy and gets boring and repetive after very fast. Rockstar purposely made it soo difficult to earn money on your own in the game that your forced to spend $10 for 500,000 in game or $20 for 1.2 million. I will never understand how there's any value in spending real hard-earned money on stupid virtual cash,...because there is no value, it's not something you can touch, feel, look at, it's in a game! Basically you have to grind so hard and you still end up being broke ALL THE TIME because there's so much to buy and everything is so expensive in the game. I've already spent $60 alone for in game money and that's AFTER buying the game itself for $60. It pisses me off how they've made so much money off of this game, yet they still want more! wtf! For that reason alone there's no way i can give this game more than one star..I'm the biggest GTA fan and expected the enjoyment of this game to last much longer but it just hasn't. You can't even buy houses in story mode and online you can only buy boring apartenments that all have the same interiors. GTA online seems unfinished to me and they could've made way more things to do and buildings to go into. Plus the loading times are aganizing!!

{"product_name":"B000HE9LL8","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Simple, silly but at times a pain in the...","reviewText":"Despite Nintendo's past ill-conceived ideas such as sticking with cartridges over CD format for their Nintendo 64, promoting GBA-Gamecube Connectivity over Online, now and then they nail it on the head and shows why they don't just pump out similar titles like everyone else. With the DS's touch screen, many unique concepts over the years have popped up. Some seem tacked-on such as Dawn of Sorrow's or just simple menu displays but on occasion, a game exclusively features it. Elite Beat Agents is surprisingly addictive when you feel like the song is at least a little in your head, other times it can get frustrating easily.Story: It's a kooky story so don't expect nothing fancy. 3 Agents decide to save people's problems through music so we have little vignettes ranging from saving a babysitter from crazy kids to a washed-up ballplayer getting his groove back to stuck-up celebrity sisters stranded on an island.Graphics: Very nice indeed. The entire thing has a very comic book feel and presentation and visuals are nicely done. It shines during its story scenes where it's quite animated and fluid. Your main play area isn't really nothing to write home about but that wasn't the point of them anyway.Sound/Music: Of course it's entirely music driven so it's good audio quality considering DS's tiny speakers and whatnot. There's several voice clips like when a story character needs help, they actually scream \"help!\" while your commander yells \"Agents are...GO!\". My one complaint is that while easily identifiable songs allow easy knowledge of beats, some songs you've never heard before might make it difficult to follow long since you can barely hear it.Gameplay: Similar in a way to PaRappa the Rapper or San Andreas' music minigame except this time the button presses have to be tapped. Circles appear on the 2nd screen which have to be tapped at a certain point and thanks to a shrinking halo, you tap when that one meets the main circle. The circles are numbered so you know the timing and color coordinated so you don't tap any circle that pops up. Some circles have to be dragged, keeping your stylus on the ball that travels in a line. These are all pretty fun and easy to get into but sometimes it's hard to tell when you should make your move for the next circle since some come immediately after rather than a bit of a breathing room.Using licensed songs, some seem note perfect(pun intended) for the rhythm-based game such as YMCA and even of all songs, Sk8er Boi, yes that one. Others though I've never even heard of which makes it difficult to know your timing, especially when you have to double-tap circles or quickly drag the stylus. One particular song was so all over the place I lost the mission easily, not because of poor gameplay but because of lack of familiarity with the song. Something like Another Brick in the Wall Part II or, would've been expensive but movie themes like Star Wars. Some though are quite good such as a cover of Chicago's \"You're My Inspiration\" which comes with a surprisingly touching story involving a girl and her father.Song choices iffy? Yep but is it fun and addictive? Holy crap is it ever. It's not quite as pain in the *** as Trauma Center but there can and will be trouble spots but the desire to beat that stage is always there which is quite something.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2007"}

{"product_name":"B000LSJKAM","reviewerName":"Nightmare","summary":"Enjoyable for single or multiplayer","reviewText":"This is the first Mario Party game I have played since the original, and it's the first that I owned.  Coming into it I knew what to expect for the most part, but I didn't know how things had changed over the course of the previous 7 titles.  After playing this game for many hours over a few weeks, I must say that I am not disappointed.The board game aspect of Mario Party 8 is the biggest draw, IMO (but if you don't want to play boardgame style you can choose to play without the board in a few other modes that are pretty cool).  There are six different boards to play on (five available from the start), and each one offers a unique take on the ultimate goal--gaining the most power stars in the alotted number of turns.  One is pretty basic with multiple paths to choose from as you head towards the star (after spending 20 coins for the star it appears somewhere else on the board).  Another involves making the most laps down a single-path board that ultimately leads to a free star.  One of my favorites involves investing money in hotels that provide stars to the player who has invested the most coins.  In other words, the variety of boards is very satisfying.Minigames are played at the end of each round (after all four players have taken a turn).  It could be a 4 player free for all, 3 vs. 1, 2 vs. 2 (the winner(s) of any of these earns coins), or a battle minigame in which players pool a certain amount of money in and compete for the lion's share.  You can play each board as teams if you wish, which is great if there's a poor loser in your family.;)  There is also a VS. mode where only two players compete, but it's not that interesting because you rarely participate in any minigames since you must land on a specific type of square to initiate them.There is a \"story\" mode (although there's not really a story to speak of) for one player, but it's a series of VS matches which gets kind tiring.Minigames come in a large variety.  Some are played by pointing/shooting, tilting the remote, shaking the remote, holding it side ways like a standard controller, and a few others.  The motion controls work flawlessly, and are used to make some pretty neat minigames.  Sometimes I just decide on some I want to play and go to the Minigame Tent to play them individually.Replay value excels in Mario Party 8.  You can play different boards for variety, have some friends over to spice things up, and each play through is always different.  You never know what's going to happen.The only real negative I have is that some minigames require pure luck.  They are rare, but they can be the most important.  But luck is a part of a board game anyway, so that's really not a game breaker.Overall, I highly recommend this game if you enjoy board games, playing with friends/family, or love minigames.  This 22 year old gamer is very pleased.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0049DYNNO","description":"","reviewerName":"GarionOrb","summary":"Pieces of gaming history...is it worth it?","reviewText":"YES IT IS!  Super Mario All-Stars was a love letter to fans of the first three Super Mario games back in 1993.  At the time, it was a great experience to play these three beloved games (and the Japan-only first sequel) with updated graphics and sound for the Super NES.  Is that the case now?  Well, I think it is.  What you get here is nothing more than the SNES game put on disc.  No changes or updating have been made at all.  That's not a bad thing, however.  This is, after all, a commemorative limited edition package, and for the thirty-dollar price it's really not a bad deal.  Think of it like this.  All four of the included games are available on the Virtual Console service in their original 8-bit NES glory.  The first three US releases (Super Mario Bros. 1-3) are $5 each while the Japanese \"Lost Levels\" game is $8.  That's $23 total.  For only seven dollars more, you're getting better graphics, a CD soundtrack and a commemorative book.  Plus, you don't have to worry about the games taking up valuable space on the Wii's memory.  To me, that's worth the price of admission.  Now I've read a lot of negative reviews on here, and they stem from the expectation that because it's released on disc that it must be a \"new\" version.  I can totally understand the disappointment, but it's really no big deal.  If this game had been released on the Virtual Console as well, no one would have any qualms about it.  The truth is that this was released solely as a celebration of 25 years of Super Mario Bros. and nothing more.Now, onto the game itself.  As I said, it's an exact port of the SNES game.  All four titles are presented in their original 4:3 aspect ratio, but unlike Virtual Console games they run in a 16:9 format.  That is, you don't have to manually adjust your TV to make the games look undistorted...the game adds black bars to the left and right of the game image.  This was a very welcome to me, as I was fully prepared to have to mess with my TV settings to play the games correctly.  The graphics are certainly better than on the NES, but they're still 16-bit so they'll look a bit blocky on HDTV's, but in no way do they look bad.  You can save each game at any time, and you can control the games with the Wii Remote, Classic Controller and GameCube controller.  Speaking of control, the reason I gave this game 4 stars is because of the slight lag introduced by the Wii's wireless controllers.  For the most part, it's no big deal, but when trying to time jumps precisely it's very noticable.  Later levels are a bit more difficult than they should be, especially in the Lost Levels game.  Other than that, they're the same games we all know and love.This is a nice little package at a reasonable price considering what you get.  Purists may want to just stick with the 8-bit versions available for download, but for newer gamers and fans of the Super Mario Bros. games, this is a great way to keep the spirit of these classic games alive!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2010"}

It really feels like you're in the movie and inside a computer. Everything is bright and highly detailed and look exactly like the movie. The only people who'll really feel and appreciate the detail in the game are people who know a lot about computers. There are many terms and words that refer to more advanced computer users, me being one of them, so I understood everything. When you first start the game you feel really giddy and it's just so cool playing this game! Monolith did a great job with the number of weapons and their design. The weapons look really slick and the \"subroutine system\" that is here is effective and nicely done.You can find \"archive bins\" throughout the game that store permissions (which grant you access to move further in the game), subroutines, and emails that you can read that give you updates on what's going on outside the computer. The subroutine system is cut into 3 categories: Defense, Weapons, Utilities. You place them in a ring and every time you enter a new level you have different \"memory requirements\" which means you can equip more or less. You can also upgrade your subroutines through optimizers you can find which upgrade it from Alpha to Beta to Gold. Upgrading each step makes subroutines more powerful and take up less room. You can also upgrade yourself through a basic RPG type style. Then you have energy which weapons consume and so does downloading things.Now all this in theory sounds great but this game just wasn't thought through all the way. Even though weapons consume energy they take too much so you're just left with your weaker disc all the time. The makes battling many enemies and bosses annoying since you're constantly dodging and restarting the level. Speaking of restarting there are NO checkpoints anywhere and you have to CONSTANTLY quick save every step you take. The story is also somewhat confusing and the dialogue can be a bit cheesy at times. There aren't enough enemy types in the game, and the boss fights are all same. Micromanaging your subroutines is also annoying when they get infected while fighting off the Corruption. You have to manually disinfect them and it takes forever if you are badly infected.Now the errors and flaws are tollerable but they do get old near the end of the game. Speaking of that there are some bugs in this game that cause it to crash a lot near th end and as a result I couldn't finish the game (due to me quick saving right when it crashed so every time it loaded it reloaded the crash.) I also have to mention the Light Cycle races and they are few and shallow. There are 3 races in the whole game and even though you have power ups and all that its hard to get them and the races end too quickly. Half the time I wound up just moving around the grid until everyone killed themselves off so I could move on.This whole game feels really neat in the beginning but near the end you just wish it would hurry up and end. I didn't get a chance with online play since no one was on but I'm pretty sure it would have been neat. If you want a snazzy looking FPS experience then go for Tron 2.0 you will walk away pretty happy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

Additionally, a host of brand-new elements have been seamlessly merged with the original game, providing unexpected surprises for longtime fans. With new dungeons, new job classes, and other exciting features, both old-school players and newcomers can enjoy this genre-defining Final Fantasy title in a portable format!","reviewerName":"Stephen J. White \"Dragnilar\"","summary":"Arguablly the \"deepest\" SNES RPG ever made","reviewText":"FF6 Advance is an enhanced re-release of what some people may remember as FF3 for the Super Nintendo (circa 1995.) The enhanced part of the re-release is a slightly remixed soundtrack and some additional content in the form of new items and one humongous dungeon to explore. Also, the game's script has been re-translated so that it \"matches\" the style of contemporary Final Fantasy games in terms of spell and item names, and also clears up some of the vague confusions in the FF3 translation.As for the game itself, in terms of approaching it from a non-comparison perspective, it is hard to give this game a low rating. Unless the player has a keen hatred for 2D graphics and \"sprites\", there is little that FF6 Advance has going against it. In the graphics department, the game has probably the most polished looking graphics that the Super Nintendo could handle during its days of glory. As a testament to this, the game features hardly any graphical tweaking, and virtually none of the game's sprites have been redrawn. The game also features a very good story with quite a few interesting twists, a large world with plenty of places to explore and discover and over 10 characters to utilize in your quest to defeat evil.As with most RPG games, FF6A relies heavily upon its combat engine. The engine is a little more complex than most SNES combat engines mainly thanks to the fact that all characters in the game have their own specific skill, and for the most part, specific function in combat. The game however manages to blur the characters when it comes to the utilization of magic spells. Spells are learned about 1/3rd of the way into the game by equipping magic stones, which subsequently bestow magic upon their wearers by earning a 100 AP (acquisition points) in combat. Acquisition of said spells will differ greatly upon the amount of AP an enemy leaves behind when killed and also upon the multiplier that the magic stone has on it. This ultimately means that much of the game can be spent leveling and building your characters up into massive magically powered slaughter machines! However, this also means for people who played the original FF3/6, one of the games biggest exploits hasn't been dealt with by the re-release. Going into the details of this exploit is a little off the beaten path, but to summarize it: With a little attention to getting all characters to learn magic, the game begins virtually a cakewalk due to the sheer factor of powerful magic spells and magic enhancing items available in the game.Still, game play does not have to rely solely upon magic, and players can use physical fighters or whatever else they prefer as they play FF6A. Thanks to the number of party members available, creative players can come up with all sorts of adventure teams!The game does rely upon having a good story (but ultimately still falls back on combat). The storyline of FF6 is one not to be missed if someone is at all interested in RPG games. It has many conventions that have been copied or innovated upon many times since its inception. It is a tale slightly reminiscent of the types of Star Wars, with an oppressive Empire seeking total domination, and the only thing able to stand against it being a small resistance army. The similarities between the two however stop as the game progresses. In fact, many could play the game without ever picking up upon the similarity between the two. Amusingly enough, there are also a couple references to Star Wars in the game, but it is better for the player to find them than have them spoiled.The soundtrack of the game is also another fine showing of what the Super Nintendo was capable of. And while the soundtrack has been remixed (if one were to listen to the soundtrack of the original side-by-side the \"Advance\" version), most of the remixing has only been done to accommodate for the smaller sound output inside of the GBA/DS rather than to \"bring the game up to date.\" The soundtrack features some of the most prophetic, moving and eccentric songs of the 16-bit era. It is VERY diverse and it will surprise players with all of which it holds when they think they've heard every single song the game has to offer.Finally, touching upon some of the other \"enhancements\" in the game and how well they'll hold up for people familiar with the game and newcomers alike:-The new bonus dungeon in the game features almost a days worth of content to explore, and far more complex puzzles than in any of the other dungeons of the game. It also features arguably some of the hardest bosses in the game!-There are a plethora of new items, almost all of which are available in the new bonus dungeon. Some of them can be outdone by the items obtainable prior to entering the dungeon, but that's most likely only going to happen if the player is aware of some of the game's exploits.-The original version of the game has had quite a few bug fixes. While there are still some bugs still in the game, the fixed ones will bring a lot of relief to people who might have been frustrated when they played the Super Nintendo version. Newcomers will probably find this to be the least interesting feature of the game, but still, a reassuring feature considering the standards of contemporary games.-The translation of the game is for the most part the same as the one from the SNES version. But there are still changes that make it a superior translation. There are still a few \"incorrect\" lines intact in the game, but these were left in due to the humor associated with them, not the laziness of the new localization team. Newcomers again will probably find this not all that interesting, but slightly more since the game now features spell and item names that are consistent with FF lore and terminology.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2007"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E6NE","description":"","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"Fun, but flawed","reviewText":"First off, I had huge expectations for this game; I've been anticipating its release since seeing its announcement trailer at E3 a couple years back.  I wasn't a huge fan of the Bioshock series before this, but this game just looked too good to pass up; and, in short, I'm glad I got it.  Columbia is gorgeous & the story, as well as the concept & setting of a city set in the sky, is imaginative, so I had no complaints there.  My biggest complaint came (from what may be a personal issue) from how complicated it was switching between vigors - it's just annoying to have to enter into a \"pop-up window\" type screen to choose which one rather than use the d-pad to just press & select in-game as you can in the God of War series.  Elizabeth is a terrific independent, naive young woman who serves as one of the best \"sidekicks\" since Cortana to Master Chief and I applaud the developers for creating such a lifelike character who doesn't need to be protected during gameplay (a.k.a. she holds her own).  Overall, Bioshock Infinite is a game that all gamers should play because storytelling this unique and interesting certainly shouldn't be missed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0044SA734","description":"","reviewerName":"Carl Ward \"Black Sinow\"","summary":"Fantastic, but not worth sixty bucks.","reviewText":"When I had tried Kingdoms of Amalur for the first time (after buying it), I was simply amazoed, wowed if you can even call it that. KoA had seemingly brought so much to modern day open-world fantasy rpgs, things that Fable had only begun to touch on. Imagine if you will, a mad scientist transplanting various game mechanics from Skyrim over to Fable, and that is exactly what KoA is. The beautiful part about this game, it doesn't pretend to be anything other then a simplistic gaming experience for those that enjoy this sort of genre.I regret to say that there are some flaws that stop this game from staying as a game worth the price that you pay for it currently. From useless skills to a tedious tutorial dungeon, it is easy to see why this game doesn't attract as many players as Skyrim. But the game isn't absolutely the worst game ever made either, it is simply a fun and enjoyable experience, provided you have the patience to go through the tutorial dungeon. This is a gaming franchise that has already shown so much potential, it would be a shame if it were to destroy any chance for a sequal.Though the story and quests aren't anything out of the new or ordinary, they are pretty fun and do add new twists and turns to what some of us have come to expect out of stories found in rpgs. The mechanics aren't all that different from other rpgs, giving you a reminder of an ability point distribution mechanic that you would have found in Diablo II to gain new attacks and abilities. Those who aren't used to extremely difficult rpgs can be assured that KoA has an appropriate level of difficulty. Should you wish for fantastic and breathtaking graphics and sound, well fear not! The game not only sounds beautiful and enjoyable, but looks like it graphically.In conclusion, if you are looking for a new rpg to steal more of your precious time... Kingdoms of Amalur can do it, it can potentially offer around two hundred hours worth of playing time. The unfortunate truth is, that this game does not step up to bat as a brand new rpg worth paying sixty bucks to purchase. If you want to buy this game, wait til it drops in price to about forty bucks!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0009VRSS2","description":"Burnout: Legends takes the most explosive moments of the popular Burnout series of racing games, mashes themtogether and adds some new surprises -- giving you the best racing experience to come out for the PSP. Use your car as a weapon and battle your way to the front of the pack - by taking out rivals and instigating spectacular crashes. Speed, depth and destruction are waiting for you, in the game of on-the-go automotive anarchy.","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"A legendary game","reviewText":"Electronic Arts and Criterion have made the Burnout series the most successful and exciting racing video game series to date. Now a yearly franchise (or so it seems), Criterion dropped the bomb on the home consoles this September when they released Burnout Revenge. They also released a PlayStation Portable Burnout, titled Burnout Legends, which is one of the best PSP games to date. With all of the hard-hitting crashes and the same blazing speed of the console games, Burnout Legends holds true to its legacy and delivers in every way.Burnout Legends takes bits and pieces of Burnout, Burnout 2, and Burnout 3: Takedown and optimizes the experience for the PSP. You'll instantly recognize some courses, cars, and Crash Junctions if you've played any of these three games. This means that there hasn't been much new stuff added to the mix, but what is crunched up into this UMD is impressive. There are eight gameplay modes, including Ad Hoc WiFi multiplayer, and the single player World Tour mode has over 170 events on its own as well as the usual 100 Crash Junctions. It would be safe to say that Burnout Legends will take players as long to complete as Burnout Revenge would on a home console.After four or five years of high-speed crashes, I'm surprised that EA has managed to keep this franchise fresh and entertaining but somehow they surpass themselves every year with something new. In this year's revenge, you have the ability to ram pedestrian cars around and potentially cause crashes this way. Unfortunately, Burnout Revenge's newest feature is exempt from Legends. This means that Legends plays in almost every way like Burnout 3: Takedown, which isn't a bad thing at all, it just means that Takedown veterans won't find anything new to try.Still, all of those events never get old. Crash Junctions are as fast, explosive, and hectic as ever. I could never tire of making 30-car pile-ups. There are rewards for players who rack up damage dollars and collect gold medals, of course, so getting all of the gold medals in this game is as addictive as before. As a side note, though, I was disappointed as I noticed it was slightly easier to get gold medals in most of the challenges.Visually Burnout Legends ranks among the best-looking PSP games so far. The exaggerated sparks from Burnout 3 return and the explosions, filled with smoke and debris, look right at home on the PSP. The crashing not only looks great, but it sounds great as well. The sound of metal buckling and explosions going off is as sweet as candy. As far as music goes, the soundtrack is similar to most of EA's other games this year. It contains pop rock and punk rock, so take it or leave it.I noticed a few small glitches while playing Burnout Legends, but nothing really distracts from the experience. Sometimes when I was taken down or I'd crash, my car would fly into a tree and get stuck or slide along a wall until the crashing sequence ended itself. I've always thought this, but some Crash Junctions are more luck than skill. No two attempts at the same Crash Junction will end exactly the same, so some Junctions may take one or two tries while others could take an hour or so to finally beat. I know there was one Junction that I tried about thirty times and still never managed to earn gold until I tried it one last time and blew the score away. It's inconsistent, but it's always fun.In conclusion, Burnout Legends is one of the premium PSP games. It ranks among Hot Shots Golf: Open Tee, Metal Gear Acid, and Wipeout Pure as one of my favorite games on the console. With so much to do and so much excitement while doing it, Burnout Legends is an explosive rush quite unlike anything else on the PSP. The console is loaded with racing games (and there's still more on the way) but you'd be hard-pressed to find something better than this.(NOTE: This review is also posted on a website where I review games on a regular basis.)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2005"}

You could easily fill your shelves with Capcom's fighters alone. But one title stands as not only the best game on the system, but the one of the greatest games ever made.Soul Calibur was a launch title for the DC but you wouldn't be able to tell by the level of refinement, both in asthetics and gameplay.First, the graphics are phenomenal for their day. Nothing looked this good back in 1999 on the consoles. The character models were heads and tails above anything gamers had ever saw; they were clean, smooth, detailed, featured flawless animation, with fantastic effects like clothes and hair waving in the wind. The backgrounds are amazing too, various settings from underground caves, deteriorating castles, and Japanese style training grounds.It also rus in progessive scan with a framerate that never falters no matter how intense battles get. Not only that it looks better than the arcade version, quite possibly the first game to accomplish this feat.Sound is excellent too, even today, the voice work sounds great (although it is in Japanese, so I can't understand it). Sound effects are equally impressive, the clash of swords and other weapons sound great, nothing is overdone, or repetivive. The music is wonderful, it's great to hear it has aged so well, even after all these years. Namco could have easily thown togther some bland 80's rock styled music, but it wouldn't have done the game justice. The sweeping classical tunes work rather well with the fast paced, yet tactical gameplay.As far as the gameplay itself, it's perfectly paced, not too fast, not too slow. It is a game that is easy to learn hard to master. In my opinion, Soul Calibur is the most balanced of any 3D fighter. Even a beginner can pick up a controller, understand the basic concepts of the game and have some success just feeling out the game. However, it's not like Tekken (Namco's other 3D fighter) that allows button mashers to cheat their way to victory, if a person bothers to learn a characters moves, he can easily devistate a beginner. There are tons of advanced moves beyond just learing a command list, there are techniques such as the advanced guard and the 8-way run to master that seperate the average player to the advanced one. Combine this with strategies that a factored into most 3D fighters like forcing the ring out and using the clock to your advanage and you have a fighter with a serious amount of depth.While soul caibur has tons of depth, it would have not have reached a perfect score had it not taken it to the next level, and by that I mean modes. That is the mistake that Virtua Fighter 3tb made. Namco saw fit to make Soul Calibur on the dreamcast the most ambitious 3D fighter to date, and they succeeded. They did a wonderful job of adding a fully featured versus mode, team battle, survival, and extra survival (one hit kill), modes, but they all pale in comparison to mission mode.Mission mode is by far the greatest feature of Soul Calibur. Unlike Soul Blade where you had a handful of character specific missions that weren't very fun, Mission mode allows you to pick any character that you desire and progress at your own pace. Missions range from winning with a ring out, to survival matches, and later throw in more obsure challenges. While they are challenging, they are for the most part, fair. As you beat each of these mode you will acquire points to buy artwork; purchasing this artwork will unlock more missions, costumes, characters and stages. By the time you finish this mode not only will you be an accoplished swordsman, but you will have a robust amount of content to show for your efforts.There is a reason Soul Calibur has the reputation that it doesn 12 years later. The game is simply stellar. It has aged rather gracefully and is the best game on the DC. The game is also available through Xbox live for $10 but omits the mission mode and has everything already unlocked. This is truly the version to get if you want to fully experience the games as it was intended by Namco. I highly reccomend this game as one of the greatest games ever made.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2011"}

The build quality of the headset is excellent and it feels like it will last and will hold up to quite a lot of use.  The ear pads are large and comfortable, but not too large or so large that you feel like you have a big unit on your head.  The weight is not bad at all and the headphones feel comfortable for long gaming sessions.These are NOT wireless headphones, so keep this in mind when ordering.  These connect to the port on your XBOX 360 controller and can suffer from a ground loop that causes buzzing if you attempt to charge your controller battery with a charge-and-play kit while playing.  This has been confirmed by Turtle Beach customer support, as I couldn't stop the issue on my own.  Their suggestion is to only charge your controller when not playing if you are using the headset.  I dropped the rating to four stars for this issue.There are multiple surround modes and a limited volume option to keep you from damaging your hearing.  I suggest that you pay attention and that you do not boost the volume up extremely high, as you can really damage your hearing without even thinking about it if you are playing for hours at a time with a higher volume.  The sound quality of these headphones is excellent and you will not be disappointed, so ENJOY but be careful.Great headset!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2013"}

The problem is when you are facing a fierce enemy and you need to reach for the magnum pistol saved in your bottom left, you have to run and if you are lucky enough you will have time to acquire the pistol before your head is sawed off.  I'm only half way through the game, but the game play itself is so far the same, and it doesn't appear to change drastically.  I hate to compare games, but Bioshock had a much better gameplay, inventory selection, and it was ten times scarier than RE5.  RE5 will grow on me and I'll continue playing it and probably play it twice, but its not one of those games I'm dying to play.  I think Capcom was lazy to release this game with the flaws in the game.  With so many good games out now and the additional time they requested to release the game, Capcom had no reason to release a game that couldn't receive any easy 5 star review.I'm only giving this game four stars b/c I was such a fan of RE4, but this game play is at times frustrating and really deserves a 3.5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2009"}

With a rugged new look and suited with armor, Jak is also equipped with an arsenal of new weapons with upgradeable mods that enable players to increase their firepower and enjoy the freedom to strategize and activate their arsenal at any time.As Jak has been exposed to Light Eco, players can now experience Jak's magnificent transformation to Light Jak. With a glowing electric blue aura and a massive wing span, Light Jak introduces new move sets, including the ability to glide great distances, emit an energy to block enemy attack, and power up at anytime, all of which provide the player with a sense of being invincible. Dark Jak also returns with more capabilities, forcing Jak to find a balance between light and dark.Additionally, game developer Naughty Dog continues to push the genre forward with the introduction of new technology. For the first time in the franchise, enemies feature realistic ragdoll physics, which will allow gamers to witness a unique death for each enemy that is killed. Naughty Dog has also implemented independent cloth movement technology and enhanced the enemy artificial intelligence (AI) with wall climbing and smart formation capabilities.","reviewerName":"Ian","summary":"The end has come...is that a good thing?","reviewText":"Note:  This review is spoiler free with regards to the game's storyAll good things must eventually come to an end, such as the star wars series, the lord of the rings trilogy, and the Jak and Daxter trilogy (not including the racing game and Daxter's own PSP game).  After two excellent games, our favorite elfin friend and his furry sidekick come to the last entry in the Jak trilogy.  The big question is:  Is it a good ending?  I'm pleased to say that overall, yes.Jak 3 takes place an undetermined time after the conclusion of Jak 2.  Haven city has become divided after relentless attacks by robots, metal heads and other nasties.  The population blames Jak for these problems and he finds himself flown out to the wasteland, a harsh and unforgiving desert where nobody can survive without help.  Abandoned by those he saved, Jak and his buddy Daxter set out on thier final adventure.Like it's two predecessors, Jak 3 is a platforming game combined with a gun shooter.  You get various jumps, kicks, punches and leaps, and you also get a wide array of firearms to take out your foes when your fancy Kung-Fu and karate aren't enough.  Jak's moves remain largely unchanged from Jak 2 (which will now be called J2).  He can still punch like a man, jump like a kangaroo, and leap like a bullfrog.Gunplay remains pretty much the same as well.  You get four guns (blaster, rifle, machine gun and peacemaker), but in a nice twist, each weapon gets various upgrades as the game goes on.  The rifle for example, starts out in it's default setting.  Hower, the next upgrade allows it to shoot richochet bullets while the third upgrade gives it a flying platform that shoots bullets in all directions.  Each gun has three upgrades and playing with them is a blast.  The peace maker for example, can fire a shot that paralyzes all enemies and makes them float around (whee!) while it's final upgrade...well, let's just say that you'll be shooting mini-nukes a lot.The biggest change to Jak's game play comes in the form of  vehicles.  While J2 had flying vehicles and zoomers, Jak 3 has cars (and not the nice, talking Pixar kind).  Because half the game is set in the desert, Jak and Daxter get around on dune buggies.  There are eight of them and each has various unique traits.  Some are really, really fast, one can jump riddiculously high (wheee!) and some of them will spin out of control at the slightest twitch of the control stick (boo!).  You'll be spending a lot of time driving the buggies and for the most part, it's enjoyable and fun, though some of them (such as the sand shark) can be a bit difficult to handle.Another new feature of Jak 3 is the sheer size of it.  J1 and J2 had two enormous areas to run around in.  Here, you have not one, not two, but three, yes, three! gigantic areas to run around in.  And like the previous games, there are no loading times, an astonishing feat considering how enormous both worlds (Spargus city, the wasteland and Haven city) are.  You'll definatly see a lot of amazing sights during your trips throughout Jak 3's world (such as how Haven city has...ahem...changed since the last game).Dark Jak powers return as well, but are now balanced by a new side to our hero...light Jak.  If Dark Jak is the attacking force, Light Jak is the defensive force.  Dark allows you to kill things really quickly, while Light allows you to heal, fly (this is so AWESOME!), surround yourself with an inpenetrable shield, and even slow down time to a crawl.  Both powers can be activated at any time as long as you have light and dark eco in your meters.  And in a very nice touch, you can stop being light or dark at a touch of a button to save your energy for when you really need it.  While both light and dark do come into play at vital moments during gameplay, both are really just a little added bonus to spice up gameplay when you want to, as you can play throughout the game without needing to use either force (except for scripted moments where you need to).  But then again, being able to heal yourself whenever you want is a very handy thing! *smile*Like J2, Jak 3 has you going from place to place, talking to people and doing what they tell you to do.  And when you finish with that, you head over to the next person and do what they want to do, etc.  It's a linear system that makes it easy to tell where to go and what to do next and it sounds fairly restrictive, but it does have one big strength:  You don't have to start the next mission until you want to.  If you want, you can wander around the wasteland blowing up wanderers for twenty hours, go hunt down twelve precurser orbs and watch the sun go up and down three times, and then tackle the mission.  This free roaming system allows you to do what you'd like to do if you don't feel like doing missions for a while.One thing i'd like to address before we go any further is the difficulty level.  If one takes a look at my review for J2, one can find a lot of anger and hatred directed towards Naughty dog for making J2 the most unnecessarily hardest game i've ever played (and it still is by the way, tied only with Spider man for PS2).  I am very pleased that Naughty Dog towned down the difficulty a lot for Jak 3.  No longer does each and every mission require twenty attempts before you pass it, and no longer will you be throwing the controller into the TV while screaming obscenities becuase that a**hole Errol won that fricken race again.  Here, the difficulty seems just right.  Not too hard, not too easy.  Most missions require a few attempts before they are completed, and a few can be finished on one try.  There are still a few that are quite difficult, and one or two that are grit-your-teeth inducing, but overall, nothing as infuriating as many moments from the previous entry in the series.  Oh, and there are only a few \"go through the ring\" missions this time around.  Thank goodness.In addition to the free-roaming gameplay, there are also plenty of secrets to unlock in this quest.  There are over 600 precurser orbs to find and collect in Jak 3, and by doing so you get to unlock various features such as unlimited dark and light Jak power, invincibility, extra vehicles, various weapon upgrades, etc.  While some are hidden behind corners, many of these orbs are collected by doing various challenges that people throw your way, such as searching around a paticular area, going through rings (grumbles), following a little blue light and even stopping time.  There are plenty of things to do to get those little shiny orbs, but the results are well worth it.In addition, Jak 3 arguably has the best moments in the series in terms of \"wow\" factor.  Fighting a gigantic sixty story tall monster with only a dune buggy is a moment that sends shivers down your spine.Even with all these fine points, Jak 3 does stutter a little bit in what is arguably the most important part of the game...the story.  J2 is most memorable to me for it's story.  It had many twists and turns and you never really knew what to expect next.  The story in Jak 3 is a good one and it does keep your interest in what is going to happen next...but ultimitly, it left me unsatisfied.How so?  The three biggest ones are charachters, the precursers and the ending.And for those of you worrying that i'm going to tell you who the precursers are (which I won't) i'm going to keep this as spoiler free as I can.First off, the charachters.  We have Jak and Daxter of course, and those two are always fun to watch and care about.  We have many returning charachters such as Torn, Sig, and Samos, and we have some new residents from Spargus city.  The problem?  Almost all of the returning charachters have zilch charachter development.  It's assumed that you know them from the last game and because of that, Jak 3 takes no time to explain who they are or what they do.  That may be okay, but pretty much none of the charachters are expanded at all.  Torn is still gruff and tough (but not as much as last time), Ashelin is the firm leader, and Samos gives warnings on what may happen to the planet if things go badly.  Keira, who was such a vital charachter in J1 and J2, has absoloutly nothing to do in the story aside from look pretty and important.  Sig...well, he's just there because he's cool.  The only returning charachter who kept me interested was Tess, who fufills the \"dumb blonde\" role.  Her relationship with Daxter is sweet and lighthearted and kept my interest easily.  Errol returns as well (though I won't say how), but he's gone from \"insanely irritating\" to \"average irritating\", a sad departure from his compellingly egotistic nature in J2.Of the new charachters, only one, Damos, kept my interest due to his charachter.  Tough, yet gentle and caring at the same time, he's easily the most compelling of Jak's new companions.  The new villian, count Veger, isn't that compelling, though he does have some very powerful scenes (especially one near the ending).One of the claims on the back of the game box is that we'll discover the shocking secret of who the precursers really are.  As I said earlier, I won't reveal who the precursers are (someone did that and ruined the suprise for me), except that in my personal opinion, we should have never find out who the precursers were and leave them as a mystery.  I personally felt that seeing who they really are sucked out all the suspense and mystery, esepcially since they have been talked about at length for two games now.  It's like revealing the face of doctor claw.  When you go back and experience your old memories, there is no more mystery or wonder anymore.  In my personal opinion, these beings should have remained hidden forever.However, the saddest part of the game for me is the ending.  Again, I won't ruin it for you, but it's always sad when game developers have to wrap an entire trilogy up in three minutes.  Some people criticise the ending of the film, Return of the King, saying that it goes on too long.  However, the ending to the lord of the rings film trilogy took it's time wrapping up the threads from three movies and bringing closure to the story and leaving one satisfied.  However, Jak 3 doesn't do that.  As the game goes on and gets closer to the end, the feeling of dread and the idea that everything can be destroyed just vanishes and is pretty much gone by the time the final boss battle comes (and sadly, the battle itself isn't that exciting or memorable).The ending does end the trilogy, but leaves the door wide open for more games (of which two have already happened).  I've invested a lot of time on these three games, i've grown attatched to it's charachters and I would like closure to all thier stories.  Saldy, that doesn't happen.  Everything is left wide open when, in my opinion, it should have been closed.  There is no real ending here, at least, one that ties everything up nicely.But despite my points with the story, I do want to stress that Jak 3 is a very good game.  It's a satisfying blend of storytelling, platforming, shooting, driving, and action.  It's one of those games where you keep saying \"Just five more minutes, just five more minutes\", only to discover that time has flown by and it's two in the morning.  It's addictive, fun, and, for me, a blast to play.  I definitly recommend it, especially if you find it for under twenty dollars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00006I02Z","reviewerName":"Pecos Bill","summary":"A great physics engine does not a great game create","reviewText":"Just got this game and put in a couple hours last night.Excellent graphics, excellent physics, smooth gameplay.  I particularly liked the realism of the other people and the \"body\" physics they use -- no more dead zombies falling into walls or laying horizontal on a slanted staircase, the interaction with the environment is perfect (just watch the way someone falls down a staircase...)I had two problems, though:1) Load times are too frequent.  Maybe I'm spoiled by RPG's that offer huge, seamless worlds, but I was annoyed at having to pause what seemed like every 10 minutes for \"Loading\".  If every RPG in the world can offer seamless loading of a huge environment, why can't HL2?  I'd gladly sacrifice some graphics if it meant they could do away with pauses to load between areas.2) Gameplay was way too predictable.  Maybe I've just played too many FPS games, but HL2 was really formulaic.  There's only 1 path to take, any other path is just a deadend with supply crates, it felt very arcadish (as opposed to immersively realistic).  Like oh, the way is blocked!  Well, good thing someone left a big ramp here, which I can't use because it's not at the right angle, but luckily someone left just the right number of floating blue containers here that I can use the jack it up to the correct angle to make the jump!I mean come on, okay, you have a nice physics engine, we get it, you didn't have to set up a time consuming yet completely obvious puzzle just to demonstrate the fact.  It was interesting in a \"it's neat the physics engine can do this\" sort of way, it was not interesting in a \"this is a fun aspect of the game\" sort of way.I almost feel like I'm playing a demo moreso than a game.  Like they set things up to say \"look what our engine can do\" rather than setting out to create an awesome level that's fun and immersive to play.So here's my advice to Valve:Stop letting your programmers do level design.  Design levels that are fun and immersive and don't worry about whether or not every nuance of your physics engine is being demonstrated.  That's pretty annoying.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00005ML10","description":"One of the most anticipated titles in PlayStation2 history absolutely  lives up to the hype.Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Libertyis the  follow-up to one of the most captivating and intelligent adventures on the original  PlayStation. Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M. PadillaPros:One of the best and most complex stories in gamingOutstanding graphics with many interactive elementsExcellent soundtrack and voice actingCons:Long periods of watching instead of playingSome extraneous dialogueSolid Snake may inspire gamers to grow mullets","reviewerName":"Jobe","summary":"Best PS2 Game of 2001","reviewText":"Unless you've been living in your parent's basement for the past 10 years and still think the 16-bit era is alive and kicking, the word of \"Metal Gear Solid\" has spread across the globe like the Black Plague. In one year, Metal Gear Solid acclaimed legendary status and became the game associated with the Playstation system. That's nothing easy either, having to surpass the legions of fans that lust for the Resident Evil series, or the millions and millions of Final Fantasy fans as well; need I remind everyone how huge Final Fantasy VII's debut was?So it comes as no surprise that the over-weight, Dead or Alive 3 girl drooling critics at the gaming magazines slapped even the slightest pieces of news onto their pages, Electronic Gaming Monthly even deemed MGS2 the \"Only Game We Really Want\". And now when they finally have it, they turn into whiny little children complaining about the storyline which is the reason it only scored a 9.5 in EGM, when Halo which I'm sure has a fantastic storyline received straight 10's. Class act guys, clearly all of them were missing the big picture.Solid Snake, ring a bell? The video gaming world's biggest and baddest male character who rightfully reclaimed his spot in 1998 is back tracking the newest Metal Gear prototype named \"RAY\", being transported in a military tanker on the Hudson River. Investigating soon puts Snake in far over his head, as the truth becomes a spiral staircase of lies and conspiracies deeper that anything he could ever have imagined. This is where most critics centered their complaints, and while I won't  agree with them I will admit that the Metal Gear story takes a HUGE turn with an almost out of this world that will either intrigue or turn gamers off.However, this turn did shock me, but in no way lessened my opinion of Sons of Liberty. After all, games like this are played for their gameplay features, if people focus only on the story and are detracted by this; well...that's their problem. And with saying MGS2 is played for it's gameplay I can say that it exceeded all expectations, I had watched the movies, and read about it but wasn't sure if it would stack up to Metal Gear Solid, it was funny how much an opinion changed in less that 10 minutes.Veterans of Solid will find the basics still remain, pressing Snake against a wall will allow him to peek behind corners, he can still pound on the wall to distract the enemy as well as snap his neck if you can successfully sneak up behind an enemy sentry. Along with oldies comes some new abilities, hanging on ledges is now possible for quick escapes from guards, also Snake can now enter a 1st person view when shooting  which seemingly opens up a new world in the game itself.With this addition guards can be held off much easier by shots to the head and even shooting steam pipe or fire extinguisher to block enemies' views. Speaking of enemies, your foes have some new tricks as well, if in trouble a guard will fall back and radio for help, and then the \"Clearing Squad\" comes barging in with bullet shields and up to 5 back-up members. They'll search ever inch of the room for you and when done will cal replacement guards to the area. It's a new kind of battle this time around, stealth becomes almost crucial in every area so huge gun-fights don't result in being spotted.For example, if an enemy is killed or put to sleep with a tranquilizer dart, he won't report his status to his commander which will cause a back-up squad to investigate. The body of the soldier must be hidden to avoid further trouble; he can be stashed in lockers or tiny rooms or even in some areas like the ship, can be thrown overboard. No detail has been left to chance here, if the enemy is radioing for help his radio can be shot and disabled so then he's pretty much out of luck, and is Snake's for the taking.For a Gameplay point of view, Sons of Liberty is absolutely flawless; no area in the game seems shallow or rushed to meet deadlines. Everything from sneaking through rooms, disarming bombs, fighting a Harrier Jet, swimming through a submerged basement, all in a days work for Solid Snake and Raiden. What's that you say? Who's Raiden? Well...okay, I can understand how people complained hereHalfway through the game an event occurs and the center of view changes to a young Fox-Hound member named Jack, a pale white-haired sissy who could use a haircut (I'm surprised I actually didn't mind Snake's mullet). It's a little of a let-down being Solid Snake is the only name that should be associated with Metal Gear. He's whiny but non-the-less gets the job done by sporting some athletic maneuvers of his own. The other casting is fine, the members of the Special Forces unit \"Dead Cell\" work but won't win any awards. The 3rd child of the Les Enfants program however, is awesome, where Solid Snake was stealth and cool-headed and Liquid was brilliant, Solidus is an all out war-machine who sports a mechanical suit that can increase his body's muscle mass and totes two missile spouting tentacles. By far the best new character to the series.Hour after hour I was amazed over and over again; a game that never went stale for a minute, like a dog gnawing on a bone for hours on end is what I became. Even when pulled away for daily routines I could still feel my hands clasping onto the controller never letting go just waiting for the next time to start it up. It's sad to see the critics attacking the storyline and never looking at Sons of Liberty as a game, but more as a book that's ending didn't turn out the way they thought it would. It didn't take Jobe long to come to this decision, so here it can be said: Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty is the best game of 2001 easily pushing ahead of titles such as Grand Theft Auto 3 and Final Fantasy X. In its world, all other games are obsolete, you've been warned. Sons of Liberty, get it now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2002"}

However, if you are using this controller lit up in a darkened room it may be too bright and distracting at times.  Fortunately the controller has 3 modes - on, off, and on only when the controller rumbles.  Personally I prefer the 3rd option as having the lights flashing in tandem with the rumble jolt is always fun and surprising.If the above 2 factors are not of concern then this is a great 3rd party controller.  It looks great, feels comfortable in the hands and is cheaper than the standard Microsoft wireless controller.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2014"}

I started wih megaman 7 and was instantly hooked! As the series went on it was nearing its peek. meg man X was insanely good, great powerups, and o so much mroe to collect, as was X2, and especially the ultra rare, 125 dollar X3. The trnslation to the next gen consoles is usually the ultimate down fall of great side scrolling, old school shooter, and this is no exception. Megaman had some undoubtedly rough spots, what with megaman legends, and megaman 64, things were really looking down. Then capcom graced us with megaman X4, good ol' side scrolling fun, and megaman was good again for a brief shining moment. Then again the quality began to slip with X5 and 6, and X7 is definately the low point.the problem with this game is that megaman was never meant to be a 3D expierience, it just doesnt work. The game has terrible controls, average graphics, and infuriates you past the point of caring anymore. Megaman should frusterate you, but before it fueled you to do better, now it just pisses you off and causes a lot of broken controllers. The megaman anniversery edition just came out, and is an excellent old school finger numbing smash!

With the 101 patch on the game website the game was completely bug free from start to finish on a 32-bit Vista Ultimate machine.As others have said, there is nothing new here but the game is very well done.  The world is not huge but it is very well rendered (actually it is as pretty as any game I have seen but the NPCs are not really realistic).There are none of the annoying run to France to get cheese, then swim to Los Angeles to get some sunshine, then return to Belgium to get me a beer quests that show up in lots of RPGs.  There are quest maps and the dialog points you to where you need to go nicely.  So, you will not need to do a lot of digging on the web to figure out how to complete the quests.The combat is hard at first but stick with it for a couple hours and it gets easy.If you have young kids around take the M rating seriously.  There is plenty of real profanity in the voice acting.  That really helps the game come alive because the more villainous characters seem more realistic with the high quality cursing but you probably do not want your 7 year old daughter asking Mom what some of the words mean ... doh....Overall the game is extremely fun and will take several full days to complete.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2009"}

The loading screens show detailed faces, flicking veins in the orbits of the characters eyes, individual pores, and an overall breathtaking set of graphics. Combined with a ridiculous amount of actor driven motion animations, and you have a life like set of characters in a pristine environment. Audio is the same, with dozens of hours of plot driven dialogue. Certain scenes are cookie cutter to advance plot, but these are few and far between.Gameplay however is where some serious trouble occurs. Walking is almost agonizing, identifying actions is vague and uncertain, even in simple circumstances, and not enough time is given to make certain choices. Combined with the orbiting decision buttons, which are indistinct on even top shelf TV's, combined with unhelpful descriptors make picking certain choices are wing and a prayer event, especially since you can't rewind unless you reset the game prior to autosave points. This is compounded when your character is \"panicked\" and the wobble and indistinctness is made worse. While I can appreciate the theater of it, when I'm guessing at what choice I'm making, its not really a choice. The decision tree is gigantic, and no real viable method was put together to go back and try again, without basically starting from scratch. A 'Prototype' style mosaic(made instead with unfolding origami perhaps?) would have helped tremendously to allow players to revisit their plot from their favorite points, rather than restarting and hoping they do it just right this time would have helped.The story is flush and full, but some characters detract tremendously, and deus ex machina's crop up periodically and nearly ruin the story, though I had a watchful eye out after the last debacle from QD. Action scenes flow well, but the greater parts are nearly lost in moments of mundanity. While I can understand the action for opening the fridge, and another for removing a pizza from said fridge, I think the rational conclusion is to close the fridge without requiring a quick time event. That said, the action scenes allow you to appreciate the scene and play the game, though sometimes the tunnel vision gets pretty bad, but this is mostly absolved by setting the game on the lowest difficulty.Overall, this game is fantastic, and unless you follow one of the leads advice and only play it once, there's an ocean of replay value and radically different endings that require more than yes/no lynchpin decisions to get. A rare buy recommendation, unless you are easily frustrated.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2010"}

Garrelts","summary":"Somewhere In-Between Movie and Video Game (Move Controls Reviewed) Spoiler Free","reviewText":"Heavy Rain is developer Quantic Dream's first title for the PS3 and as a fan of their previous game, Indigo Prophecy, a title I was highly anticipating. For those not familiar with Quantic Dream, the studio has made few games, however, supplies technology and motion capture techniques to movie studios and video game developers. It's no surprise then that Heavy Rain features some of the most fluid and lifelike character movements to ever be represented in a video game.Heavy Rain blurs the distinction between video game and movie. That fact will tend to cause a rift amongst people who play this \"game\" and in my experience create two camps - folks who love it and folks who hate it. To call Heavy Rain an interactive suspense movie would be a compliment in my view. Because of the presentation of Heavy Rain and the emphasis on creating an intense and compelling narrative, gameplay is somewhat limited. You will control characters and their movements, however, the game relies exclusively on QTEs or Quick Time Events whenever an action sequence takes place. Suffice to say that if you dislike QTEs you'll probably dislike Heavy Rain.Heavy Rain follows 4 main playable characters and their involvement in a series of murders by a killer dubbed the \"Origami Killer\". The Origami Killer targets children and uses periods of rainfall to drown his/her victims. There are a cast of characters in addition to those that you control and your interactions with them will vary greatly based on the choices and actions you make as one of the main characters.The main characters are:Ethan Mars - Father of two boys. Suffers from depression after a traumatic event.Madison Page - Female and an insomniac. Her curiosity drives her to seek out the Origami Killer.Norman Jayden - FBI Agent assigned to assist in capturing the O.K.Scott Shelby - Private Investigator hired by the families of the victims of the O.K.Graphics are generally very good and presented in a gritty style reminiscent of the movie Seven. Heavy Rain takes place almost entirely under gray, rainy skies and Quantic Dream uses the few moments of sunshine as a welcome reprieve from the dark reality of the main story. The motion capture, as I mentioned,is fantastic as would be expected from Quantic Dream. Movements are realistically fluid and largely devoid of stiff or unnatural looking movements.The voice work in Heavy Rain is a mixed bag. The main characters are all voiced well, however, some of the support characters voice acting can be a bit grating. My least favorite voice actress was the woman who voiced the character Laura. The soundtrack in HR is a bright spot featuring a good mix of light and heavy tracks that support the on screen events perfectly.Gameplay as I mentioned relies heavily on QTEs and if you're using the PS Move controller it can be a somewhat frustrating affair. My first time playing HR I used the Move and at times I was frustrated enough to want to switch to the regular DS3 controller. The main issue lies with how the controls are implemented. At various times while playing HR you'll need to hold the Move controller in very specific ways. There is no way of anticipating the next required move and ultimately I found that I ended up with many dead characters. That doesn't spell game over in HR as the story adjusts based on the outcome of the events in game. But it does lead to a frustrating experience. Luckily you can tone down the speed in which you need to perform actions in the options menu which serves as the games difficulty setting. My second time playing through Heavy Rain I used the DS3 and I feel that overall it's the better method of playing the game. The secondary affect of using the Move controller and always focusing so much on performing the right motions is that it can distract the player from the actual events unfolding in the game. My recommendation is to use the DS3 initially and then the Move controller. Or using the options menu to tone down the speed that actions are required.For fans of games with multiple endings Heavy Rain is an indulgence. There isn't a wrong or right way to play the game and all of your choices influence your relationships and ultimate ending in the game. I would recommend newcomers to simply sit back and play the game without resetting or replaying anything. Let the story unfold as it does and always move forward. Heavy Rain features a chapter select that allows you to go back and play things out differently.Overall Heavy Rain is an interesting experiment into what video games can do and where they can go. Many folks refuse to call video games art. But surely if television can be deemed art than so can a game like Heavy Rain. Even though there are some hiccups in the presentation I recommend this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2010"}

There's not much more to add to the reviews that the first 150 didnt say. 5 star ratings are for perfect games, and the 5star rank is thrown around too much. While this game is really really good there is one (to me) major flaw:Stuttering gameplay - I did a system update on 4/5/10 before playing this game and I havent even tapped half of my HDDs storage capacity...so while I didnt notice all the problems some were having (lost trophies, lost saves, etc), there is this pause in the game: happens about every 4-5 seconds - it may be minor to others but in this instance it was the difference between the feeling of 'watching a movie' and 'watching a video game system process a game that may be too much for it too handle' - ie takes away the feeling of immersion. That's as far as my list of complaints go though (well, that and the lack of mini-games to return to). If I didnt play IP/F first I probably woulda gave this a 5 star.

You will find 3 seperate campaigns, one each for the Aliens, Predators, and Colonial Marines.  Each race plays totally different from the other - the Marine is closest to standard shoot-em up FPS and also the movies, the Predator has lots of stealth missions and jumping from tree to tree while on the hunt, and the Alien - well, I won't ruin it for you, but the Alien campaign is certainly the most creative I've seen since Half-life.The resemblance to the films is uncanny.  While AvP2's story doesn't much resemble anything from the movies, the developers have taken many themes, locations and situations from the films and plugged them into the game, so that you are often replaying a moment that will remind you of something.  The plot is wonderful, as each campaign, although self-contained, gives little details about the other two.  When you finally finish the game, you'll definitely want to play through again, just like watching Sixth Sense a 2nd time to catch all of the details.My only complaints are that the game is too linear and the enemies are too predicable on the second or third time through.  Also, the multiplayer code will greatly hurt the online games, so get this game just for the single player game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2002"}

Its great that you can change their colors from blue, red and purple but there should be the option of brightness too. I think mine is defective because about half of the keys randomly throughout the keyboard look like they have grease stains on them. Its not grease but possibly some kind of plastic discoloration as they didn't wipe clean.

It has a full set of keys including the number pad on the right which I use all the time. It also has volume controls as well as the usual play, rewind, FF etc. A big let down is that while it says its mac compatible, where's the command key? also there's no eject button. I might be able to configure some of the extra buttons but its nice to have a dedicated marked symboled key especially that it's mac compatible. They keys are quieter than most other keyboards and had a solid feel. The space bar was just a bit too small for my hands and the backspace and right side shift keys were a bit bigger then needed. There is a usb jack built in as well as headphones and mic jacks. All the programmable keys are done thru the software provided.I didn't really get any warm feeling from this keyboard in fact It was just another keyboard just with the novelty of backlit keys that were too dim.

Join Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny in a hilarious journey through South Park. There are tons of areas to explore including the streets of South Park, houses, parks and local businesses. Every house or business has quest missions to complete and there is always some trouble to get into around every corner. There are constantly punk kids that want to kick your butt and will pick a fight with you. They will hop out and surprise you any chance they get. You battle and when you win you level up and become stronger. As you play the game you accumulate different weapons and special attack and powers. The battles are a lot of fun and they are my favorite part of the game.As you play through the game you meet more and more people and become friends with them on a Facebook type of system that you get to by hitting the start button. They will leave posts for you giving various tips and guidance throughout the game. There is an inventory section where you can explore your weapons, abilities and accessories and totally customize your character. There is a listing of all your current quests but I wish there was a map on the screen during gameplay that would show you where to go. That would make it a lot easier. I just hate having to flip back and forth in and out of the game in order to see the map.The graphics aren't anything amazing at all. They are basically graphics that the old PS2 could have produced and I would have liked to have seen this game use the full processing power of the PS3. I realize that it's a cartoon game but I still think that more could have been done to beef up the graphics.  What you see in the graphics here is just like what you see when you're watching it on TV.  I understand the reasoning, but still, I would've liked the graphics to be a bit more exciting.Another thing that surprises me is how bad it can lag sometimes, especially considering how simple of a game it is. I understand that some games are very complex and will eat up system resources and occasionally lag but this is not a complex game at all so it shouldn't be laggy. Sometimes I am just walking down the road with nothing else really going on and the screen will start getting choppy. That makes me think that this game was rushed into production without adequate testing. It's not horrible but it just shouldn't be the case.The game certainly isn't perfect but it's freaking hilarious. There is something new that is said every minute or so that cracks me up. It's every bit as funny as the series so if you are a die-hard South Park fan then you will probably enjoy this game. Even though the graphics aren't amazing and it can get choppy, it's still a lot of fun to play. I'm not even really a South Park fan but I have really enjoyed playing this game over the last several weeks. There are just so many areas to explore and trouble to get into that it doesn't get boring.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2014"}

On his 21st birthday, the Darkness awakens within Jackie Estacado, a mafia hitman for the Franchetti crime family.","reviewerName":"Shaimun","summary":"Obey The Darkness","reviewText":"I bought this game to play because I was a little interested in The Darkness II which was released recently.The Darkness was released in 2007 so this is a throwback game. In the game, after you find collectibles, you have to use a payphone to get them. It is showing it's age.Game-play: You get The Darkness powers and they make it really easy to kill enemies. It is fun using the 4 specific skills you get with The Darkness. You have to sometimes use them to get through obstacles;Light also drains your power so you spend time taking out street lights. You also usually use guns. They have 5-6 different types of guns you will eventually carry. You can also summon four types of darklings to aid you in battle or to get through puzzles. You are able to interact with NPCs in this game and do sidequests. After killing enemies, you are able to devour their hearts to increase your darkness level. The darkling and ememy AI is very atrocious in this game. They act retarded which makes the game less challenging. I say it is an interactive FPS.Story: I love the story. The game is based on a comic but it doesn't incorporate all the aspects of the comic so it creates its own alternate story arc(isn't that the case with every comic series?) The writing for this game is pretty good and it stands well for 2012. The campaign could take you 5-7 hours.Level Design: Every level in this game is pretty linear. You don't have to think much. It is nice that they had a few puzzles here and there.Multiplayer: I don't know. I have not tried it and it would not be easy to tell if the multiplayer community is alive because the game is about 5 years old.Replayability: The campaign mode is not very long and you can find collectibles which will unlock extra content in the main menu. It is stuff like comics, concept arts, character designs etc... You might have to re-play the game if you missed some collectibles in the previous playthrough. There are about 100 or more collectibles.I do like it this game. It is short but slaughtering enemies being a monster is fun. The POV from being something evil is awesome I believe. The enemy AI is the worst part of the game but it does make it easier to enjoy killing them. If you are interested in The Darkness II, play this game first to understand the story. It's short so it won't take you that long.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00503E8S2","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Does One Thing Really Well","reviewText":"The CoD series is great at making the Average Joe feel like G.I. Joe in exciting cinematic bursts of action.  In this day and age, most people who buy games (non gamers) don't have time to get good at playing them.  So Call of Duty does everything it can to level the playing field and make the Joes feel like Pros.  There are 3 basic modes of play:  A story driven Campaign, Mission Based Special Ops, and Multiplayer with a ton of individual and team modes.  All of them can be played with friends.Story: 7/10The stories of the CoD series have been well acted, well directed, visually entertaining, and do their job to add context to the exciting levels.  In CoDMW3, you're out to hunt down the evil military mastermind Makarov with CoD vets Price and Soap.  You'll battle all around the world in cities, jungles, deserts, mountains...  The game feels less like one solid action story and more like the action scenes from 3 or 4 Michael Bay movies edited together.  Actually, Michael Bay movies feel like a bunch action scenes edited together...Gameplay: 6/10Run to the next checkpoint, squeeze the triggers, feel awesome.  That's been the formula for success in the CoD series.  The gameplay largely depends on what difficulty you select.  On Recruit, you are almost invincible aside from grenades or insta-kills.  On Hardened or Veteran, you really need to use cover and play smart.There's really nothing new here if you've played the other CoD games, but it's not like Activision is going to say, \"Well, the last CoD broke sales records, so let's change everything!!!\"  They're going to stick to the formula and crank out sequels every Christmas.  Hopefully with some improvements.  There aren't enough improvements to this game to make it feel like the next game of a great franchise.  It feels more like a heavy duty expansion pack.Unfortunately, there are some strange issues with the AI that ruin the immersion.  Enemies run into walls and keep running in place.  Allies often do strange things as well.  If you keep AI characters on screen for too long the illusion is shattered.  But in Call of Duty, you usually kill them or they kill you in 2 seconds, so if you're rushing to the next checkpoint, you won't see these things.Levels: 7/10Most of the levels are fun and make you feel like Jack Bauer or Chuck Norris.  You and your squad mow down hordes of enemies and rush through checkpoints to save the world while the game unlocks Achievements for you.  You even get an Achievement for Starting a Single Player Campaign!  The levels are a good mix of army missions, special forces missions, sniper missions, and vehicle missions.Unfortunately, there really isn't anything new to the levels.  I swear I've seen the same props, textures, and objects from other Call of Duty games in this one.  I felt like I had Deja Vu through most of the whole game.  (Aside from the crazy submarine level.)There are a few poor choices in some of the levels like infinitely spawning enemies until you reach an invisible box, or in the underwater level, you can actually get pinned against the side of the screen and die.  But most of the levels are exciting bouts of death and explosions.Multiplayer: 6/10Activision has also tried to make the Joes feel like Pros in Multiplayer.  In Multiplayer, you gain XP by doing just about anything.  As you gain XP, the game unlocks more powerful weapons, weapon attachments, and weapon skill perks.  The beginning guns are powerful, but the upgraded guns are like death rays that vaporize you instantly.  In my first Multiplayer game, I went 0 and 20.  My worst outing in 15 years.  In the second round, I picked up an upgraded gun from a dead guy and got a 5 Kill Streak right off the bat.  The guns kill you so quickly, that running, cover, strafing, will always lose to a better gun.  It seems as if you die in 0.3 seconds if an enemy has you in their sights.  There is no time to shoot back, take cover, evade, dive...  You're just dead.As Call of Duty tries to make the Joes feel like Pros, they are frustrating the Rambo Style Players.  In Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch, the enemies spawn all over the map...  especially right behind you.  You just hear Tak-Tak, and you are dead.  The plus side is that anyone should be able to get a few kills.  The downside is that it feels kind of cheap when you die like that.  As you play, you realize that the system rewards a powerful gun and some camping or slow methodical movement through the maps.  With many players focusing on their Kill to Death Ratios, you'll see quite a bit of camping.Also, the maps are pretty small and their layout is a bit maze-like.  It takes a while to get the hang of them and learn where the danger spots are.  The plus side is that there is hardly any downtime for dying.  You spawn pretty quickly and get XP bonuses on your next kill.If you really want to test your team skills, you'll have to play the objective based multiplayer games like Sabotage.  Your team has to take a bomb to the enemy base, arm it, and guard it for 30 seconds.  When it explodes, you win!  If the bomb carrier dies, the bomb drops and is free for anyone to pick up.  These types of objective based games are probably the best and most rewarding for the \"Tactical Players\" or the players who like \"Team Work.\"Graphics: 7/10Other video game franchises improve with each installment.  Look at SKYRIM, Gears 3, and Assassin's Creed Revelations.  As these franchises grow and improve, the Call of Duty series seems a bit stale.  The game doesn't look bad, but it doesn't look much better than the other games in the series.  One problem is that many of the textures are 'too clean'.  Lots of them look shiny and new, which seems out of place for a war game.  So, the game doesn't look bad, but it is falling behind the curve of the other great franchises.Sound: 10/10The music sets the heroic atmosphere and the explosions punctuate the action! If you're playing Call of Duty right, your neighbors will complain about the noise.Maturity:  MWar Violence, Gore, Language...  It's an interactive war movie.Replay Value: 7/10The Campaign is about 6-8 hours long depending on the difficulty setting.  It's fun... not groundbreaking... but fun.  It can be enjoyed solo or with a friend (split screen or online.)There are a ton of multiplayer modes as well.  But the shallow gameplay and insta-kill guns, really take the depth away from the game.  After a while, the Multiplayer Games don't feel rewarding.Overall: 7/10Call of Duty Modern Warfare is a solid game in a great series.  But it's not a great game in a great series.The next installment really needs to up the ante with some new gameplay or the fans will stop buying it.It's best enjoyed in small doses by people who don't have a ton of free time.It's also fun to play with friends.Buy it if you love the series and can overlook a few flaws.Buy it if you will take advantage of the Co-op, Spec Ops and Multiplayer Modes.Rent it if you want to blow through the campaign in a weekend.Rent it if you think you'll get tired of multiplayer in a week.  (Tak-Tak Dead)Avoid it if you are a graphics snob (Am I saying this about a Call of Duty game?)Avoid it if you love skill based multiplayer where you can dodge and win circle strafe wars.Avoid it if you are growing tired of the Call of Duty Formula and want a change.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2011"}

For those of you who may not be aware: MH3 Ultimate is a re-release of MH Tri, but with updated graphics and a ton of added content such as new weapons/armor/monsters/quests/etc.Q: What do I like about MH3 Ultimate?A: The new content does not take long to get into. Right off the bat you have access to weapons and monsters that were not in MH Tri. Being able to have HUD elements on either the TV or gamepad is sweet! The only thing I have present on my TV screen is my Health/Stamina bar. Everything else (i.e. my map, items, etc.) is on my gamepad.Q: What do I dislike about MH3 Ultimate?A: The game feels a lot easier than Tri. Monsters seem quite a bit weaker (i.e. take less damage to kill). Certain ingredients are now almost too easy to obtain.Q: How is the game's offline vs. online play?A: What's cool about MH3 Ultimate, is that you really have every reason to play both offline and online modes. In offline play, the game teaches you the ropes: how to gather, how to kill and capture monsters, how to craft, etc. Plus, your farm and fishing fleets can only be upgraded via single player, but can be accessed regardless of whether you're online or offline.In online mode, you can play with your friends and tackle monsters in groups, which you just can't do in single player. Another added incentive is that you can seemlessly take your character and all his/her gear between the two modes. Weapons/Armor that you earn offline, can be taken online and vice versa.Q: Does it cost any money to play the game online?A: Aside from what you already pay to have the internet? No.Q: How is the cross-platform play between Wii U and 3DS?A: Unfortunately, I don't know. I only own the Wii U version and seem to be the only person on Earth that has friends who don't play video games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0086V5V8G","description":"","reviewerName":"Andrew Gray \"Beezer Review\"","summary":"Harkens back to the Splinter Cell of old","reviewText":"Splinter Cell: Blacklist is the latest installment in the beloved series. With Splinter Cell Conviction, Ubisoft decided to make the game less about stealth and more about brute force. Sure, there was the option at times of using stealth but I never felt the need to use it. With Blacklist however, stealth plays a much bigger role. Gone are the days when it was ok to charge headlong into a room emptying clip after clip on enemies. While I enjoyed Conviction, Blacklist takes all the good parts of Conviction and adds so much more to it.For a game bearing Tom Clancy's name, the plot line is exactly what you would expect. Terrorists are threatening to destroy something and an elite group of soldiers have been given carte blanch to stop them. In this case, terrorists are threatening to destroy the United States by systematically taking out high value targets, or what they call the Blacklist -- things like energy, food; basically the backbones of the country. Sam Fisher of the elite 4th Echelon is tasked by the President to do anything necessary to stop the attacks. While the plot isn't spectacular, it serves it purposes to facilitate the missions and lead you towards the final encounter.From the first mission it's evident that there is an enhanced fluidity to movement. It's easy to slip into the shadows, mantle over cover, climb up a pipe and drop down onto an unsuspecting enemy. There is a certain satisfaction in sitting in one spot for several minutes studying enemy movements to really plan out a route that will either let you slip by completely undetected, or to divide and conquer without raising any alarms. Each mission allows you to complete it any number of ways; some force you to remain undetected while others encourage it by sending in swarms of reinforcements. It proves beneficial to not start large scale gun battles.One complaint I had with Splinter Cell Conviction was, while stealth was a game mechanic, there was very little true need to use it. That has completely changed with Blacklist. Sam Fisher can only take limited damage and when multiple enemies are attacking it can end very quickly. Planning before the mission is just as important. Deciding what gadgets and gear to equip before you put boots on the ground is imperative to making the mission go as smoothly as possible. There is a wide array of gadgets you can purchase with money earned during the mission such as smoke bombs, EMP grenades, sticky cameras, sleep gas grenades, etc. Depending on your play style, there is certain to be gear you will quickly fall in love with.Graphically the game looks good. On Xbox there is an optional HD Texture pack that can be installed from disc 2. It's approximately 3 GBs of data; honestly if you have the space just download it for the full effect of the game. Lighting and shadows are well done. The lights on Sam's suit flare when you are under cover of darkness. They provide a nice indicator so you are not left guessing if you are in the shadows or not. Likewise, the sound track and effects are pretty good as well. They won't win any awards here, but they don't detract from the game either, but with one exception. I have a surround sound headset which is perfect for a stealth game like this. However, on more than one occasion the enemies footsteps did not mesh with where the enemy was on screen. This created some frustrating moments when I needed to go off enemy positions purely based on sound.On top of the single player campaign there are two multiplayer offering as well. The first is the fan favorite Spies vs Mercs mode. Spies are elite, agile stealth-based characters who need to hack certain terminals, all done in third-person perspective. The Mercs and heavily armed, first-person based characters whose job is to stops the Spies from hacking or to kill the spy responsible for the hack before it completes. Playing as the Merc, there is always a sense of tension as you search for the spies, knowing at any moment you may be taken down by a lithe assailant. Conversely, as a Spy you know if you are caught in the open the fight will end quickly. There are a couple different modes within the Spies vs Mercs umbrella. Classic 2 vs 2, 4 vs 4, and then Uplink where there is a combination of Spies and Mercs on the same team. All three are high tension modes, but when you succeed luring an enemy into a kill spot and execute it to perfection, there are not many video game moments that can live up to it.The other multiplayer mode is 14 Co-op based missions. These appear as side missions during the campaign, and all but 4 can technically be done solo. Yet, playing through these missions with a partner adds an entirely new level of strategy, planning, and tension. Executing double kills, having a partner distract a guard so the other can sneak up behind them and eliminate them is so rewarding. I have never hid the fact that I love co-op games, missions, or stories. While Conviction had a Co-op mode, it was a self-contained story and felt more like an add-on. The co-op in Blacklist feels and plays so well. Enemies rarely do the same thing no matter how many times you play a mission, so repeating the missions with different play styles, or partners, still offers an engaging experience.I haven't enjoyed a Splinter Cell game this much since Splinter Cell Chaos Theory. Blacklist went back to the roots of what made it an outstanding game and added more variety and appealing gameplay. I have always been a fan of stealth-based games, a few games claim to be stealth-based but quickly become run and gun games where the only stealth is hiding when you are waiting for your health to regenerate. Blacklist is not one of those games. It's a game that forces you to plan ahead, and rewards you for good choices, and punishes you for rash decisions.ProsStealth, that actually works and is beneficialAmazing Co-op and MP modesFluid movementConsAt times audio is out of sync with events on screen, most notable enemy footstepsAt times the control scheme gets in the way of the gameSplinter Cell Blacklist is the stealth game that Conviction promised it would be. With solid gameplay, and fantastic level design, it delivers many memorable moments while not sacrificing its true vision. Allowing the player to play anyway they want through almost each mission, and still feel as though it was the way the developers intended it, is a testament to how much Ubisoft wanted to get this right. Blacklist is a deeply rewarding game for those who take their time, plan, and execute a strategy. If you are looking for a fast paced, run and gun shooter - you can play like that. If you are looking for a game where you can sneak past virtually every enemy leaving nothing but a shadow behind, you can play like that. If you want something in between those you, you can do that as well. While Conviction was a decent game, Blacklist excels as a stealth -based game with loads of replayability.

{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"Berlin L. Brown \"Ghost in the Shell\"","summary":"The most overrated game in the history of games","reviewText":"If you google on the article \"BioShock - Overrated Disneyland Ride\", I share many of the sentiments.  I just don't understand what game you reviewers were playing.  It sure wasn't BioShock.  I will try my best to not sound like yet another \"This sucks\"  kind of person.  The graphics are amazing; the spotlight lighting and shading is pretty advanced.  Sometimes the enemy characters are so in the dark, they are hard to make out, but their features look pretty believable.  I also liked the Big Daddy character mulling around.  The story itself is also ok; a little different from the humans against the aliens shooters we are used to.  But, I am paying $60 to actually play a game not to foam at the mouth for eye-candy.First, the gameplay is just so amazingly basic;  You pick up guns, ammo, plasmids and you run around the dungeon like environment as characters pop up or the occasional turret or flying thingy.  This may not be so bad except for the fact that you don't really get to use your full range of motions.  You don't ever have to attack somebody above you or below you.  It is a basic forward shooting, dungeon FPS (almost kind of reminded me of Doom 1).  Oh yea, all of that is kind of pointless because if you aren't strapped for time, you can just respawn and finish off your characters without any real penalties.Let's look at Halo2 or Gears of War, for example.  In Halo 2, you might have to take out a bunch of weaker characters close up and then snipe the more difficult ones from a distance while using your soldiers as bait.  In Gears, it is the same thing; you are ducking behind walls corners so you don't get toasted by the Boomers, hoping your friendly characters might kill something.  In Bioshock, I just kind of ran around clubbing people with the wrench because I never really had any ammo.  I was bored to tears.Not a big deal, but what happened to Animation sequences or End chapter sequences.  All I am getting is that silly radio message popup or maybe a diary message which I won't normally listen to.  Those aren't very exciting and makes it hard to appreciate the story.Maybe I am wrong, It could be possible.  I am flexible in my analysis of the game if you want to comment on it.And I am only at 60% completion, so maybe that other 40% is where the amazing part of the game is.  I don't know.  To be honest, I don't think I can continue.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"Sir Edmund Hillary \"Tenzing Norgay\"","summary":"A Different Perspective","reviewText":"I enjoyed everyone's viewpoints in the Amazon reviews. I thought it would also help the potential buyer to know things about this game that aren't highly publicized, but are important to note.Graphics - It's been compared to Gears of War as either being better or almost as good. This really depends on your perspective. Both games actually run on the Unreal 3 engine. Both games run at high frame rates and almost never stutter. I think Gears might look a little crisper, but the artistic design and lighting from BioShock is currently unparalleled within the XBOX 360 realm.Sound - In all of the games I have ever played (and I am sure there are games I am missing here), BioShock stands alone and has actually created it's own league. The 1940s music & score coupled with voice-acting that sounds like it's from a 1940s movie (as mentioned below), weapons/environment sounds, and 5.1 implementation are second to none at this point in the game development continuum.Gameplay - Here is where I would like to share a different perspective. The save at any time functionality, to me, is a good thing. I know some folks don't like it and say it lessens the challenge. I believe if you are in that camp, you have the freedom of saving less frequently thereby personalizing the level of challenge that's right for you. I particularly don't like doing the same things 15 times until I get it right. This promotes frustration and not satisfying challenges. With BioShock it is a necessity to be able to save at any time because you can experiment with different solutions in dispensing enemies. Each option is a joy to experience. Another under-mentioned fact is that the load and save times last only seconds allowing the \"save at any time/point\" functionality to be practical. Some games have extremely long save and load times, making the \"save at any time/point\" functionality a mixed blessing. Also the controls, while not revolutionizing the FPS/RPG-lite genre, are super tight. The controller layout is well designed & implemented. All these little game-play tidbits combined make this game great and head and shoulders above 99% of the rest.Story -The story is on par with the God of War stories in that it takes an old idea/story (Greek mythology vs. Jules Verne) and creates something totally innovative, dark, and fresh.Conclusion - This game is not Ninja Gaiden challenging, nor is it meant to be (Ninja Gaiden is awesome in it's own right). It is an experience that I believe really starts to straddle the line between a movie and a video game. I agree with Hieronymus below that no one will know what game-of the-year is until the year is up. This is going to be one of the greatest years to be a gamer in that there will be so many AAA quality titles released this fall/winter. It will be tough to manage your time and money on which games to own and play. Nonetheless, BioShock will surely be a top-tier contender and a must-own title for any XBOX 360 owner.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2007"}

Us and Them.","reviewText":"Well the reason i hate pc gaming now is all the bugs, clitches, DRM, Securom, having to download games now rather than pic them up at gamestop, and all the other garbage that goes along with copying games. I must admit i have downloaded a few in my time but i realized its just not worth it when you can purchase it and \"attempt\" to enjoy it from the store. Gamestop doesnt even sell PC games anymore, Best Buy is about the only place to find them. The main reason for its demise is that people never know when to stop finding ways to get around the games copy them for free and share them with everyone else. If people werent so lazy and cheap they would have jobs and go purchase games like real adult should. Music is a different story, CD sales may be suffering because of MP3 downloaded but thats because people want them because you just download it from here, or even for free. And no musicians are suffering or walking the streets broke because of it, they make there money on touring anyways. So back to computer gaming, the DRM, and Securom you find on most games doesn't even really effect how the game plays and with windows seven doesnt really slow down or damage anything at all on your PC. In my experience i only have one case when playing Dead Space, that it wiped out all of my songs from my hard drive because most i had downloaded through the years using Soulseek, a free download service. A game is worth paying for, to me, if you like it buy it, and play it. Music is different because people don't want to buy a cd that sucks or has 3 good song and then let it sit on the shelf and collect dust for years. I agree there are some shady deals gong down with having to be on the net, and spyware and actual viruses being put on games. The only hope you really have is don't order it but download it from direct2drive, or gamersgate, where is 90% of cases the DRM or Securom is removed because there is NO way it can be copied or burnt to disc. But as i said the reason for this is peoples dishonesty and just having to copy the game and then try to take it back or just share it with 100's of other people. Movies are slowly but surely dying as well with Netflix, Xbox Zune Videos, and PS3 Network. Its a shame but we live in a digital world now, and we have made it that way. So given that we have the ability and computer distributors knew burners had the means to do it, we have ourselves and also them to blame. Thanks Microsoft for ruining what use to be a thriving market. Now look at all the horrid reviews on 85% of PC games.Btw, the game itself is great and much better than the first, but no one else is bring that up and they are just ranting about the DRM and having to have internet to play, so i thought i would rant also.

The story itself doesn't get interesting until halfway through the game.  And then you get hit with a very important revelation.The story takes place in the continent of Spira.  Apparently this continent and its people are regularly terrorized by a monster called \"sin\".  The only ones who can stop sin are special people called \"summoners\".  The Summoners have the ability to call powerful spirits called Aeons, which they can command to fight on their behalf.  However, each Summoner must visit (pilgrimage) various temples distributed around Spira and pass the \"trials\" in order to earn the right to call the spirits.Character development is through a unigue system called the sphere grid.  The sphere grid system will be confusing at first.  But you will quickly learn how to use it.  I suggest acquiring a strategy guide, which you can order here at Amazon.  That might help you learn how to use the system without much hassle.The battle system is rather traditional.  Characters either hack, slash, bash, cast spells, etc.  Once in a while, after building up, a character can unleash a powerful attack called an Overdrive.  However, there is little variety in the types of attacks the characters can do.  If you like to hack, slash, bash, and cast spells, then I would recommend The Legend of Dragoon as a better alternative.My one complaint against this game is the sheer amount of repetitive random battles.  You cannot walk Tidus for more than thirty seconds without triggering a battle.  I saw very little sense in fighting the same enemies for the  20th time, all in the span of an hour.  Basically, time filler.  And, these random battles break your concentration away from the story and takes away some of the appreciation you might have in the fairly decent plot.  I recommend this to the more energetic gamers out there who may not necessarily be looking for a complex story in their RPG.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2003"}

{"product_name":"B0053BSNZU","description":"","reviewerName":"pennywyze","summary":"A big improvement","reviewText":"This game is a big improvement over the previous UFC games released for the 360/PS3; but I question why UFC 3 wasn't UFC 2 undisputed.The game features a huge roster, more weight classes, more fighting moves, smarter AI, a better career mode, a more polished look and tons of unlockables as well as the all-new Pride Mode.Here's my review-Graphics-The graphics are a bit more polished while the game itself features the same engine from UFC Undisputed 2009. While this isn't a bad thing, why not just update the entire game model appearance altogether?Sadly, THQ shoveled the same looking game to us and polished it a bit more. The frame rate is smoother, the fighters sport newer clothing, but one of the best updates to the game's graphical engine would be the cuts and bruises now actually look like actual cuts and bruises. Whenever you get a mouse around the eye  or if your head's split open, it really shows. When fighters bleed, they tend to bleed more frequently. However, after a round ends and they're back in the ring, they look a bit dolled up and the cuts seems to not be as significant no matter how bad they were. This is not always the case being that you can really make your fighter look nasty looking with severe swelling and cuts.Another update would be the camera, which seems a little better in my honest opinion. In addition to all the obvious improvements, the collision detection is much better in comparison to the the last UFC Undisputed game. (which I'm not a fan of)The Pride fighters roster looks pretty good and I loved the Pride arenas.With that said, my biggest gripe about this game is probably the replay. When you pound an opponents head brutally or submit them, the replay doesn't show any of this at all. It's the same slow replay that's been force fed the past two games which could show major improvement. The game still does look quite nice.Sound-I liked the commentary a lot better in this game than the last two. It seems much better paced and not so clunky. While Undisputed 1 and 2 had issues with commentary halting prematurely or just too much talking, the commentary in UFC 3 feels more natural. The sound effects aren't good and still sounds too \"light and fluffy\", but the music is pretty good.Gameplay-Here's where the game shines.The roster is huge; and I do mean huge. You also get new weight classes such as Bantamweight and Featherweight which include fighters like Dominic Cruz, Mighty Mouse, Kid Yamamoto, Renan Berao and others.There's also Pride Mode featuring legends like Mark Hunt, Bob Sapp, Henderson and such. Unfortunately, the Pride roster could've been deeper with more weight classes and fighters but it's the least evolved half of the game. I did like the fact that in Pride Mode you can hear Jenne Hardt aka the Crazy Pride lady announcer and you also get Pride rules and Pride arenas so it really is a separate mode altogether. The options are also updated in both modes.The control is smooth and responsive, you can even cancel moves mid arm/leg. But the biggest and best feature to this game would be the fact that fights last longer and the AI is much better. The fights aren't so robotic or stiff feeling especially since you're given newer transitional moves, fighting moves and positions. Basically, this boils down to a smoother and more authentic fighting experience being that you're able to ground and pound in different ways or do new takedowns.The system itself takes a few notes from EA's MMA game that was released although not quite as deep.Skipping beyond the fighting system, there's the career mode which I actually like a lot more than the previous games as well. You actually get ranked  and there's a win/loss system that actually does hinder or help your progress. You can also go up in weight class or lower depending on your weight class. Obviously, if you're a bantamweight, you can't go any lower in this game. In career mode, you'll fight your way through organizations be it pride, ufc, AFA and so on and the difficulty actually depends on what's recommended for you after the short length tutorial which isn't as punishing as the previous games thanks to better control. This career mode actually feels like you can play it any way you want to. Unfortunately, I didn't make a C.A.F so I used a roster fighter, therefore, I wouldn't know how deep the CAF is.In addition to Career mode, there's also Event mode, Ultimate Fights mode, Pride Mode and XboxLive. The online is this game is not good and with the AI being much better than the previous games, I could care less.The gameplay is really good, but I do have a few gripes, namely, about the roster itself.The heavyweight roster seems so bare. Featuring less fighters. The Pride Roster is too small despite unlockables and DLC. I'd of really liked to see a few more heavyweights than the ones featured. The good part is, this game does feature fighters like Melvin Guillard, Alistair Overeem and such who were absent from past UFC games or even DLC.Overall, I want to give this game 5 stars but a new engine would've been better than just a big update and honestly, everything done in this game could've been done in the second game which would've made this game even better. As far as UFC is concerned right now, this is the best UFC game to date and is definitely worth a buy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2013"}
