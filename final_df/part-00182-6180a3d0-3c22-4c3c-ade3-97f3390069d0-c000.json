{"product_name":"B0000A9Y11","description":"Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

It blends hack and slash elements, shooting, and adds a few RPG elements.Concept: 8/10In a world of High Fantasy, two mercenaries become entangled in a demonic plot to enslave humanity.  Using the Unreal Engine (Gears of War) this is a co-operative hack and slash adventure with light RPG elements.  There is a great deal of bow combat, magic, and melee combat.  In single player, you fight with a nearly invincible AI character who helps you out.  You can play co-op on split screen, Xbox Live, or linked systems.  As the story progresses, you battle your way through fantastic levels through a fairly long six chapter adventure.Story: 8/10Two mercenaries are visiting a familiar town when they notice something amiss.  Instead of hearing the boisterous laughter erupting from taverns and the mischief that typically follows nightfall, the town is unusually silent.  As they approach a tavern, they watch a townsperson get slaughtered by a wargar (orc).  Wargars normally stick to the woods and prey upon hapless travelers and to see one in the middle of town is unusual.  Too late, the heroes notice that the town has been overrun by wargars and they must battle their way through hordes of them.  But this is only the beginning, the story includes dragons, a powerful warlord, minotaurs, wargars, and evil sorcery.Warning:  There are 2 different endings to the game, depending on if you drink the Slag.  This is a magic brew that makes you invincible and gives you unlimited magic for a short time, but it tastes like EVIL.  If you drink it just once, you will be tainted.Graphics: 7/10Technically, the graphics look a few years old.  They're a bit muddy and the lighting is fairly bland.  The color palettes are also a bit too gritty.  It's like you're looking through a dirty glass.However, the art direction and imagination that created the fantasy world is really good.  There are ancient temples and ruins, medieval cities, foul creatures, dragons...  Throughout the game, there are some cinematic shots of fantasy settings (God of War style) and they really make you feel like you are on a fantasy adventure.Gameplay: 7/10The gameplay is simple.  Use cover and bow combat (Gears of War) to pick off faraway enemies.  Use blades and spells to vanquish charging enemies.  The levels are a bit like arenas where you encounter waves of bad guys.  This is not an auto-heal game and you can only carry a limited number of potions.  This greatly increases the tension.The combat does get a little bit repetitive, because you only use X for light attack and Y for heavy attack in 4 hit combos.  You can block, dodge, cast simple spells, and cover / shoot.  (This isn'tBayonetta)Levels: 7/10The level designs are well constructed and you do feel like you are on a fantasy adventure.  You'll battle through towns, dungeons, caverns, ruins...There are also side quests that involve simple puzzle mechanics and riddles.  Oh, those ancient ones and their riddles...  Always trying to see if the current generation is worthy...Design Flaw:  The Upgrade System requires searching for hidden objects, but some of the doors are one way, so it is possible to miss things and not be able to go back for them.RPG Elements:  3/10The upgrades are tied into items that you find (crystals) and you use them to purchase skills from a skill tree.  The skill tree is INCREDIBLY SIMPLE.  I guess the designers didn't want to scare off the shooter crowd...  But you only get 3 spells and 3 attacks and 3 more powerful versions of each.  Each spell and special move has 3 slots to upgrade.Fireball Example:Fireball 1 (Cost 2 crystals)a) costs less mana (1)b) does more damage (1)c) wider blast arc (1)Fireball 2 (Cost 6 crystals)a) costs less mana (1)b) does more damage (1)c) wider blast arc (1)Fireball 3 (Cost 11 crystals)a) costs less mana (1)b) does more damage (1)c) wider blast arc (1)Higher powers are also LOCKED until you reach certain parts of the game, so you sort of have to upgrade the way they want you to upgrade.  This game would have been much better if there was more to the skill tree like Diablo, Titan Quest, or Dragon Age.  Special moves, special stat boosts, defensive spells, exploding arrows, bank shots, etc...As you play, you also find magic weapons (bows, shields, and swords), but they have a durability stat, so after you use them X times, they become weaker.Sound: 8/10The voice acting is pretty good and you really get a sense that the characters are hardened mercenaries out for gold.  They also have chemistry with each other, which is rare in these types of games.  It's a refreshing change of pace from the \"lawful good naive students just out of the academy.\"  The action sound effects are pretty good and the music sets the atmosphere.  It's not a soundtrack that you'll remember later on (Morrowind, God of War) but it is good.Replay Value: 7/10There are 4 different difficulty levels and you can play co-op.  There is also a dungeon builder where you can create your own adventure.  You can link up to 25 rooms and fill them with rewards, punishments, and hordes of enemies.  You can play these online with friends.  It's incredibly simple to use and pretty fun.  You get enemy types and features by playing through the adventure and finding gold.  The gold is cumulative and you'll have to play the game twice to unlock everything.  The problem is that after a 24 hour campaign that has pretty simple mechanics, it does get a bit tedious.Maturity: TeensThere's fantasy violence and blood and some surly comments.Overall: 7.5Despite its dated appearance, game mechanics, simplicity, and slight flaws, this game is fun.  It's also about 24 hours long and if you have Xbox Live, the dungeon creator is fun to use with a friend.Buy this game (cheap) if you want a hack and shoot adventure.Rent it if you have 24 hours and you just want to blow through the campaign.  (once is enough.)Avoid it if you are expecting a Bethesda Style RPG (Oblivion, Skyrim, Morrowind), you're a graphics snob, or you love complex combat like Bayonetta.This is whatGolden Axe: Beast Ridershould have been, instead of the festering turd that it was.  If you like co-op hack and slash, check out Castle Crashers on X-box Live, or any of the LEGO games.  If you like fantasy RPG's, Dragon Age 1 and 2 are Ok.  If you like open ended complex RPG's then you'll love Oblivion and Skyrim.  If you want a great renaissance adventure, Assassin's Creed 2 + Assassin's Creed Brotherhood are great.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2011"}

Sleeping Dogs is a lot of fun, and seriously addictive. It may lack the complete freedom of GTA IV (no flying vehicles available), which I guess is still considered the benchmark for open world video games even 5 years on, but Sleeping Dogs is far, far more refined with superior graphics and details, as well as featuring a much more likeable protagonist.As I began to play I felt that the game was very similar to the True Crime games. I later learned that it was actually planned as True Crime: Hong Kong, before Activision cancelled it and passed it over to Square Enix who continued to develop it as a new title. So this really is the 'spiritual second sequel' to True Crime that we never got, and I have been accidentally referring to it as such. As far as I am concerned it is.The game stars Wei Shen as an undercover cop raised in California who returns to Hong Kong to infiltrate the mob. It's full of cliches but is highly entertaining and never once boring. There are a variety of missions including gunfights, fist fights, foot chases, car chases, boat chases, espionage, as well as multiple side missions and upgrades. Highly addictive stuff indeed. And bloody too, very, very bloody. Believe me, the game justifies the age restriction without ever seeming forced.I do have some complaints, like not being able to hail taxis and missing them every time you dash for them. Also there never any cars to hijack when you need them, meaning you'll have to run up the street hoping to block the way of a passing vehicle. The radio stations are not as humorous as GTA, but there are some nice tunes on there.The game is liberal with trophies, and features loads of DLC on the PlayStation Network, including two new missions sets.

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Justin Sanders","summary":"An amazing RPG with a long storyline","reviewText":"Needless to say that this game proves that there are good rpgs out there. The story is long in my mind (about 10-13 hours if you know where to go.) Because of its storyline replay value may be cut short. But regardless is a fantastic game.Darth Malak is the head of an seemingly invincible sith fleet and is on a conquest to exterminate the jedi from existance. As a soldier, scout, or scoundrel it is up to you as your story unfolds and it is up to you to either save the galaxy or conquer it.

Working in the proximity of the palace, Leonard stumbles on a plot to kidnap the enigmatic Princess Cisna. As he helps her escape he also becomes aware of his connection to a transformative power which allows him to take on the ancient shape, and harness the devastating power of the White Knight. Yet there are other elements at work here as well, including the forces of an evil wizard with powers that stretch back to the same ancient times which produced the White Knight. With the help of his friends and the power of the White Knight, these are the forces that Leonard will have to face in his quests.GameplayWhite Knight Chroniclesis a Japanese RPG (JRPG) centered around a turn-based battle system in a local single player story-driven campaign that is supported by online multiplayer functionality. Gameplay questing occurs from a third-person perspective and follows Leonard and up to three other AI companions, which can include the customizable character that players assume in multiplayer mode. Once quest members are assembled, players utilize the strengths of the overall group as a whole, and are able to switch between characters at will. Combat being turn-based, players must be able to cue up and control the actions of each character in quick sequence for each combat scenario faced. The game facilitates this via the Function Palette, located in its Battle Preparation menu, allowing players to prepare in advance a series of commands for each character to carry out. These can involve magic or weapons use and can be merged into combos. Multiple palettes can be saved, making it possible to optimize actions for specific types of enemies, and making for quick changing of commands. As with any RPG, throughout quests players accumulate experience which allows their character to level up, purchase items and abilities and generally grow stronger with an eye towards besting the increasingly challenging creatures, bosses and situations faced.Online MultiplayerAlong with a compelling single player campaign,White Knight Chroniclesalso contains an exciting online multiplayer component. Within this, up to four players can engage in more than 50 multiplayer quests, with each player creating their own unique customizable character which can be leveled up in a combined group effort, and take advantage of created items and new skills. Although unique to the online game mode, which is designed for multiplayer action, these quests can also be played alone if players wish. In addition to this functionality available in the online multiplayer mode also includes a variety of ways to interact with the widerWhite Knight Chroniclescommunity on the PlayStation 3 platform. Included in this is town building through the Georama functionality, which allows players to construct a town to their own specifications that can be populated offline with characters from throughout the single player campaign and then taken online where it serves as a base for quests hosted by players, as well as a persistent online location that other players can visit and buy items your town's population has for sale. The game also offers an online interface known as GeoNet that allows players to communicate with others via blogs, forums, quest logs and voice chat functionality, as well as post snapshots from their journeys using the Crystal Camera in-game tool.Key Game FeaturesWhite Knight Transformation- During single player combat players can transform into the giant White Knight, gaining the ability to challenge large enemies as well as troops of soldiers throughout the adventure.The Customizable Avatar Character- Using a wide array of sliders and customization options, players are able to create a unique character that can join the adventure in single player mode as well as online.Combo Battle System- Engage in an accessible, active turn-based battle system that caters to players of all levels allowing both default attack settings and a system for for maximum damage.JRPG (Japanese RPG) Action for PS3- Experience true JRPG action on PS3 that incorporates a variety of online gameplay elements.Beautiful Environments- Players traverse through 13 stages, as well as visit up to six towns/villages to visit and purchase items at shops or interact with NPCs.

Along the way, you're drafted into the kingdoms army to help fight off monsters and gigantic robotic armored suits to rescue the princess Cisna. Why are you, a wine delivery boy, with no formal training, magical ability, or even a remote tie to the kingdom or Princess willing to do this? Um... moving on...Graphics and audio are typical starry eyed JRPG to the nines. Awful dubbing and bizarre, choppy speech that are the hallmarks of virtually every bad game made since Final Fantasy. Backgrounds and character models, as well as cinematics are fluid and well produced, but the degree to which the characters speak like they have some kind of paralysis induced by learning a new word is laughably disappointing. Many scenes will proceed like this:Character A: \"...Its the &lt;Noun>.\"Character B: \"(whispered)...&lt;Noun>...\"Character C: \"(frightened whisper)...&lt;Noun>?\"Combat is innovative in that you aren't locked into the Attack, Magic, or Item routine. Different weapon classes have different skills, which can be setup beforehand into combos that are useful, easy to determine, and actually a challenge to pick and choose the right setup to get the best bang for your buck.The degree to which you can customize Protagonist is astounding, and you could easily spend an hour creating a borderline clone of yourself as an avatar. And just don't be disappointed when you have to flush all that work down the commode, as the REAL main character is Leonard, the White Knight, who was fortunate to have spoken lines in his cinematics.Overall, this is a major disappointment. Good graphics, a good combat system, and a tolerable story that made the makings of a solid 3 - 4 star game are completely crippled by the fact that your character is dealt off to the side with a deus ex machina that's as subtle as a gaping chest wound. I've never played a game where you're expected to create a character and have him wind up as the lackey to a high schooler.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"Moviedude","summary":"A solid game undermined by controversy and poor decisions","reviewText":"Diablo III is possibly the most hotly anticipated PC game of all time, and considering the huge following of Diablo II, it had some big shoes to fill. The game we got has ended up being very divisive- a lot of folks don't like it much, as evidenced by its rating here. I love it to pieces, but a lot of the experience SURROUNDING the game is hugely disappointing. I'll spare you summaries and just jump to the key points:GAMEPLAYThe area where D3 most shines. Gameplay feels a LOT like Diablo II, but a bit more dynamic and alive- knockback actually launches enemies (and you) into the air, there are dodge moves, and magic spells are a lot more diverse than in the past. The game feels even more arcade-like than its predecessor with big, flashy fights that are a lot of fun (if a little confusing at times). Purists aren't all happy with how skills work- unlike Diablo II you can unlock every skill for your character, and they level up automatically as you do. This means you probably won't build 3 or 4 barbarians for kicks, but it also means no more working on your character for weeks only to realize you built them wrong. Controls are slick and responsive.GRAPHICSDiablo III is a direct evolution from Diablo II artistically. That means you see everything from a locked 3/4 perspective; any zooming during cutscenes is lenticular and not physical. During gameplay you cannot zoom or rotate. This is all done to accomodate the clever use of sprites and low-poly models to simulate a much more detailed world than actually exists in-game. It works to a point. Outdoor environments look outstanding, and everything has a sort of painterly look to it. However here and there a tree will look a bit flat or a character model will show a rough corner. This game was in development a long time and it shows. I can't help but feel that the graphics also suffer so that the game can accommodate the weaker computers of Blizzard fans who thusfar have only played the lower-requirement World of Warcraft. That's great and all, but I don't like my experience suffering so Blizzard can double-dip on its fanbase.SOUNDIt's a Blizzard game. They do game audio better than just about anyone, except maybe Valve. Not really much else to say, if you played Diablo I and II you can guess about how this one will sound.MULTIPLAYERHere's where things begin to unravel a little. Multiplayer itself is fast and seamless- find your friends, join their game, PROFIT. But the general chat channel is full of spambots, and you will get constant friend requests from spammers. Welcome to the Blizzard social hell that WoW players have endured since the dawn of time. Crooked BS and suspect invites are so rampant that generally you will end up just playing with friends and gradually friending THEIR friends- a sad thing when starting a fully public game is pretty easy. But what should be a fun experience with neat strangers gets old fast when a couple scammers jump in your game.Two more downsides are that multiplayer servers hold only 4 people (half of Diablo II's limit) and PVP, a much advertised feature, does not actually exist yet.SUPPORTThe dealbreaker for many. Diablo III requires that you be logged into Battlenet to play. Battlenet undergoes more maintenance than Cher's bustline. If you were one of the thousands of people who skipped work to play on launch day you got a nice 6 hour break in the middle of the day when your game was unplayable. It's gotten better, but there are still outages, particularly in the EU. The number of times Diablo II went down for me? ZERO. Just saying. So far the always-online aspect SEEMS to at least prevent cheating, but then I only play with people I know.THE ENDGAMEDiablo fans know you don't beat the game in one playthrough- it now takes 4 thanks to a new difficulty, Inferno. Unfortunately, somewhere in your road to victory you will probably hit a wall. At level 60 you stop leveling and only improve through gear, which means eventually you must stop by the AUCTION HOUSE. 2 are on tap, a cash one and one that uses in-game currency. Both are grossly inflated. A lot of people resent having to buy and sell in order to progress, rightly saying that the auction mechanic hurts immersion and slows gameplay. I don't mind it but I won't call those people wrong either.OVERALLDiablo III is in most respects the game I wanted- an action-packed hack'n'slash with adequate graphics, great sound, and fun multiplayer. Could it be better? Absolutely, and given Blizzard's reputation for perfection (everyone forgets Rock'n'Roll Racing) that may cost it more points than it would another game. It's hard not to balk at all the Warcraft conceits slipping into Diablo, or Blizzard's dodgy servers, or how many ways the game feels scaled back. BUT it's still a Blizzard game, it's STILL Diablo, and it's STILL better than 9/10 of what's on the market. Here's hoping they keep improving it with patches, and the player base sticks with it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2012"}

I just saw 300 last weekend & since I bought this game yesterday I am really enjoying the God of War gaming experience. This game is incredible!! I believe that for the PS2 it will be the greatest game of the year. I own a PS3 & I am not kidding when I say that as far as graphics God Of War on the PS2 rivals some titles on the PS3. The control of the character has been enhanced from the first God Of War also. I felt the movement of Kratos was a little more choppy in the first title. In GOW2 the kill sequences are more polished. The transitions through the action button sequences that you enter are cinematic & cool to watch. I am at the beggining of the game but I am excited to see the next level & the powerups that Kratos will receive. The music is powerful as in the first GOW. The dialog between the characters is not cheesy as other games of the past. They actually have mainstream actors as the characters. T.C. Carson who played Kyle on the series Living Single is Kratos & he rocks, & Linda Hunt plays the narrator and Athena.

{"product_name":"B00149ILCK","reviewerName":"SB","summary":"My favorite sandbox!","reviewText":"This game is an incredible amount of fun.  It it as good as Assassin's Creed II?  Not really-- that game boasted a superb fight system & fluid controls & character animations that made it a complete show stopper.  However, one of the best things about Assassin's Creed, namely, its incredible evocation of a specific time and place, with a vast, gorgeous game world to explore and enjoy, is also the best thing about Saboteur.The romance of WWII-era Paris, the characters that are right out of Casablanca, or an Indiana Jones movie, and the thrill of re-enacting the fabled Paris resistance, with it's intellectuals and hand grenades, just cannot be beat!  The game world is just as rich and detailed as Assassin's Creed-- the city map is fully realized and shockingly accurate.  If you've been to Paris, playing this game is like a repeat visit, but with the added glamor and charm of the Occupation-era milleau.Personally, I prefer this setting and this group of characters to those found in the GTA games.  Of course, this game is highly derivative of GTA games, but that being said, there's something much more exciting and novel about this setting and theme than GTA.  Instead of wearing Timbs and blue jeans and a ball cap, our characters are wearing classic fashions of '40s Paris.  Instead of driving today's cars, they are zooming around in classic roadsters from the period.  Instead of stripclubs and taxi cab agencies, we get swanky cabarets and romantic, candle-lit catacombs stocked with contraband.The gameplay is also highly addictive, from the accessible, yet very challenging gunplay, to the auto races, to the varied missions that range from assassination to demolitions to rescuing hostages, there is hours of fun to be had exploring and wreaking havoc in Paris and the environs.Furthermore, this game actually has a very engaging plot and group of characters.  The story is well-complimented by cracker jack dialog.  The lines are always clever, and quite frequently laugh-out-loud funny.  The voice acting is great.  Of course it is campy.  The drama plays like the espionage elements from Casablanca or a classic Noir film.  It isn't supposed to be today's Hollywood version of \"realism\", instead, it is done in the style of classic films from the period when it was made.It isn't particularly ground-breaking, which is why I cannot give it a full five stars- I reserve that rating for games that really push the genre forward.  But that being said, The Saboteur is a fantastic game--comparable to/derivative of Assassin's Creed and GTA, but with a unique charm and intelligence that makes it really stand out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2010"}

Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular.

{"product_name":"B00000I1BR","description":"Let me go on record and say that I was never a fan of the original Crash Bandicoot. Even though Crash was disarmingly cute and fuzzy, and even though the game's graphics were just about as good as they got in those days, the frustrating design of the game made playing it such a painful experience that I still have flashbacks when I see small marsupials on the Discovery Channel. But just one short year after his debut, Crash is back in a sequel that is so far superior to the original that I'm willing to forget the mistakes of the past.The new storyline is simple: A very gullible Crash is corralled into collecting crystals for the evil Dr. Cortex and gems for the terrible N. Brio. There are 25 levels in all; each level contains an easy-to-find crystal and hard-to-earn gems. Instead of being forced to approach the game in a strictly linear fashion, you progress through a series of five warp rooms. Each warp room contains five levels, which you are free to tackle in any order. After you have found the crystals in each level, you can progress to the next warp room. This system of warp rooms is a great innovation; it's clear how to progress in the game, and yet you have the option of moving to a different level if you're hopelessly frustrated with one area. Best of all, you can save your game in the warp room at any time (a big improvement over the original game's horrific save system).A lot of variety is packed inside this game. You'll navigate through simple run-and-jump areas, try to outrun a very mad polar bear, work your way through sewer systems, and even fly around with a jet pack. Within each level, the basic gameplay is similar to the original Crash: Running, jumping, and spinning are still the order of the day. Even though most levels are set in a semi-3D environment, Crash Bandicoot 2 is a platform game, plain and simple. The graphics are in a league of their own among PlayStation games, and the music couldn't be better. Unlike the original, Crash 2 is rarely frustrating enough to make you want to throw your controller at the TV. In fact, some expert gamers might find Crash to be a little on the easy side.There are only two real problems with Crash Bandicoot 2. First, the semi-3D setup is sometimes hard to navigate, and you'll find yourself missing jumps because you're unable to judge distances properly. Secondly, the game is just plain cheap at times; in some areas you must sacrifice many lives until you memorize a level's layout.In any event, these problems are balanced out by the game's excellent gameplay and intelligent design. Crash Bandicoot 2 is a topnotch platform game. If you're a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to check this title out. -- John Broady--Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Everything that the first game got wrong; the second game got it right. The second game was released in 1997 as a PlayStation exclusive called Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back; obviously reference to Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. This game is also available on the PlayStation Store as a PS One Classic to be played on either the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable or PlayStation Vita for only $6 so I&#8217;d recommend getting that version if you are interested. Developed by Naughty Dog, published by Sony Computer Entertainment and distributed by Universal Interactive Studios, the second game was better than the first game in pretty much every way. The second game takes place immediately after the first one as Doctor Neo Cortex survives the battle against Crash in the first game and decides to use crystals to power the Cortex Vortex to take over the Earth. He decides to abduct Crash Bandicoot to gather the crystals making him believe he wants to use the crystals to save the Earth. We also meet Crash&#8217;s sister Coco who is suspicious of Cortex&#8217;s true intentions. Meanwhile, Doctor Nitrus Brio who was Cortex&#8217;s right hand man wants Crash to gather gems so he could destroy Cortex and the Cortex Vortex orbiting Earth so we are presented with many people wanting to side with us, all with different intentions.The gameplay is a platformer in which you control Crash Bandicoot across 30 levels to gather crystals and gems. The game takes place in a series of six &#8220;Warp Rooms&#8221; which as the hub areas of the game. Each Warp Room contains five portals leading to a level. The goal of the level is to obtain crystals and gems throughout the path. Crystals are placed somewhere along the path whereas gems are obtained by either destroying all the crates, or in bonus levels or secret levels; once you obtain the crystal or gem, you have to reach the end of the level, if you exit the level by using the start menu with a crystal, you will lose it. I guess they made it that way to be hard. Once you obtain all five crystals in a Warp Room, you then have to ride the platform in the center of the room to move to the next Warp Room, however you have to fight and defeat a boss character before gaining access. Ripper Roo is back as a boss who is one of the more interesting bosses as he goes from a genius scientist to a mentally unstable psychopath when Crash hurts him, I can&#8217;t help but laugh at this. Then there&#8217;s the fight with Tiny Tiger across floating platform that drop, the goal is to have Tiny be on that platform when it drops and in true cartoon fashion he floats in the air for about a second and then falls, I love that. I was kind of disappointed that the final boss fight was too easy, but whatever.The gameplay is like the first game except with new controls, Crash can now slide across the ground, perform a body slam, crawl on all fours and even slide across the ground and jump immediately to reach higher places. Some enemies can only be defeated by one of these methods so the game has strategy which is nice. The boxes are back which once again have to be broken in order to obtain extra lives and gems. But what&#8217;s nice is you can die and still get the gem without having to restart the level like with the first game. A new famous box is the Nitro Boxes which explode upon any physical contact, but fortunately there is a green colored box with an exclamation mark on it that will explode all the Nitro Boxes in the level once struck. The game also features bonus levels which contain hidden boxes, extra lives and even gems.As a kid, I played the s*** out of this game. It was only recently I managed to beat it 100% because it is both challenging and fun, but it&#8217;s easier than the first game so if you were expecting a greater challenge, you will be disappointed, but the controls, smoother gameplay and the fact you can save anytime you want as long as you are in the Warp Room makes this game a far superior game than the first one.FINAL RATING: 9.5 out of 10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2014"}

My favorite fighting game of all time. I started in the beggining, and can say that Tekken Tag is the best one. This game is good, but it is hard to follow up an act like Tekken Tag. There aren't alot of characters. I love the ones there, but they could of added more. Replay value? Once you beat it with everyone there isn't much left to do, except tekken force.Tekken force is NOT new. Tekken 3 had tekken force. This one however has better terrains. It isnt too hard, but it is rather fun compared to 1 on 1. I found that the length made it less enjoyable, I want to play the last level over and over, but instead I have to replay the first ones which take forever.Time attack, survivor, team battle, they the usual. New characters rock. Marduk is like jack replacement, I enjoy fighting him. Christie is, I guess they thought instead of having Eddie, they could make him more popular with a girl. This does make the game better in arcade though. Alot of guys, instead of using Eddie 24/7, have now decided to use other characters. Steve is probably the best thing about the game. Hes a boxer, and because of this, he has no kicks. He however, can dodge, which is the coolest and most fun thing in the game. You can duck all kinds of ways, spin around, sway, and you can combine them to have your character spaz out. The great thing is, you can actually dodge most attacks. Parrying is also pretty fun. I still love counter attacks, and this game made my love of Tekken rise slightly. Most players are turned off by Steve because he has no kicks. It is really fun playing against humans. Some of those kids at the arcade freak out and tell you to stop moving and such. Steve is really great once you learn the techniques.Almost forgot, sidestepping is much easier. Press up or down to sidestep. You can still jump and crouch, but with tekken 4, I have learned they are not needed really.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2003"}

Bet you can't have just one.","reviewText":"The other reviews and my own reviews onPlaystation Move Starter BundleandSports Championshave talked about how incredible the Move system as a whole is. This review will focus on the Move controller itself.Sony has done a rare thing--combining both great form with great function.From a design perspective, the unit is beautiful. Its smooth and round design fits into your hand seamlessly, and is much more comfortable than the blocky Wii remote. Most of your interaction will involve the large Move (squiggly line) button in front for your thumb and the Trigger (\"T\") button in back for your trigger finger. The familiar four Playstation buttons are within easy reach of your thumbs as well. The Start Button and Select buttons were a little hard to find (they're embedded on the sides of the unit), but you won't use them that much.The soft plastic white ball on top glows multiple colors. This isn't just for aesthetic purposes--it serves as the primary way the unit detects motion--the Playstation Eye uses the colored light to determine your arm movements (and allows you to play in rooms with dim lighting conditions, something the Kinect will be hard-pressed to match). When combined with the controller's internal gyrometer and accelerometers, it results in precision that's astounding. It's an amazing thing to wield a sword or a ping-pong paddle, move and tilt it, and have the on-screen animation match precisely what you'd expect in real life. The colors also serve to differentiate players on screen for multiplayer games (each players' on-screen cursor color will match their unit's glow).The unit also has rumble capability, which augments gameplay. It does not have built-in speakers like the Wii remote.One question that will come up a lot is: do I need multiple Move controllers? The answer is a definite yes for two reasons. The first is obvious: for multi-player games, each player will have to have their own. But even for one-player games, I strongly recommend getting a second unit. Looking at Sports Champions alone, while games like Gladiator Duel and Archery support one controller (it'll give you the option of using one or two), to have the full experience, you definitely need two. It's one thing to \"switch\" between using a sword and a shield, but it's a whole other thing to wield a sword in one hand and a shield in another.When I first heard about the Move, I was afraid that Sony would just ape the Wii. In some ways, they did borrow liberally from Nintendo's concepts. But I am impressed at how they took the technology forward. They've launched the first salvo in the \"motion control wars\". I hope Nintendo and Microsoft follow suit by introducing great improvements of their technology.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00BGA9V2Q","reviewerName":"The Bigmac","summary":"Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance finally gets a worthy successor on current gen consoles.","reviewText":"The majority of console titles being released nowadays are either first person shooters or sandbox games. Isometric Action RPGs, a genre so basic, so essential, I never thought would become scarce, hasn't seen a decent release on the current console generation in almost 7 years. Not one. Back in the PS2 era, the golden age of console action RPGs, we had the holy grail. Baldur's Gate: Dark alliance, and its more than worthy successor, Dark alliance II. The genre was so in vogue, even the Everquest universe brought a worthy contender to the table with the release of Champions of Norrath, and Champions of Norrath 2: Return to Arms. Oh, those were the days. I used to sit on the couch with my girlfriend (nowadays my wife) and play together for hours on end. Just us, exploring dungeons, marveling at the prospect of a dropped piece of armor or sword, which we would immediately  pick up and analyze in order to compare to the one we were wearing. Since the current generation of consoles was released, we have waited, and waited, and waited for a worthy successor of one of these games. And there hasn't been any. There have been flops like Sacred, or Dungeon Siege's console version but none that were remotely decent (with the exception perhaps of Lord of The Rings: War in the North. Technically NOT an isometric RPG but a brilliant coop action RPG game nonetheless, which filled somehow the void we carried as gamers for over 6 years). Enter The Lord of Destruction.The wait is finally over. Diablo III is that game. That worthy successor to Baldur's Gate: Dark alliance we had waited for (for more than half a decade mind you). From the moment you pick up the controller you can tell Blizzard nailed this port. It doesn't even feel like a port. It's like the game was designed with this control scheme in mind from scratch. Movement is fluid, combat satisfying. Everything is there. The search for better and shinier loot is just as fun as it was back in the PS2 with Baldur's. The co-op action is flawless. Minimap, skill trees, chests, weapon racks, everything you may have possibly missed is there, and then some.If there is maybe one department where the game takes a hit vs. the PC version are the graphics. They're not bad. They do feel a bit...cartoonish. But they're totally current gen. You just can't compare the graphics of a current PC (even a mid-range one) with the graphics of a game, running in 720p on a console like the PS3, released 7 years ago, and already on it's way out. If you have never seen the PC graphics, these will look totally OK to you. Nothing to write home about but not bad by any stretch of the imagination. And my only other gripe with the game (now, this is a minor thing and I'm definitely nitpicking), is that I  wish 2 players playing local co-op could enter their inventory at the same time instead of player 1 having to wait while player 2 compares 10 different kinds of armor in order to be able to enter his inventory, or at least, there should be an option to enable this. I'm rocking a 55 inch screen, there's plenty of room for both player's inventories. If a player has a small screen they could disable this option. The upside is when my wife is going through her inventory, I get to see everything she's carrying and sometimes a weapon or piece of armor catches my eye so she gives it to me and viceversa so it's not like it's super boring or anything like that. Like I said, I'm definitely nitpicking. This game is seriously awesome. I can't wait to see what Blizzard does with this game on the PS4. Even if it's just a graphics overhaul, I'll buy the PS4 version in a New York minute and play it all over again (Heck I intend to play the PS3 version all over again several times). Just take my money Blizzard. Keep releasing games like this on the console and keep taking my money. And I hope this game sells like hotcakes so publishers realize there IS a market for this genre on the consoles, and that gamers like us will buy anything you release in this genre as long as it plays this nicely.Now, don't get me wrong, I love first person shooters as much as the next guy, but sometimes a gamer needs a break from that. No online lobbies, no 8 years olds yelling at the top of their lungs threatening to quickscope me or anything like that. Just me, my girl, the couch and the dungeons (wait, that sounded a bit kinky. But I digress). Sometimes you just want to sit on the couch with a friend, relax, and just have some fun. Sometimes, we need to get back to basics. And what a glorious playground Diablo III is for that purpose. Welcome home Lord of Destruction. What is thy bidding my master?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2013"}

This game you see your perspective go every which way while you're running around the levels just like you do in real life when you go running. Many many games have since copied this feature, but Mirror's Edge was the first to really do a good job at it.Also, in a first for first person games, gun shooting isn't the emphasis. I did end up shooting some guns, but for the most part I went through the game unarmed and I fought armed guards with just my fists.hand to hand combat is high risk high reward. You can do jump and slide kicks. But get close and the enemy will take a swing at you. If you hit a button at just the right time, and you only have like a 1 second window, you grab the weapon, knock him out, and disarm him.Which is pretty cool. But it is also unforgiving. Miss the first grab and you're going to die and have to reload.The art style is striking. Most games are gritty. This game is bright and clean.Unfortunately, the game is very linear. So basically in the game you're trying to figure out the path the developer laid out for you in the game. What you are not doing is using her parkour skills to be creative and making solutions.This seems to be a problem in many games which give your character fantastical movement powers. The developers don't really know how to keep things real so they just make them very linear. An open-world mirror's edge where you scampered across buildings to get to mission points or just wander around the city would have been great.Still, no other game is really like this one.

The offered more modes such as a realism mode which only allow headshots for kills and a scavenger mode in which you have to fuel up a vehicle as fast as you can. I find the zombies pretty cool. The jockey is one in which jumps on you and will ride. Charger is one that will bullrush you. There is one I can't recall the name but spits out acid. All of these new zombies provide more challenge and more enjoyment in vs modes.The game isn't noticeably too different from the last but it provides melee combat by the use of chainsaws, bats, swords, and such. There is new items to use such as an adrenline rush which makes you a bit faster and able to withstand some damage for a short time. There is an item to revive dead teammates. These and other things help give the game more strategy. Of course with all that said, there is new guns to gain and even laser sights for better aim. If you loved the last than you will enjoy the sequel. It is very fun and is one of the best multiplayer games you could play outside of Modern Warfare 2,Borderlands, and what Uncharted 2 offers.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2010"}

Enjoy the big budget bonanza","reviewText":"With so many crap shoot publishers like EA, it is nice to see SE pouring money on its pinnacle title. This review is without any spoilers, no worries. I have played a big portion of the game, WOW WOW WOW. The game is awesome smooth and grand. The initial portion is more like a hybrid of Western action title and JRPG. You are pushed down a straight path, similar to Gears/Uncharted. Move into an area, clear enemies and move on the next. It feels very refreshing as you will be constantly introduced to new skills and upgrades. By the time you get the entire arsenal and understand the combat system it will be 30 hrs in and the game opens up at the right time. If it had opened up a little earlier, you will be left to scratch the head. So it is 30 hrs of story & combat building and 30 hrs of exploration. Perfect balance. You will never notice that you have already spent 30 hrs in learning the combat mechanics as it is very deep and satisfying.The battle system is the best we have ever had in any RPG before. Yes we have seen slow mo shooter this and that, nothing this deep and well flushed out. Every battle requires a different strategy. You can't go all offense or defence and win every thing. Every monster you fight requires you to think and solve like a puzzle. You need to setup different paradigms. Simply put they are sets of characters with specific jobs and abilities. AI is very smart and they can take care of them selves. It took so long for AI to be independent and not run directly into line of fire. You will be switching in and out of paradigms multiple times during the fight. Try different combination before settling down. Combat is a visual spectacle. Every animation is so meticulously done, you have to appreciate the work that has gone in.There is lot of mis-information about this game. None of the JRPGs seem to get good scores this generation. Great ones are dinged and crap shooters are given 9.5 and 10. The first half is about the story and second half is traditional JRPG. By the time you unlock all the trophies and yearn all the skills it will be 200 hrs of game play. Nothing is more satisfying than getting five stars on each combat situation. It is slightly more on the action side than character development. But it seriously deserves better treatment that what meta-critic is showing.Don't miss it. Yes we have a abundance of AAA titles. But nothing this grand and epic. If it was a book, it will be 700 pages. It is one of the well flushed out stories that you can find in digital entertainment. Romance, valor, sacrifice, friendship all add up to a very satisfying epic novel feel. I felt lucky that I was able to borrow and play the Japanese version. SE has redone the lipsync for English version. Voice acting and script is top notch.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2010"}

The sound effects go from fitting to odd and overall sound quality is simply OK.Overall, it's not a bad game. It's just another example of a typical JRPG.

I have owned Playstations since they first came out in 1995.  Originally I was planning to buy the PS4 at launch and then found myself canceling my preorder.  Why you ask.  It has to do with a lackluster demo unit I tried.  If your going to sell a console at least give demos of several games.  Needless to say I was holding out and had no intention of buying a PS4 any time soon.  Two games getting delayed at launch made it a lot less attractive to me.  Considering my time with the PS3 is mainly using the Amazon instant video app I couldn't justify the $400 purchase of a new console.  It wasn't until I began reading all the positive reviews my mindset began to change.  When I saw these available for purchase I new I had to jump on it and I am so happy I did.The Playstation 4 is really a seamless entertainment experience that shows how smooth a console can operate.  The PS3 only gave a minor glimpse of this future.  This is really a console that is meant for the gamer.  Of course it is family friendly also.  The seamless transition from the front page to playing a game takes away the tense feeling that came from waiting and waiting for the PS3 to boot up a game.  Now everything quickly comes together in such a way that and impatient person like me can be happy.  I do know there are some features that need to be added bur right now I am so happy with this console.  The games are a step up and will only get better.  As of right now I have only had the chance to try three games and so far so good.  It's not mind blowing but it is impressive.I really do enjoy the new features like the Playstation app that puts control on your phone.  it's good to see SONY is finally embracing some of the newer technology and helping make the PS4 future proof.For those of you on the fence I can say the PS4 is a great investment.  Please don't except amazing games as of yet.  This is a very well made console that I believe will last without breaking on most of you.  Unlike the PS3 that seemed to get loud and overheat the PS4 is quite and sometimes it's hard to know it's even on.  In the coming months several games are planning to be released that I believe will help demonstrate the power of this console.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S.

{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Paul Arellano \"Last Days on Earth\"","summary":"What's It Like?","reviewText":"When the PSP first came out, I was going about my merry way in Best Buy checking out the latest PC games. Then this salesman from Best Buy approached me and asked me if i wanted to try the PSP. I own two PCs, a GC, a PS2, and an Xbox. After about an hour, I bought the PSP and here's why:1)Graphics: Good graphics. Good resolution. A bit sensitive to too much light. When playing in the daytime with the sun up, you might have issues seeing what's on the screen. Too much light creates an odd reflection that kills the image on the screen, and what you see is your face. Some slowdowns when too much activity going on in-game. Otherwise, the graphics is way better than any handheld i've played.2)Weight: The PSP is quite heavy for a portable. It weighs close to...hmmm..a discman and a half. It will put some strain on your wrists and your fingers. The weight adds some stress to how you hold the PSP, thus creating some discomfort on the fingers and palm.3)Battery Life: as many have said it only lasts 2.5 hours. not true. my PSP lasts for about 4 hours just playing Ridge Racer. Be careful when booting down the PSP, sleep mode will make you think the PSP is completely turned off. When turning off the PSP make sure to push and hold the power switch for at least 4 seconds to shut off the power completely. Pushing it for a second will take you on sleep mode only.4)Price: for $250.00 I think it's worth it. You get all the perks for a device...movies, mp3, wi-fi, usb. it's ok5)Format: UMD is a sony format. Nobody else does UMD. Sony is famous for writing their own formats for their gadgets. the MiniDisc uses Atrac3 format. So it is with UMD...which by the way PSP I think supports Atrac3.6)Overall: Good system, sleek, and durable. I dropped my PSP and it still works. One advice: always put the PSP in it's soft case (comes with the value pack) if you're not using the device.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2005"}
{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"The Gifted One","summary":"Sony PSP, the new king of handheld gaming?","reviewText":"Many have tried, but no one has ever been able to go toe to toe with Nintendo when it came to handheld gaming.  Nintendo's GameBoy has been dominating the market for over a decade now.  So in March 2005 Sony decided to try and take a slice of the handheld market with the PSP.  After owning one for 7 months, here's what I think of it.HARDWARE 4.5/5The system itself is a beautiful piece of hardware.  The first time you watch a movie on it or play a game, you'll have a hard time believing that it's actually a handheld system.  The system is laid out almost like a PS2 controller, however it lacks a right analog stick and the two rear shoulder buttons (L2/R2).  Though the PSP doesn't quite have the power that Sony made it out to be (saying it's visuals would dwarf the PS2 itself), it looks as if it were a generation or two ahead of its rival the Nintendo DS.SOFTWARE 3/5This has been the main topic of discussion about the PSP since its release.  The problem is that developers are making so many ports of PS2 games for the PSP rather than original titles.  This isn't completely bad but it makes many gamers think to themselves \"Why buy a stripped down version of Socom when I can just play it on PS2?\".  The first six months of the PSP's lifespan saw very few notable titles outside of Lumines and Untold Legends.  Recently things have started to pick up.  X-Men Legends II, GTA:  LCS, and Tales of Eternia (Import Only) have gotten me to play my PSP more often these days.  GTA was the PSP's first big hit game.  Whats really hurting the PSP is the lack of a true RPG title.  The current so called RPGs (Legend of Heroes, Popolocrois, Kingdom of Paradise), just seem far too generic and way too many flaws to make an impact.  Tales of Eternia has had me glued to my PSP for the past few days but that game is a European import.  A major RPG from Square/Enix would really give the PSP the spark that it needs.  All other developers would then follow suit.EXTRA FEATURES 4/5The biggest extra feature of the PSP is its UMD movies.  How or why the movies sell so well is still a mystery to me.  They are usually more expensive than DVDs (a new release is usually $24.95), they can only be played on the PSP, and they don't include special features (even though I could care less about features anyway).  The movies do look amazing though.  It's like a plasma screen in the palm of your hand.  But even all of that isn't enough to make me want to buy lots of UMD movies.  The PSP is also capable of playing music.  Even with a 1GB Memory Stick I find it a bit impractical to use as a music player (I'll stick to my IPod).  It also stores photos and they look brilliant on the PSP.  The PSP can even hold full DVDs on its memory stick in the MPEG-4 format.  If you want to take advantage of this feature then I'd really recommend you get at least a 1GB Memory Stick because the 32MB one that Sony supplies is only good for game saves anyway.  The last great feature of the PSP is that it has the ability to store and play NES, SNES, Arcade, Genesis, GBA, and many other games on your PSP.  This is only possible if you have a version of the PSP that is 2.00 or older.  I won't tell you how to do it, just do a little research and you'll find out easy enough.All in all I think the PSP is a pretty good handheld system.  I prefer it over the DS myself but that all depends on you.  The game lineup has been fair thus far but we need excellent.  It's far more powerful than the DS no question, but the PSX and PS2 proved that it's the software, not the hardware that makes a system successful.  With that I still have one question.  Square/Enix what are you waiting for?  The PSP needs you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2006"}

What I discovered while doing so is that this game is actually pretty fun.Most of the achievement points are obtained through playing online in the different multiplayer modes. There are the typical deathmatch and team deathmatch as well as a few objective based games (sabotage, capture the flag, ect.). The variety of modes to play online and the variety of weapons helps to keep this game entertaining for quite some time.Also, I tried out the offline story co-op with my brother. The main story on this game is not very good, but it is alright to play through and  I found it to be a lot of fun playing through it on co-op. The game also has increased difficulty modes if you are good at the story mode. The problem with these modes is they are annoying if you fail for the lack of checkpoint and the number of objectives that you must complete perfectly. Of course, that is what makes these difficulty settings so challenging (the enemy AI is never really all that great).For those of you who are curious about the achievement points, it is pretty easy to get the ones for playing online with some time spent playing this game. You only get points from the story mode if you complete the whole story on a given difficulty, but you get points for beating it on both single and co-op modes.This game might not be so great in todays terms, but since you can get it pretty cheap now it might be worth picking up. If you're looking for some shooter fun online or some co-op play with a friend this game is a good way to get it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2007"}

Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions.

XML II leaves the good stuff alone and works on all the stuff that caused players so much grief, and the result is a truly great game.The improvements over XML I:1. Characters actually go up to level 99 now.2. There's many more skills to play with now.3. A \"hero chest\" now allows you to keep extra items in your inventory.4. Items are more varied and more useful.5. Characters are more varied and aren't just tanks or ranged attackers anymore. Also, certain combinations of characters/costumes give team bonuses.6. AI is vastly improved.7. So is the flying mechanism - still takes energy, though, but now it's a smooth use and can be negated by leveling up focus powers (unlike Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, which just did away with the energy cost and penalized energy regeneration rates instead, which works SO much better).8. Boss fights are much more clean.9. There are varying difficulty levels...10. ...and you can use your characters from a past game in a new one.11. The Blink Portal, once unlocked early in the first real level, lets you teleport back to base at almost any time, but there is a 5-minute minimum between uses. It's a good compromise between infinite quicksaves (too easy) and not seeing a save point for 45 minutes in a tough level (like in XML I, which was frustrating as all heck).And, a few downers:1. The glitch - keeping too many items in your hero chest/inventory causes the game to freeze. Easily avoided, but annoying and definitely something that should have been caught in development. I have both the PS2 and GameCube versions, and the GC version was particularly nasty - I had to keep both the chest and the inventory half-full lest I glitch, whereas on the PS2 it was fine as long as they both weren't totally full.2. Some characters from the original have been severely watered down - I'm looking at you, Storm and Jean. And the central character from XML I - Magma - isn't even mentioned in XML II, let alone playable.3. Too many characters are \"mental resistant,\" making telepathic/telekinetic attacks near-useless.4. Ultra attack chits are still notoriously hard to come by early in the game. (fixed in M:UA - you slowly earn ultra attacks by dealing damage)5. The rationale for unlocking costumes is still pretty arbitrary (another thing they fixed in M:UA - you earn them by defeating enemies the character or beating their Danger Room disc).6. Combos are much harder, and thus the Leadership skill is much less useful.All in all though, XML II is a fun game, and the unlockables will keep you busy and interested enough for at least two run-throughs. A must for any X-Men fan who is a gamer, and for people who like action games in general.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2008"}

Anyway, I didnt start playing Final fantasy until just recently (2004)I've owned an NES since 1990 but I never even thought of buying Final Fantasy until I saw a TV show about it on G4TV! Since then, I've played all of the following Final fantasy titles; Final fantasy, Final fantasy II, Final fantasy mystic quest, Final fantasy VII, Final fantasy VIII, Final fantasy XI, Final fantasy I & II dawn of souls, and Final fantasy IV Advance. Out of all of them my favorite title was FFII for the SNES,why? Because FFII had the best story and charecters of all of the other Final fantasy titles that I've played so far! Unlike in FF1,you dont choose your players, you just start out as one and meet more from there!The Heros: Cecil the dark knight, Rosa the white mage, Kain the dragoon, Cid the Engineer, Yang the Monk, Rydia the summoner, tellah the sage, Edge the ninja, and Fusoya the sage.The Villans: Golbez the dark wizard, 4 Elemental warriors, a brain-washed Kain, and a slew of other enemys each more sinister then the last!The story gets better and better as the story progresses! I wont spoil it for you,but one of the coolest moments in the game is when Cecil discovers that Golbez, the most fearsom fiend in the game is not the one behind all of the chaos! Plus, Golbez's true identity is revealed! (No, he's not Cecil's father.) All and all this is my favorite Final fantasy so far, I highly recomend buying it! BUT BE WARNED! Final fantasy I & II dawn of souls does not include this title! So if you want to play this and FF1 you'll have to buy them both!For more details read my Review on Final fantasy I & II dawn of souls.

I was flabbergasted at first, but quickly lost interest as the &quot;unique approach&quot; of the game wore off.The &quot;unique approach&quot; for this game is the training of a creature that you use as your Titan to watch over and convert the worshippers at various villages.  The supposed A.I. of the creature becomes simple programming after you figure out how most of the creatures are meant to behave.  Furthermore, the storyline, puzzles and sub-plots included are interesting at first and add to the overall experience but these too become tedious as they aren't interesting enough to make the game last.This game is capable of an online multiplayer versus mode.  I never tried it and it seems like a game that is better suited to the stand-alone (the game itself) version rather than a multiplayer matchup as the story is what the programmers used to try and push the game over the hump.  It would still be interesting though to play a multiplayer game considering this isn't your typical shoot 'em up or strategy game.  Furthermore, explore the internet as there are additional creatures to play that you can download.  Also, there are the usual amount of bugs in this game (perhaps more than some first releases) and as I write this review, the patch for the game is only in beta stage. (Being tested.  The patch is downloadable at the company's website but there is a disclaimer for it.)While I liked the game but didn't think it was good enough to be considered a &quot;classic&quot; I can see how many people would thoroughly enjoy this game.

All are good, but the portable console isn't shaped like a console controller. This means no wrapping on the extended grip. When pushing in L and R buttons, there is nothing to resist or push back, which means the console also get pushed in. With shooting games (e.g., Uncharted, Unit 13, Resistance, etc), I don't feel as secure unless my hands and wrists rest on a table or other firm surface.

of the lyrics are messed up too.i read a book called \"beatles songs\".it had every beatles song with its lyrics and actual quotes by the beatles as to what they were about.in this game,at the beginning of \"come together\" the lyrics on this game say \"shoot me\" over and over.all john says is \"cha\" a bunch of times.john lennon was actualy shot and killed as im sure you know.is this supposed to be ironic?it comes off more like a sick joke!another place is at the end of \"i am the walrus\".there is a low voice in the back chanting about drugs.on the game,they babble nonsense.the drum playing is erratic.it feels like the programmers threw together the timing without actualy paying attention to wether or not it would feel like rythmic drumming or repetitive untimed  sporadic rapping.the graphics are astonishing but i cant see them because im playing the game.it seems like someone went through a lot of trouble to make this game beautiful for someone who wasnt looking.a LOT  of really good songs were left out.if i had made this game, i definately would have included more songs that everybody should hear like \"in my life\"  \"yesterday\"  and \"let it be\".plus i noticed that of thier 27 number ones,quite a few were missing there too like \"all you need is love\".now after all i have mentioned,you are left with a very easy,relaxing,fun music video game.the songs are ,of course,timeless.the experience is great.its a great distraction from your hectic life and all those other video games that hurt your head from making you think too much.i LOVE this game.i like rock band 2 as well,but this easily the superior choice.its easier.you dont have to gain fans because they already adore you when you get to america.its less like loud ,screechy,screaming,incoherent forgotten stuff from the rock band game and more like everything every musician and music game ever aspired to be.in closing i would like to say,i have a list that would rock for a sequel\"ps i love you\"\"misery\"\"till there was you\"\"and i love her\"\"yesterday\"\"act naturaly\"\"michelle\" its so pretty.\"elanoar rigby\" would be tricky to sing and play.its also very pretty.\"in my life\".its a song that is uplifting to everyone\"im only sleeping\"\"when im 64\"\"a day in the life\".the musical changes would be a new challenge.\"strawberry fields forever\".this was johns self proclaimed masterpiece before he did \"imagine\"\"piggies\"\"the continuing story of bungalow bill\"\"all you need is love\".they did this song for one of,if not the,biggest radio broadcasts in history at that time.they said they needed a message that everyone should hear.\"blackbird\" for its excellent slide guitar.\"happiness is a warm gun\" for its ever changing vocals.\"sexy sadie\"\"good night\" because its beautiful.\"here there and everywhere\" as is this one.and then the medley from \"abbey road \" as the finisherand \"let it be\" and \"the long and winding road\" as bonus songs.and at the very very end.it should be the last thing john says from thier last album \"let it be\".\"on behalf of the group and myself,i hope we passed the audition\"this is the greatest rock band game ever.i hope bob dylan,the cure,black sabbath/ozzy osbourne,jimi hendrix,janis joplin and kiss all make one soon.this game is great for everyone even if you grew up in the 20s with jazz or in the 902 with grunge rock.and for anybody who doesnt like the beatles i say you shouldnt call yourself a lover of music,because you are clueless on the subject.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2009"}

As such, \"Double Dash\" for the Gamecube had a lot to live up to.  Luckily, the game rises to the challenge and perhaps even surpasses the original.Though the controls and even some of the courses are basically the same as the N64 version, the addition of multiple characters per \"kart\" is a welcome addition to the franchise.

The first open-world title exclusively for the PlayStation 3,infamousis a single player action/adventure that places you in the role of once regular guy, Cole, who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers. Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both? The choice is yours ininfamous.caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Everyman turned superhero Cole.View larger.Devastating electricity-based powers.View larger.Go anywhere open-world design.View larger.An organic urban environment.View larger.StoryEmpire City was a run of the mill metropolis, until one day a massive explosion rips through six square blocks of its bustling downtown real-estate, seemingly leveling everything and everyone in its path. Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

The days of the very first Mortal Kombat game making its debut were originally surrounded with controversy with the constant blood and gore the game consisted of, along with the ways to finish your opponent with what were called Fatalities.History aside, back to review. When i heard that the Mortal Kombat re-boot was in the works, i thought the game was gonna be another fail expecting me to think the game was gonna be good. I was very disappointed with the MK's that came to ps2. I am very happy to say that this Mortal Kombat, a next-gen update of the famous classic exceeded every expectation i had. The story mode thats added to the game was a nice change of pace considering there shouldve been a story surrounding the arcade phenomenon. Fighting the A.I. can be frustrating when it comes to the Ladder or Story Modes, so putting the difficulty on Beginner really shouldnt be that shameful. :)Other than minor flaws that exist here, the game is still a Klassic that is bloody, violent, fun, and satisfying for every Mortal Kombat fan everywhere. The only reason why i think some are rating this 1 star is either A: People put the game in their console and fell asleep before the title screen showed up, or B: Blood and violence is just too much for some people to handle.

The side quests in this game are even worse than the previous game, and the running back and forth to get to each fight sequence is even more pointless than the last time around.If it wasn't for the amazing graphics and animations this game would be complete garbage.  The fights leading up to the boss battles are way too easy, and then the difficulty cranks up ten notches for the boss battles.What annoys me even further is that once you get to fight with characters in their super duper powerful form, the controls turn to complete trash.  I just don't get it.  I don't understand what they were trying to make me (the player) feel when going through the story, but it really just consisted of thoughtless travel from point A to point B, a ridiculously easy fight sequence here, and ridiculously hard (but fun) boss battle sequence there, then some story progression.This game is longer than the previous, and I appreciate that.  What I didn't appreciate is the meaningless stuff that you have to do besides all the fighting sequences.

Just Cause 2 is an absolutely amazing in every aspect. I think \"Eidos\" who is the maker of this game could school many of the other game makers who release sub-par games for the PS3. In my opinion this is the best game ever developed by far. It simply blows away the competition! Just Cause 2 just goes to show you what can be accomplished when you utilize the powerful PS3 processor and use a little imagination.Game play takes place on the huge island nation of Panau. Rival gangs are battling a ruthless and oppressive regime. You work to gain the trust of each of the gangs and complete missions for them. The gangs will then assist you along the way and even supply you with weapons and vehicles at the start of most missions.The island nation of Panau is about 600 square miles, which is beyond massive for a video game. You can explore the entire nation however you please and you can also complete missions in any order. Your main objective in the game is to create chaos but destroying government facilities. As you create chaos your score will build and you will unlock additional missions. As you complete missions you will also unlock new missions.There are over 100 air, sea and land vehicles to choose from. Many of them have multi-point movement so you can drive or hop into a gun turret or even ride on top of the vehicle. There are many different vehicle types to choose from including motorcycles, dirt bikes, four wheelers, cars, trucks, civilian helicopters, military attack helicopters, civilian jets, military fighter jets, huge jumbo jets, tanks and armored personnel vehicles. You can explore the air, land water and underwater environments.The environment is very destructible, you can totally destroy vehicles, buildings, enemies and landscape. In fact the game encourages you to cause carnage and rewards you with chaos points.Weapons include single and dual hand weapons, RPG, grenade launchers, explosives, turrets, vehicle mounted weapons and you can use your grapple hook as a weapon as well. The grapple hook can also be used to quickly pull yourself across the map whether on foot or flying through the air with your parachute. You can even grapple onto vehicles like helicopters; pull the driver out and takeover the vehicle. There is so much that you can do with the grapple hook like grapple onto a person and hook the other end to a vehicle and watch him get dragged down the road. Or even grapple a person to a pressurized tank and then shoot the tank and watch the guy go flying and eventually blow up.I have been casually playing this game for about a month now and I am only at 22% completion on the medium difficulty level. I don't expect I will get tired of playing this game anytime soon so when I eventually complete the game I plan on starting over on the hardest level.The only thing I would ever change about this game is to add online multiplayer support. It's rumored that they might add this option at some point but I haven't confirmed it yet. I hope the rumor is true because it would be incredibly fun to play online against other players.Update: Free downloadable ice cream truck on PSN (Playstation Network)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2010"}

It's such a return to form for the franchise, and it's great to see a Sonic game with both 2D and 3D elements.  All the levels are cleverly designed, and you can tell a lot of work went into them.  At times, I felt like some of the levels were just way too fast-paced, but hey, this IS Sonic the Hedgehog we're talking about!The time travel element to the storyline is pretty good, too.  You can get through the main story in a good day or so, but the collectible items and achievements really add a nice touch to it all.  The only minor issue I had with the game was the final boss.  I found that level to be a little odd, and it took me a few tries to find out exactly how to beat it.  All you have to do is keep holding down the X button to boost and dodge all the debris.  When I found that out, this level became the easiest boss stage in the game.The challenge gates are a very nice addition as well, and they keep you busy even after you beat the game.  I didn't collect all the items and pass all the challenges, though, but if you're an achievement getter, then you should definitely attempt the extra levels.All in all, this is a very fine game, and a work of art as far as Sonic is concerned.  5 stars","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2012"}

This version is an excellent portable fighter with a huge cast of AAA characters, tight controls, and a good amount of modes. Online play is what will keep you coming back for more, but the fighting engine has a few issues that most hardcore fans will hesitate to admit.The story is pretty much a dead throwaway. Galactus is a super giant trying to destroy the universe, but Marvel's and Capcom's are colliding and that's about it. Sounds kind of like Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe right? Ignoring the lame story, you will probably dive right into arcade mode and the first thing you will notice are the 40 some odd characters. They are all here! On Capcom you have Frank West, Phoenix Wright, Amaterasu, Chris Redfield, Albert Wesker, Tron, and tons of others. Marvel's side has Dr. Strange, Electro, Spider-Man, Wolverine, X-23, Thor, Hulk, She-Hulk and more. These are all awesome characters, with each their own unique moves, hypers, and combos. The game is built off a 3-on-3 engine so the game gets really hectic. I wish I could only use one character, but you can't do it. Pick three of your best because each work off each other in tandem.The way the game uses all three characters is pretty crazy at first. New comers will be overwhelmed by the over complicated combos and controls. I had more fun with the simple control scheme because no matter how much I practiced I just couldn't truly master any character. Even if you go into the mission mode you will probably get stuck on every character somewhere. The button combinations are just ridiculously complicated, and this goes for most Japanese fighters like Soul Calibur. The simple controls shrink everything down to special moves on one button, combos on another etc. This was more fun because I could pull of crazy combos without much effort. The Vita version has a third control option and this is using the touch screen. This is probably for children because you just tap away at the enemy and your character automatically pulls off combos and hypers, but it is usually the same combo over and over again.Hypers are both cool to pull off and to look at, but not so fun on the receiving end. Some combos can go in the 50+ range if you pull off a hyper. Depending on how many of 5 levels your hyper meter is you can do some serious damage. Have it high enough and you can pull off a super hyper which uses all three characters. These will almost wipe out your entire health bar. There are a lot of technical terms with the game that will take a few hours to get used to. There is jump cancels, super jumps, and all sorts of lingo that only hardcore fans will take to heart.After you spend some time button mashing in the arcade mode there is a whole Heroes and Heralds mode that is kind of like a campaign mode where you slowly conquer areas. You get a hit list sheet, and if you get 5 in a row you get an A rank card. These cards have abilities that will be equipped with your fighters. The cards take a while to learn to read and understand what each ability does. Some will let your character auto-block, or at level 2 hyper you can jump cancel automatically at the cost of a bar. It's all pretty in-depth and complicated, but some tinkering around and you will get used to it.The online mode is where all the fun is at, and it is just as fun on the Vita as the consoles. Not much to say here but that it is online. Watch out because you will get your butt handed to you by most players. In terms of other modes the game doesn't really have any, but the online mode should keep you busy for quite some time. The visuals are pretty stunning with lots of effects, great looking character models, and I didn't experience any frame rate hits.Overall, UMvC3 is a great package on the Vita, especially with Cross-Play on the PS3. The graphics are great, the controls are tight and responsive, but the touchscreen controls are disappointing.  I would have liked to have seen some mini-games, or maybe a few extra modes just for the Vita, but as it stands this is a pretty good PS3 port. If you love hectic, in-depth, and complicated fighters then look no further.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2012"}

I enjoy the updated maps but I think they should've been add-ons at a later date.  I want some actual new maps.  Over 3 months into the game now & there's still been no word on any future add-ons.This game is only playable online & the lag is quite ridiculous most nights.  They always seem to be working on this problem but still don't have it fixed.Being able to follow people is a pain.  At first the only way you had available was to message people (through the PS3 messages) & tell them where to go.  They've changed it a little bit so now on the main PS3 screen you can kind of see where people are.  There are only so many spaces though so if they are in a long titled lobby & room then it's still not possible to know exactly where they are.  Yes, you can send invites but that's a pain as well because you can only send while in the lobby & that's if you have time after the screen finally loads.I enjoy playing most game types.  You have Demolition, Suppression, Control, Extraction, Escort & Breach.  A new type for this game is Elimination where you can't win a round unless you eliminate everybody on the opposite team.No vehicles.  That's a bummer.  & you can't make ranked rooms.  There are some pre-set ranked rooms but it gets pretty old playing the same stuff over & over & getting stuck with night maps all the time.  You can make your own rooms but they will be unranked.The headset- Don't care for it.  It's not comfortable AT ALL in my ear.  I sold it.  The only really nice feature is that it tells you when you are on/off mute.  I use my other Bluetooh headset & people say I sound the same on either one.Overall I still enjoy this game but I think they're dropping the ball.

This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"A more than worthy follow-up to Resident Evil 4","reviewText":"When Resident Evil 4 was released back in 2005, it was exactly what Capcom's beloved survival horror series needed: a kick in the tail.  Completely overhauling the series' archaic controls and trite puzzles, Resident Evil 4 ended up being one of the absolute best action games to ever see the light of day.  Now Resident Evil 5 is finally here, and from a technical standpoint, the game is a sight to behold.  These may be in fact the best graphics to be seen in any game on the market today, with beautifully rendered visuals that are simply eye-popping.  The core mechanics from Resident Evil 4 remain intact here, as you play as RE1 hero Chris Redfield and new character Sheva; both of whom are investigating the African nation of Kijuju, and eventually are faced with hordes of infected villagers, mutants, monsters, and other nasties, including good 'ol Wesker.  The game is loaded with enough balanced moments of action and tension, and having a partner only makes things even better.  Seriously, adding a partner opens up some new dimensions to the gameplay that helped make RE4 so good, using teamwork to take down the baddies and watch each other's backs as well, which simply just makes the game more fun.  The only true flaws of Resident Evil 5 lie in its online capabilities.  Online co-op has it's share of problems, including not being able to exchange weapons with a teammate, as well as having to wait for the host to restart from a previous checkpoint or get to a new one before jumping into the action.  Still, flaws aside, Resident Evil 5 is a sheer blast of an action game and a more than worthy follow-up to Resident Evil 4.  It isn't perfect and doesn't leave the lasting impression that RE4 did, but it remains a stunning technical achievement that delivers the goods, and with the promise that Capcom will be re-vitalizing the series once again in the next installment, the best may very well be yet to come.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"ShoppingGeek","summary":"Astounding!","reviewText":"I just ordered my first xbox when the price dropped, and I got a half-dozen games at the same time. This is my huge favorite. I tried all the others, but now I never want to stop playing GTA4 to play the others.It is very challenging. I must try most missions several times to succeed in them, and that is usually with tips/videos from the Internet.Words of warning: The instructions are pretty weak and some times just plain wrong. (e.g.: Sniper rifle scope zoom is done with the left stick, not the right one as shown under Controls in the program.) That's why I often have to go online to get info about how to do things.After popping $100 for a steering wheel, I was disappointed to learn that GTA4 doesn't support it, and driving with the joystick is far from easy, but eventually you get the hang of it, though it always remains awkward.Words of advice I haven't seen elsewhere:(1) You get around by jacking cars (hence the name), either parked or waiting at a light. Before jacking one, do a quick look around for cops. Sure, you can get away from them, but why waste the time? One of the most fun things in the game is trying out different rides. If you spot a limo, for example, follow it around until you get a chance to jack it. You can run the streets in dump trucks, armored cars, sports cars, SUVs, city busses, motorcycles, even forklifts.(2) Drive like crazy unless you want to spend all your time sitting in traffic. The cops won't stop you for speeding, hitting cars/people/objects, etc. Other cars will usually try to avoid you.(3) When being chased or chasing, don't go any faster than you usually do. The worst thing you can do is go too fast and crash, then the cops get you and/or the bad guys get away from you.(4) You get money for each mission completed. Before starting a new mission, go to the firearms store and stock up, including body armor, then go back to your safehouse, stopping to eat if your green health bar is down. Once in your safehouse, head for the bed and you will be asked if you want to save. Save your current, fully-stocked status. You will probably bomb out of missions the first couple of times you try; the game lets you try again, but minus whatever weapons, ammo, armor, vehicles, etc., you lost. If you saved, you can instead easily start fresh and fully equipped by clicking Game-Load on the Pause menus.Six months later: After playing a number of other shooters, I would say that GTA4 does have a major design flaw, which is that when you fail a mission, you must start it over from scratch. Many missions have 3 parts: a chase/follow sequence, followed by a gun battle, followed by escaping the police. It decreases the fun when you have to keep repeating, say, a long, somewhat boring chase/follow sequence, and perhaps a long, diificult gun battle just because you died in a hail of bullets in the ending cop-escape sequence. If it let you begin again from the start of the sequence in which you died/failed, GTA4 would be perfect, IMO. An example of how to do it right:  Bioshock.Also, the penalty for getting capture by the police is far too great -- you lose ALL your weapons, plus some of your money. You are much better off dying, where you lose only some money to the hospital, but sometimes Niko just raises his hands and gives up and there is nothing you can do.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2008"}

With all that said, this is probably going to be one of the better 2D games you'll see on any of the current console platforms. But that is where this also falls short, 2D games are great, for retro collections, or even for original content, but in this case a Konami greatest hits would have been much more fun, with all the Contras, Castlevanias, etc. This game would have benefited from an upgrade to 3D, like Capcom's Maximo for PS2, or like Nintendo's Metroid Prime, for the GameCube. Contra collectors should pick this title up, but don't expect much.

{"product_name":"B0028ZNX68","reviewerName":"Dmitry Kristal","summary":"The good folks at Activision have done it again!","reviewText":"Please Note:  This is an extensive review that covers the controller, as well as the actual gameplay.  For those who are familiar with the turntable controller and want to see the review for gameplay only, please go directly to the \"Gameplay\" section.The Good:*Ability to customize your music and adding your own style and flavor to the mix.*Lightweight turntable-controller that is very responsive.*Lots of music to satisfy your song tooth with 102 songs, 93 exclusive mixes, including many genres and artists.*Ability to play online and local multiplayer, with 2 turn-tables or a turntable and a guitar(not included.)*Many stages from around the globe, which is mixed in with the colorful graphics you know and love.*Advanced and unique controls that are not hard to master, which brings out the DJ in you.The Bad:*Could take time getting used to the controller, especially if you are new to music games.The Turntable:*Dimensions:  14x9x1 inches*Weight:  About 3 Pounds*Power:  2 AA batteries*In addition of being a turntable, it can also act as a regular controller, which includes the \"A,B,Y,X\" buttons in a corner.Controller Experience:Apparently the video game music life doesn't end after \"Guitar Hero,\" and Activision presents \"DJ Hero.\"  Before start playing, you should decide how you want to handle your turntable controller.  Unlike with Guitar Hero, where standing up was a great alternative to sitting, it is really impractical to stand with a turntable.  Three of your possible choices are: Placing it on your lap; Sitting on a floor with it OR putting it on a chair or a small table, which will give you more of a \"DJ Feel.\"After finding your comfort zone, you should really spend a few moments familiarizing yourself with the controls and even consider visiting the tutorial.  One difference you'll notice from the guitar controller is that you are no longer feel tethered to the strum bar and that there are only 3 push buttons on your platter, instead of 5 that were on a guitar.  On the left side you will find an effects dial and a crossfader.  For the most part, you will be using your right hand to tap the buttons, as well as \"scratching,\" by moving the platter up and down vigorously.  There is also an effects dial knob(resembles a radio tuner,) a euphoria button and a crossfader control(left-to-right slider) on the left side of the controller.  As I played it for about 2 hours almost non-stop, I noticed some slight stiffness in my joints.  Therefore, you should take short breaks during those long gaming marathon sessions.Gameplay:One thing I really like is that you are no longer tethered to any type of strum bar that the guitar had.  However, the multitasking of this game is very challenging, especially at the higher difficulty levels.  One great thing about this game over Guitar Hero is the customization and flavor that you can add to the mixes.  With Guitar Hero it is more of a follow the script gameplay, where all you do is touch the notes you see on the screen.  However, with DJ Hero, you have an opportunity to add your own style to the mix.  Turn the effects dial left or right during a prompt to add different styles.  Crossfader will force your slider to go left or right.  My favorite one is adding special effects in the middle of a mix, which can be police siren, horn, zap or other sound that you choose.  If you are doing well, you will have the option of pressing the \"Euphoria\" button, which will open up more options as you try to get a higher score.  There is also a rewind feature to unlock.  Once unlocked, if you mess up and feel like going back, you can spin the platter backwards and actually re-do a small portion of the song.  It feels like a cheat, but it is a good feature to have if you are ever distracted.  So now that you are a DJ, does this mean you have to put away your guitar from Guitar Hero?  Not at all!  Multiplayer actually allows you to partner up with a friend and do a DJ+Guitar performance.  Of course, the guitar will not have the fancy controls that the turntable does, but it is still fun to play together.  In terms of songs and mixes, there is something for everyone here:  Eminem, 50 Cent, Beastie Boys, Motorhead, 2Pac, Black Eye Peas, Marvin Gaye, Foo Fighters and even names like Vanilla Ice and MC hammer make the list.The Bottom Line:If you are already a fan of Guitar Hero and similar games, there is no reason why you shouldn't enjoy the heck out of this title.  Other casual gamers who like music should enjoy this title.  Nobody is really too old nor too young to play this, which will also make it a decent family game as well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2009"}
{"product_name":"B004FSE52C","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"An Action-Adventure-Stealth-Horror-Exploration-Drama!","reviewText":"You know a game is great when you are sad after you finish it.  I wanted more.Concept:  10/10Reboot the Tomb Raider series with an engaging origin story of Lara Croft.  Set the game in an open world jungle with tons of hidden secrets and animals to hunt.  These things give you currency and XP, and aren't just thrown in there as an extraneous exercise.  Use tactical combat with stealth, melee, and an arsenal of upgradeable weaponry.  What's not to like?Story:  10/10Lara's first adventure!  She's off in the Dragon's Triangle on a mysterious island cursed by an ancient Storm God.  The island happens to be inhabited by mercenaries, indigenous cannibals, and things that are much worse!  Her crew gets stranded on the island and they need to battle their way off of it.  In the beginning of the story, Lara is a young, well-educated girl.  But the vicious conditions on the island transform her and she must hunt, kill, and scavenge to survive.  The entire adventure is a desperate struggle for Lara and in the end; she is transformed into a survivor.Graphics: 10/10The cavern, ruin, and jungle environments provide a creepy / dark setting well suited for a horror game.  The characters are very well rendered and show emotion.  There are weather effects, supernatural storms, and explosions; and they all look amazing!Gameplay:  9/10The gameplay can be summarized into three basic categories:  Exploration, Puzzles, and Combat.  The environments are very interactive and Lara can climb, use zip-lines, break destructible objects, burn things with a torch, and crawl through tight spaces.  Throughout the environments are hidden relics, character journals, GPS devices, and mini-challenges.  One upgrade for Lara gives her a type of item detection, where collectibles highlighted and visible even through walls.  So, this is less of a nightmarish Easter Egg Hunt, and more of a challenge to get to the Collectibles.  And remember these things give you XP and currency!The Puzzles are easy enough to where you don't get frustrated and just complex enough to where you feel smart when you solve them.  When you enter a secret tomb or puzzle area, you can press LB to highlight the interactive objects.  There may be a very heavy bell on a rope and behind that is a rotted wooden door.  Suddenly, it becomes obvious.  You need a way to swing the bell into the door to shatter it.  It's pretty simple, but you still feel good when the door smashes open!Lara is equipped with a bow and arrow for silent kills, and some guns.  Shotguns for close range.  A pistol for head shootin'.  A machine gun with a grenade launcher.  All of these weapons are upgradeable with a variety of different additions:  More damage, faster rate of fire, more accuracy, etc...  The shootouts with enemies are fun.  There is cover and enemies will pop out and shoot.  Occasionally, an enemy will throw dynamite or a molotov cocktail to make you run for cover.  Some of the cover is destructible as well.  Lara also has a dodge/evade + stun/kill melee combat system.  Dodge an enemy strike and get in position for a lethal blow at the push of a button.Sound:  10/10The music is very atmospheric, the voice acting is very well done, and the sounds highlight the creepy environments or punctuate the action!Multiplayer:  5/10There is a multiplayer mode where the survivors fight the Solari (evil storm cult).  There's Deathmatch and some objective based games which involve moving through the map and holding an area.  As you play, you level up and unlock perks and gun upgrades.  There's also a great deal of environmental navigation in the maps.  But overall, the gameplay feels clunky and the matchmaking sucks.  There's also some host migration which will pause the battle and occasionally drop you.  If you like multiplayer, there are so many other games that do this better.Maturity:  Older TeensThere is some swearing, some gun play, and some suspenseful situations, like cowering in the dark while heavily armed enemies are hunting you.  There are some fairly gruesome deaths for Lara if she falls off of a cliff and lands on spikes, or gets caught by a sword wielding enemy and stabbed through the head.  It's the stuff you see in rated R action or horror films, but not the stuff you'd see on a TV show.Replay Value:  8/10The campaign is 12-20 hours depending on if you rush through the game or explore the large environments for loot.  There is a multiplayer mode, and it's not great.Overall:  9.5/10This is the Tomb Raider game that fans have been waiting for a decade.  It's GREAT!  Great Story, Great Character Development, Great Gameplay, Great Graphics, and err... semi-crappy multiplayer.Buy it if you are a Tomb Raider Fan.Buy it if you love the Uncharted Games.Buy it if you like action / horror games.Rent it if you have 12-15 hours to finish the campaign.Avoid it if you need great Multiplayer.Avoid it if you don't like horror.If you played this game and liked it, I highly recommend FarCry 3 for the environments and action.  Bioshock Infinite for the engaging Story.  Red Dead Redemption for the open world and gritty story.  And the Witcher 2 for horror elements.  I also highly recommend the Uncharted games for the PS3!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0001NBNGG","description":"The creepy tale of a possessed Japanese village (Hanuda) told through the eyes of ten playable characters in combination with some impressively innovative gameplay&nbsp;features should totally make my day&nbsp;&#8211; but playing Siren turns out to be sadly different than I was expecting.The game's two big features: sightjacking (where you see through the eyes of other characters) and the Link Navigator (which manages the plot's order of events) sadly don't add to the player's experience enough to justify their problematic existence.Sightjacking is more fun to mess around with than it is helpful to the player. Watching the paths of roaming enemies can offer useful information, but the stealth mechanic is so simplistic that the data is rarely necessary. In many situations, being seen by enemies is something that you can't avoid or recover from &#8211; they will find you, and they will kill you. This is fine by me, but when the only stealth-orientated skill that is offered is a painfully slow crawl (and a distracting yell, which had little to no effect that I could perceive), it doesn't make me want to be all that sneaky. There isn't a sound meter, no real way to know if enemies can see you or not (like a vision cone or shadow meter), and very little chance of distracting them with diversions. It is more fun and more efficient to just run through levels and see what happens than to use the sightjacking feature to suss out a plan of attack.Which leads to discussion of the game's other big feature, the Link Navigator. Siren's storytelling plan sounds like a survival horror Real World season: Pick 10 characters to escape the apocalypse and find out what happens over 3 days through 78 missions &#8211; you could call it Siren: Hanuda. The complication is that the order of events is jumbled and the Link Navigator is supposed to help you keep track. What this means, from a player's point of view, is that the game's story doesn't really get its hook into you &#8211; not even in the first few hours. The tales are too disjointed, the characters too many, and the plot too slow in getting going.The more conventional aspects of this game like sound design and graphics are also something that people will have mixed feelings about. The creatures' insane, maniacal laughs are honestly unnerving, and therefore good for this game. The graphics look to be actual pictures of the characters' faces and lend a realistic, but still skewed version of each person &#8211; they're detailed, but strangely flat. I think that this is a nice subtle touch, but others may disagree.I really, really wanted to like Siren, but in the end, I just didn't have much fun or feel like the innovative parts of the game were used to their advantage. It has good ideas, and I'm glad to see experimentation in survival horror, but this should be chalked up as a failed test in the genre.Concept:Navigate a horrific village as ten different charactersGraphics:Muddy and jerky&#xC2;&#xA0;&#8211; but it fits with the disjointed feel of the gameplaySound:The best part of this game, the sound effects are creepy and (for lack of a better word) ickyPlayability:The context-sensitive menu system is&#xC2;&#xA0;counter-intuitive and the stealth mechanics are pretty archaic and basicEntertainment:I really need a reason to care in a game this cerebral and slow-paced, and Siren doesn't give it to meReplay:ModerateRated:6.25 out of 10Editor:Lisa MasonIssue:May 20042nd Opinion:From a conceptual standpoint, Siren is chock-full of ingenuity, and is a soaring success when it comes to the delivery of unusual ideas. Forming a mental bond with your attackers so that you see the surroundings from their perspective is a great idea that leads to some unnerving situations. This gimmick only goes so far, however. I found its functionality, and the entire gameplay package for that matter, to be clunky, and above all, frustrating. I grew so disenchanted with trying to pick up enemy sight that I avoided using this technique whenever I could. I love the episodic approach to storytelling &#8211; but the execution of gameplay bothered me to no end.Rated:5.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Review Lover \"ReviewLover\"","summary":"Huh.","reviewText":"Why oh why didn't I get Fatal Frame 2 instead??Not that Siren is a bad game; quite the opposite. It's just that there are far better examples of survival horror and tactical infiltration games available than this.I'll explain.The Plot, briefly, concerns a handful of survivors who have to get out of a small inland Japanese town, which, for reasons yet unknown, is now overrun with Zombies and other such nasties. In the time-honoured Survival Horror tradition, you must employ various keys, guns and whatever else is handy to make good your escape.The graphics are beautiful in places, and, even at their worst, still do the job nicely. Sound is good, even if the voice acting is sometimes a little hammy, but certainly isn;t half as bad as some people would have you believe.So far, so predictable.Where Siren differs from others in this vein is in its approach to the gameplay, and this is both good and bad. The story is played out in a series of short-ish Missions or Chapters - and there is a new ability to 'Sightjack' - to see from the point of view of any enemies or allies in the immediate vicinity. Both of these ideas are excellent, and a welcome change to a genre where, if the story's no good, neither is the game. Sightjacking, in particular, adds a new and creepy dimension to the proceedings - Log onto an enemy to see if they can see you, and wait for your reaction :-)Similarly refreshing is the fact that your characters are as brittle as real-life people. They cannot fight or shoot very well, or generally stand up to much physical punishment at all. This too adds huge amounts of tension to an already atmospheric and chilling scenario.And, if the control system wasn't such a yowling, sluggish, disobedient dog of a mess, then 'Siren' would rank alongside Fatal Frame and Silent Hill 2 as an all-time Great. Sadly, this isn't the case, and trying not to smash your expensive PS 2 pad against the wall/console/friend/whatever is nearest at the time becomes the greatest challenge in completing the game. It's woeful - slow and unresponsive, and, in a game where fifty per cent of your chances of survival hinge on your ability to react quickly to unexpected scenarios, this is a huge, unfair problem.I can't give this game 5 stars, much and all as the new additions and innovations are highly commendable. If you are a patient person with the stomach for oftentimes-repetitive gameplay, then Siren is for you. If not, then go with Fatal Frame 2 or wait for Silent Hill 4.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2004"}

Well, my impression has changed a lot now that I'm really far in the game. First thing I've begun to notice is it's impossible to get 100 percent completion. This is because Monster Hunter was made to be for multiplayer, you can only go so far solo.Towards the end giant monsters start fighting you in twos or threes and usually do 1/3 your health in one hit. Lets not forget that you're being timed to boot. If Capcom would have gotten rid of the timer then I can see these types of missions being possible by yourself. Thing is when there's only 50 minutes on the clock and three opponents that take 20 minutes a piece to drop it's rather hopeless and actually quiet frustrating. If you don't care about completing a game 100% solo, or have a friend to co-op with, and don't mind timed missions then you're ok because this game is pretty fun. For someone like me it's a darn shame... A really darn shame.  Also note there are still a few glitches here and there when playing. I've had monsters throw me into walls and I would free fall for like five seconds, then get up to have them do it again. Then there's the almighty unresponsive roll [B] button that has a mind of it's own. To top it off the swimming system is still a mess. They did add a monster lock-on feature in Ultimate, but that only helps a little when fighting under water. Imagine controlling a joy stick and a D-pad with only you're left thumb. Another frustration. Anywho without getting into the narrow weapon system or missing level up system Monster Hunter Tri Ultimate is an ok game. Also the graphics and 3D are top notch. This is a fun game for down time and welcomes gamers thirsty for a challenge. A word of warning.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2014"}

Before this game was released, many people didn't know much about Shadow the Hedgehog and his mysterious past. This game would show people just what they were missing out on.The story starts out when we're introduced to Shadow thinking about his past. It is while wondering who he is and where he comes from, he notices aliens falling from the sky and destroying a city before his eyes. At the same time, he meets the leader of the aliens: Black Doom. Black Doom tells Shadow that he can reveal his past to him if Shadow gives Black Doom the seven chaos emeralds. From then on, the way the story goes is up to you.Oh, and did I mention the swearing? That's right; Shadow the Hedgehog contains a mild amount of swearing in its storyline and even when you die or get hurt. Such a fact remains controversial for parents of children who own this game.There are three ways to finish a level: you can be the hero, the villain, or a neutral hedgehog in the midst of chaos. When you are in hero mode, you will team up with Sonic or another Sonic character and do good deeds--such as killing aliens. When you are in the evil mode, either Black Doom or Dr. Eggman will instruct you do either do their will or kill humans. In neutral mode, your job is to either make it to the end of the level or grab a chaos emerald.In terms of gameplay, it plays almost exactly like any ordinary Sonic game--but with a few tweaks here and there. First of all, Shadow can use weapons scattered in his surroundings: a very controversial fact among Sonic fans. He can also use the homing attack, yet there are a lot of places where--instead of doing a homing attack--you'll send yourself flying to your death. Finally you have the spin dash, which isn't very useful in this game except for when you're trying to squeeze through tight spaces.After beating every single level in the game, you are introduced to the \"Final Story\", but I will not reveal any information about its story. Let's just say its the climax of the entire game.Overall, Shadow the Hedgehog I would have to say is an okay game. It uses the same engine from Sonic Heroes and puts it in a game revolving around Shadow. I'll have to admit that it's very fun before you defeat the final boss. After that, however, it becomes very boring and repetitive.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2011"}

I love MW2 as well as any MMO games but with competitive games comes lazy people who want to look better than they are and they exploit the game to appear godly.  In black ops grenades dont kill you as often,  Noobtubing is almost a nonissue.  You occasionally see someone running around with the grenade launcher attachment but its alot easier for them to miss or survive those cheap kills with the appropriate perks.Black ops is for people with skill in shooting, running and hiding.  If you have none of those stay away from this game and go back to MW2.Main story is interesting and a nice little distraction from from the main focus of the game which would be the Multiplayer aspect.Multiplayer is tons better than MW2 mostly because there are 3 types of games you can play in multiplayer.  Basic black ops multiplayer with FFA, Domination, HQs Team Deathmatch etc.  Then two types of Zombie action.  The zombies we all know from World at War is back and just as good and lastly Black ops Arcade which is like a combination of contra and zombies which can be alot of fun if you are tired of the other two.There is a theatre option were you can make movies of recent games you were in and show off your best kills (or your worst deaths lol) and show it off to your friends.For those of you who were godly in MW2 but cant seem to hold your own in multiplayer you can always do the training mode where you pretty much play against bots (the computer) and improve your skills til you are brave enough to take on other people.  But i dont advise this for those of you who are green to the COD series and competitive multiplayer shooters because bots have some serious accuracy and most humans as we all know dont. lolOverall get this game if you love a challenge and want to be interested the entire time you grind through levels.  There is tons of things to do in black ops.  Those who gives this game bad reviews needs to go back to MW2 because they are obviously the type of players who are used to the easy kills of MW2 and cant hack it with a big boy game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2010"}

If you didn't tell me anything about this game and put it in front of me I would have sworn I was playing Desmond in the future. (The assassins creed game I actually wanted before they killed him off)The game itself is nothing special. I don't know why people keep comparing it to GTA... besides driving cars in a city nothing is similar in anyway.  Are you good at pressing the &#34;x&#34; button.... then you are a master hacker! Press X, look for a camera... press X look for another camera.... press X... look for a terminal... press X. To base an entire game around &#34;Hacking&#34; where you do literally nothing is completely pointless. It might as well be press X once and watch a movie showing the character actually do something... anything.To put it bluntly this game is all hype. Being a cross gen game only hurt it chances at any form of success. Its almost funny the only system this game got cancelled for was WII U as WII U would be the only console really worth playing this game on.

You can take virtually any route that you see fit in character develpment, and the customization is by far one of the most in depth and revolutionary systems to date. If you don't take full use of everything the game gives you then your experience will not be as fulfilling when playing FF8. Some people have complained about balance and having to rely on your GF's (guardian forces) too much. This is not the case at all, because in FF8, you make your own balance in the way you junction your characters. I have beaten this game with minimal, to no usage of my GF's, or magic-only using regular attacks and limit breaks. It can be done, and if you experiment with different spells, status ailments and elemental junctioning, then you will appreciate the very deep system that this game offers.JUNCTIONING~First you have to be careful that you do not miss anything in this game. Draw from everything you encounter early in the game, because alot of early bosses have magic that you might not see for quite some time, and those spells are the key to sailing straight through this game. The more spells you have of one kind determine the junctioning stats rate of effectiveness. For example: if you have 30 fires junctioned to your str. and your str. is currently at 30, and you happen to draw 70 more the next battle, your str. will now be at 100 because you have more fire spells in your inventory and you are currently junctioned to fire. This was just an example because if I can remember right, the magic only increases the stats that they're junctioned to by percentages. The most of any spell you can aquire is 100, but experimenting with different spells on different stats are better than choosing auto junction, in which the computer does it for you without much diversity. 100 full-lifes on your HP works wonders though!GF's~Alot of the GF's have some of the same abilities to start out with, so pay attention to which one give you the abilities to junction certain stats. You will need to divide them up accordingly, so that your whole party has even statistics, so then you will be able to draw with them also. Always leave one party member with a magic command though so you can use cures, and draw with your other two. Your GF's level up as long as they're equipped to you, even if you don't use them in battle.Try junctioning the spell zombie to your status attack, and the use life to instantly kill alot of tougher enemies. Have fun!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2013"}

I love this game because of it's junction system and some of the other cool features in this game. Unfortunatly, from all of the people that I knew, people either hated the game (most of those people are on this side of the love/hate group) and a few people loved it (Extremly Hardcore RPG fans seem to love it.). I love the game but this is the Final Fantasy game that a whole lot of people just can't stand. It is a long game, especially if you get stuck, so a guide (internet or actual guide i don't care) will really help. It is the easiest game to literally reach level 100 because every 1000 exp gets you a level up but using the junction system is also an important role in the game because it can raise your stats as well.

Anyway, everyone is familiar with the Star Wars: Rogue Squadron series that started on the N64 and followed into the Gamecube.  Each game was known for its outstanding graphics, movie cut-scenes, and fast action gameplay in the different types of ships.  Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike is the 3rd game of the series, and again it still delivers the same action quality gaming we were waiting for.  Don't listen to the negative reviews, as this game is the strongest and most challenging of the bunch. This is why I can recommend this game from the very start...now onto the review.The graphics of the game are spectacular and are every bit as good as the previous ones, if not better.  From the ground missions on Hoth, to the bike missions in the forest, each level and character detail is well done.  As an added bonus there are some great movie clips that come into play in different scenes of the level, usually before and after the mission is over.  These videos are all good quality and really help put you into the game.  Some people have complained about certain framerate issues, but they are not noticeable, especially in the fast paced sky missions.The audio portion of the game really shines as well...all the Star Wars sounds are here, including movie based voice acting.  There really isn't any music to speak of while you are playing the missions, but in menus and selection screens, some Star Wars music and classic Rogue Squadron game music plays.  Sound effects are all great here...Tie Fighters exploding, lasers firing, voices coming in on the com-link...everything sounds great, so no problems here.Now we get to the gameplay...now after the positive graphics and audio reviews, you would think there would be some gameplay problems as well.  On the contrary, the gameplay is just as good as the others, but there are some problems...lets take a look inside.  Levels are still mission based as always, and if you are defeated a number of times, or fail the mission, you lose.  Now along with the classic sky based missions, there are now the addition of land based missions.  If you have played the demo of Hoth, you probably know already.  Some people disliked the foot missions, but I found them important to the storyline and were actually kind of fun, due to the change of pace.  With that, there are 2 different campaigns...one following Luke, and the other following his buddy, Wedge Antilles.The foot based missions weren't the only new addition to the game, there was also the addition of new vehicles...such as the Tie Bomber, Jedi Starcraft, and Tie Hunter among others.  From that, the best new addition would be the competitive Multiplayer and the Co-operative mission modes of play.  This adds a great deal of replay value to the games...which had great replay value already from the medal awards.  If you are new to the game, gold, silver, and bronze medals are given based on how you did in each level.  This inspection includes how many enemies you beat, how long it took you to beat the level, your accuracy, and more.  The sheer number of things to do in this game is incredible, and why the gameplay gets a thumbs up from me as well.Now with all the positives there are a few negatives, now while they aren't a big problem, they are a tad noticeable.  One such being the camera...now while the camera isn't a major issue in the air missions due to the constant moving gameplay, the land missions are a tad affected by this.  Main point being you can't control the camera in these missions which is a tad annoying...however the camera issue isn't as bad as in games like Super Mario Sunshine.  The other problem I had was the bike missions.  They are extremely difficult because basically one wrong mistake and you fail.  I really think this is one mission that could have been removed from the game.  Beyond this though, there are really no major problems, so you can look forward to nice graphics, great sound, and great gameplay.  With all these positives, there is no mistake if I should be recommending the game or not.  This is one of the best games of the season next to Mario Kart: Double Dash and Mario Party 5, and is one of the games to get for the holiday season!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2003"}

{"product_name":"B000084318","reviewerName":"Carlos Santiago","summary":"The legend continues","reviewText":"I have just completed the Wind Waker adventure and can tell you without hesitancy that this game deserves to be part of anyone's Gamecube collection.The plot is basically universal, save the damsel in distress and repel the evil from the land; the difference is the extraordinarily ingenious way this adventure was designed. It's fun, it's big, maybe frustrating for some, but it is definitely entertaining and worthy of a purchase.What separates this adventure game from the rest is, among many other things, the non-linear design, meaning that you don't necessarily have to follow a straight, exact path to complete the quest. There are always alternative methods of doing things such as defeating an opponent or solving a puzzle.Having an open ended world may be a blessing or a curse. If you get stuck, you may start wandering all around looking for clues all around, and let me warn you, the world is vast. On the other hand, you may take advantage of this, and use a break from the main adventure to take on the many fun side quests in order to obtain additional useful items and hints.You will need some time, a lot of time, to finish this game; you shouldn't expect to complete it in one sitting or even on a weekend (unless you are going to play with an \"official\" guide beside you).One important aspect of this game to consider is that you need to work for even the most insignificant item; nothing is given away for the taking. The good news is that completing the quest is not impossibly difficult, and being a game jockey is not required.  All puzzles are logical, witty, increasingly difficult but very well thought.You don't need to be a Zelda fan to appreciate this game, although for us veterans, the overall feel was very familiar. The addition of the wind factor and using the sea as part of the adventure was fantastic and made it much more interesting.The Zelda series has always been distinguished for being very musically oriented, and this game is no exception. The music is superb; the fighting scenes are greatly enhanced with sounds depending on how well or bad you are performing.Visually, the game is beautiful, there's night and day, there's rain and sun, different moon phases, plus there's lightning and storms. Graphic textures are very real and the cartoonish effects are simply astounding, as if it was an interactive movie.The game dialogues are the only thing that have room for improvement. Nintendo kept the old text based dialogues instead of using voices. Voice effects were limited to a few grunts, \"hmmphs\" and \"ohhhs\" (and \"thank you's!!\")In summary, a very special game, delivering exactly what is expected from the Zelda adventures, suitable for old fans and people new to the series.A sure thing, 5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00006F7S8","description":"It's hard to believe that creator Will Wright had trouble selling his originalSimCityconcept to publishers. That first game went on to fame, notoriety, and great praise--from critics, gamers, and even educators--and spawned countless imitators, not the least of which include Wright's own smaller-scaleThe Sims, which went on to become a phenomenon in its own right. Now on its fourth edition,SimCityreturns to our hard drives, and would-be city planners everywhere will be busy for a long, long time.SimCity 4functions much like its predecessors. You've got the power to zone land as residential (green), commercial (blue), and industrial (yellow). You control the budget. You decide where to place crucial services like police, fire, medical, and even utilities like power and water. You place schools, parks, roads, water towers, and scenery as you accede to the many demands of your Sim citizens. Do a good job and your city will grow and the money will flow into your coffers. Do a bad job and the people will pack up and move away, leaving your city treasury in horrific debt and landing you what the game cheekily considers to be a far easier job: senator. The game requires a balancing act that takes both planning and a persnickety nature. There are charts to read, reports to watch, and, above all, needs to juggle. It's rewarding when it all comes together, and frustrating when you fail, once again, to build anything worthwhile.That's why I wish the game came with a better manual. The included book glosses over most major information and then neglects important aspects, such as the RCI indicator (which explains zoning needs) and parts of the budget. At the very least, the manual should include tips on handling debt. There are two tutorials which cover the basics, but again, they won't help you get out of trouble once you get in too deep. You can find this information in thestrategy guide, which is sold separately, but you really shouldn't have to go that route.The graphics are amazing, showing a vibrant metropolis with scurrying traffic, wandering Sims, smoking chimneys, and sparkling lights when night falls. Fireworks reward each year of service. And wait until you see the cool disasters you can unleash if the mood strikes you--fire, lightning, tornado, volcano, and giant robot. Oddly, there's a significant performance hit even on fast systems. Thankfully, the stuttery scrolling and slow-to-respond zoom don't hurt the game too much since you can pause it at will or fast forward if you need to wait for your cash reserves to build. The most significant flaw is that the game only offers one save slot, which discourages experimentation.Despite minor imperfectionsSimCity 4is an awesome game. You can build several cities next to each other on the map and make them dependant on each other. (You can build the greater L.A. area, in other words.) You can even import your Sims fromThe Simsto live in your city. Such familiar characters can tell you a lot about what your city needs. Put simply, city planning has never been this fun, this challenging, or this deep.--Andrew S.

{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"tdl","summary":"Half console, half tablet, all amazing","reviewText":"I had my doubts about Nintendo's new Wii, I didn't really like its predecessor (the original Wii), and it seemed like another expensive gimmick. I asked one for my birthday, and when I got the Wii U it was an epic console! The main \"gimmick\" Nintendo has came up with for this is the large, high resolution touch screen centered in the controller. It doesn't sound like much more then a gimmick, but so far it has been implemented amazingly. In New Super Mario Bros U the epic multiplayer formula goes to an insane new level when the player holding the gamepad can place blocks, stun enemies, and reverse moving gears. The pack-in game, Nintendo Land, has 12 different ways that the Gamepad is used. Even better, Wii U also uses the original Wii-motes, so you won't have to go out and buy 3 more gamepads. Also, the Wii U has A TON of cool features. It functions as a universal TV remote, which works well with both my TV and cable box. Like its predecessor, Wii U also has a lot of video streaming services; Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Instant Video are just a few to name. The revolutionary Mii Verse program allows you to post messages and drawings in various groups. While Wii U still uses dorky friend codes, you can use it to video chat other things. Wii U currently has a rather small Eshop, but since the console has only been out for 4 months right now it is understandable.The breakdown:Graphics- 10/10: Wii U displays colorful, bright, detailed graphics. It believe that it has 3x the power of Xbox 360.Controller- 8/10: The gamepad looks dorky, but it is actually really nice. The buttons are good, the analog sticks work well, and the touch screen is a real innovation. The gamepad also has 6-axis gyro motion controls. Wii remotes are required for multiplayer.Games- 7/10: It is hard to judge the games since the system is so new, but the launch titles are excellent. Scribblenauts, Mario, Zombie U, and Nintendo Land are all notable games. Upcoming games include Pikmin 3, Smash Bros Universe (?), and Wind Waker (HD or something).Cons:1. The Wii U is sometimes slow and requires updates frequently.2. The new interface consists of three menus (home, wii, and wii u) and maybe confusing at first.Other then that, this is the next generation console you should pick. It is not babyish, it is probably one of the most advanced machines available right now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2013"}

You fight foes and bosses from the film. And you learn new skills, you can customize the armor and weapons of your characters, and the character image changes not like other RPGS that you upgrade armors, and helms, etc. But the carachter always looks the same.This game is addictive, and if you have played any kind of RPG's in the past is very easy to pick up the gameplay. The Characters are from a sort of parallel world to the one of the trilogy, but still you visit and fight the same bad guys from the movies. You can also play as the bad guys once you have finished a chapter. You can also travel from one chapter to another at tha save points, which are plenty, avoiding in that way having to play over and over a world when you are killed in a difficult, specially boss fight.As in other RPGs you can do normal or special exclusivelearned attacks for each character, magical attacks or defenses, use your turns to use items to power up or restore health, use leadership to improve attack or defense, you can even skip your turn opr change your character to the 4th party member who is not actively fighting.You can get items in treasure chests or as rewards for winnning fights.I wrote in another review I would never play RPGs again, but this one is worth it, even if it's long, reason why I don't like RPGs, otherwise these are great games technichally and its game play which is more of strategic fighting than smashing buttons in certain patterns.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2004"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYLRK","description":"","reviewerName":"J.S. Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"For the First Time Ever, a Step in the Wrong Direction for AC","reviewText":"It's an interesting look back across my reviews and opinions on earlier Assassins Creed Games.  Every single release had HUGE funding behind it - advertising campaigns were massive, Gamestop employees would sing praises for each title as if bribed by Ezio himself...The first game was a massive flop - a repetitive, tedious chore of a game with little merit in playing through the main story, even less in going after side-missions; what few there were.The second game was surprising - the variety was amped up tremendously, the ridiculous side-missions were gone; the game actually made sense, even if combat was still a bit of a chore.The third game was a huge breath of fresh air - combo streaks were added and thank GOD for that...  Suddenly content was through the roof - it became a game to last for weeks instead of days.  Even multiplayer was added.The fourth title was a bit similar to the third, but still more dynamics were added - ziplines, tower defense, borgio towers.  They kept packing more into the game.And now Assassins Creed III.  For the first time since the first title, I preordered my copy months ago.  If the ever-increasing quality of the Assassins Creed genre was to continue, AC3 would be the game of all games.The result has been somewhat less than satisfying.Right from the get-go it's those stupid sequences - cut scenes broken up by 20 seconds of walking.  See a movie.  Walk to the next movie.  Why do they keep doing that to us?  Finally the action begins - a new character; one I rather like, too - is introduced.  Still more walking, quick missions that act as tutorials.  This was to be expected, but what's this?  New fighting controls?  And what's this slow-motion block/counter stuff?  Is this necessary?  Why after four games of controls that made sense do they suddenly go and mess with a solid formula?  The final nail in the coffin was a fighting sequence against some coyotes where the \"Uncharted'esque: flash buttons on the screen and hit them within a narrow time limit\" strategy played out.  Terrible.  Absolutely terrible.Reviews NOT written by fanboys have hit the nail on the head - controls are cumbersome.  Your character doesn't move with the fluid grace of Altair and Ezio.  Commands given during combat are often ignored, objects ran against for cover are often run around instead, blowing cover and often resulting in failed missions.  And now, several hours into the game, it's still trying to teach me new tricks, new commands.  It becomes frustrating - enough, already.The city of Boston, which is certainly rendered beautifully and packed with life - is sparse and spread out.  Leaping across rooftops is no longer viable, as wide roads lead to unpassable gaps between buildings.  It's easier to stay on the ground, which then puts you contantly at odds against guards and annoying children who constantly hinder your path.Background Audio is fun - once.  During a run at Six Men's Morris (a somewhat-enfuriating pub-game available at certain locations) I eventually had to mute the TV, as I was tired of hearing the same drunken line mumbled ad nauseum.And then there are the glitches.  Many of them.  Too numerous to overlook.  Despite a 17mb release-day patch, there are still ample issues to deal with.  Killed guards leave muskets floating in the air, passengers on carriages have their hands appearing through solid wood.And eavesdropping missions again?!?!  Those were terrible in the FIRST Assassins Creed title, and they're still terrible now.  It's almost as if Ubisoft rehired some lousy staff members from the first title...So with all this being as it is, is Assassins Creed a BAD game?  Not at all.  Graphics continue to be mesmerizing - something started from the very first title.  Textures at a distance suffer - visible early on in a lavish theatre where, from your seat towards the rear of the audience, the actors and props on stage are a jumbled mess of color.  But facial renderings - even outside of cut scenes - and lush fields are simply gorgeous.  The story is indeed compelling if not still plagued by a lack of cohesion from mission to mission.  Why AM I chasing down that Indian girl, anyways??  And again the content is overwhelming.  Clubs to join, towers to climb, assassins to train and much, much more.But if a player finds himself required to run a mission over and over again because gameplay glitches and finicky controls result in repeated failed attempts, will he/she find the ambition to play through that content?  Is the story and mere presence of additional content worth the frustration, the slow start, and the constant reloads?That is ultimately for you to decide.  Some players, myself included, are anxious to see how it all ends.  Perhaps I'll wait for further updates, perhaps I'll lose interest before getting that far.  If you're on the fence, then my best suggestion is to eschew the 5-star reviews containing the word \"troll\" and read the honest, constructive reviews.  Or wait for the ever-popular \"bargain bin,\" which I'm willing to bet will wait quite a while before seeing this title.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2012"}

And when you do get into the storyline, it's engrossing, exciting and personal. It really is one of the best examples of what a game can be.I will admit I haven't dug into the multiplayer yet, but I will point out that the people who are saying you can't play online without paying are idiots. You don't pay to play online, a pass to play online comes with your copy of the game. If you are renting or bought a used copy, then you can play online up to a certain point, and then decide if you want to buy an online pass. There's nothing tricky here, and it's all outlined on the home screen. Honestly, this is primarily a single player game anyway, so it isn't that big of a deal.

The Steam criticism I can kind of understand.  If you don't want to use Steam, I can see you being irritated by it being mandatory.  I happen to love Steam.  I've been using it since 2003 and I have purchased over 200 games for the platform.  It has been an invaluable program for my gaming hobby for years.Anyway.. about the game.  I think it's fantastic.  I've been playing Civilization IV since it was released and I have both expansions for it.  I've probably put more hours into that game combined than I have put into combing my hair.  I think it was one of the best games ever made.  That said, I have been enjoying Civ V even more.  Even though the interface is more streamlined, it feels to me like a deeper game.  For instance, in IV, I would always automate my workers because I always ended up with a massive empire with too many units to keep up with.  In V, I have been keeping a fairly small empire and doing everything manually.  This was possible in IV, of course, but now there's actually a REASON to do so.  The reason is that expanding too much can be detrimental to your economy and happiness, meaning that it will only hurt you in the long run.You don't really need to have the hundreds of combat units that were necessary in IV.  A few well placed units can do the job on their own without having to resort to the \"stacks of doom\" from previous games.  The combat is much more strategic and satisfying.There are a ton of changes that I think make this a better experience.. the city states, the new social policies, ability to purchase tiles to expand...I could go on and on about why I love this game, but to be brief, the only thing I DON'T like about it is that each unit has to be moved separately.  You can't group units.  That's my only complaint.Since that's the only fault I can find with it, I have to conclude that this is a damn fine game.  I think that if you've ever been a fan of the Civ series, you'll fall in love with this one if you give it a chance.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0000DJX7I","description":"Praised for brilliant scripts and open-ended gameplay, vilified for unapologetic violence and mature themes,Grand Theft Autohas deservedly become one of the most popular game franchises in history. This double pack contains the full versions of bothGrand Theft Auto IIIandGrand Theft Auto III: Vice City, enhanced for Xbox. Xbox gamers can rejoice that the grand king of video games--The Sopranoswith a gamepad--is finally available on the big black box.Grand Theft AutoWithGrand Theft Auto IIIRockstar proves that not all developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games. This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking more structure can embark on dozens of missions driven by a genuinely interesting crime-story plot or steal cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and you can go on vigilante missions. Grab a cab and you can play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi. Take a fire truck and you can earn money putting out fires. The minigames are a good way to unwind after a particularly difficult mission. With so much to do, the game just never gets boring.As you'd expect, there are consequences for criminality. As your random acts of mayhem mount up the police start hounding you, eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic, pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing. Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerGrand Theft Auto III: Vice CityHow big is this game? Even publicists for other games end up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto IIInever dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action. InVice Citythis is--to use a clich&#xE9; that is for once apropos--taken to a whole new level.--David StoeszPros:Open-ended gameplay; player can chose to be relatively law-abiding or engage in wanton virtual destructionVaried missionsBrilliant scripts with Hollywood voice actingRocking sound track (also available in our Music store)Xbox-enhanced graphicsCons:As theThe Sopranosof games,GTA 3draws unwanted attention from overzealous legislatorsNo multiplayer","reviewerName":"M. S. Hillis","summary":"An all-time great, but not for kids","reviewText":"This is simply one of the best games for the Xbox. I basically missed the whole GTA3 phenomenon when it hit the PS2 and PC. I started paying attention when they announced the Xbox double pack, and have been, um, blown away since I actually started playing it.Though I've only played about a third of the way through GTA3 and haven't even touched Vice City, I feel confident giving this set a full five stars. I've owned probably three dozen Xbox games in total, and this is maybe only the second or third true five-star winner I've had (the others being Splinter Cell and maybe Max Payne. Even Halo had a few flaws).The freedom allowed in the game is astonishing. You can jack any vehicle, including cop cars, ambulances and fire trucks. You can beat up or kill any person, including little old ladies. The city is vast and filled with little mini-missions and surprises. Even after a couple weeks of playing, I am still discovering new things, like the the parked Hummer-like SUV that, when you get in it, you unlock a mission to hit a certain number of check points scattered all over a steep and rocky hillside.Okay, I am not a very skilled gamer in general, meaning it often takes me many tries to get past a level. I am also not very patient, meaning that if it takes TOO many tries to pass a level (like, ahem, Dead to Rights) I am likely to get frustruated and give up on the game. GTA has hit that sweet spot where the missions are tough but incredibly engaging, so even if I keep failing, I come back for more to try a new tactic. The missions serve to pull you along a story of competing crime syndicates, and the cut scenes in between missions are hilarious and often filled with rather salty language and not-too-subtle sexual innuendo.Though the built-in radio channels have a great mix of good tunes and funny chatter, the custom soundtrack feature is a must. If you've never ripped songs to your Xbox, now's the time to do it. Take an hour and put a couple dozen songs on to start with -- it will take your game to a whole new level! There's nothing like running down Triad bosses in a blown muscle car while blasting \"Running With the Devil\"!Though the game allows you to be pretty vicious if you want, I found that the novelty of being able to club old ladies on the street wore off pretty quickly. There are much more interesting and intricate things to do in Liberty City than resort to low level muggings. While most of your tasks involve taking out other scumbags, there are some pretty brutal side missions that require you to, say, kill a certain number of gang members or blow up a certain number of cars within a set amount of time. The whole game definitely has a tongue-in-cheek, aren't-we-naughty sort of feel that takes the edge off the mayhem, but I would advise that if you feel your kid shouldn't watch, say, \"Pulp Fiction\" or \"Bad Lieutenant\", they shouldn't play this game.I have a feeling that GTA3 and Vice City are going to dominate my Xbox for the next couple months. Thumbs up, five stars, grade A+, whatever. Just get these games!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2004"}

This is NOT a great game. While a great story is certainly an important component to a great game, there are other essentials which must be present as well.So, let's talk about the good first. .hack has a good story which should keep the gamer quite interested. You play as a another video game player who wishes to play the MMORPG \"The World\". Invited by another friend who then mysteriously vanishes (and in fact falls into a coma), you must determine the who's and why's behind this mystery. Along the way, you will meet up with other players who will help you in your quest as you hack your way further into the mystery that is \"The World\". I was quite interested in the game myself, and will certainly purchase the sequel to see its continuation.Now for the bad. The gameplay .... Essentially, you call up these \"friends\" of yours to walk through repetitive dungeons with little graphic splendor, each time trying to find a statue at the bottom which will reward your party (i.e. you) with items. Hooray. While the story kept me going, the gameplay is far from inspiring, reminiscent of the doldrums of \"Dark Cloud\" or the likes. I know that MMORPG's are like this, but somehow, I never really felt that I was interacting with real people, which is obviously the hope of this simulation.I think that most RPGers will like this game, solely based on the story.

The game is surprisingly easy to play. Each level is a scene from the movie and even contains actual film footage from Episode 3 hence the spoiler. It would be better to get the game after watching the movie since it gives so much of it away. The action is decent using force powers and your light saber to advance in skill from Jedi to Jedi Knight to Jedi Master. After each level is completed the experience you earn in the battle can be applied to advance your abilities such as throwing your lightsaber, force healing, critical attacks etc. I can use the force to move things and throw them at the enemy but this takes practice. As Anakin, Obiwan is constantly giving pointers like keeping up your guard or advice like looking for a power conduit. The game itself is you and a computer controled jedi either Anakin or Obiwan. The game chooses for you which one you'll play depending on the scene. Their are secret combos, art galleries, duels, rooms etc to unlock by completing the scene. The issues I have is with lag time for your aviatar to execute the move after you push a button. I had trouble with blocking shots. I had a hard time facing the enemy to attack and with the delay my character has his back toward Dooku a great deal during the duel. The main issue I had was camera angle . I'm stuck with whatever angle the game is programed for. I have droids off screen shooting at me and I have no way to move the camera to show the attacking enemy. The graphics are alright if a little block when it comes to the characters. R2-D2 looks like a floating trash can. I'm in no way finish with the game and I've made it past Darth Tyrannis and am now trying to get back to the ship. I do recommend this game but only after watching the movie.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2005"}

My favorite feature by far is the Spartan Ops feature. This feature runs you through additional gameplay and storylines while set in the multiplayer environment, i.e. respawning after a time limit and allowing you to change your load outs after deaths.

I played the original and many other strategy games in the past. This is a full, long review. It may have minor spoilers. I will cover as much as possible. I give Objective reviews whenever I can, not Subjective. I will state my personal opinions when I can. This review may be more subjective  for me as I really like this game.Bear in mind XCOM:EU has immense replayability as long as you like turn-based tactical battles. The strategy base part of the game is awesome as well.GraphicsUnreal engine, but they spent a lot of time on the graphics and they look terrific! Only a few minor glitches here or there. The Deco DLC is awesome, not yet available as of this writing (it was a preorder bonus).SoundThe sound is good, with voices for the soldiers. The music is not as eerie as in the original game, but it is still very good. When aliens are being fought the music picks up for the action. Very nice sound.Early thoughtsThe game is pretty solid, I only had one freeze up for the PS3. The base is very cool, and tactical is as good as ever. Bear in mind, the official Strategy Guide is NOT going to give tactical training! You need to become a good player by playing and figuring out the strategies, that is why it is called a STRATEGY Game. I will give a few tips where I can. I beat this game in two days, took roughly 24 hours, and I missed a lot of sleep.Difficulty - Easy/Normal or Classic/Impossible?If you are new to this type of game, and especially to XCOM in general, I suggest at least Easy mode. On Easy mode there will be less threat to deal with and more special missions to help you. Also, the alien timetable will be a little longer, so you will have an extra monther or so before fighting the toughest monsters. Aliens are not easier to fight though, they have the same health and stats as Normal mode.On Normal mode it took me 8 game months to win. I lost one country early on, Germany, mainly because South Africa asked for a Satellite they really did not need. Normal mode is just that, nothing differrent. This level of difficulty is the most fun in my opinion.Classic and Imposiible difficulties really crank up the action. More enemies in missions and all the aliens get upgraded. Most get +10 Aim (they hit you easier), +10 Defense (-10 for you to hit them), and extra health. Even Thin Men will have 4 to 6 health, not 3. This means Grenades are no longer 100% to get kills. Less starting funds, Start with only one base facility (Satellite Uplink), More enemies, countries give fewer scientists/engineers.Accessory slotYou get one accessory slot. The Support soldier can eventually have two. What should you bring to the battle? Early on you have no choice - Grenades. Useful especially if you are new to XCOM style tactical battle. To be honest, this is the ONLY time I use grenades.Scope or Grenade or Nano-fiber/Chitin Armor?Scope. Scope. Scope! Once you get the Scope, you should seriously think about all soldiers having one. Nano-fiber armor gives +2 armor, VERY useful early in the campaign when you only have Body armor (+1 armor), as Nano-Fiber's +2 gives a total of +3 armor and -may- keep a soldier out of the infirmary when hit by Sectoid/Thin Man pistol fire, although critical hits may still happen. Chitin armor is rare to acquire, and I use it on Assault soldiers. With the best standard armor and Chitin armor my Assault can have 9 life + 14 armor, which when combined with the Assault's Extra Conditioning skill will give a total of 27 health in combat.Scope or Mind Shield?Mind Shields are hard to get and thus rare, but take them in the Final Mission for your low-Will soldiers as much as possible.Early MovesEarly in the game you need to concentrate on gettng as many satellites up as possible. This will hopefully lower Alert levels in the country the satellite is deployed and will increase your monthly income. Countries covered will also give scientists and/or engineers per month. When deploying satellites, alert levels are Top Priority, not the continent or credit bonus of the country. Save your satellites until near the end of the month to help respond to Alien alert activity. This is very important as it will allow you to have the most flexibility to repond to Alert levels.The Alien Containment facility can wait. In my opinion, this facility is best built much later in the game. It takes up energy and resources better used for satellite facilities.Workshops are neccessary to raise your engineer numbers, but only so you can build more satellite uplinks. Laboratories are nearly useless, unless playing on higher difficulty settings, then they are useful because research speeds are much longer.One power generator + one thermal generator + one elerium generator, placed all in a row, will give enough power for the whole game.All facilities get the +1 bonus if placed next to each other, either horizontally or vertically.SQUADMy squad typically has 1 Support, 1 Assault, 2 Heavy and 2 Sniper. This is what I use but other players favor Assault more. Your squad composition is up to you.SupportThe weakest offensive unit but the most relied on for support. Eventually can have 3 Medikits. NOTE: All soldiers can carry a medikit as an accessory!AssaultTotal offense. I believe making the first enemy reaction shot miss is best, that way you can lead with this offensive tank. Can have up to 27 health, Awesome.HeavyI always go for +100% damage against Robots. VERY useful when facing the tough robot enemies. I also like Shredder Rocket and 2 Rockets. The capability to take 2 shots in a row is also very nice.SniperI like Squad Sight as it allows me to shoot at anything the squad sees. Less useful with Hover armor, but still a good skill. Double Tap is also awesome. I do not prefer the Sniper that can move and shoot, so I take +2 pistol damage.Tactical BattlesStay together but not all grouped up. If you can't Dash from one side of the formation to the other you are too far apart. Use two mini-squads of support/heavy/sniper and assault/heavy/sniper (different depending on your choice of soldiers or if main soldiers are in the infirmary). When getting ready to enter a doorway, have each mini-squad stand to the SIDE of the doors, never IN FRONT. You could try it the other way but there are certain encounters that may end Very Bad. Take high percentage shots. Sometimes the game will make you miss No Matter What, that's just the way it is.Move forward slowly! Use Overwatch as much as possible! Almost never Dash to move forward, and only Dash when near 100% certain the coast is clear. I cannot stress this enough. Tactical battles are long, patient affairs.Use cover as often as you can! Although soldiers in full cover can still be hit, get as much defense as you can. Defensive bonuses make it harder to get hit, and you need every advantage you can acquire.InterceptorsEmp or Plasma? Well, there are two ships you will encounter that are Main Story ships. No matter what you do, these ships will still have a good complement of soldiers. You can always get more artefacts from other missions, squad survivability is paramount so go with Plasma or the late tech Interceptor weapon. Use the EMP until you get Plasma or Fusion.Grey MarketAlmost everything you bring back from battle is useful. Only sell useless items on the Grey Market. Do not sell corpses as almost all have a use. Eventually some can be sold. Early in the campaign it is ok to sell some things, but usually unwise. For example, in my current game I have 4 UFO Power sources and 4 Navigations left. I built several key units and have no more real need for these items. However, they would be needed if I lost Firestorms. And these numbers are for most of the game! If I had sold any of these items I would not have been able to build all the stuff I needed. Therefore, Be Carefull selling on the Grey Market!OVERALLXCOM:EU is a great game. I am certain I may not have included everything I wanted, but this review is very long. I hope it all helps.I LOVE THIS GAME!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2012"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

They make some of the best stories and characters of most video games and are generally fun to play. I loved Star Wars:KOTOR and Jade Empire for the original XBOX. They played perfectly and (despite their age) never experienced the slightest technical fault. Then came the brilliant Mass Effect 1 and last years (best) RPG Dragon Age Origins but they're both littered with graphical glitches and bugs. Mass Effect 2 is no different. Characters disappear, graphics waver, you get caught in background environments and the game crashes (at least once a play-through for me).The reason I'm so frustrated by the above problems is because Mass Effect 2 is by far Bioware's grandest achievement in both story-telling and gameplay. It strikes the perfect balance between 3rd person shooter and RPG without ever feeling like it's lacking in either department. This is something that I've felt has never been achieved before in any video game.The Combat in Mass Effect 2 is hard and intense...even on casual mode. While I almost never died in ME1, I'm on my fifth play through with ME2 and I'm still dying at least once in every area. Your enemies try and outflank you, you have limited ammo and you have no heal button. That's right, you have to wait for your health to recharge which makes covering mandatory. If you liked Gears of War you'll feel right at home. One draw-back though is that your party members still have pretty stupid A.I. They're not as bad as ME1 and will actually try and kill opponents but you'll mostly be relying on your own skills to succeed in combat.The customization and character classes have also taken a huge over-haul. Every character class controls slightly different adding to replayability. Also instead of buying different armour (light/medium/heavy) you get one armour (which you customize the colors) and you can equip add-ons to it to make it look and function to your liking. There's also three different love-interest stories for each gender you can pursue (thought the 'love' scenes you get are PG-rated..no skin, sorry). One thing I will say is that you'll probably stick to your carry-over character for Mass Effect 1. Not only is the character creater not as varied as it was in ME1, the decisions the game makes for you as regard to the story are not neccesarily what you want.The one major drawback of this game is the story/plot accessibility. Mass Effect 2 is probably Bioware's most cinematically involved game to date and the characters and story are amazing......assuming you've played Mass Effect 1. I can't even imagine how underwhelmed (and confused) someone would be going into this game without experiencing the back-story of ME1. There's so much emotional build-up and plot hooks from the first game you might find yourself wondering 'why is this so important?'. This is VERY much a sequel and no matter how accessible Bioware wants you to think this game is you MIGHT want to play Mass Effect 1 before buying Mass Effect 2.So despite it's draw-backs Mass Effect 2 is a terrific gaming experience. It's not perfect (and I hope there's more patches/updates) but if you're a Mass Effect/Bioware fan you absolutely must play this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2010"}

It held at the time the best Western experience in my opinion and since then I have been dying for another release of the classic genre. Rockstar San Diego has added an additional classic to the dying genre. Those who have played GTA series will adapt to the gameplay and controls with ease, this includes an auto targeting system who can be modified to an expert difficulty and a cover system.First thing is that Red Dead Redemption's sandbox is beautiful with the world beaming with wildlife and interesting NPCs with different accents and looks depending which of the three regions they come from. What is also included is an added Fame and Honour system which is affected by your behaviour and actions. You can also interact with any of the 40 plus wildlife with killing then skinning the animals for their fur/meat and various other parts. You can also hunt down and kill or capture criminals of the law.Finally, the story is set at the turn of the 20th century where the land is giving way to the advancing government and the incoming Industrial Age. You play as John Marston forced back into the saddle on a personal matter (say no more).However, some bugs do exist and the gameplay and controls can be chubby at times. These tend to affect the textures which I think ruins the overall presentation of this fine game and the cover system at times doesn't work which can be frustrating, especially when under fire. I have also come across the occasional cut-scenes that have characters missing (American Appetite?).With bugs and issues aside the gameplay and the experience of this open-world Western epic is fantastic and by far one of the more enjoyable games available. I'm thrilled that Rockstar San Diego has answered the call with their release which is undoubtedly the best Western release yet which is unfortunately a dying genre. The sandbox beams with life around every corner and there is always plenty to do whether its murdering, foraging, hunting, the story or just free-roaming your bound to enjoy it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00004U55E","description":"It's been nearly 10 years sinceWolfenstein 3Dforever  popularized the first-person shooter, and at long last everyone's favorite Nazi  killer, B.J. Blazkowicz, is back inReturn to Castle Wolfenstein. Set  during World War II,Return to Castle Wolfensteinfinds the Nazis  dabbling in the black arts in an effort to create an army of supersoldiers.  Naturally, Blazkowicz is the only thing standing in the Nazis' way, so he's set  behind enemy lines in an effort to end the madness.On the surface, the single-player game seems like pure gold--after all, everyone  loves killing Nazis. But the story jumps all over the place, the enemy AI is  less than impressive, and most gamers will be able to finish the game in a mere  10 to 15 hours. The single-player game falls short of the standards set by  titles such asHalf-LifeandNo One Lives Forever.In fact, the best thing aboutReturn to Castle Wolfensteinis its  team-based multiplayer mode. Each multiplayer adventure features Axis vs. Allies, and  both sides offer four character classes: engineer (removes obstacles), medic  (heals and revives teammates), lieutenant (calls in air strikes and replenishes  ammo), and soldier (only class able to use sniper rifles, flamethrowers, and  other unusual weapons). The game includes only eight multiplayer maps, but they  are all perfectly designed, and in order to be successful teams have to work  together. The result is a great gaming experience that fans ofCounter-Strikeor the Day of Defeat mode forHalf-Lifewill really  appreciate.Graphically,Return to Castle Wolfensteinlooks amazing. It uses the  powerfulQuake IIIengine to great effect, and the character models,  explosions, and lighting effects are all perfectly done. Alas, pretty graphics  and a great multiplayer game don't quite make up for an exceptionally average  single-player experience.--William HarmsPros:Amazing graphicsGreat level design (including secret passages)Awesome multiplayer modeCons:Lackluster AISingle-player game is very short","reviewerName":"D.

The level of anticipation I had to play this one was very high.  And it lives up to the anticipation, with a few  criticisms.Gameplay is excellent, if not repetitive, graphics are outstanding, without the open environment of a GTA.  As result, the game is very linear with only one path to take to get you from one level to the next.  Not that this type of game is bad, it is just very objective focused with little to explore other than achieving the objective at hand.The biggest disappointment however, was the final scene, as I was able to beat the game on only my second try.  It was too easy and not very satisfying.  You go through a hundred or so levels to get to the climax where you're expecting a monster so hideous, that it will literally take everything you have and multiple attempts to defeat, but alas, the weapons in the game were too overpowering even for something as gruesome as Heinrich.Very good, but too much effort for relatively easy payoff.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2003"}

However, having said that, the game is not without its' flaws....THE GOOD :This game is first and foremost very `effective'. Effective in the sense that it's so creepy & eerie in its' atmospherics it becomes unsettling the longer you play it (especially late at night!). So much so that (as I saw someone elsewhere say) \"it makes the mundane task of opening a door a near ordeal\". And that it does. Every door you open, every corner you turn, every room you enter causes you to mentally bolster yourself for what may or may not be coming at you. And sometimes it's as predictable as you'd expect and other times it's not at all. That's what helps make it so effective. Add to the fold the low lighting, constant background sounds of creaking, moaning, aliens slinking about, whispers and other asundry noises not of this world (kudos to the games very creepy version of 'Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star' !), and you have quite possibly one of the most atmospheric games created. Visually speaking, the vistas of space, planets, the character you control and much of the scenery you walk through is spectacular and breathtaking. Ironically, the aliens you fight are not (even in a gruesome way) but we'll get to that in a moment..... Another thing I liked about DEAD SPACE was the way in which the gameplay is varied. Mainly this is a FPS-type 3rd person game, but there are moments when you control massive ship-mounted cannons, run to dodge asteroids, perform zero-G jumps and even get to play Basketball in zero-G! Well done in terms of breaking up the monotony of  a constant FPS-type game. Additionally, the weapons are a lot of fun (especially when they've been upgraded and do more damage) too. But getting back to the `effective' factor of this game, it will make you consider carefully your ammo and spending habits, as you may or may not always have enough of what you need to get the job done. Additionally, the number of items your suit will allow you to carry and the weapons in your arsenal will force you to make solid battle strategies to deal with the situations at hand.THE BAD :As I mentioned previously (and this is a relatively minor thing) the aliens in the game, while gruesome and disturbing in appearance enough, don't look as well rendered as the rest of the game. Especially up close, and believe me, they WILL get up close on you! Maybe it's just me, but they felt a bit more choppy and not as smooth in movement as the rest of the game was, but hey, like I said, it's a relatively minor gripe. And maybe they were supposed to be that way - they're aliens, right? All in all, they looked more like PS2 quality renderings than PS3....  The only one real, significant, major complaint I had with this game was, it's WAY too difficult in some spots. And I only played it on `normal' setting as I'm not into making things easier or harder on myself. I've seen others comment on their frustrations with the asteroid shooting sequence, but for me that wasn't that difficult to get by with some practice. What WAS difficult were a few spots in the game where you're trapped in a room with BOATLOADS of aliens, limited ammo and no way out until almost all are dead. Seriously, it took over a week to get by some of these spots and I was about ready to give up on the game altogether, even w/ help from the Internet. But, like anything, `practice makes perfect' I guess, or I just got a lucky break. But be forewarned - this is definitely a frustratingly difficult game at times.OVERALL :An at times, VERY difficult game, that is one of the most atmospheric, creepy and well-done I've seen. Great visuals, superb sound effects and varied gameplay make this a good if not great game to play. Definitely recommended for fans of this genre and those who just want to try something a little different.UPON FURTHER REVIEW:Since DEAD SPACE 2 is coming out at the beginning of 2011, I decided to go back and not only re-familiarize myself with the storyline, but also to clean up the trophies on this game and get the Platinum trophy. I'm glad I did, as I came to realize that this game was not as difficult as I had first thought, though there were still a few areas that caused me some grief, as they had before. None the less I enjoyed this game much, much more on successive playthroughs (I have now played it a full 3.5 times through) and still found it to be creepy, unsettling, disturbing and jarring even after knowing what was going to pop out at me and when. Definitely a sign of an effective and well-done game. All in all, this is really a fantastic game and I'm glad I went back and played this again. It gave me a much deeper appreciation for it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2010"}

With true-to-life race car steering, shifting, braking and acceleration, your game gets so real you may want to buckle up.","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Excellent Wheel, But Not for All Ages","reviewText":"NOTE:  I've used this wheel with both the PC and the PS3...PC Compatibility details have been posted in the Comments below the review.I've logged a number of hours on the PS3 Logitech Driving Force GT Racing Wheel since I got it for Christmas.  It's not only a lot of fun to use, it makes a tremendous difference in the games that I play.  Instead of twitching thumbsticks to steer and mashing buttons to accelerate and brake, I have a fine degree of control that enables me to fly through the races that used to hold me back.I was really worried, the first time I used it:  I expected the pedals to be flimsy and the wheel to be delicate.  I'm pleased to say that both feel pretty durable.  The sensitivity can be tuned, but even out-of-the-box it's precise enough that you won't find yourself stomping pedals or yanking the wheel.My only real complaint with the driving experience is the shifter:  it's like an \"autostick\" vehicle.  I had to get in the habit of thumping the shifter towards me to shift up, away from me to downshift.  I'm so used to an actual stickshift that this kind of thing seems...weird. (More expensive versions of the Logitech wheels come with a multi-position gearbox).Two important cautions that make this gadget something you should not allow small children to access:1) Every time you power on your console and the wheel is plugged in, it calibrates itself:  it spins all the way in one direction, then the other, then centers itself again.  The torque this wheel is capable of generating is actually pretty strong.  Small hands and arms could easily get caught and crunched (not broken bones, but surely plenty of tears).2) The force feedback on this wheel is actually stronger than my car (a 2007 Subaru STi with a drive-by-wire steering system).  You don't have to fight the wheel hard when you go off the curb, but you do want to be sure you've got the wheel mounted solidly on a flat surface that can provide counter-resistance:  I'm not sure a TV tray will be enough, and it definitely doesn't work well in your lap.

{"product_name":"B00BI83EVU","description":"","reviewerName":"Battlefieldr","summary":"Not just a \"GTA clone\" with 'downgraded' graphics.","reviewText":"TL;DR VERSION AT BOTTOMFirst off, I am happy to say this is my first review for a PlayStation 4 game. Also, let me state that I decided to buy this game only 4 days before the release date, as I didn't really care for it before. To clarify- I was never really hyped for Watch Dogs, and I took a risk buying it on launch day, not knowing if it was going to be worth my $65. What was the result? Just keep on reading.Gameplay:Simply, Watch Dogs' genre can be boiled down to a sandbox action game-similar to Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed games (which I've played two of six games). From what I've heard, many gamers are calling Watch Dogs a &#34;GTA clone&#34;, or a &#34;modern day Assassin's Creed&#34;. I can only go as far to say that the only similarity I see in these arguments are the simple concepts of sandbox games: you are  allowed to run around the world and explore, and cause trouble (if you decide to) between missions. The giant, obvious difference that Watch Dogs has over GTA and/or Assassin's creed is that you can manipulate the city's (set in Chicago) technology with your phone. Watch dogs does have guns, and does car chases, but the game is all centered around your control in the &#34;CtOS system&#34;, which is Chicago's central security system--you could say. You can hack phones and look at all the NPC's lives, hack cameras (which is a big feature in Watch Dogs), traffic lights, bridges, etc. When hacking a device, you usually have to go into the network and play a &#34;pipe game&#34; (complete the flow through pipes)  to successfully hack into something, which are pretty easy, and can get kind of hard sometimes. In Watch Dogs, you are not forced to go on machine gun rampages, if that's not your thing. When I began playing this game, I was afraid that it was all centered around stealth (and I am not the best at stealth games). While you have this option (and as it IS mandatory sometimes), Watch Dogs makes the stealthy route a fun, strategical route, as you can mess with enemies by hacking several pieces of technology and craft items useful to distract or kill enemies.  Besides the main gameplay, there is quite a bit more you can in Watch Dogs. As boring as it sounds, you can play minigames, one of the many is Chess (challenges or a full game), complete investigations, and do side missions of course. Before I write a 8-page college essay on just the gameplay, I'll finish up saying there are also crazy &#34;Digital Trips&#34; (that are nothing like the regular game!), and &#34;Cash Runs&#34;. If I haven't convinced you already, there is A LOT you can do in this game, if you are not one solely for the campaign (which is pretty long, may I add).Story (finally!):I have not finished the story yet (though I've had it spoiled for me already). To save you from any spoilers, the story basically puts you in the shoes of a clearly adept hacker named Aiden Pearce, as he used to use his skills for crime (at least that's what the first cutscene seemed to show). The game's story progresses into big investigation to find who killed Aiden's daughter, and find justice, and at the same time, learn more about CtOS, and how it is corrupt. I can't really say anything else, but it is a relatively simple and fun story, and again, not some GTA clone.Graphics/Sound:As I said, I was never very hyped for this game (at least until the few days before launch). It seems like many fans turned this game down because the graphics shown in E3 were not nearly as good as the graphics in-game. My thoughts? They look fine! Though we are in the nex-gen console age, we must realize that we cannot just rely on crystal clear graphics in a game. For the PlayStation 4, the graphics COULD be better, but they already look very good. I understand there are people out there that want the best looking games out there, but Watch Dogs looks good enough. In my honest opinion, I'd rather trade better performance for for worse graphics any day. If I can see what's going on, that's fine with me. Simply get a nice gaming PC to play the game on Ultra if you want good graphics. One thing that really stands out for me, however, is the graphics of the steam pipe hack (which you can obtain later in the game). It looks really cool when you activate it, and the blur and particle effects look amazing.Watch Dogs' sounds are pretty solid for me. There is nothing too special and nothing really stands out. Like many sandbox games (modern day at least), you can control a radio with real music attached, and there is a good chunk of songs that I enjoy, other than that, the city ambiance sounds fine. On a funny note though, when you commit a crime around civilians, everyone disperses, and you can hear an echoed scream throughout the city, which sounds pretty cool. (the sound itself, not the actual screaming).Online:I have not delved too deep into the multiplayer, but it is active as you play the game in single-player (you can disable it if you choose). Basically, the main features of multiplayer includes online hacking, tailing, decryption, racing, and free roam. The game introduces some of the online features to you in the game with bots, but when it comes to real people playing against you, all I can say is good luck. You can level up by successfully completing online contracts, thus gaining &#34;reputation&#34;, but in turn (which is the one gripe I have), you lose reputation if you lose in the contract, and sometimes, players are unfair and make it very annoying to find them in Hacking. I've only been hacked twice, I plan to do more once I finish up with the main game. Apart from the online contracts, there are city hotspots you can visit and 'interact' with other players, and if you check in the most times in a week at a spot, you become mayor (which I do not know what it gives you). I find the whole hotspot feature unnecessary, and frankly, kind of dumb. Lastly, one of the side missions are called &#34;Fixer Contracts&#34;, that are single player, but allow you to compete online for bragging rights of leaderboards for each fixer contract (I actually am in the top 5 for the interceptor contract called &#34;Rogue Data&#34; on the PS4, search for UA1gr3MMU5_K3Z).Other:-Controls:Controls are pretty simple, but there are a few buttons I'd like to change around, as the reload button is R3, and some actions are mapped to the same button (given if you are driving or on foot), but the controls are not bad--they take some getting used to.-World:Chicago is very big, or at least when I began playing the game. I play Just Cause 2, and that world is insanely big. After playing for a while, it's not as gigantic as I thought, but still pretty vast.If you are on the fence for this game, and don't really care for graphics, but care for a large game with a lot to do, I highly recommend this game. It's not the best sandbox I've played, but I love the concept, and I haven't gotten bored with it yet!TL;DR version below :)Gameplay: Sandbox game centered around hacking, and tons to do.Story: Aiden Pearce learns about more CtOS and wants to find justice for things done to his familyGraphics: graphics are fine, stop complaining!Multiplayer: optional &#34;dark souls&#34; like hacking contracts and challenges.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2014"}

The game is quite pretty, and contains a great amount of character an personality.  Unlike others, I kind of like the cartoony look.  I like the different styles and voices and environments of the different races.  Bottom line is, the graphics and sound people who worked on this game did a top notch job.  That's about the only thing that went right though.The game starts out fun enough.  The interface and playing is easy and  intuitive, so its not hard to play the game and feel like you're doing a good job.  The game gets repetative really fast, but if you're playing an MMO that's (so far) unavoidable.  Instead of grinding on a bunch of creatures for just xp, 90% of the game is sending you on quests that say \"go kill 30 of crfeature X\"; aka grinding with a purpose...sort of.After a while the game's flaws start to become more apparent.  There are LARGE balance issues between the classes.  The professions are bugged so sometimes you can't advance in them any further, and even if you could, they're by and large useless by the end of the game (engineering being the exception, and cooking if you're a hunter).  There's still an inordinate amount of bugs that really hamper gameplay (for instance, if a mage gets hit when using his ice block talent, he will be disconnected from the server).  On top of it all, the servers are still unstable.It might be forgiveable if this was still release, but I'm writing this review after the game has been out for 7 months.  Blizzard has taken little to no steps to fix any of the problems with the game, instead doing nothing for long periods of time, and then introducing new features which either exacerbate old problems or create entirely new ones.  The developement team makes no direct contact with the community, but instead uses a group of community managers who are just glorified forum moderators.I've been a big fan of every blizzard game so far except diablo 2 (it was terrible until the 1.1 patch they released 3(?) years later), so this was a huge letdown.  The game's got potential (like I said, lots of character), but I've spent $70 worth of monthy fees waiting for them to fix the game, and I don't recomend anyone else paying a monthly fee waiting for them to finish developing the game.

Also some people were complaining about the voice actor from the 2008 version saying he lacked the wisecracking and smarmy attitude of the previous Prince of Persia character,  I have to say that I feel that's really wrong that actor I felt did have a great voice and attitude of the Prince character and I truly wish he did this one too as and while the voice actor for this game is very good he didn't quite entertain me as did the previous voice actors skills.  The extra bonuses are pretty good for the price of the game so for adventure fans is the game worth buying?,  and my thought says yes but if you're still undecided try out the demo and make sure before getting the game because while it is pretty good it still might not be for you...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2010"}

But did you know that this game wasn't originally intended to be a Mario game? In fact in 1986 in Japan the TRUE Mario sequel was more like the original classic but a bit more difficult, so Nintendo of Japan did a Mario enhanced version of a game called \"Doki Doki Panic\" where it had nothing to do with the Mario Brothers but added the characters from the game into our version of Super Mario Brothers 2.But it's still a fantastic and fresh game experience! The story goes that your actually in a dreamworld called Subcon where Mario, Luigi, Toad and Princess Peace (a.k.a. Toadstool) where they must travel to different places of the dream world to fight against spy-guys, the flamboyant Birdo who spits eggs, killer Catcuses etc. and try to battle the evil King Wart who has imprisoned some of the dreamworld's citizens.In this game you get to chose out of 4 characters to play such as Mario, Luigi who is the best character with the best jumps, Princess Peace who can float and Toad who is strong but has weak jumps. This game is very different than the first one as instead of squashing enemies you can stand on them and pick them up so you can hurl at other enemies. You can also pick up vegetables to throw at enemies even pluck out 1-ups or coins for a special slot game you can do for extra lives.The graphics are very good for it's time yet it still holds up in this 3D era as the cartoonish graphics made it very good including the gameplay. It's an addictive game that never gets old and it's quite special but NOT as brilliant as the next one which revolutionized 8-bit gaming.If you can find a copy of this game, Gameboy advanced version, Super Mario All-Stars or download it then you'll be surprised by this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2010"}

The gameplay and controls, however, bring this game down significantly. The camera works ok for the most part, but during frantic battles, you notice its shortcomings very quickly. The lack of second control stick severely hampers you ability to turn and see what's around you.Other annoyances also contribute to the downfall of the gaming experience. The levels are generally large, which means if you do not make a commitment of 30-minutes to finish the level, you will be forced to replay the bulk of the level. Some gamers may not have problems with this, but I personally dislike repetition; the same enemies at the exact same locations, using the identical attack patterns...it gets old very quickly. To add to this frustration, the weapons you are given are seldom \"up to the task\" in defeating the enemies during the first encounter. In many instances, you are forced to fight them at least two or three times, during which your health levels up. This just feels like the game developers artificially tried to lengthen a game that is already short.The hoverboard races, Clank giant robot sequences, are all quite bland. If you have played most of the R&C; series, this will not bring any excitement at all, but feel very \"been there, done that\".Overall, I must give it a 3-stars out of 5.

{"product_name":"B003O6G5TW","description":"","reviewerName":"Taylor C. White \"Ttay\"","summary":"Best console FPS multiplayer, campaign leaves something to be desired","reviewText":"I'm going to keep this relatively short. Ultimately enjoying the multiplayer experience comes down to enjoying a different game style than something like Gears of War or Call of Duty. While it's a huge stretch to call any FPS game a 'simulation' game, it is undoubtedly much closer to an actual 'battlefield' experience than the more arcade feel of so many FPS's. Examples include level scale, gravity affecting bullets (sniping is SO much better than competing FPS games) and vehicles. If you're tired of sprinting in circles around small maps and the prospect of absolutely massive levels with every vehicle class you can imagine excites you, you should get this game.One aspect of Battlefield games that I have grown to absolutely love is how it rewards and fosters working together. You're not a single player running into 1 v 1 firefights over and over again; most of the time kill-death-ratio isn't even what people seem to care about. You get reward for revives, providing ammo, repairs, all kinds of assists and so on. Because of this kind of gameplay style, this is without a doubt the best FPS to play with a few friends. You can communicate meaningfully, get in a chopper or tank together, spawn on each other, etcetcetc.While the PC version obviously has a leg up on the console versions (graphics, player count, level sizes) the game still looks great and no other game has levels of the size that BF3 does. It would be nice if the battlelog (included free, unlike CoD Elite) was accessible on the console and not just the web, though. On a final note, the prospect of tons of expansion packs is exciting (and knowing Dice, they won't just be $15 map pack after map pack - if they have something like a map pack, they include new skins, guns, and even vehicles).I give the game a 5 because I bought it FOR the multiplayer experience. Co-op is not that great, and the strict linearity of the campaign is a huge let down given the near sandbox multiplayer. Honestly though, single player is something that takes up a handful of hours in most good FPS's - but if you are a gamer and really love an FPS's multiplayer, you'll play it for many times that amount of time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0038N0A24","reviewerName":"William Grose \"Tzu Crazy\"","summary":"The best Toy Story game, ever.","reviewText":"I will absolutely admit I went into this title with the wrong attitude. Totally the wrong attitude. As a now 29-year-old gamer, what on earth could this game offer me?I also admit I really enjoy Pixar's movies, but still...I figured I had to be at least 20 years too old for this title.Oh how wrong I was.Toy Story 3 opens the same way the movie did, with the train out of control, and your mission to save the orphans. This is a nice little action sequence which plays on rails for the most part, but is very smooth and quite satisfying.After this opening, the game changes pace dramatically. What's this? A sandbox game? Put buildings down, finish quests, dress your villagers? Somehow, it's all excellent fun. It's like the developers took the best bit from a ton of genres.Toy Story 3 is part:1.) World of Warcraft2.) Tomb Raider3.) Stunt driving4.) Mario Galaxy5.) The Sims6.) Pilot Wings7.) Other games that elude me, title-wise.Oh don't get me wrong, the depth of all these games in their entirety certainly isn't there, but parts of these games are, and as a whole it works very, VERY well. It's an exceptionally well-made title.Aside from the sandbox-ing, you can also pick from a set of levels ranging from Andy's house to infiltrating Zerg's underground lair (just like in Toy Story 2, the movie!). These are fun to play through, and aside from getting from point A to B, it's enjoyable collecting all the hidden items which range from outfits to hairstyles etc etc for your villagers in the sandbox mode.I only encountered a couple of glitches: At one point I was able to walk through clothing buildings, and at another point I was unable to get out of the tiny racing car. In each case, a quick save and exit and going back in fixed it. No big deal.Overall, this is one of the most fun games I've played in a while. Really makes a change from the death and destruction that permeates other titles on the 360/PS3 (not that I don't enjoy those games, too, but you know what I mean).Age-range for this title is likely 8 and up. I'm not sure a 5-year-old could do all the tricky driving and platforming. I had trouble with some of the bits, though nothing was too taxing, thankfully!4.5 stars out of 5. Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2010"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E620","description":"","reviewerName":"Maek","summary":"Focus on what this is...","reviewText":"Ratchet and Clank All 4 One is not like the Ratchet and Clank Future Trilogy.  It does not have the same upgrade weapon trees.  It doesn't have a very in-depth story.  Hell, you can't even control the camera.So why 5 stars?  Because I knew that it wasn't going to be like previous Ratchet and Clank games.  What endears me to this game more is that--despite its differences--it allows me to play with my daughter (and others) at the same time.  The co-operative aspects of the game occasionally poses some challenges so in addition to simply PLAYING with someone else, I'm INTERACTING with them.  I get a great deal of satifaction strategizing with my 9-year old daughter how to go about beating the next big boss fight and frantically coordinating our weapon selection to maximize our damage simultaneously.  Or there is the crazy chaos of trying to deal with multiple enemies at the same time and finding the best way to beat the baddies.  And then there's the puzzles which require teamwork.Insomniac put a great deal of thought into what makes a good co-operative game.  Some levels can't be beat without working as a team.  Whether it be launching another player high into the area to hit a switch so the player below can activate another one, swingshoting across vast chasms in tandem, or selecting weapons to provide systemic destruction, Insomniac finds many ways for co-operative play to be challenging and fun simultaneously.  It's not like the most recent Super Mario Bros. on the Wii where 4 players are chaotically moving across a level with the basics of co-operative play barely working at best.Sure, the weapon upgrades are not as deep (3 per weapon - purchasable by bolts).  Sure, the graphics take a hit.  And sure, the story doesn't flow like the Future titles.  But what the game does quite well is to keep things moving along and with 4 players on the screen at once, it manages to do so without taking a framerate hit with multiple-colored bolts flying across the screen to different players as rewards.  If there was an upgrade weapon tree like Future, I could only imagine the groans as 4 players are trying to simultaneously upgrade their weapons for about 10 minutes as they weigh their choices.  If the story were as deep as Future, it would detract from getting players back into the action.Also, the diverse array of comical and creative weaponry is still there.  You still get a pistol as your starting weapon.  Add to that, though, the Blitzer which act as charged punching gloves.  Or the Thunder Smack which creates lightning storms above your enemies.  Or maybe you'd like to change your enemies into farm animals...or freeze them...or paralyze them with the whip of the Arc Lasher.  Or you can listen to the smack-talk of Mr. Zurkon who does not need \"bolts...his currency is pain.\"  The hilarity is still there.  Add to that the fact that when your teammates use the same weapons, some of the effects are greatly enhanced dealing extra damage.  Some enemies require the systemic weapon choices to be defeated which, again, requires coordination/teamwork.  It's quite cleverly done.Can you play it as a single player?  Of course you can - and that's where you will likely be disappointed because this is NOT like previous Ratchet & Clank titles.  You will still suffer the same limitations as a single player and that's why you will be disappointed.  This game was meant to be enjoyed as a multi-player experience, plain and simple.  I love the fact that Insomniac teams our dynamic duo with two people they DON'T particularly like to work with:  Qwark and Nefarious.  And yes, Nefarious still occasionally malfunctions and broadcasts melodramatic soap operas through his mouth.  :)So if you're looking for a Future-like title, you will be sorely disappointed.  I understand that completely.  But this game wasn't made with that in mind.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2012"}

Thankfully, within the first ten minutes, this game felt like a completely different beast.  The colors, the sky, the freedom from the claustrophobic atmosphere was apparent that this game was going to be a reincarnation of itself.  The city in the sky is fully fleshed out living and breathing eco-system filled with religion, patriotism, racism and revolution.  There are parts of the city that are rich and poor, peacefully pristine and war torn, historic and futuristic.  Each person has their own story and place in the world, and the main characters are fleshed out to the depths of any your favorite movie characters.  In short, you could write an award winning essay based upon this game, the content in this game is as rich as your high teacher's favorite classical novel.And then there's the gameplay.  I played on the normal setting, and noticed the difficulty was a little on the easy side.  But maybe that's a testament to how well this game was crafted.  Like a fine tuned sports car, this game has tight controls, great graphics, and an amazing, musical score.  There are so many fun ways to play the same combat events out in this game, it's a rare feat to even consider replaying a single player game through multiple times, but for this game I wouldn't even hesitate.  The upgrade system has also been tuned in such a way that it always left me satisfied after purchasing my upgrades, but wanting/craving to buy so much more things.This game is a fairly long adventure with a somewhat satisfying ending.  The pace dropped off a little too much for my liking towards the end, and even though it seemed well fleshed out, it felt a little numb because of the brief moments of inactivity.But for me, it provided a very deep and rewarding experience that I'd encourage everyone to try.5/5P.S.

However, I cannot bring myself to say the same about the game. I've played this game nearly four years ago, and then just recently tried to play it again. In both of my attempts, I got bored with the game very quickly, and so I have no choice but to conclude that it is not me, it is the game.When I bought this game four years ago, it was because I got carried away in the bandwagon filled with nothing but praises for this game. This game is supposed to be amazing, with amazing music, sound, and polished graphics. So many reviews claimed this game had the best graphics for PS2. I strongly disagree, the game isn't bad looking, but take a good look at any of those floating god faces you run into before you receive new powers, and try telling yourself that this is the best graphics for PS2. Are you kidding me? This is far, far away from the best graphics. Games like Resident Evil 4 must be crying when people falsely praise this game for good graphics. That being said, Visual effects such as splashing water or barrels getting destroyed are superb. It's just a shame that the animation of same calibur cannot be found in other parts of the game. Enemy designs are really boring, but since a lot of enemies are straight out of the Greek myth, I will forgive them for their lack of originality (for once).Music. So many reviews hail the epic tunes found in the God of war. Again, I am sorry but I have to disagree because music was terrible in this game. The soundtracks in this game are orchestrated, yes, so I do give a positive recognition on this aspect. Unfortunately, that's where the good things end. Music was really generic and uninspiring.Game design is average. Game levels are usually linear with minimal backtracking, which is to be expected in a hack and slash game. Nothing out of ordinary here. The fighting is surprisingly simple and button smasher, and depending on who you are (and your age), you MIGHT stay impressed with the action sequences triggered by simple button presses throughout the game. Unfortunately for me, it got really boring after half an hour or so. Game length is on the short side. Since it's single player game, I doubt there is much of replay value, unless you actually like this game enough to play it over and over again. If you like it, that's great I'm happy for you. But chances are, after playing quality games that have been pouring out the past couple of years, this won't be missed. Narrative cut scenes were crappy and abrupt (This sentence too has been abrupt, excuse me.) For example, the game starts with the narrator saying \"and so Kratos, jumps off the edge.\" or something to that effect. That's BAD. If there was ever a movie that started like that, I would burn the disc in anger.I think the three dollar value this game holds as a used copy is quite reflective of its quality. It has some nicely executed parts, but it just isn't fun. It's mindless hack and slash, like Dynasty Warrior (which is terrible), but the God of War is more sugar coated and has a higher production value (and bigger budget too I'm sure). Unfortunately for us, at its core, this game is a very boring game. The only \"skill\" you need in this game is pressing L1 at the right timing for blocking, and that wasn't enough for me to really get in to this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2012"}

Not much plot, but who cares, basically you play an angry teenager skating around spraypainting public property and outrunning and outmanuvering the cops while doing it.  After the first real mission, the game gets downright addicting and even more fun than before, something SEGA is great at doing with most of their in-house developed games.  The soundtrack is surprisingly decent too even though I'm not into hip-hop at all, tracks from Rob Zombie, Cold, and Professional Murder Music add to the replay value.

Raillard","summary":"Great game, could have been even better","reviewText":"Don't get me wrong, this is a terrific game, but it isn't without its flaws, some of which may irk certain gamers more than others.  Here is my breakdown:Graphics: Terrific.  Probably the best, most realistic car models on any system.Sound: Also very good, with customizable soundtrack and a good selection of ethnic, location-specific tunes.Control: Solid.  This game is about 80% Simulation (ie: realistic) and 20% arcade (easy to learn, forgiving).  The cars respond as they should and you can definitely tell the difference between a Mini Cooper and a Ferrari Enzo.Gameplay: Very good, but this is where the flaws are found.  In order to unlock more cars, you need to progress in a VERY linear fashion, fighting your way through various classes of vehicles.  The vehicles are class specific, so you can't race your Ferrari in the SUV class, and your money is always limited.  There are also no customization options (a la GT3 or NFS: underground), so you can forget about adding a turbocharger or what have you.  My biggest complaint, however, is with the enemy A.I.  Simply put, the cars race as if on rails, and generally act as if you aren't there.  While a slight tap will cause YOU to spin out of control, you can ram the computer cars and they will barely swerve for a second or two, before accelerating away at an ungodly rate.  Playing online can solve this problem, but as with any online game, for every nice gamer you play with/against, you'll have to wade through a sea of jerks and tough guys.  The downloadable ghosts/records is very cool, though, as it makes you feel like part of a bigger community.This is a very, very good racer, but I was hoping for a more open-ended game, and I'm still waiting for good CPU drivers to hit the console (or PC) scene.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000K8YAKI","reviewerName":"Michael J. Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"Halo's a bit tilted, but it still shines bright","reviewText":"I came into Halomania with Halo 2 on the original Xbox.  During the time we waited for Halo 3, I played Gears of War online with an expanding circle of friends, including the Geezer Gamers (look 'em up).  We chafed at the eight-man team maximum and were itching to play in the larger sandbox that was Halo 3.My wife bought the Halo 3 Limited Edition the day it came out. Did I mention I love my wife?There's been so many reviews about Halo 3 that there's little new I can contribute here.  The campaign is serviceable, but takes itself a little too seriously.  Viewing the web site for Halo 3 is unintentionally hilarious, treating the game like a World War II memorial, as if it has that much emotional gravitas. It doesn't; the hinted-at relationship between Master Chief (Steven Downes) and Cortana (Jen Taylor) gets a little silly at times, the stalwart allies die heroically, bad guys become allies and then betray you later, and aliens natter on about setting off the Halo rings and destroying the universe. The talking plant known as the Gravemind (Dee Bradley Baker) doesn't make an appearance, but his voice is ever present.  In fact, the game uses the awful method of flashbacks, both from Cortana and Gravemind, to interrupt game play and force the plot down your throat.  It gets old fast. The game reaches a rollicking conclusion with a crazy Warthog chase across collapsing platforms that recaptures some of the fun of Halo 2. The ending is predictable but well earned.But forget the campaign.  The real beauty of Halo is the multiplayer game.  I play the game every Wednesday night (look for Talien) and we play Team Slayer with sixteen people at once.  It's great fun, and the boards provide an endless array of challenges that make Halo 3 the excellent multiplayer experience we've come to expect.There are some changes.  The graphics are better, but not much better.  I miss the value of a perfect reload from Gears of War.  Speaking of Gears of War, Halo's environments aren't as destructible.  And my favorite tactic, two-fisted Needler-ing, has been rendered obsolete.  In fact, Needlers don't track nearly as well as they used to.There are new guns and vehicles, but the biggest change is the ability to remove heavy machineguns from their mounts and walk around the board, mowing people down.  I've had more kills using this new tactic than using all the other weapons combined. As for vehicles, there's a new bike and an enormous beast known as the Elephant that I'm fond of driving (I flipped an Elephant once, ask me about it some time).  Speaking of war stories, there's also a neat function that allows you to view replays and share it with friends.The packaging of LE of Halo 3 isn't very practical.  Made of metal, the package I received was warped.  Since the piece that holds the disc in the box is also made of metal, the disc was banging around inside the case.  Even the booklet, which is in the center of the container, was warped.  No wonder the discs in some copies were scratched!Despite the changes from Halo 2, Halo 3's multiplayer can't be beat.  It's a testament to the game's staying power that we come back to it every Wednesday.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2007"}

Some goofy echoes and at times a soldier will tell you to stay quiet but will shout you have enough ammo if you ask for some and the echo would have given your enemy serious heads up! OOOOPS!Gameplay: 5/10.Fun moments, but way too many times when I was yawning at the cutscenes or pulled back into reality because the game takes over and plays for you at times! UGHHHH!Too few weapons as well. I know...maybe that is realistic but there is nothing realistic about this game or most vid games really! Some weapons you cannot choose to use as you desire. You get a Barrett .50cal but you can only use it a few different short times when the game allows it. WTF?Graphics: 6/10.Not bad but could have been better. Should have designed a whole new gaming engine and give us something cutting edge like Far Cry 2 or CrysisCustomization: 1/10.There is no customization. A few settings.Bugs/Errors: 1/10Plenty. You might get lucky and play through the whole thing without a problem. Check the forums though and you will see plenty of angry players stuck on all the buggy parts, falling through the game floor and dying, unable to launch missiles or attack with the SOFLAM. REALLY PATHETIC EA!!!!Replay Value: 1/10The game does not have much replay value. The problem is that you cannot control much...such as keeping weapons you like, doing the missions differently...all because it is soooooooooooooooooooooo scripted. You know exatly when every attack will take place and how the enemy will act, move and where they will be shooting from. It is literally the same every time!

{"product_name":"B000HCQK0A","reviewerName":"Michael J. Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"SPOOOOOOONNNNNN!","reviewText":"When Halo 3 was announced, I actively resisted buying Crackdown for the sole purpose of getting onto the Halo 3 beta.  Mind you, I love Halo 3.  I play team slayer every Wednesday night (add Talien to your friends list if you want to join).  But I wasn't going to pay more money just to get into the game early. So for a long time, I just avoided Crackdown out of principle. Which is a shame, because Crackdown is awesome.Basically, you're a genetically-engineered superhero who can leap tall buildings in a single bound, lift trucks over your head, and shoot criminals real good.  Did I mention the criminals?  They're the reason you exist: in a society overrun by scum, you \"AM de LAW!\" There are three gangs you must defeat, each helpfully segregating themselves by taking over a different island.  There's the Hispanic Los Muertos (death), who swear at you in Spanish and drive muscle cars.  There's the Russian Volk (wolves) who drive Soviet-Era transport trucks carrying Stinger missiles.  And then there's the Shai-Gen, sort of the uber-corporate villain reminiscent of Gibson-style Japanese megacorporations.  You take down each of these bad guys by taking out the lieutenants, which in turn weakens the gang leader by reducing the effectiveness of his bodyguards.There are a wide range of weapons and vehicles you can use to wage your one-man war on crime.  You can impound weapons and vehicles so you can use them later.  Your uber-cop advances through the skills he uses; use lots of explosives and your explosives skill goes up, run over bad guys with your car and your driving skill goes up.  There are also power-ups floating around the city, blue question marks that give you bonuses to all skills and green exclamation points that increase your speed and jumping ability.Crackdown's methodology heavily relies on the carrot approach, rewarding you for going to difficult places in the game by providing incentives.  Even death isn't permanent; thanks to cloning, you reappear at one of the supply points throughout the game with a loss in some skills.Crackdown's cell-shaded universe is both comic book-y and beautiful.  It's amazing to watch the sun set and rise, or be dangling from a twenty story building when the lights flick on. I was especially fond of killing major villains and hurling their bodies off of skyscrapers, watching them fall doll-like hundreds of feet to the ground.  Wait, should I not have shared that?  I've said too much.Ahem.  Anyway, what makes Crackdown so different is that it truly delivers on the sandbox-style of play.  You can fight gang members or kill citizens, drive vehicles anywhere, pick up anything, destroy everything.  You can jump, you can swim, you can climb.  Every character is as interactive as your character, and the AI reacts in a reasonable fashion: citizens run screaming, driving their cars erratically to get away from firefights.  Gang members shoot you, run you down, and throw grenades at your head.  When a firefight breaks out, police come screeching onto the scene, and usually get in the way.  When you jump down from a distance,  you shatter the pavement.  When citizens see you leaping through the air or carrying heavy artillery, they flee for their lives.There are moments in Crackdown where I was reminded of the target audience.  The non-English speaking gangs and citizens shout phrases, adding to the atmosphere of the game.  The English speaking drones in Shai-Gen are a lot less amusing and become downright annoying. The swearing is a little silly (with so many citizens randomly saying things, when combat goes down they end up cursing quite a bit) and over the top.  But this is a game about killing gang members by throwing trucks at them, so I give Crackdown a pass.Speaking of the audio, the narrator is the only character of substance, and he guides you through the game.  His encouragement and chastisement is pitch-perfect, an older, grizzled white guy's voice telling you how it is and how to do better next time.  I wasn't thrilled with the ending - like so many games, it feels rushed and a bit of a cop out - but playing the game was still a rewarding experience.If you're a fan of Robocop, Judge Dredd, or the Tick, get Crackdown.  You'll be shouting \"SPOOOONNN!\", hurling chimneys, and leaping across rooftops in no time.  Unless you're not a fan of the Tick, in which case you'll appreciate laying down the law the old fashioned way: with a rocket launcher.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2008"}

I wanted to try a game that was more realistic, hence the purchase of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. It was quite a change of pace not having to slay monsters and riding a horse through the streets of Rome. I really enjoyed the combat in this game, (wish it was more of it) there's nothing like splitting a guard's skull with the bearded axe lol. I have to admit, It took me awhile to get used to having to physically find a Blacksmith shop to purchase upgrades (I'm accustomed to just pressing the start button and getting them). But once I upgraded, I really loved using those weapons! I enjoyed the scenery of Rome, tons of stuff to do and get into, maybe too much at times....There are a few reasons as to why I deducted a couple of stars. Now, this could be due to the fact that I have not played the first two installments, but this game was a bit overwhelming at times. I would be in the middle of a fight, and all of the sudden, a red icon is streaking across my map, I'm like who the heck is this??? I later found out it was a thief, how was I to know that? Or, I could be riding my horse trying to escape guards and all of the sudden a message pops on the screen saying that a deposit failed in the bank. And? Why would I care, I'm trying to escape. It was just a ton of little things like that going on throughout the entire game, just not used to that in an action game. Without all the mindless platforming, (especially as Desmond), this game would have been 8 hours long. It seems that they threw silly things in just to make the game seem \"longer\". I'm not a fan of the kind of puzzles AC used. The puzzles consisted of: here is a building, now figure out how to climb to the top. That would have been ok if the control scheme was better laid out. I can't count how many times I tried to climb, but ended up doing a wall jump in the other direction....I really wish there was more fighting in this game as opposed to all of the platforming and roaming around Rome (no pun intended). The Desmond stuff alone caused to me to deduct another star. I would have given this game 4 stars if I did not have to endure the Desmond nonsense at the end. All of the endless climbing and jumping really got on my nerves, not needed. I often asked myself, what the heck and I suppose to do now? Where the heck am I suppose to go, no map telling me anything while playing as Desmond. The only thing I'll say about the ending is that Desmond is such a tool...I would have had a blast with this game if there was more fighting and less platforming. For me, it's never good if I'm ready for a game to be over. I don't know if I'll get the next installment of this game, I'll just have to wait and see.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005ML10","description":"One of the most anticipated titles in PlayStation2 history absolutely  lives up to the hype.Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Libertyis the  follow-up to one of the most captivating and intelligent adventures on the original  PlayStation. Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M. PadillaPros:One of the best and most complex stories in gamingOutstanding graphics with many interactive elementsExcellent soundtrack and voice actingCons:Long periods of watching instead of playingSome extraneous dialogueSolid Snake may inspire gamers to grow mullets","reviewerName":"George","summary":"MGS2 fun to watch, but what about PLAY?!","reviewText":"Metal Gear Solid 2 was probebly the most wanted game for the PS2 besides FFX.  Everyone had high expectations for the game and for the most part, it meets them.  For people new to the Metal Gear games, this game requires that you sneak around.  This isn't a FPS type game where you just blast everything you see.  But it's challenging and fun.The graphics are probebly the best feature of the game.  The characters have eyes, unlike the first MGS game where the just had dark lines.  Almost everything is destructable.  You can shoot pipes, little bottles, etc.  There are also nice little effects like shoe prints, breath, and the rain effects are pretty realistic.  This game has a first person view where you can shoot guns but can't move and during the rain, you see little rain drops get in your view.The control is basically the same as MGS with a few new moves.  You can now hang from the rails and you can look around corners and do a quick \"jump out shoot\" at a guard and quickly get back around the corner.  You can either kill a guard or knock them out with a tranquilizer gun.  You can then hide the body in a locker or whatever you want.Now for the story.  The story plays out threw movies and long conversations through a CODEC where you just see two faces talking.  For anyone who has played Metal Gear Solid, you'll know the story was very good.  For this game, it's intersting but it has a few disappointing surprises...Some parts of the story don't seem to make sense and can get very confusing at times.  Also, there are A LOT of movies.  You can literally walk 5 steps, and then a 5 minute movie will play.  The beggining took FOREVER!  You can't even pause the movies like in FFX.  Not a good thing when you need to go...For my final say, I think MGS2 is a pretty good game but it just has to many long movies making this a game where you do more watching than playing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2002"}

{"product_name":"B002I0JIQW","description":"","reviewerName":"JoeAZ92","summary":"No hard feelings","reviewText":"Portal was a truly groundbreaking puzzle game. Innovation abounded throughout every test chamber in that short but quirky and memorable game, though its rather short length made it feel more like an extensive demo than a full game. With Portal 2, though, we now have a full-fledged Portal game in our hands... and it's not a game you'll want to miss.For a puzzle game, Portal 2 actually has a remarkably strong story. The basic plot is solid (I won't give anything away because it's well worth the surprise of going through it yourself) but the background and characters are the aspects that really make the game's setting and context strong. As you progress through the game, you're given a lot of background about Aperture Science that is actually pretty intriguing, and it all happens as you continue to discover new level design elements and solve more great puzzles. GLaDOS (who was (supposedly) killed by the main character at the end of the first game) returns with even darker, wittier humor than before, and this time another robot character named Wheatley enters the picture. He proves to be just as hilarious as GLaDOS, albeit in a different sort of way, and the voice acting for him is pretty much perfect. These characters actually are a part of what will keep you coming back to this game, because their constant bursts of humor and commentary are a major part of what keeps Portal 2 interesting.Gameplay and level design reign supreme in Portal 2, though; the game thrives in these areas more than any others. Once again you are given a portal gun that can shoot two invisibly linked portals, but this time around a wide array of extra elements have been added to the puzzles to keep them creative, complex, and challenging. Propulsion and repulsion gels are especially interesting: repulsion gel makes you bounce off of it, whether it's splattered on the floor or on the wall, while you run faster if the floor beneath you is covered in propulsion gel. These two elements alone add incredible depth to the game, and when you add in other twists like Arial Faith Plates that fling you into the air and Excursion Funnels that carry you in a particular direction within a wide beam of some kind, there's plenty of depth and challenge at every turn. Of course, the levels are designed to utilize all of these mechanics to their maximum potential, often incorporating many of them at the same time, so the game continues to feel fresh right to the end.Portal 2 is much longer than its predecessor, clocking in at about 8-10 hours of single player from start to finish. It's not a particularly lengthy game, but once you finish single player you can always find a friend to play through the brilliantly executed co-op mode with you. Though I have not played co-op for more than a couple hours, even that short time has given me a great taste of the complexity and creativity it presents. Using two separate characters, each with their own regularly functioning portal gun, works perfectly and presents plenty of fantastic obstacles and challenges to overcome.If you enjoyed the first Portal game, there's really no reason for you to not get Portal 2. It's bigger and better in every way possible with innovative gameplay mechanics, challenging (but never impossible) stages, and a strong co-op mode. There really aren't any flaws to speak of, either. So really all I want to say is that Portal 2 is a fantastic game, and you should get it if you're even remotely interested; if you play it then you're in for a real treat.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00004XOWT","description":"If the original PlayStation was the video game console equivalent of the  '60s-era Volkswagen Beetle--economic, reliable, loads of fun--the PS One could  be considered the new Beetle--a hip restyling of those same qualities.Make no mistake: the PS One has all of the same functionality as the original  PlayStation workhorse, will work with all of the same peripherals and  accessories, and will play the existing PlayStation game library, as well as  audio CDs (also note that, like the original PlayStation, it's not compatible  with the more advancedPlayStation  2). The difference here is that this new model is quite a bit smaller than  its older brother, and quite a bit cuter, too.The system is made up of a 32-bit, 34-MHz RISC processor with 16 Mbits of main  memory, 8 Mbits of graphics memory, 24-channel stereo sound, double-speed CD-ROM  drive, and one Dual Shock analog controller. That's not a lot of power, compared  to a next-generation system like theSega  Dreamcast; but, when you factor in its very low price and the enormous  library of games that are available (more than 1,000 that are spread across  every genre imaginable), one can see easily why it's as good a deal as ever. If  rumors of exciting future accessories for the PS One (a four-inch LCD screen  attachment, to name one) are true, this little machine could become a great  option for the on-the-go gamer.--Porter Hall","reviewerName":"Stephen A.

I prefer role-playing and strategy games, however, action, arcade, driving, first person, etc., you're not left out by far. Playability is second to none, although load times are a little slow, the ease of this game system to play puts a smile on this gamer's face. Remember my old adage: The play makes the games, not the graphics. Graphics, IMHO, are secondary to actually enjoying the game you're playing. Fluff factor aside, the game has to have some depth, or it's just another pretty face (pun intended). At this price, with this vast library to choose from, you can't go wrong. Many classic games exist on this system (Final Fantasy 9, Tomb Raider, Crash Bandicoot, Twisted Metal), all around the $15.00 mark now.

Realistic weapon setup includes over a dozen real-life guns, all fitting the crime-story setting like a bullet in the head. The action is surrounded with more than 80 hand-painted comic-screens that enhance the game's gritty atmosphere and attitude, introduce the game's murderous cast of characters, and carry the plot from one location to the next.","reviewerName":"John L. Maillard \"Digital Enthusiast\"","summary":"Game of the Year -- Hands Down","reviewText":"Wow. Simply put, Max Payne is one of those games that makes you sit back and thank the heavens for your PC. From the brilliant opening sequence to the dingy corridors of Hell's Kitchen apartments and subway systems, Payne promises a feast of graphic delight, convincing audio, and a wealth of gameplay goodness. The game's depiction of Max's wife being murdered is harrowing, and from there, the story just gets better. Told in snippets of pulp fiction graphic novel, Payne's bent-on-revenge theme works to perfection. The locale of NYC is genuine, down to the ambulance sirens, mailboxes, and subway location signs. But where the game really stands out is its gameplay. Although Max is a conventional shooter, it is anything but. Using the brilliant &quot;shootdodge&quot; and &quot;bullet-time&quot; techniques, Max can essentially slow down the clock and dispatch enemies, despite overwhelming odds. How, you ask? By slowing the enemy's actions (including their bullets), Max remains in real time, essentially letting you squeeze off a few rounds before the bad guys even knew what hit them. When it's all over, you'll see foes somersaulting backwards, bullets and blood their last hurrah. The game's use of Max's heartbeat to slow down the action is unforgettable, and having to use it only in times of trouble is amazing. It never gets overdone. The action sequences are too good to be true. In fact, to believe it, you'll simply have to see it. Action camera angles are done seamlessly, and Max's comments during the game keep the story flowing. Cut scenes are meticulously crafted in grainy comic book action, and the style works, thanks to the story's key elements.With so many cool features and amazing gameplay, the only disappointment with &quot;Max&quot; is its length. Because after 10 to 15 hours of complete immersion, it's over. Still, with the included editor, game geeks from all over the world will be creating mods to further Max's bloodlust. Oh, and one other note: Payne works better on fast machines with updated graphics cards, so be sure you've got a 700 MHz or better unit running with some heavy RAM (128 or above; 256 is clutch) and a GeForce2 or above.So, if you're thinking about buying one game this summer, make it Max Payne. It's an instant classic that is sure to go down in PC history as one of the greatest. It's that good.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2001"}
{"product_name":"B003O6EB70","description":"","reviewerName":"ahw","summary":"Good Game With Too Much Scavenging, Derivative Story","reviewText":"As good a game as Bioshock: Infinite is, I do not think it quite lives up to its hype.The gameplay is average.  The controls depart from the \"standard\" FPS controls established by games like Call of Duty, which can be a minor nuisance for players who are accustomed to CoD style controls.There is quite a bit of scavenging around in the game, which personally I found annoying.  You have to constantly search desks and lockers for health, salts (i.e., mana), ammo and money which entails running up to every desk, trash can, barrel and crate in the game to see if it \"glows\" in game, meaning that it is searchable.  You also have to carefully scan the environment for small lockpicks to unlock doors that lead to more scavenging opportunities.  Around a quarter of your time playing the game is spent scrounging around for stuff, which disrupted the flow of combat and the story.The different gear you collect throughout the game does a fairly good job of creating opportunities to test out different \"builds\" and experiment with different gameplay styles.  However, I did find that one particular piece of gear (Winter Shield) was rather overpowered, as it grants you temporary invulnerability in circumstances that are easily repeatedable/exploitable.The story is good, but I didn't find it quite as engrossing as the first Bioshock.  The plot is rather derivative.  Without giving away spoilers, if you watched a certain TV series from a few years back, you might accuse the Bioshock writers of minor plagiarism.  The characters are interesting enough and are well voiced, though the dialogue sometimes goes into B-movie territory.  As an aside, if you are Christian and somewhat overly sensitive you might take offense from the fact that the game could be interpreted to suggest that Christianity is the origin of the pathway to evil.The best and freshest aspect of the game would have to be Elizabeth, your partner throughout most of the game who is implemented very well.  Throughout the game, she serves as a timely sources of health, salts, ammo and money.  As far as I can tell, she is hard-programed to be invulnerable to enemy attacks so you don't have to worry about bad AI getting her killed.The game is short--it can be completed in 10-12 hours.  I managed to finish the game in a week (albeit with the aid of a three day weekend).  So, in terms of value, if you pay full price you may be disappointed.Overall, I'd give the game 3.5 stars out of 5.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2013"}

Well once i got a rig that was strong enough to play it, i thought this is pretty awesome, though the first is EXTREMELY tough by comparison. Some reviewers have said this one is to easy. I wouldn't go that far, but it's just more accurate and to lock onto enemies is just executed better than the first two games. Crysis two left something to be desired, (maybe because of the concrete jungle atmosphere) instead of a real one. But fun none the less. Also the storyline is much more compelling than one and two, and more movie like. Although the basis of the game has not changed, you still get maximum armor, strength, invisibility and better still a new bow. The bow is a lot of fun to use, and i think i prefer it actually over conventional weapons. I love the arrows that give enemies and electrical shock death, very gratifying. The atmosphere is great, and the mixture of jungle with condemned delabidated building gives it a dark new feel. I admit to liking the bright lush great jungle in the first game, but many games now have taken that same route. Most of this game takes place in the darkness. So there isn't much to say, it's just above good so i would give it 3 1/2 stars, but we don't get that option here. Though it isn't what i'd call \"great\" because it still doesn't break any new ground, unlike say a game like dishonored.But if you loved the first two or even thought they were just ok, you may like this one even better. It is easier and actually shorter by just a few hours, nothing major. The multiplayer is enh, good, but i'm not much of an online guy. I like engrossing myself in a game in private. More intense that way. By the way the mechanics and AI are much better in this than previous games. And there are no Koreans yelling at you with annoying accents (no offense). I want to try this on my gaming rig and max it out in a few months or so, when the price drops for pc. I think i will even enjoy it more then. But as of now i really enjoyed setting back on the couch and taking in the atmosphere while shooting aliens and various bad guys with my bow. I felt like a robotic rambo. So that's what i dug about the game alot. And the fact that the difficulty is just right, among other small details. So enjoy, it may not break any new ground, but it's beautiful and it's another Crysis game. So thumbs up. ;o)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2013"}

It isn't going to change your life. But what it is is high quality entertainment in a neat little package.I'll just glance over a few individual topics since they've already been covered to death by everyone with a computer and an opinion already.[Graphics]: Amazing. Best I've ever seen on a console.[Sound]: Incredible. Turn up the volume on this one, it makes the experience much more immersive.[Controls]: Perfect. After awhile you practically forget you're holding a controller.[Story]: Entertaining. Not incredibly deep, but the characters are interesting and the plot moves along at a satisfying pace.Now for the 2 biggest components people seem to disagree on.[Gameplay]: The gameplay is Ryse is simple. There's really no way of getting around that fact. It's pretty close to Dynasty Warriors in terms of action variety. You end up using most of the same moves over and over again, but like God of War you can also purchase a few new ones from an upgrade selection menu. Some people complain about this fact which is very hypocritical when put in perspective.In games like COD or NFS you repeat the same actions over and over again and no one seems to be complaining about that. In most cases if something is fun the first time it will likely still be fun the 500th time as well. Most people will probably still enjoy the combat in Ryse throughout the game. &#34;Most&#34;, not all. If you're looking for something meatier with more variety in gamplay pick up an RPG and invest 100+ hours in it, cause this title may not do the trick for you.[Content]: Some people don't seem to see eye to eye in regards to their satisfaction with Ryse's length. The campaign itself is somewhere between 5-6 hours depending on difficulty and play style. It's divided into 8 chapters, each usually beatable in one sitting. Though it may seem on paper to come up a bit short lengthwise, it feels very full during the entirety of it's story. Like the difference between a movie and a television show. TV shows are lengthy and draw attention to smaller details to fill their larger runtimes, while movies are short and sweet, usually concluding an entire story in less then 2 hours. In that regard Ryse is very much like a movie. It moves along quickly, but tells a complete story without being drawn out or focusing too much on less significant aspects of it's world. And if you do still want more after you beat the campaign you can always play through it again or try the co-op survival mode, which pits you as a gladiator fighting in the arena.Overall I loved Ryse, even if it wasn't the longest experience it was still pretty damn entertaining!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2014"}

Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Great fun, great adventure.","reviewText":"Its been noted by other reviewers that &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot; has received hardly any publicity, and I agree that this is a real shame, as this is a hugely enjoyable game. Playing as Jade, you are an ordinary person living in a kind of floating futuristic city who finds herself wrapped up in an attempt to liberate the planet from the oppressive regime that controls it. Advance publicity billed this as some kind of stealth/photography game, but its actually far more than that, more like a cross between Tomb Raider and Ratchet and Clank...and its definitely more fun that Tomb Raider. Gameplay involves exploring caves and ruins, where you will engage in combat with various monsters whilst also solving puzzles to progress further. Both elements here are cleverly and well implemented into the game. Then there are sections where you have to infiltrate the enemy strongholds to photograph their dark secrets and its here that the stealth aspect is employed, which the game pulls off very successfully. Still more variety is provided by a hovercraft which is Jade's means of transport between the various explorable areas, and along with combat with flying ships and monsters whilst in motion, there are also high speed chases plus optional races to be tackled. There is so much variety in the game, such as mini-games held in the city bar, and a side mission to photograph rare and elusive animals that are scattered throughout the world, and although it's not difficult, some of the puzzle solutions are quite ingenious and will tax your brain. There's even an upgrade from hovercraft to flying spaceship in the final stages of the game, which make for some great flying manouveres, not to mention a beautiful view of the planets surface from above as you glide over it. In fact the look of the game is one of it's most outstanding accomplishments. The towns are surrounded by realistic rippling waters, and the characters all look convincing, especially Jade herself, who is a detailed and interesting lead protagonist who displays convincing emotions. There's also a lot of humour in the game, excellently portrayed by the many voices and mannersisms of all the characters.All in all, this is a pleasant surprise and a joy to play. My only gripe is that it is too short, but then that only means I was sorry when it ended!

Their demands are for the United States to recall all their troops in every country and bring them home. Until this is done, new attacks are launched upon aditional unknown locations. This list of places to be attacked is known as the Blacklist. The mission of you and your team is to stop these attacks.Down time:Your main headquarters throughout the game is a plane called the Paladin. It's 4th Echelon's version of an Air Force One on steroids. Between missions you go here and you can pick up intelligence information gathered by your team members for missions. This is also where you customize your loadout for Sam and select which mission you want to play next. You can walk around freely and talk to other characters and see what info they may have for you to use for your next mission. You also have a new tool called the Strategic Mission Interface (SMI) that updates you with info about your objectives and is sort of a mobile handheld version of Paladin, letting you access mission objectives and such throughout missions.Game play:While Splinter Cell is designed as a stealth game, Blacklist lets you deviate from this and play it in a whole new way. You can now chose to play each mission in Assault, Panther or Ghost mode. Ghost is your stealth mode, with your goals being getting from beginning to end with as little enemy contact as possible. Panther is a middle ground, letting to play stealthy, but with some hands on action as well. The third, Assault mode, is my favorite. In this mode you play a running gunner. You come in guns blazing and demolishing every enemy that crosses your path.While the controller commands are both Ghost and Assault mode friendly, having smooth fast actions combined into a single button push, the cash/points system favors stealth over unloading lots of lead. Your score at the end of each mission will affect your cash payout and Ghost mode, and the objectives associated with it, tend to produce a larger monetary reward at the end. This money is then used to upgrade and unlock weapons and tools. But Splinter Cell was created originally as a stealthy game, so it's not surprising that this would be rewarded in points as the games primary objective. So if you want to run and gun (like myself) you may have to replay a mission to get enough cash to buy one of the new high tech toys you can use against your enemies.Conclusion:Whether playing the single player missions, co-op missions or online multi-player, Splinter Cell Blacklist has plenty to offer fans of the series. The new option to chose different levels of attack (Assault/Panther/Ghost) let those who like to go into a mission with guns blazing finally have a place in the game. In addition, since there's several modes, after you have done a mission in one version, you can then go back and replay it again, trying to complete it in the other modes. It makes each of the game's mission have more replayability, giving you a different secondary objective to try and achieve. This combined with a long singer player campaign, makes for many hours of entertaining game play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2013"}

What it does is blends both the cinematic experience one gets from going to see an incredible adventure movie such as the original Indiana Jones films with the ability of allowing the user to actually be a part of that experience, literally.

The scenery and areas of exploration will have your jaw on the floor and honestly this is the game that is going to be the game changer of making the PS3 a dominant force in the current generation of consoles. If video game makers are reading this then please listen because as a long time gamer from the days of the Atari 2600 I can tell you that personally this is the type of games I'd like to see more of.So much heart and depth went into making this game that is literally has me in awe. Everything about it is just perfect right down to the amazing soundtrack. Bravo to the Naughty Dog team and everyone involved in making this masterpiece.And to the other developers out there, please more games like Uncharted 2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2009"}

Wii, like all the previous releases in theSuper Mario Bros.franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiis held sideways, allowing for easy, classic inputs using the D-pad to direct playable characters, the 1 button to jump and 2 button to spit out projectiles like snowballs and fireballs. In addition, players can access powerups with their choice of either the push of a button, or by shaking the Wii remote, again demonstrating the perfect merging of classic gameplay and modern game design which isNew Super Mario Bros. Wii.Key Game FeaturesNew Super Mario Bros. Wiioffers a combination of cooperation and competition. Players can pick each other up to save them from danger or toss them into it.Supports 2-4 players in multiplayer mode.Mario, Luigi and two Toads are all playable characters, while many others from the Mushroom Kingdom make appearances throughout the game. Players can even ride different Yoshi characters and use their tongues to swallow enemies &ndash; or their fellow players.In some areas, players use the motion abilities of the Wii Remote controller. The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"AF \"Whigs\"","summary":"Excellent game, but very hard","reviewText":"I've been playing Mario games for over 20 years.  My son and I love Paper Mario and Mario Galaxy games on Wii.This is classic side-scrolling Mario with excellent controls and standard great gameplay, as Nintendo often delivers.  The only issue is that this game is hard.  You will end up playing the same levels over and over.  Thankfully the levels are relatively short, so it's not terrible, but it does become frustrating at times.Also, the boss battles are surprisingly easy compared to the regular levels.  That's not bad though, because if you run out of saves then you have to start the level over from the start.It's also nice that you can play co-op.

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"Cute Chihuahua","summary":"The best game system choice for younger kids, but adults will enjoy too","reviewText":"The Nintendo Wii is a fantastic game system for kids especially but I think most adults will love it just as much. The Wii doesn't have nearly as good of graphics as the Playstation 3 or Xbox 360 but the game selection is so much better for young kids. Many of the games on these other systems have a lot of foul language and so far I am not seeing that at all with Wii games. In addition there is a huge selection of games that kids will love. Most of the games fully utilize the motion sensing technology inside the Wii remote and will get your kids up and moving. Some of the games are even quite exhausting and I consider very good exercise. My Daughter loves playing Wii Cheer 2 which she plays almost daily. It teaches you cheer routines and you get to unlock new characters, songs and challenges. Wii Sports is fun for the whole family with a variety of sports to play. It is fun to get a group of people playing together and have competitions. The new Super Mario Bros is also very cool; it's a new and improved version of the original Super Mario Bros with great game play and improved graphics. If you enjoyed playing the original on the Nintendo Entertainment System then you have got to try this new version. I could go on and on about how many good games there are but I will leave it at that. This is certainly the best game system for the younger crowd.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2010"}

I bought it based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews only to find out that everyone is so so wrong on this game. The fact of the matter is, however, that this game is about as exciting and fun as NPR. This game is SO SO BORING! It may very well be the first game I've never finished because I dread wanting to pop it in my system about as much as I dread dental surgery. But at least dental work is more fun and a lot less painful.This game is simply a \"lather-rinse-repeat\" style of game. You play as a cocky 12th century assassin who's arrogance has gotten him demoted from the Assassin's union, or whatever you want to call them. Your goal is then to re-work your way up the ranks of being the top assassin while killing all of your town's enemies off on the road and blending in with the townspeople, being stealthy, etc. All of this takes place within the flashbacks of a modern-day bartender who's being held captive against his will by a scientist and his assistant who's using him for their research in \"genetic memories.\" The assassin you play as is a direct descendant of the guy and the scientists are viewing his ancestor's memories through a high tech machine. And in-between accessing the past, there isn't much else you can do.Basically, you sneak into towns, save countless townspeople from the SAME soldiers accusing them of theft, and climb up HUNDREDS of towers in order to expand your map (you can't go any further without the semi-realistic way of seeing your overall area by climbing up the top of high towers in order to see everything to expand your map. That's right, you have to actually work just to see where you're going.) Doing all of these things, maybe, I don't know, 6 or 8 times is okay, but you'll be doing these things literally DOZENS of times in any given area, making the overall game very boring, very repetitive and not fun, whatsoever. Each of the three towns you go to has a rich, poor, and middle class district, and in any given district, you'll have to climb about 15 towers, save about 15 citizens from persecution and interrogate or spy on about 10 people. And that's PER district, per town. So, yeah. You can just imagine how boring this gets after a while. And doing the \"research\" on your enemy is about three-quarters of the game play. The actual fighting/killing is the last thing you actually do.The sword fighting system is very archaic and simple. Basically, it's button mashing and dodging until everyone is killed. While I admit, the counters are cool, the overall sword fights are just as repetitive and boring as anything else in the game. And when you FINALLY get to face the enemy you're after, even HE is no different or unique from any other enemy you've faced.This game isn't good at anything they claim to boast. It's not that good at being stealthy (all you do is blend into the crowd, which, considering your wardrobe, actually doesn't make any sense) and it's not that good at being fun (seriously, why all the climbing towers and saving people?) and it's not that good at doing much else of anything as far as game play is concerned. Sure, the game looks and sounds great, but is about as fun as the worst college History class you've ever been in. The whole game itself, draws a lot of knowledge and information and historical accuracy, so I can't help but feel like this game was made by a bunch of history geeks who know nothing about what the term 'fun' or 'entertaining' is, and that feeling seeps within every aspect of this game. It's simply boring as HELL, and that's about as much as you need to know.Don't make the mistake I did in buying this game. While it may be a bit egotistical to go against so many other people, I just have to say that they simply just don't know what they're talking about. OR they're entertained easily by the graphics and feel of the game, because there is NO aspect of fun game play WHATSOEVER in this title! This game literally feels like a chore to play and I don't like taking a video game as a chore rather than as fun.I'll end on this: DON'T PLAY THIS GODAWFUL GAME!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2009"}

In the first mission, you come across a few parked cars, some guards, and a tall statue.  You can go the \"tried and true\" method of running in and out of cover while using your weapons.  You could go bit more extreme and use the car to run over enemies, or, you could tether the car to the statue, and pull the entire structure down on their unsuspecting heads.  It's fun elements like this that make the game fresh.The graphics are great.  I'm sure there is a story involved but you will quickly forget about it.

And now we have the same thing happening with COD4 and Treyarch's COD5, you get the feeling that one is made by the master craftsman and the other is made by his pinhead loser brother looking to cash in on his sibling's reputation.Games are more and more like the movie biz, too many out there and the overall quality is at the extremes, 1% can't miss, 99% overpriced junk. Hopefully with the economic retraction we can get rid of many of these type of developers and have a leaner, more quality core of boutique video makers and also mega ones like EA, or maybe the government will bail these guys out too, wow wish I could get some of that free Gov cash, oh wait it came out of my paycheck so it is my cash I'm paying for, genius!This is really an expansion pack to COD2 with somewhat updated graphics and very slick graphics laden and celebrity narrated intro cinematics. Come on, get rid of all that and focus on the gameplay here, for what they paid that guy from 24 to narrate this they could have at the very least come up with an expansion pack for COD4! I'll never understand why they don't build onto an excellent thing that everybody wants more of, especially since those of us into single player only would love to have more COD4!!!This seems to be what to expect, this is a year off for the REAL COD series to take a breather but still try a cash grab with inferior product that is a run of the mill WW2 FPS. With games like Brother's in Arms:HH out there this just doesn't come close in the WW2 genre this year and you should not reward them by rushing to get this thinking it's COD4 caliber.This title sure feels a lot like some of the older Medal of Honor titles, like Pacific Assault, that can be had for five dollars or less here. There's no cover system and the graphics just don't compare to BIAHH or Deadspace or COD4 and I've got it set on 1680x1050 with everything on the \"extra\" setting above \"High\". Treyarch also recently released the 007 game Quantum of Solace that was built on the COD4 engine and it is also lackluster graphically but better in the variety of playing mode department than this one, with cover system and a more exciting experience in general.The sound is unconvincing, especially when we've got BIAHH to compare it to since they use the same weapons and you can see the HUGE difference both in graphics and the sounds. In short don't get this until it's $20 or less and if you want a latest generation WW2 game get the latest Brothers in Arms which has superior in everyway graphics, cover system, sound and story and leave this alone.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2008"}

It adds nothing new, nothing interesting or fresh to the series at all. It is basically just resident evil 5 all over again, only it somehow feels more stale, less interesting and less like resident evil. Its action based over scare based. They removed over the years any sense of terror or suspense instead going with the modern day version of horror being loud noises and stuff jumping out like it's a carnival spook house.The game literally feels like a 3rd person version of house of the dead where you basically move from linear corridor to linear corridor where monsters popup and you shoot them, that's it. A lot of times you'll stand there and there is obviously nothing at all in front of you, then lighting flashes and suddenly there is a zombie there. You're walking along and they slide out of dir ducts, popup out of the ground or a body just laying there leaps out at you when you get close. And the worst part about that is its all so predictable, you can see everything long before it happens.The story (I won't go into details and spoil anything) is horribly bad and needless. It feels so forced that it's just plain awful. It's an obvious poorly conceived notion put in place just to make another sequel and nothing else. It has no originality, nothing that actually adds to the resident evil mythos, nothing is explained that needs to be explained. And the characters are either ones from previous games used purely because they are recognizable or new ones added that haven't the slightest shred of originality to them or intrigue and are basically just cookie cutter characters that are very two dimensional. Everything also happens so fast and with no logical or even reasonable reason I can't get into it. \"Oh no I'm trapped, wait this stranger says a bus is coming to save us, and look here it is, now were driving down the road and crash\". That's essentially how the entire game goes along. It's like each section and each scene in the game are broken up with no fluidity between them. If you ever heard an 11 year old kid try to tell you about something that happened to him when he is all excited that's what resident evil 6's story is like. Or \"Hey look a woman in a white cocktail dress is laying in this bottomless cavern that has been sealed for decades we had to open ourselves with no one or nothing else around. Oh its my sister, quick we have to help her\".The quick time events are back and worse than ever. You are constantly waggling a stick, button mashing, pushing button combos or whatever for no reason at all. Even something as stupid as during a cut scene you're getting away in a car and during the scene you have to push a button to make the car move. You don't steer, you don't drive, you don't do anything because you're not controlling anything but it still makes you push a button, just one button just so the cut scene will continue.The combat is awful. It's basically just like gears of war, only with less polish and it's harder to use because it's so clunky. You're body takes up too much of the screen, especially when backed against a wall. The shooting feels stiff. Trying to hit something that is close but not directly in front of you is a pain. Just all in all the combat is horrible and I don't know how many times I died simply because moving around and shooting were so sluggish and poorly designed. And the cover system is awful since it will switch your perspectives, stick you to walls you don't want to be on, move the camera to a position you cant see anything, if an enemy gets in too close it is hard to get off the wall to fight them and so on.I can't recommend this game at more than 10 dollars and even then I'd just say \"if you played resident evil 4 and 5 then you played this already\". I paid 20 and I feel like I wasted my time and money on it.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2013"}

There are some cons that will keep PC snobs away, but there are some serious benefits, lots of them.  Newcomers should definitely check this game out, CS is the most popular online action game for 3 years straight because it is superbly balanced and highly addictive fun, faster than Rainbow Six but not out-of-control like Unreal Championship, CS actually rewards teamwork in lots of subtle ways.  However, I will warn you - don't expect to see the magic until you've been playing on Live for a day or two.  You NEED Live to get anything out of this game.The most important thing- Microsoft nailed the controls exactly right.  It feels totally natural and fits perfectly with the needs of this game.  I never once felt frustrated with the controls or felt like I was &quot;losing&quot; something from the console port, if you know what I mean.  Sometimes the control limitations of console ports total change the way you play the game, but not in this case.  Bravo.  Other &quot;cons&quot; of not playing on a PC actually serve to equal the playing field for everyone.  The low resolution might give many PC players a headache, but it gives scopes an actual purpose now.  On the PC I had my resolution cranked so high I never used a scope.  The controls mean that no one can whip 180 degrees and get a head shot on you in 1/10th of a second, something I've seen many many times before.  Protecting your flanks is more important. The only thing I really miss is being able to play any map I want, especially some of the older favorites like Assault.  The game does comes with 20 maps, though, 2 unlockable with Live, including the awesome &quot;Office&quot;.Second, the bots are amazing, probably the best bots I've ever seen in any game.  Most of the time I can't even tell it's not a human being playing.  They work as a team, use effective strategy for each map, and react realistically to the changes that swing thru each round.  They really capture all the strange quirks you see human players do (you spend a lot of time watching other ppl play CS, but don't worry, it's fun)  They are awesome for practice, but not much else.  They are still bots, they tend to be very single-minded.  You aren't going to formulate some crazy strategy with them or laugh about a wild kill.Single player options are so sparse the developers seem kinda lazy.  They made incredible bots but no kind of story or even a ladder to motivate new players, just endless practice matches. These are fun but rather limiting.  Customization is lacking too- you can't do simple things like change bot names or have teams with different numbers of bots, like 4 against 6.  Big letdown here. System Link forces you to have a separate disk/Xbox/TV per player.  There is no spilt-screen of any kind, another huge disappointment.  This game is beginning for Halo-like multiplay, but Live is the only practical option.  Live rocks though.  You won't find the rampant cheating that you see in the PC community, and almost everyone has headsets, very helpful in a game that requires so much teamwork.  The community is still pretty big and seems very dedicated.  I don't think it will drop off anytime soon.  So in the end, CS is a very focused game that does a few things very well, and I recommend hardcore gamers give it a go.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00AY1CT4U","description":"","reviewerName":"pastapadre","summary":"Madden stumbles at the end of the generation","reviewText":"Madden NFL 25 is one of the most difficult to evaluate sports games in recent memory. It carries with it considerable value thanks to a deep feature set, distinct improvements to gameplay, and appreciable fun factor. For every positive though there seems to be something dragging it down from potential excellence. Features aren't completely fleshed out, gameplay looks and feels chaotic, and legacy issues remain unaddressed.MODES-Connected Franchise: This is obviously the big one - especially with the return of Owner mode - and I wrote over 3000 words and posted nearly 100 screenshots regarding it on my site detailing everything from the executive duties of an Owner and how things progressed within the entire Connected Franchise universe having played every game in a season and extended into year two.Owner mode provides some compelling elements which will be especially fun when joined by friends but Connected Franchise as a whole fails again in tying events from the league into the actual games. That could severely dampen long-term enthusiasm towards the mode.-Skills Trainer: Similar to NCAA Football 14 the Skills Trainer provides an opportunity to learn, improve, and refine play in very specific areas. It does a good job of teaching things like the option as well as aspects like hot routes and audibles which novices may need explanations on. There are also Ultimate Team bonuses given for getting \"Gold\" in each of the individual drills.On the flip side it has the same faults as NCAA. Things that are out of the control of the user can screw up success. It gets frustrating going for the \"Gold\" and missing out because a receiver drops a pass or a defender sacks a QB when you needed to get an interception.The Skills Trainer was personally approached with the hope of learning the new \"Precision Modifier\". Getting to test out the timing and various functions is the valuable thing here. What the Trainer didn't do was explain what \"in range\" actually means or go beyond just a handful of moves when there are 30 something combos possible.-Madden Share: This is something that will become valuable as users get the game and start uploading their own personal content. During the evaluation period there were some files there to download but they may have just been tests from other users so it didn't make sense to spend time pulling any down not knowing whether they would make for quality useful content.Files that can be uploaded/downloaded through Madden Share are rosters, playbooks, and slider sets. Video highlights can also be uploaded to the EA website.Any roster set can be used to start a Connected Franchise including the user-edited ones obtained through Madden Share. Custom Playbooks can also be taken into CF.-Ultimate Team and Online Play: Without many users to face online it would be inappropriate to judge Ultimate Team (which brings in the fun Seasons concept) or online play performance in general. Will update this section at a later date.GAMEPLAYMany of the enhancements apparent in Madden NFL 25 were first introduced in NCAA Football 14. The two series share a gameplay development team which means Infinity Engine 2.0, work done to the offensive line, enhanced player control, and much more are found in both. It might be the more wide-open gameplay or the lesser talent on the field but NCAA 14 plays a much cleaner game than Madden 25.Sloppy is the best way to describe Madden's gameplay this year. It feels that way when playing it and it looks that way when watching it. There are glimpses of good things - there's no doubt about that and it can still be fun to play - but overall it's hard not to walk away and say it's a mess despite that.The Infinity Engine seems to have been downgraded not enhanced. There is a distinct lack of tackles appearing organic (or any impact between players or gang tackles) and instead you get an overload of frantic collisions and guys knocking into and off one another plus bizarre looking pileups. Everything is much stiffer than last year and even what was played back at E3.CPU QB's are competent if not unrealistically so. Other than one or two boneheaded throws each game - even the highest rated QBs will do that - they march their teams up and down the field fairly consistently. Completion percentages in the demo were ridiculously high. They haven't been as bad in the final version of the game. Lower rated QBs might even struggle at times though that usually isn't for the entire game. The one time that happened was holding Brandon Weeden to under 50%. Most other games are around 70% or higher even from guys like Mark Sanchez.There are a few reasons this seems to be the case. Few throws will hit the ground. They'll more likely be jarred loose in a hit or intercepted. QBs are generally accurate and they find receivers in big space pretty often. Whether poor zone or man coverage is to blame is difficult to determine.The pass rush is also inconsistent. Most sacks aren't due to immediate pressure but end up as coverage sacks. In my franchise I had some success controlling Cameron Wake and forcing off-target throws. The user shouldn't be forced to play the D-line (and not everyone has a Wake) in order to get pressure on the QB.CPU running backs can threaten and they tore me up a few times in my franchise season, but that becomes an afterthought to trying to find a way to stop the QB. Heavy blitzing may be needed to push the CPU into third and long situations where their success level dramatically drops. Third and short or mid they probably convert over 75% of the time when the actual NFL average on third downs is around 39%. CPU punters are still idiots and kick it into the end zone at every opportunity. The CPU kickers only missed one field goal against me the entire season (short and off the bar rather than wide).The \"Precision Modifier\" is going to have its share of supporters and detractors. On one side it adds more dynamic and exciting events. On the other it doesn't balance out well in terms of risk and in some cases, with the right players and the right timing, can almost be unstoppable. I'm personally not a fan of it in concept or execution.It's interesting EA made this an option because there is very little reason not to just hold down the left trigger at all times when running forward. In my franchise season there were two fumbles noted while using the modifier with a back or receiver out of 14 total on the season. Of course there were more instances where contact took place without the modifier activated than with it, but that still goes to show there is very little or no correlation to turnovers and using the modifier.Going up against a shifty player in open space controlled by someone who has the modifier down will undoubtedly be frustrating. Even power guys, when they stiff arm, end up dragging the defender sometimes 10 yards down the field in that animation. There was also an instance where Darren Sproles stiff-armed a linebacker to the ground.The CPU will use some modifier moves though somewhat infrequently. The over and over spinning seen in the demo definitely wasn't present in any of the games played with the final version. What they will do is awkwardly throw out stiff-arms when no one is even in range.The read-option is a lot of fun to utilize and is represented well in Madden. While some thought it was too easy in NCAA Football this year there is more balance found in Madden considering the talent of the defenders, the rate of fumbles being higher, and the always looming risk of injury. A fragile quarterback is not going to be able to take hits during a game and survive it. There were also instances where the QB would make the right read and still get crushed by a defender who identified it. The CPU only used it a few times with Cam Newton and Geno Smith running it sparsely in my franchise season.The one play I may start removing from my playbook: HB Draws. It seems as though the offensive line frequently gets pushed so far back that the runner has no where to go once the ball is handed off. The one I'll be using more frequently: WR Screens. Against a soft defense getting the ball in open space to a quick and agile target can result in big plays.As was the case with the demo there are issues with catch attempts at the sidelines. Quite often a receiver won't make a concerted effort to get their feet down when they seemingly have plenty of space to do so. Even top rated receivers don't always complete the catch in bounds.Deep shots downfield can also be troublesome. This is where most of the INTs came off the CPU and in pass breakups by the CPU. In one-on-one coverage on a leading-lob pass the ball rarely gets over the top. User picks are easy to make on those attempts. Even with a step on the defender the ball usually ends up short and incomplete or picked off.Those looking for more penalties will still not be satisfied. My team committed 12 over the 17 games played in the season. A few of them were self-inflicted (defensive offsides, false starts, late hits on QB) and the others were some for clipping, a few personal fouls for late hits on the sideline, one facemask, and one offensive pass interference that was called on my left guard.The Hit Stick finally has some use again as big hits do force some fumbles. Holding the stick down also activates \"Heat Seeker Tackling\" which acts somewhat as a magnet when in range but if out of range results in a big whiff.I went into injuries at length in the franchise write-up. There are lots of them, which doesn't make it unrealistic, but the same players seem to get hit with them over and over and its usually key contributors.In fourth and short situations coming out in goal line the CPU does not match unless near the goal line. That makes sneaks essentially automatic. The only thing to worry about would be the QB getting injured.The booth will automatically review a close touchdown as they should, but never review close turnovers and the user isn't even given the option of manually challenging them. This was something mentioned last year as an issue that apparently didn't make it onto the radar to get fixed. This omission upsets me.There are five camera angles including \"Legacy\" which is the standard one from recent years. Considering how many expressed hatred towards the new standard camera angle that was locked in for the demo it's important to note that.PRESENTATIONLike everything else in Madden NFL 25 presentation has its ups and downs. There are only a few different game openings, personalized celebrations look alright but they're done within awkward cut scenes, the halftime show isn't a halftime show, the lack of ties during games to league events dampen interest in Franchise mode, and commentary hasn't taken a big jump. The intro videos for primetime or playoff games in Franchise mode though are pretty cool.Commentary is steady but it's surprising how little has been added or old lines thinned out. If I have to hear Phil Simms criticize a QB for checking down again, the one where he says it's just the QB worried about stats, my head might explode. In general for year two in the booth there is still too much left unspecified in their calls. \"What a win for that one team\" is literally something that was said after a game.Danielle Bellini is the new sideline reporter and fits in well but most of what she has to report is very generic and often leaves out identifying the team or player names. Where she's most valuable is reporting on injuries at different points in the game. Unfortunately even with those she's stuck saying something about how the team wouldn't tell her what was wrong with the player. \"The team wouldn't say.\" So then what's the point?The touchdown and sack celebrations look good upon first viewing. The more they're seen though the more looks wrong with them. Players will show up out of no where to celebrate, it'll happen in spots where the play hadn't ended, the camera view may be blocked by other players, or it's noticed that there are no other people actually on the field. What's worse though is how players just stop and stand there after crossing the goal line or catching a pass for a score before a celebration or replay kicks in.Auto-replays also have issues with individuals being lingered on from a single camera for too long. In some cases players run towards the camera and end up out of frame as they approach it. The graphics, while still largely excellent, seem far more muddied and flat (the lighting in particular) than recent years.Rain and snow thin the crowd out to about 60% of capacity. Even in franchise for the Super Bowl fans apparently won't show up due to bad weather. Outside of a few team specific crowd chants or PA sounds the atmosphere in games is uniform from stadium to stadium. Hopefully with the \"Living Worlds\" part of the next-gen Ignite Engine they'll get some definition to the unique experiences that each fan base and stadium delivers. It should also be noted that the crowd still reacts improperly to the results of challenges. They'll boo a favorable result.The post-game \"Never Say Never Moment of the Game\" is almost always a let down. Generally the play of the game is identified as a field goal that didn't actually determine the outcome. Or even worse an extra point.MISCELLANEOUS-The wind indicator is reversed. How this seems to happen year after year is beyond me. It can even be seen in how the rain or snow is being pushed one direction and the indicator pointing the opposite way. Keep that in mind with any kicks and adjust accordingly.-Another release that doesn't include surprise onside kicks.-Game results can be shared on Facebook but the share to Twitter functionality is gone.-There is still no screenshot feature included. The next-gen systems will have that built in.-If a team is running out the clock when kneeling and the opponent has no timeouts can we get a chew clock option for that in the future please?OVERALL OUTLOOKMadden NFL 25 feels like a 10 week bridge to next-gen rather than hitting a pinnacle in the way the series did late in the PS2/Xbox generation. It may satisfy many - there certainly are improvements over last year both on the field and off despite the gripes that will be had - but there will sadly be no Madden reaching \"classic\" status during the 360 and PS3 generation.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000TUZCQI","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"Biggest selling video game of all time (over 40 million copies); The game that singlehandedly saved the videogaming industry","reviewText":"A Note on Duck HuntThis review focuses more on \"Super Mario Bros.\"  This particular version of the game is a dual game cart and includes Duck Hunt, where you hunt ducks with the Zapper Gun (awesome!) and if you miss too many times the b-st-rd dog will laugh at you for sucking so bad at a mere child's game.  Now, one thing to be aware of is due to the technology used, Duck Hunt DOES NOT WORK on new televisions such as HD TVs.  You'll need an old CRT television.  Overall a fun game but the type of title that now aways would be an Internet or phone title rather than a full blown main stream release.  How far we have come since the NES days!  This is the last you'll hear of Duck Hunt in this review.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Review Proper:Arguably the single most important videogame in history, SUPER MARIO BROTHERS, along with the Nintendo Entertainment System (hereafter referred to as the NES) singlehandedly resurrected the video game industry after the historic crash of 1983-1984. Rather than reviewing the game itself, which has been done many times, I think many people may find the history how of this revolutionary title came to the videogame industry's rescue very interesting; I know I do. I draw much of this information from various websites, one very good one in particular; unfortunately, I can't really plug them due to Amazon's policies. Email me if you want the websites.By 1983, the gaming industry, in existence for a mere twelve years, had risen to an astonishing 3.2 billion dollar industry. Atari spearheaded the industry, which introduced its first console in 1977 (Atari Video Computer System), and since had grown to hold two thirds of the entire market. However, in 1984 all this would end with a thunderous crash. This concise overview will show you the history of the home consol crash and how SUPER MARIO BROTHERS came to the rescue.In 1976, Warner Communications bought Atari for $28 million from the company's founder, Nolan Bushnell. Over the next two years, Atari, suffering major production problems and Bushnell's bizarre management, lost Warner millions. Bushnell and Warner's CEO fought, and in 1978 Bushnell was forced to leave. Warner totally revamped the working style, and in 1979-1980, produced twelve new titles. However, Atari was still dragging down Warner's stock. Struggling to gain the market share, Atari made the smartest move they possible could have; in 1980, they began licensing arcade games, the first being SPACE INVADERS. Over the next two years, Atari overtook the market, bringing in over half of Warner's overall profits.However, very significant problems would totally destroy the infant industry. In 1981, Atari released PAC MAN on the VCS, and, because it was such a huge arcade hit, quickly became a bestseller. Unfortunately, the quality was very low. This was a major blow to the company's image, with fans and critics alike extremely disappointed.Another major stumble was one of video games' most infamous games, ET. Warner bought the rights from Spielberg for twenty one million dollars. Atari, expecting the game to be as big a hit as the movie, which was the highest grossing film at that point, purportedly made more ET cartridges than there were consoles themselves. ET proved to be a huge flop, nearly breaking Atari.By 1983, Atari was in serious trouble. Suing Activision (which was disgruntled Atari employees who broke off and formed their own company) and Imagic, the two leading third party developers, Atari tried to gain control over its software catalogue. Atari lost the suits. Third party developers began popping up overnight, and the industry becomes saturated with very low-quality products. (One of the most controversial is CUSTER'S REVENGE by Mystique, where the goal is to rape a Native American woman while avoiding being shot by arrows.) The third-party developers went bankrupt; these cartridges were heavily discounted, and the major companies couldn't compete. Another factor is the home computer market, that was just starting to come alive in 1984. With an increasing amount of computer games and low prices, people started buying these over the consoles.All these factors lead to the crash of 1984. In 1983 alone, Atari lost $356 million. Warner sold Atari to Jack Tramiel, former head of Commodore. The video game industry died, with no major American corporation coming anywhere near it. Enter Nintendo.A little history here will be highly illuminating as well. What many people don't realise is Nintendo is a very old company, founded in 1889 (yes, you read that right) as a playing card company. It became Japan's largest playing card company, and was very successful. In the 1960s, they moved away from the cards and got into the game and toy markets. (A very interesting sidenote: during that same decade, Nintendo's president opened up a `special hotel' rented `by the hour.' Supposedly, the married president was one of the hotel's top customers). In the 1970s and early 1980s, the company scored significant points with big arcade hits and the Game and Watch product line. In 1983, Nintendo released the Famicom (Family Computer). It was a massive hit in Japan. In 1983, Nintendo went to Atari because they wanted to release the Famicon to the American market. Do to complications I won't go into, the deal fail through. In 1984 they were looking to broaden their market share.1985, Nintendo announced the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System. They release SUPER MARIO BROTHERS in Japan, scoring a huge hit. In 1986, the NES comes full throttle into the American market, quickly becoming the biggest selling console ever, largely because of this title. The NES owes much of its success to SUPER MARIO BROTHERS. Coming prepacked with the console, there are an estimated 40 million copies of SMB in existence, making it the highest selling video game ever.Unparalleled, SMB blew open the doors to the videogaming world. With rich palettes of colour, eight four level worlds, spot-on play control, and expert level design, SMB was a much longer game than most of Atari's products and was a game unlike any other at that time. SMB also had the benefit of being very simple to grasp; run, jump, and fire. It was also the first side-sroller as we know it, though Atari's PITFALL set up the concept. Also, it's one of the best. Without SMB, NES wouldn't have been nearly as big a hit.In the end, Nintendo came at the industry's key moment. With a powerful new console and a very well-designed game, Nintendo resurrected video gaming. With its phenomenal success of the NES and this game, the video game industry once again took off, becoming one of the world's most significant economical contributors.And we very largely have this game to thank for it","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2011"}

Denick","summary":"An awesome game for fans of Uncharted and The Descent (the horror movie)","reviewText":"I've never spent much time playing the &#34;Tomb Raider&#34; series, but this reboot did all the right things, and it drew me right in. This modern take on the famous franchise takes inspiration from many great sources- my first impression, oddly enough, was of &#34;Resident Evil 4&#34; (a classic so significant, it's still influencing the gaming landscape). The early goings of &#34;Tomb Raider&#34; have a distinctly &#34;survival horror&#34; vibe that is masterfully conveyed, interspersed with just the right amounts of Quick Time Events, cinematic showpieces, character development, story telling, and gameplay tutorials. Additionally, it reminded me of the fantastic island of the TV show, &#34;Lost&#34; (complete with freaky natives and bunkers!).The most striking comparison, of course, is that of the &#34;Uncharted&#34; series. &#34;Tomb Raider&#34; obviously existed long before &#34;Uncharted&#34;, but it's equally obvious that it drew inspiration from the mechanics of climbing, combat, and cinematic storytelling of one of this generation's most successful series. And I'm not complaining at all- I wish there were more games like &#34;Uncharted&#34;! For the most part, &#34;Tomb Raider&#34; does a fantastic job implementing these elements, resulting in a game that is a blast to play and easy to pick up. Everything is very responsive, the settings are visually vibrant and interesting, and the island is begging for more thorough searching. The inclusion of TONS of unlockables is a genius notion, including documents (which help to further unfurl the mystery of the island), artifacts, and salvage (for weapon and gear upgrades), and it means crazy amounts of replay value... plus the online multiplayer aspect, if that strikes your fancy.The only thing holding &#34;Tomb Raider&#34; back is that when pitted up against the unrivaled production values of &#34;Uncharted&#34;, it falls a shade short. The characters are noticeably lacking compared to the likes of Nathan, Sully, and Elena, and the presentation just seems a bit &#34;off&#34;. There's such an emphasis placed on (literal and figurative) darkness and grittiness, I oftentimes had difficulty seeing what was going on around my character, and it actually had something of a demoralizing effect (particlarly when compared to the bright, tropical locales of &#34;Uncharted&#34;). That's not to say that &#34;Tomb Raider&#34; is a bad game- it's not. In reality, it's a very good game- it's just not among my top favorites.Final note (MINOR spoilers follow): The producers of this game must be huge fans of the movie &#34;The Descent&#34;, for there are many nods to the horror film, including Lara's affinity for the climbing axe, the &#34;bone scramble&#34; toward daylight in the opening moments, and the slow emergence from the red pool of ichor in &#34;the pit&#34;. Additionally, Lara's psychological transformation closely mirrors that of &#34;The Descent&#34;'s protagonist. It was an excellent source to draw inspiration from, and the developers of &#34;Tomb Raider&#34; did a fine job of subtly paying homage to it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2014"}

C. Bryant","summary":"Huge scale, small scope.  Some will love it, others (like me) will fall asleep at the wheel.","reviewText":"Burnout Paradise is a beautiful looking and sounding game, with an expansive city throughout which a wide variety of events beckon.  It is a competent and worthwhile racer, with the added pleasures of stunt driving, and worthwhile online play.I believe that all to be true, even as I'll say that I found the game rather dull, and very repetitive.  With each aspect of the game that impressed me, I found related issues that were equally annoying.  The draw distance for the roads and city/scene-scape for example is extraordinary -- not so for traffic which may and does at times appear almost immediately in front of you.  Online play was fun while it worked, and my connection was solid, but that didn't seem to be the case for many others as people kept dropping and having to rejoin as we tried to play.I am a huge fan of free/open driving type games, but this one feels more like the longest and most complex closed track in the world, rather than like a living city.  The traffic is sparse and mindless, there's no real evidence of life in the city itself, no police-related consequences for racing through a busy intersection at 100mph and smashing into another car.  My suggestion is not that these things would have been important to the core purpose of the city, which is really just a backdrop to a series of racing and stunt events on a closed network or roads, but it would have been nice if everything had felt a little more alive and vibrant between races.I felt little drive to move from event to event.  Like every other 360 title, there were achievements to obtain, better licenses to earn, more cars to drive, but I just felt that the game lacked a quality that made me really want to progress though.  Instead, it was more of a hodgepodge of unrelated individual events that required a rather drab commute.I'm going to stop well short of calling this a bad game.  It's absolutely not, and I believe that a lot of people do and will enjoy it.  For me, it's more rental than purchase quality, but that's a pretty subjective measure.Here's the bottom line.  If all you're looking for is a good racer; good audio, visuals, physics, online accessibility, and free roaming, then this is an entirely worthwhile choice.  If you prefer some depth to your driving games; whether that come in the form of increasingly hostile authorities as is the case inNeed for Speed Most Wanted, the hyper-realism (to cross platforms for the sake of example)Gran Turismo: 5 Prologue, the pure stunt/story play ofStuntman: Ignition, or the \"living world\" quality ofGrand Theft Auto IV-- then this probably isn't what you're looking for.If you don't desire that extra depth (and there's absolutely nothing wrong with wanting a specialized/focused game), then do check this one out, because I think you'll have a blast even if I didn't.  I know, a mixed message review, \"it wasn't for me, but it may well be for you,\" but that's the trick with these things, isn't it?  Particularly when it's a solid, high-quality, well-developed product such as this, but one that may be a little too niche or otherwise narrow in scope to please those who want a more immersive experience.  Ask yourself what you want out of a racing game, that's the trick to deciding whether this is a purchase, a rental, or a pass.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0053BSNZU","description":"","reviewerName":"pastapadre","summary":"Significant gameplay and career mode advancements, and high fun factor, while online continues to struggle.","reviewText":"The failure of UFC Undisputed 2010 to capitalize on the success of the first entry in the series forced THQ and UFC to reevaluate the viability of their product as a yearly release. The result has been a nearly two year gap that now culminates with the arrival of UFC Undisputed 3. The extra time has paid some substantial dividends - but one design decision in particular and troubled online performance remain concerns.UFC Undisputed 3 carries with it a solid amount of content. There is the standard exhibition fights in UFC or Pride, Career, Title, Tournament, and Event modes along with Online which are all pretty straight forward in what they offer.The Ultimate Fights mode is intriguing in that they attempt to recreate popular fights from the past while including video packages about them. There are tasks set up to complete throughout the fight at specific times and a percentage grade is given based on how much is achieved. It can be tough to fight in that manner though - trying to complete the tasks rather than just do what is necessary to win doesn't feel completely natural or even necessarily make sense contextually at a given time. Career mode has stripped out frustrating elements while pushing the focus more on the fights and progression making that much more enjoyable.Pride is a blast and a valuable addition to the series. Everything from the presentation to the varied rule sets and unique venue make it a lot of fun to play. It won't at all be surprising if fans tend to prefer playing in Pride vs UFC. Presenation has been enhanced elsewhere too and the new camera angle, though not going to feel drastically different, does bring the action much closer and the perspective works well for the fights.Gameplay wise there isn't much to gripe about at least on the surface. Refs tend to stand up fighters a bit early - this was probably done on purpose rather than just becoming an unexpected issue as maybe casual types don't want to be stuck maneuvering on the ground with little success whether they're on the offensive or stuck blocking transitions. Ultimately though the big problem comes down to the flawed submission system which, going back to E3 last year, was the most cited gripe with the game and for good reason.What amounts to a mini-game of `cat and mouse' not only takes the user's eyes off the fighters in these critical moments but the success of submission attempts remains inconsistent and unrealistic. Against the CPU it seems nearly impossible to submit them - at the same time there is little concern that the CPU will actually complete a submission against the user. There has yet to be a situation where either \"caught\" the opponent with a submission but instead the one in danger almost always escapes easily under the system. It's been the same way in head-to-head (both off and online) fights too with submissions easily escaped by evading in the mini-game.That alters tactics and strategy greatly. Offensively I find there to be little reason to attempt submissions. Why risk advantageous position when the submission is likely to fail? Conversely I haven't found myself defending against submissions because they're easy to get out of and the result is actually a positive shift of positioning and momentum.Otherwise the gameplay has proven to be fairly well balanced with counter-strategies to utilize based on any tactic an opponent could be throwing out there. There has yet to be any frustrating element beyond the submission system - the clinch is handled much better and the ground game simpler to understand.Fights have been challenging but fair. Those that I've lost I've never gotten upset about and in fact often been impressed by the outcome. That is usually the best indicator of a good game - when the time spent with it is enjoyable regardless of a win or loss.\"Sim\" stamina is an addition that the more hardcore crowd will enjoy. It makes a huge difference and forces fights to be much more realistic. Most will probably stick with the default stamina but the option is appreciated regardless.The new \"Amateur\" controls have been a refreshing addition and something I quickly got comfortable with using. There is a slight advantage for those using the \"Pro Controls\" (as there should be) but in terms of simplicity and accessibility the \"Amateur\" set holds up well. The tutorials also can help get users accustomed to the game to an extent but aren't much more than just an introduction - there are even a couple that took a while to complete because they weren't clear enough in what was expected. It's just tedious to go through them one to the next and invest that much time but it's probably worth it in the end.Online performance continues to threaten the completeness of the product. Most of the fights have been so lag-plagued that they've essentially been complete wastes of time. It has been encouraging that at least there have been a few smooth and responsive fights and they've been recent ones - but even then the masses haven't hit the servers yet so things are likely going to get worse before they get better. Quitters aren't getting losses or seeing DNF % rise either which means that'll be a serious problem to address and there's also no real reason not to choose the highest rated fighters so variety in match-ups will be sorely lacking. Since releasing the server has often been unavailable and the number of disconnects high. I'll update further in regards to online play in the near future.Other notes: There is some sort of issue with installing the game to the hard drive on the 360 that requires being signed out of Xbox Live for it to begin the install. Tapping gloves at the start of the fight is seemingly dangerous as the CPU usually chooses to throw a cheap shot. The refs can be somewhat distracting as they vanish or appear out of thin air at times. They also don't end the fights as quickly as one would expect allowing for some awkward late shots. In replays collision detection looks iffy and there appears to be very little force on the blows. The \"Highlight Reel\" feature which was previously detailed is a nice addition but the best part comes with the game automatically storing the last 50 rounds of fights.There is little doubt that UFC Undisputed 3 will be looked back on at the end of the year as one of the strongest efforts amongst the crop of sports games. Hopefully it won't fall into the category of \"almost great\" because of poor online play so that'll have to be monitored in the days and weeks ahead. Otherwise THQ has delivered a winner with refreshing accessibility, increased authenticity, stronger content, and fun balanced gameplay.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2012"}

It tells you what you need to do and then you play the game. Once you have gone through and unlocked each of the games, you can go back and play any and all the games you want.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2010"}
