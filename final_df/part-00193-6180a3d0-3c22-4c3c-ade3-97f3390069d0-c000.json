{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"OrangeCrush \"Still shooting with Film!\"","summary":"The New Standard for Storytelling in Videogames.","reviewText":"First and foremost this game has flaws. In fact, it has quite a few of them. With that being said, the story and storytelling aspect of this game is so amazing that its makes the flaws easily forgettable. I truly believe that videogames will become the most popular storytelling medium in the years to come. The unique advantageous properties that this medium holds over the other popular storytelling mediums, such as film and novels, are just now really starting to come to fruition. Videogame makers have been trying for years to bring videogames up to the movie level in regards to the quality of story. For the most part its been a slow progression as writers have really had to learn how to write a quality script for a videogame. What works for films doesn't really work for videogames. Its a different medium and as such it has its own unique challenges. L.A. Noire is ultimately a perfect example of just how far videogames have come and to say they have come a long way would be a massive understatement.I wont get too much into the story as I dont want to spoil anything. The story basically starts out with your character, Cole Phelps, coming home from the war and joining the police force. Your main duties throughout the game include the assessment of crime scenes, the collection of clues and evidence, and the questioning of characters. Its really a simply system that works perfectly for this game. The real challenge comes from interrogating and questioning the characters. What seems easy in the first couple cases quickly becomes a real challenge with later cases. Its really the most successful cop/detective game made to date in this regard. Its important to note that all of the cases in this game were based off of real life L.A. cases. This was a brilliant move on the developers part as it made the game just seem that much more authentic and real. I was constantly thinking about how these cases really happened which added to the realism and seriousness of the game. There are really two kinds of cases in the game. The story cases, which constantly keep the main plot going, and the side cases, which unfortunately wind up being one of the serious flaws to this game. The story cases are all outstanding.The graphics are really nice and the attention to detail is nothing short of astounding. The buildings, cars, billboards, clothing, music etc... Its all spot on for the period. Very few games have me actually just walking around aimlessly checking out the scenery. Just a remarkable job. In particular, I really enjoyed some of the cars that were made available throughout the game. I am an old car buff and it was amazing seeing so many models and the attention to detail that they gave the cars. For people like myself, that enjoy older cars, its just a real treat and ultimately just another aspect to this game that adds to the realism. There is no fast travel option which I think was a good thing. Things like that take away from the realism. The city itself is huge and you can expect to do quite a bit of driving at certain points in the game. On top of that the game itself is HUGE. The amount of recorded dialogue is nothing short of stunning. This is not a game your going to get through in 6-8 hours. It took me closer to 35 hours to get through the first time and there is very little filler. Most of the game centers around the main storyline. You certainly get more than enough game for the money. I also have to mention the B&W; option. Playing the game in B&W; is definitely the way to go. It just adds to that Noire quality.As for the negatives, there are a few things that stick out. First and foremost are the side cases. They are all extremely easy and extremely repetitive. I am not quite sure what the developers were thinking here. Just trying to add some more action to the game? I dont know but those cases ultimately wind up being one of the games biggest flaws. There are really 3 different kinds of side cases. Chasing people on foot, chasing people in a car and the shootout. The only ones that were even remotely challenging were a couple of the latter car chases. Everything else was extremely easy especially the shootouts. Not only can you take like 15 bullets before going down but you also have an aiming system that makes it way too easy to hit your target. This game just screams to be taken seriously yet the bad guys can empty guns into you and you still wont go down. On top of that all you have to do is stay under cover and your health regenerates. They should have gone the opposite route and made these side jobs far more challenging and far more realistic. As is the cases are really a waste of time and they really take away from the flow of the main story.Another negative that sticks out is the driving. While the cars themselves are great, the driving....well, lets just say its not the best driving simulator I have ever seen. I will admit that it gets better once you actually get used to the style. By the end of the game I was tearing around in my cars without a problem. Still, I think they could have gone with a better driving system. Another thing that might bother people is the save system. There are really no save options. The game automatically saves your progress so if you get something wrong, you either have to live with it or go back and play the entire case over again. Part of me really likes this as it makes you live with your choices, again adding to the realism and ultimately the re-playability.Bottom line - If your a gamer that lives for the fast action FPS kind of game then you might want to rent this first. This game is slow and is all about story and as such there will be gamers who consider it boring. On the other hand, if you like adventure games and games that actually make you stop and think....well, you would be hard pressed to find a better experience on consoles today. L.A. Noire is second to none in regards to its level of storytelling. Its not a perfect experience but again its so well done that it makes it very easy to forgive its faults. What this game does better than anything else is show you just what this medium is capable of in regards to storytelling. I am extremely excited for the future of this medium and its games like this that give you a glimpse as too what the future holds for this industry.L.A. Noire is not only a great game, its ultimately one of the best experiences I have ever had on a console.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2011"}

Those games rocked anyway, and still stand as the best wrestling games to hit home consoles in the history of the industry. What i will (complain) about, however, is the way Yuke's totally broke the Story mode in this year's version. Smack down 2's Story mode was nigh endless, which was a problem. But i've yet to have Story mode last longer than four matches in Just Bring it that's just ridiculous. If you lose a match, win a title, or defend a title, it's gameover. That's not nearly enough time to play out any of the convoluted storylines the WWf is famous for. It's extremely annoying if you're playing this as a one player game, especially since Story mode unlocks all the cool create a wrestler bonuses. Once you get past that, though, SmackDown is awsome. Get a multi tap and a few friends together, and the beauty of just bring it comes to light pretty quickly. It plays great, looks just as good, and features most of the wrestlers you've come to love or hate from watching Raw and SmackDown. Come on, we know you do. Plus it's so fulfilling, almost therapeutic, to layeth the smacketh down on a few of your buddies.

Nevertheless, that hasn't meant that all racing games are all bad. That has absolutemy been the case with Mario Kart from Nintendo. Since the franchise debuted in 1993 for the Super Nintendo system, it has been recognized as one of the most popular racing games in video game history. Since then, Mario Kart has really scored big for systems like the Nintendo 64, and the Nintendo Gamecube. Now, it is set to show again on the portable video game market. Last time, it really felt a little dismal with Mario Kart: Super Circuit for the Game Boy Advance. Can this one score better? Yes it can.Mario Kart DS for the Nintendo DS handheld, is a highly received game that again finds Mario and his pals into the extreme worlds of racing. This time, the time goes even better than before. The game features 2 seperate gand prixs than just 1. The main surprise is the retro grand prix with tracks from all the earlier Mario Kart games, which is great for anybody who hasn't played the earlier Mario Kart games, especially the ones for the Super NES and Nintendo 64. There is also the DS grand prix's, with 16 new and exciting tracks to play. This time, there is also more to unlock in this game including characters like Daisy, and Dry Bones who recently made a comeback on Mario Superstar Baseball and Mario Party 7 for the Gamecube, and delightful new cars to race. The game also highlights the wi-fi connection for players to race interactively head-to-head. The control and the gameplay is juat amazing, and a great improvement in the portable edition. The sounds and the gameplay is great and just incredible fun to play.If you own a Nintendo DS game system, this is one game you can't help but buy. Mario Kart DS is a pure racing delight for all gamers, and adds on to what Nintendo has built behind Mario and friends' checkered flag.Graphics: B+Sound: BControl: B 1/2+Fun & Enjoyment: B+Overall: B 1/2+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2005"}
{"product_name":"B0000A9Y11","description":"Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

Sme\"","summary":"Good game","reviewText":"I remembered \"TimeShift\" from it's brief run of commercials on TV about three years ago, so I guess in the long run advertising does work as I finally bought it last year.  It's a fairly fun shooter that's longer than the current run of done-in-an-evening games, with some original ideas.The graphics are good but not great, and the AI/combat could have been better.  The general plot is you follow a mad scientist back to 1939, where he's established a different timeline with himself as the leader (but don't they always do that?)I fault the set design somewhat as it never feels like you're in an altered 1939, more like another universe. Also, the backstory/interaction is minimal.  You're just some guy in a suit who shows up and people put you to work.  You don't talk and there's not enough interaction with other characters to feel like they're part of the story.  Lastly, the cutscenes are almost cryptic; I never figured some of them out.The early levels are pretty hard, at least until you get improved weapons, then it becomes a matter of not outdoing yourself and getting stuck/surrounded.The main event, though, is the suit that controls time.  You can slow down, stop, or reverse time, with several puzzles that require it's use.  The ones that had me scratching my head were the reverse time ones, the rest were easy enough--I do wonder what they could have done with an option for speeding time up.  One of the interesting things you can do when time is stopped is run around and disarm your enemies, but it's harder to do than it looks.Overall TimeShift is not a classic, but definitely a fun and original game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2010"}

{"product_name":"B001IK1BJ0","reviewerName":"Aaron Keating","summary":"Another smashing hit from Bioware","reviewText":"Got this game for Christmas, and I've sunk time into this game..... Alot of time. Scary amount of time. I just can't stop playing! I suspect there is going to be a sick day called in just to play this game in the near future. This is a game of a rare breed. Someone cared about Quality, and wanted to put out not just a good story, but a whole world.Onto the review.Dragonage is Bioware's newest RPG. The inevitable question arises early in this review. Is this as good as Mass Effect, and I will say yes it is. Is it better? No. That's not a bad thing though. Unless you are a shooter boi with the attention span of a 2 year old, or one of those FF \"Must have cutscene for limit break!\" weirdos. This game, has everything that you should want and expect out of an RPG and things you don't.Fast paced dirty combat. This is a million times a good thing. I'm never bored in combat which is something which is critical in an RPG as you spend alot of time in combat typically. Though in this game's case honestly the amount of time spent in combat is rather short compared to the exploration, and story elements of the game. No random encounters (Thank you!) or the ones that happen are so infrequent that it feels rather organic rather than Two steps Encounter! (Looking at you Final Fantasy series!).I'm going to dive into a tangent about the Combat, because one Issue with this game is it's controls. Mass Effect, easily had one of the best options for selecting spells and abilities out of any game I've ever played. They didn't use the Wheel.... For whatever reason. Well they did. Technically but for some reason it doesn't seem as intuitive as Mass Effects.  I think where my real problem comes in with the controls is sometimes you select an ability and nothing happens. No there's no combat going on. Just sometimes nothing happens. Like when you are in the Fade and ready to change forms. You click the change form to the form you want and nothing.  The mouse form in particular suffers from this. The Real Time, option is nice though for power selection. This is a Massive improvement over Mass Effect. It lets combat feel pretty organic and intuitive.Fights never take very long in Dragonage, which is in my opinion a very good thing.Graphics: I don't really rate graphics in an RPG. Dragonage's graphics are not as good as Mass Effects. That being said there is ALOT of content here, and for that content frankly the Not as Good rating really isn't a bad deal at all. The Graphics are far from the ugliest I have ever seen on the 360, and I've never seen a game with this much content with better graphics.Story: Pretty standard over story, but that's not a bad thing. To me the hallmark of a good game, isn't the overstory but the journey and the way it is presented and in this category Dragon Age is easily King with. The sheer amount of character development is astounding and I'm only 20 hours into this game. I love listening to the characters interact with each other, and I enjoy how different they are from each other. The \"they like you or dislike you\" system also feels very organic and real given the characters. What's good for one won't be for another necessarily etc. So your attitudes actually rub people a different way. Something I enjoy a great deal in games. The side stories are fun, originalish and worthy of play. The overstory is dark, gritty and full of drama. This is a potent and winning combination.Familiar faces: new (for videogames) twists. Very good way to sum up this game world. It's sorta like Warhammer but not nearly as Emo.Voice Acting: There are alot of voices in this game. More than you can shake a stick at. And they are all good quality and alot of voices are familiar. I haven't looked at the credits yet (as I have yet to beat this game) but I could swear Captain Janeway is in this game, as is Criton's love interest from Farscape, and I could swear Tim Curry is in this game too. There are alot of other familiar voices, such as Ashley from Mass Effect and none of them are poor or drop really bad lines.Difficulty: Easy, Medium to High, to Stupidly Frustratingly Difficult. All depending on what you select. If you want to play strictly in real time with only rarely using the Ability Wheel (which pauses combat) play on Casual. The game is still fairly challenging on casual enough so that you feel the Threat of Death as the game progresses but easy enough for just about anyone to enjoy. Medium/Normal is for more Tactically minded players familiar with more Difficult RPGs, and you will need to use the Wheel to select Abilities, bouncing between characters quite often to pull through a fight. Especially the more difficult fights.  The game obviously scales up from there, to finishing off with Tactical Genius Required Nightmare mode.This company is becoming to me, what Square was to me at one time. It's becoming my favorite game company, as everything I've played that is their child has been gold.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2009"}
{"product_name":"B001IK1BJ0","reviewerName":"Nathan T.","summary":"Overhyped Game Backed Up By FanBoys FLAWS LISTED","reviewText":"This is one of the most overhyped game I've seen. Commercials and trailers give the illusion of an epic game, but this game is no where near being epic. I asked a few folks to rate this game from a scale of 1-10. A lot of them gave it 9s or 10s. I asked if the graphics and gameplay was THAT great to justify for the high score and many of their responses were \"yeah, but I rate it based on how I enjoyed it, but the game was filled with flaws especially the console version.So this review goes for the console version (x 360).I've spent about 70 hours altogether thoroughly exploring and taking my time playing the game and I have to say it is very similar to knights of the old republic and mass effect 1 in terms of control.The plot is similar to the typical medieval setting, reminds me a lot of lord of the rings because think: Dwarves, elves, orc like creatures? Dragons don't exactly help originality here. So for all those fanboys out there that rave about the game, I'm here to douse out your lame mediocre inducing flame about this game that is far from a 10, I mean it'll probably be a 10 if the highest score was 100.FLAWS (hopefully more patches will come out to alleviate some of these problems):UPDATE#11a. Just found another flaw to add to the list. You can't manually dodge attacks. Like in real life, if someone swings a sword at you and you back out of the range of the swing, it should miss you right? Not in this game. Spells follow you even though you move aside like it has a heat seeker built into it. The minute a melee character starts their attack on you, it's too late to even try to move aside because you can be 10ft away and the game will still register it as a hit. So try it, stand in front of a person with a sword and as soon as they start their swing, back off. You still get hit as you're running off....even if you're 5-10ft away...1b. I agree with those ppl that say the end battle is too hard. It is exceedingly harder than any battle you've faced in the game, especially to the average player lacking any outside help like faqs and guides. Even the hardest battles in the game is nothing compared to the end battle, so even if you feel like you're doing fairly well throughout the game, the end battle will catch you offguard. Ridiculously hard.UPDATE #2:Main character has no voice acting. Everyone else has it except you, why does this make no sense whatsoever?1. One of the biggest flaw in this game is the lack of exaggeration, facial and body animation and expression. No way can any game lack so much basic fundamental animation and still be declared anywhere above even a 6. Please play this game and see it for yourself. Example: You walk into your house and found everything gone. A real person would react in a sense of disbelief and a look of horror would be seen in their facial expression - a distortion of their facial features etc. Their body expression and movement would be an exaggerated by wild movements to the circumstance - flailing their arm about wildly, shaky legs due to fear, falling due to clumsiness caused by fear and not thinking correctly etc etc.However, in this game, the animation would be a significantly washed down version where the person's facial expression looks plain but with his mouth open at the most. He would stand there like a dope and the only further evidence of horror would be the yelling that came out of the hole in his face.Play this game and watch carefully at the animation. Look at their face and body movements. Now, pretend if you were in their circumstances or ask yourself: \"How would a real person REALLY react if they were in that situation?\"  Sorry, but this game is washed out. Graphics and animation in this game is done to the bare minimum.2. Graphics. Subpar at best, especially to the caliber of graphics there are nowadays. I'm not talking about the art, I'm pretty sure the game was suppose to look the way it's suppose to look currently, I'm talking about the quality of their graphics. The graphics in this game has not advance NEARLY far enough to justify any positive remarks to it. It is not even worth talking about. Smooth binding in the graphics is horrible. Watch as the characters walk, their legs go through their clothing sometimes. That is one of the most simplest and basic of mistakes and this game just takes the cake. To anyone that think the graphics is alright, check out other games that recently came out. GOOD GAMES, sorry but this game is a disgrace. Makes me want to get a PS3 just to play God of War 3, totally smash this game in every aspect. I know some PS1 games that'll still smash this game. Believe it or not, there's actually floating characters in this game. I've witnessed it twice, just noticing a character in town just floating 20 foot up in the air....3. Lame storyline. It has a typical plot, beginning through end. You basically play this whole game knowing the exact outcome of it. There are some variations, but the kind of twist this game has to offer is hardily worth a second glance into.4. Battle system for the console version is not smooth and I would find it hard to deal with especially during battles that require a smooth battling system. Lets all admit, lags and delays kill. Play the PC version if you can, it's significantly better in my personal opinion. Example would be you having to babysit after selecting a skill.  Usually when you play, if you choose a skill, you should be at least confident that your character will listen to your command and use the move. However, there is a slight delay and sometimes your character will ignore your commands to use it completely. Many times in this game you'll have to double or triple select moves to make sure they even use it. In the game you are also able to make your teammates hold their positions or follow you. However, changing between either will cause a slight delay in which all your characters are very temporarily stuck in place helpless. This isn't all that bad unless of course you have a horde of enemies on their way or already surrounding you, a one second delay or so can hurt you, especially when it happens over and over again.5. Can't delete save files in game.....you have to go into your system memory....I mean what the heck?6. This one is either me or maybe it is for everyone. I find the navigator for the map useless many times. You know the one that shows you where to go and stuff. Many times it doesn't. I would definitely like the type of quality objective navigation system found in Oblivion. I don't recall even being able to add navigational marks on the map to help me navigate it.7. There's some sexual content in this game, but oh boy is it corny and embarrassing.8. The game should be a bit more clear with choice outcomes, some in which will cause you to lose teammates. I mean losing a teammate that you mainly use a lot in most if not all of your battles is a very serious thing and I just think the game, even though it is RPG, should at least give you some hints at least when it comes to serious choices like that.9. Horrible character development. Throughout the game, I don't think you'll find one single character that you'll be really attached to other than using them in battle. Alistair, for one, is one of the most annoying characters in the game. If you were a woman character, you have the choice of romancing him. However, how can you romance a person that you want to hate so much? Play the game and find out. I'm glad it is just a game, too.10. When you gear up your character and you're not talking to them, you see their gear on them. But when you talk to them, suddenly all of their gear disappears and they appear in their default gear. This game is pact with these little flaws which in the end equals a giant big massive blunder.CONCLUSION:This game is fun in many ways, however, if I had the choice again I'd opt for the PC version. More angles to use, less game killing glitches, less obvious flaws, etc.After playing it, I have to say I'm sorely disappointed because I was expecting an epic game filled with epic boss battles. Sorry, but after you play God of War on the PS2, these games are just blah. They all need to learn the definition of EPIC-ness. Epic, in my book, means a moment that you'll always remember. A moment that put you in the edge of your seat, your heart beating fast, your eyes wide, your hands gripping remote. And when it is over, you have this good and bad feeling in you. Good cause you just played the most awesome and time worthy game ever and bad because it ended and you wanted more. This game just doesn't have that. I'm glad I'm through it, it was sort of fun, but boring many times.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2010"}

He is the last of a noble and respected line. Raised in a series of safehouses by families loyal to his father's memory, Lucas will not rest until the Legion is rebuilt, and his family's honor is restored. Lucas has been taught the art of combat in the ancient and deadly style of the Legion. Lucas is a skilled swordsman, and a master of two combat stances. He can fight with a sword and shield, which allows him to attack quickly, deal heavy damage, and interrupt and stun single targets. When outnumbered, he wields a massive two-handed sword. While slower to swing and less practical for one-on-one combat, it can strike multiple foes and knock them back, making it an ideal weapon for crowd control.AnjaliAnjali is an archon - a legend, come to life.

In human form, she fights with a staff or a spear, allowing her to fend off multiple attackers while leaping in and out of the fray.

There are side quests, quests tied into the main story, and there is lots of loot, while the customization of the loot is very confusing and is not explained in the manual at all, stats like Will, Block, Warding, Chaos:  Element type, Retribution, Stagger, and even how Agility is used, is not explained anywhere, leaving you to guess how these work.  It's even worse for the PC, as you have to download a manual.  However being able to tailor a character with specialization of abilities and talents, does offset this, and allows you to customize your playstyleThe reason I do not give this game a 5 star rating is because of how badly multiplayer is done.  About the only thing that you retain is levels when playing coop.  Sacred 2, while definatly not a polished hack and slash RPG, got the system right.  Even Dungeon Hunter:  Alliance, a 10 dollar game on PSN, got it right, and it even lets you play 4 players locally, and share loot.You would think that Square Enix would've learned from Final Fantasy XIV, CHANGING CORE MECHANICS OF A GAME THAT MAKES SENSE is utterly stupid, levequests, enough said.  Part of what made multiplayer fun in Diablo was the fact that you had the option to bounce in and out of games, go kill your boss and leave to the next game.  In Dungeon Siege 3, you are stuck with the host of the game, you cannot wander around freely, and your storyline choices do nothing but possibly award you trophies.  The multiplayer trophies would also be much better if you could use your own characters from single player.Do yourselves a favor and enjoy the single player mode of the game, and only do online for the trophies, you will enjoy the game much more.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005BW7Q","reviewerName":"Adrian Jenkins \"southerndudeman\"","summary":"A very strong title with some minor flaws.","reviewText":"Well, I have put a solid weekend into Xenosaga (episode one), and I can honestly say that I enjoy this title. I won't comment about the plot, except to say that it is top notch (any spoiling of the surprises would take half the fun of the game), and any RPGer would be sorry to miss it.However, flaws do come to mind. For example (and this is minor), this game is supposed to take place thousands of years before Xenogears, yet many of the characters which appear there have their roots in this game (e.g. Citan Uzuki obviously descends, over thousands of years , from two characters in this game, and minor characters from Xenogears, such as Vanderkampf, have relatives which look IDENTICAL to their future counterpart). While I'm sure that some gamers think they're cool (whatever) for getting these in-game references, I would prefer more realism (let's face it - how many people in the world, even Asians, can honestly trace their roots back even 1000 years?). I guess it's cute, but whatever.Also, the graphics are nothing to scream about. In fact, they are reminiscent of Square's much earlier offering, Final Fantasy VIII, and are nowhere near FFX. The characters in cutscenes are static - their hair doesn't move, their clothes don't ruffle, etc. The actual gameplay graphics are OK, however.Finally, the cut scenes are a little too much. The voice acting isn't horrible, and the graphics (though I complained above) are OK. However, the first 10 hours or so are dominated by cut scenes (I know the story is rich and perhaps difficult to develop in the gameplay, but I think the developers could have tried a little harder).Now that I have ranted (and really, these flaws are minor), I should praise. The story is magnificent, and will pull the gamer in even though it develops on screen (rather than interactively). Also, the gameplay is fun (the combo system returns from Xenogears, but it is simpler, and spell-learning is handled in a clever way). Also, there is a random effect which occurs every turn in battle (e.g. the next turn will have a boosted chance for a critical hit, the following turn will have a boosted ether attack, etc.). The developers used this in a clever way at times, but I'll leave it to the player to discover just how it works!Also, four mini-games can be unlocked during game play. These minigames are fantastic, and very involved (I'll give away only one of these - a Magic-type card game in which you build a deck throughout the game in order to vie for tournament victories and fabulous prizes). The games are well thought-out, but can be complicated at times.Anyway, I've rambled here. In summary, this is a worthwhile game to own, but the flaws are noticeable. I hope that Namco and company can sort this out by the time episode two rolls around (particularly the cutscene problem).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2003"}

The setting of the universe is interesting, there's a million characters you can talk to, and they all have lots of dialogue.

Players can buy up all the land in a town and can become mayor, king, and even emperor of the entire land.Fable 2 presents a dynamic and free-roaming world that doesn't demand a player to take any one set path. At the same time, players seeking a plot line will find an epic story and quest that they can follow if they wish, along with many side adventures.Fight Using Different Weapons and MagicFable 2 introduces a new combat system that allows for mastery of hand weapons, such as swords, long range weapons such as cross-bows and guns, and, of course, magic. Players improve at each discipline with time, and can combine different combat styles when they fight. Other advanced design features include tactical positional advantages that can bring new strategic elements into combat.Bring Other Players into Your WorldFable 2 has a multiplayer mode that allows you to bring other players into your own world. Consistent with the rest of the game, the actions of these other players can be permanent and affect your world. You can explore and fight together with these other players, share treasures, and even fight each other.Note:Fable 2 will not ship with Online Co-op mode. An update with this functionality is rumored to be released shortly after the launch of the game.Xbox LIVE Arcade Mini-GamesGamers can play minigames through Xbox LIVE Arcade and earn currency that can be used in Fable 2 to purchase weapons, armor, and other items for the hero.Fable 2 is rated M for having mature content that may be suitable for persons ages 17 and older.Depending on your choices, the protagonist can turn out wildly different -- male, female, good, evil, and more.","reviewerName":"CODYMART","summary":"Terrible crap packaged onto a disc.","reviewText":"You know the game ending glitches people have been so pissed about?

I know, I should be burned at the stake. Truthfully it never really interested me a life full of pop culture references and ribs gave me a basic idea and understanding of what they were about.So when I got this game included in a bundle with my XBox 360 I was interested to play it and possible learn a little more about the story.That was my goal for playing it and judging if it would be successful. I couldn't have been more disappointed. Basically you drop into a bar with no explanation of controls or where you or (or even who you are!) Instead you're instantly walking around with a bunch of lego people who all look the same. Nothing in the area was able to be interacted with and none of the people would talk to you. What's even worse, I found out I could attack the people but they suddenly produced guns and tons of armored people stormed in and started attacking me.I finally figured out I was in some sort of \"HUB\" area, and proceed to the door in the north west which lead to \"Episode I\". Some scrolling text went by in true Star Wars fashion but it didn't say anything useful. It didn't explain who I was or where I was going.I'm suddenly dropped into a strange conference room. Without all the people I learned that I had an AI controlled partner that I could switch to, who seemed to be better than the main character. Upon attacking the chairs they would shoot out coins that I was collecting for who knows what reason. Shouldn't I be collecting LEGOs?I played further, pushed through this level which consisted of getting a bunch of strange robots and making them stand on platforms in order to open doors and finally I was entered into a jungle level where I was saving Jabba the Hut or something. There was a huge war/invasion going on and it was pretty cool how everything was going on around me, and the enemies didn't always pay attention to me because they were doing other things.However I still rate this game a 1 because gameplay was juvenile (walk, jump, attack, get character X who is the only one who can do Y, then switch back to character A because hes the only one who can do B) and if you were hoping, like me, for any sort of story you'll be sorely disappointed. I don't get why all the LEGO games are so critically acclaimed - maybe its meant for people who know the story of the game they're playing or maybe it is meant for children who enjoy mindlessly hitting things and getting \"coins\".","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2011"}

Wright","summary":"Stunning graphics, boring game mechanics","reviewText":"While the visuals are, for the most part, spectacular, the gameplay is at best average for a button masher. So, here's my dilemma about the next gen consoles. While this game should epitomize the first in a long line of next gen games, the game mechanics are so average as to be boring.GraphicsQuite simply, the visuals are stunning. The characters look great. The environments look awesome. The armor is amazing. Also, when not in gameplay, the characters also move in realistic ways.  Once thrown into battle, all that changes.Gameplay and MechanicsThis is the crux of why you play a game. This is what makes the game worthy of the play through. Unfortunately, the designers of this game just threw any old random hack and slash button masher engine into what could have otherwise been a game of the year idea.While I do like the occasional hack and slasher pieces in a game, I don't want it to become the entire focus of the game play. It's not what I look for in a game with a story. I want to be challenged. I want to have to think about my next move. I don't want to just go running in and hacking and stabbing up every single 'enemy' in view. When are game designers going to realize that people (even game characters) have a choice? Let the AI enemies make the choice to attack you or to join with you.  I mean, having this clear and constant enemy idea is just so old-school it's boring.I want games that push the envelope; that let me explore these worlds in ways other than by death and dismemberment. If I choose to go that route, my choice. If I choose to do it another way, let me.Suffice it to say that Ryse's gameplay is simply an exercise in carpal tunnel. For a next gen game, give us next gen gameplay. Don't wrapper 1998 gameplay in a cotton candy coating.Audio and StoryThe voiceovers are good and the story seems okay if not just a bit shallow. Meaning, the gameplay threads are simply there to tie the carpal-tunnel-inducing gameplay segments together. It always irks me just a tad when I see game designers using the story merely as a vehicle to tie the gameplay together. I want to feel that both gameplay and story are one and the same, not two distinct and separate segments.  Unfortunately, in Ryse, the game seems focused on the gameplay segments at the expense of fully cohesive story.OverallIt's a 1.5 star game wrapped in 5 star graphics. Unfortunately, that doesn't make the game worthy of 5 stars. While it's pretty to behold, it completely fails to entice with the boring repetitive enemies. The enemies are so repetitive that the game designers couldn't even produce enemies with different behaviors and looks. There's all of about 3 enemy types in the game. A guy with an axe, a guy with a shield and axe and archers with an axe. The two most common enemies are the former two. And, they all look and act the same. If you're going to spend the time to set up battles with enemies, at least have the decency to come up with more than 2 character models and enemy tactics.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}

Controlling a mysterious figure that has inherited the legacy of the evil, long-dead Overlord, the player emerges, near death, from the ruins of the old Overlord's Dark Tower. Only the player's actions will determine if they will rise to become the new all-powerful Overlord; it's all down to how much of a bad ass they want to be in order to succeed...evil or really evil! Played out with plenty of black humor and dark irony, the game will immerse players in twisted parodies of classic fantasy scenarios and characters.","reviewerName":"Michael J. Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"It's Good to Be the Overlord","reviewText":"I didn't start out planning to be an evil overlord.When I found out that Overlord was a cross between Dungeon Keeper (where you get to play the bad guy in a fantasy world) and Pikmin (where you get to control different colored carrot people in quests), I was sold.My first impressions of Overlord was that I was playing Sauron, back when he was still a horse-headed giant-type, before all that all-seeing angry red eye on top of a tower business. As Overlord you are in charge of goblins, who come in four flavors: brown, red, blue, and green. Fans of Pikmin (or any video game on the planet) know how this works: blues are immune to water, greens are immune to poison, etc. These diabolical minions accompany your Overlord everywhere as you rampage around the countryside reclaiming your evil inheritance.  You know, cleaning up the tower, reclaiming all your minions, and finding a naughty girl to settle down with.Being an Overlord is rather domestic, apparently.-----+= EVIL OVERLORD RULE #24: I will maintain a realistic assessment of my strengths and weaknesses. Even though this takes some of the fun out of the job, at least I will never utter the line \"No, this cannot be! I AM INVINCIBLE!!!\" (After that, death is usually instantaneous.) =+-----I started out feeling very charitable to the peasants of Spree, returning their food from the evil halflings.  I discovered that Overlord is basically a cynical view of Lord of the Rings, with all the heroes being horrible hypocrites, and thus truly the villains.  Compared to Melvin Underbelly the gluttonous halfling, the Oberon the slothful elf, Sir William the lecherous lord, Goldo the greedy dwarf, Jewel the envious and Kahn the wrathful.  The seven deadly sins, wrapped up in fantasy stereotypes, all waiting to be defeated.There are two paths you can pursue in Overlord.  Be nice to people and do good deeds (or at least, not particularly evil deeds) and you can pursue the path of Lawful Evil, for those of you who know D&D.;  Be mean and it's a downward spiral into Chaotic Evil.  These choices reflect how the various characters interact with you, from the lowliest peasant to your mistress of choice.  I started out trying to be relatively nice, if only because all the walkthroughs I consulted whenever I got stuck took me down that path.Then I was on a quest to save some stupid sacred Tree of Life in a stupid sacred elf forest and in an attempt to stop two bloody unicorns (no, really, they're unicorns covered with blood) from killing me, I used a fire spell...and set the Tree of Life on fire. This in turn set the whole forest ablaze, bloody unicorns, elves, and all, who went up in a screaming conflagration.Well that pretty much dashed any hopes of my redemption right there and I started considering an evil path.  I felt bad about the whole thing and was actually considering making it up to the elves, maybe by planting some trees or something...Until I met Velvet.-----+= EVIL OVERLORD RULE #49: If I learn the whereabouts of the one artifact which can destroy me, I will not send all my troops out to seize it. Instead I will send them out to seize something else and quietly put a Want-Ad in the local paper.  =+-----About halfway through the game you have the opportunity to take a mistress.  Rose, Velvet's older and more straitlaced sister, calls your little goblins \"pixies\" and generally sets an imperious tone about your tower--MY tower, which I didn't invite her to.  So when I had the opportunity to switch to the sleek little minx named Velvet, reclining in laced up stockings on her bed and promising Teen-rated services...I suddenly had a change of perspective.Velvet's evil and she's not subtle about it.  She constantly threatens, cajoles, and pouts throughout the game to get you to do more evil things.  It worked.  Oh how it worked! And when you give Velvet what she wants, she...reciprocates.I'm not proud of this, but Xbox Live is.  Because it has Mistress Master as a title.  This has to be a new low.  Or a new high, depending on your perspective.Thus I became not just an evil overlord, but a really sadistic jerk.  I went back to Spree and slaughtered every inhabitant, burned every building to the ground, and took all their stuff.  Then I went back and enslaved their best-looking women as servants.  I mean...somebody knows what 12-year-old boys want.  I am not a 12-year-old boy, but I hope to be when I grow up.Overlord is a glorious form of stress relief.  You travel from area to area via your tower, slowly accumulating more minions and gold.  You can upgrade your weapons, learn new spells, and of course evil-fy your tower.  Because Velvet wants you to.  And you should really do what Velvet tells you to do if you know what's good for you.-----+= EVIL OVERLORD RULE #53: If the beautiful princess that I capture says, \"I'll never marry you! Never, do you hear me, NEVER!!!\" I will say \"Oh well\" and kill her. =+-----Overlord can be repetitive at times, especially when you run out of minions and have to resort to \"farming\" lesser creatures to get the magical energy up to create new ones.  Death has no penalties other than a loss of minions and starting over on a level, so there comes a tipping point where you are either clearly outmatched and thus have to spend more time mindlessly killing wimpy critters, or you are so powerful that you roll over everything in the game.By the end of the game, I had a huge pile of gold in my coffers--you can visit your coffers and watch as the gold accumulates.  I bought Velvet everything her wicked little heart desired and then some, from flaming demon-shaped fixtures to skull banners.  And I had a shiny new set of armor and weapons.  At one point I had ten female servants, Velvet lounging around, and Jewel in a cage in front of my throne.  This is not a game that caters to females...unless your name happens to be Velvet.It's good to be the Overlord.(Rules courtesy of Peter Anspach's The Top 100 Things I'd Do If I Ever Became An Evil Overlord: [...]","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00BGA9V2Q","reviewerName":"MikeB \"Metalhead\"","summary":"Unexpected Arcade Fun","reviewText":"I had very little knowledge of Diablo III before it released on consoles. I knew only that it was called a \"mouse-killer\" because of all the clicking required for play. When PC gamer friends of mine tried to describe the gameplay, it sounded boring. Then came the PS3 demo, and I tried it and liked it. Then my wife joined in for some co-op action, and I realized what this game is: old school 4-player arcade dungeon crawler. I remember playing Gauntlet Legends in the arcade, and this is similar to that, except with better graphics, more advanced gameplay, deeper RPG elements, and online play.I bought the game, and I am not disappointed. For those not familiar, or wondering what Diablo III plays like on console, it's pretty straightforward. The game plays from a static isometric view, you control your character's movement with the Left Stick, dodge roll with the Right Stick, and perform various attack and spells with the buttons. There are five classes of character to choose from, and all of them play very different. Enemies litter the levels, and as you explore the different locals, you'll kill hundreds of them, earning experience and leveling up. Leveling up unlocks new moves that you can use to fight enemies, and allows you to customize your character to your play style. Defeating large enemies and opening treasure chests gives you \"loot\", items you can equip to give you better offense and defense.What's really amazing about Diablo III is that all of this is streamlined so it all plays very fast. Menus are designed to navigated quickly, so that when 4 people are playing, you don't get bogged down with everybody spending all their time in the menu screen. There are shortcuts that allow you to equip or drop items in your inventory without even opening the menu, and a mini-map on screen allows you to navigate new areas with ease. The game is also huge and has lots of replayability. There are lots of difficulty levels to choose from, and randomized enemy, dungeon and loot drops make the game different every time you play. The controls are tight and responsive, and I never once had an issue where I felt the game wasn't registering my inputs. The controls are also simple enough that when the action gets chaotic, you never feel overwhelmed or confused. I always felt in-control.As a single player game, Diablo III is alright, but where it really shines is as a co-op game with two or more players. The action is fun and chaotic, and the game scales it's difficulty based on how many people are playing. What's also great is that up to four players can drop in and out of the game at any time, be it local or online, or any combination of the two. So, if your buddy drops by your house, he can pick up a controller and join your game instantly. Then if a friend of yours appears online, he can also join your game instantly, and the three of you can play together. If you feel like rounding out your party to an even four, you can open your game to \"Public\" and anybody can join in, even if they aren't in your friends list. Your friends can even transfer their characters using the cloud or USB and any items and progress will be saved and carried over to their console.The graphics are pretty good, but won't blow you away. The art is what really shines, as levels and characters are designed really well. There are some issues with frame rate and screen tearing, but it's rare and doesn't impact the gameplay. The sound design is also good, the music is appropriate, sound effects fit well, and voice acting is decent. About the only thing I've heard people complain about is the story, which doesn't quite live up to the previous games, but since I haven't played Diablo 1 or 2, I can't really say. I will say I thought the story was good, and kept me interested.If you've been looking for a 4 player co-op game that you can play online or locally with three buddies on your couch, this is the best game money can buy. The fast and fun pick up and play controls, easy drop-in, drop-out online and local co-op, hundreds of hours of gameplay, and deep-yet-simple RPG elements make this one of the best games I've played in a long time, and I highly recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0001KUE7S","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. If your PC has the juice to set this game loose and you have a thirst for first-person shooter action, you're in for a treat. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have.Hell on MarsYour character is a low-ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the Mars Research Facility of the United Aerospace Corporation (UAC). That's pretty much all the backstory you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the storyline department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of the Doom franchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?), it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well-crafted sound effects succeeded at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth... ethereal Revenants fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy... a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll often find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might easily be solved by duct-taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.Looking GoodDoom 3looks incredible. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. The eye candy does come at a price, though, and we were forced to play at fairly low resolution even on a Pentium IV 2.8 GHz and an ATI Radeon 9500. Even so, gameplay was smooth as silk. For higher resolutions (1024 x 768 and above) the latest generation of ATI or Nvidia cards is suggested.--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessRich variety of enemiesPlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineStiff system requirementsNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multiplayer options","reviewerName":"Joseph Izzo","summary":"Starts out great but gets old fast.","reviewText":"I loved Doom 3, for about 4 hours or so.

Yes, it seems a little repetitive and padded at times, but it's hard to find a TPS that isn't.  I mean, the whole idea of a shooter is to go from point A to point B and shoot everything that moves that isn't your teammate.The gameplay itself is a cross between Dead Space, Vanquish, and the action portions of Mass Effect 2 and 3.  Lots of duck-and-cover with at least a couple of teammates who will respond to your commands if you're being reasonable and they trust you.  Also, your level of trust with your teammates has an effect on who survives the final battle (like in Mass Effect), so you want to be mindful to keep everyone happy.More often than not, a single shot won't clean house.  Instead, like in Dead Space, you quickly learn to shoot arms and legs when a head shot isn't likely.  But these are robots, and they'll still keep crawling towards you, so you keep shooting until the sparks stop!The boss battles reminded me of Vanquish.  Those bosses are huge and take some doing before going down.  But the controls are tight enough and (at least until the final battle) judicious use of cover helps you keep the difficulty level in check.It's a beast of a download at 11 Gigs, presumably for the voice recognition element of the game.  I didn't use it, preferring to just press L2 and pick a dialog option.If you don't care for third-person shooters, this won't make you a convert, but if you do, it's a good story with fun characters and some solid gameplay.

The PS Move and the WII are yesterdays news, having all three I can say the kinect shines above the rest.  Kinect isnt for the hardcore gamer, more for the family and also anyone who wants the best in technology.  Great party games, easier then the wii cause no controllers and also voice activated my friends get a kick out of when we watch a movie I tell my Xbox to play movie and it starts.  Being relatively new there is not a huge game selection but most are 50 dollars or less which is a nice break from the $60+ games.  My 7 year old loves it!  The 33 year old kid loves it too(me).  Do not buy if you dont want all your neighbors kids coming over to have a dance off or see who is the best at track and field. All in all I would recomend to anyone looking for something fun for the family and also for anyone like me who has a wife that hates video games and now she is dancing to lady gaga on dance central, so much for her poker face.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2011"}

This is one of my very favorite games of the past console generation, and my favorite franchise, as well. And on that subject, I would say that \"A Crack in Time\" is the best Ratchet and Clank adventure to date, though I'm sure Insomniac is cooking up something extra special for the forthcoming \"Into the Nexus\", as well as whatever Lombax madness might be arriving on the highly vaunted PS4.If you are a Ratchet fan, you need this game in your collection. If you're a fan of platformers, you absolutely NEED to give this game a try. I've never played a better platformer in my life, though Rayman Origins comes darned close (although the two are so different, it's hard to make an adequate comparison - let's just agree that they're both awesome). What's particularly noteworthy about \"A Crack in Time\" is just how much there is to do in this crazy universe. The story-driven campaign is quite lengthy on its own, but I love revisiting the sectors that I've already passed through. There, I can search moons and planets for additional challenges and collectibles, including gold bolts, zoni, and schematics for the ultimate weapon, the RYNO V.Additionally, I can answer distress calls from other star travelers and assist them, upgrade my spaceship, do battle with other ships, collect weapons and gadgets, focus on leveling up Ratchet AND all his crazy weapons, visit the coliseum for arena battles, and so forth. And as if all that wasn't enough, there's STILL the challenge mode (New Game+), trophies, AND a whole bunch of skill points to acquire. This is platforming perfection, and Ratchet and Clank gold. One of my favorite games of all time, I give it my highest possible recommendation. It's impossible to play this game and not have FUN, and just as impossible to not SMILE!

{"product_name":"B003O6EATE","description":"","reviewerName":"Moonlight Graham \"Ben\"","summary":"Awesome System","reviewText":"The Vita is exactly what I had been hoping for since I started taking the train to work every day - a fantastic gaming system with great graphics and quick load times. So far, I have played Uncharted, Fifa, and Virtua Tennis, and none have disappointed. The graphics on all are amazing for a handheld. There is so much potential here, it's ridiculous. This thing is very portable and is incredibly easy to throw in your bag and take along. Compared to the DS, sure, it's big. However, for a bigger guy like myself, this is a blessing. Holding it is very comfortable, and I've played for hours on end. I haven't had a problem with battery life, either. I'm not sure how long people need to play before charging it, but I'm easily able to play on two train rides and some at home before charging it up at night.The screen is beautiful, no doubt about that. The touch screen works well in conjunction with the normal PlayStation controls, although it probably hasn't been utilized to its full potential yet. The touchpad on the back is also a nice feature, although I think it has only really served its purpose in Fifa, so far.Overall, this is a fantastic handheld that I will use often.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-29-2012"}
{"product_name":"B003O6EATE","description":"","reviewerName":"PM_SuperFreak","summary":"Amazing piece of tech!!","reviewText":"As a gadget nut and a previous owner of the original PSP, I was watching the PSV from the start. It was appealing and showed promise, but I didn't really \"jump on the bandwagon\" right away. I was confident that Sony would deliver a high-quality product but was unsure about types of games that would be made available. Then I saw some videos of Hot Shots Golf and I knew I had to have this system. I went for it, and do not regret my decision one bit. The 5-inch screen really pushed the boundaries of what is considered a \"portable\" system, but it's as good as it gets. The resolution and clarity is incredible, and the performance is very smooth.Here is a run-down of my thoughts. I have the DS and DSi XL but I won't bother comparing PSV to these systems because it's like comparing apples to oranges. Instead, I will make a few references to the PSP since I feel that is the predecessor.Pros- Overall feel of the system is very solid. It's not as heavy as my original PSP Phat yet it does not feel flimsy like the newer editions of the PSP. The construction is mostly metal with some plastic components. The concave design on the back is a good choice as it allows you to hold the system more securely (as compared to the PSP).- Very nice screen. Bright and crisp.- Great controls. D-pad has been improved significantly. Control sticks are small nubs which feel smaller than they look, but they are still far superior to the tab on the PSP.- The back touch pad is has a nice feel to it. From the pictures, it seems to be very sippery but when I felt it for the first time, the feel surprised me as it has a slightly tacky feel which is not completely smooth. This actually works really well since it improves the grip on the device. I don't know how many games will utilize this unique control mechanic but Hot Shots Golf uses it well by allowing you to determine the distance to the pin by touching a point on the course.- Sony included a USB cable/AC adapter which is great. It enhances the versatility if you want to transfer files from/to a PC or PS3.Cons / Minor Gripes- Integrated battery may become an issue; as the years go by we can't replace the battery ourselves if it fails to charge. This seems to be the trend these days as seen in tablet PCs. It's a minor concern rather than an issue I think.Miscellaneous Observations- The system boots up fairly quickly. It seems to be slightly quicker than PSP.- When you insert a game cartridge, the system will go through a quick install and put some files on your memory card. This process is also quick; probably around 30 seconds or so.- The 'Start' and 'Select' buttons seem to be too depressed which makes it difficult to press. I can see that this is by design so that you don't accidentally push them.- Many people are not happy about the memory cards being so over-priced. I tend to agree that Sony found a way to gouge loyal consumers again, but this is what Sony has done for years with their proprietary formats. If you look at the positive side, you get to decide how much storage you need/want. If the unit came with a standard internal storage then we would not have that choice and could have been stuck paying an even higher price.Closing CommentsThe PSV is a great piece of technology that has great potential. I have only used mine for a few days but I am thoroughly impressed by the quality of the product so far. The longevity of this product will depend on Sony's ability to release top-notch, high-value games either via full releases or PSN. With so many different control schemes, I anticipate developers will come out with many more titles in the coming months/years. If you consider yourself a gamer at all, and crave for more serious, deeper games instead of what you get on your cell phone or tablet, you should seriously consider the PSV!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2012"}

It took me a little over 20 hours to complete, and it wasn't too difficult. I actually wish it was another 20 hours longer because it's a fun game to play, and it's easy to lose track of time. You can save at anytime - which I like a lot. The times that I died, I didn't have to back track much, so that's pretty cool too. My chaos wound up being high, but I didn't care what it was. I tried to avoid confrontation and killing as much as I could, but when push came to shove, it was either them or me, so some people died. :-)I thought the controls worked great and were easy to get used to. The story was interesting and kept me wanting to find out more. I enjoyed the mix of powers and weapons, even though I rarely used my weapons. I would call this an &#34;open area&#34; game and not &#34;open world&#34; or &#34;sandbox&#34;. You play in certain areas during your missions and you are free to move anywhere in that area, just like BioShock. And if you enjoyed BioShock, then I would certainly recommend this game.I'm not really the type to play games through again after I beat them, but I'm going to keep this one and give it another go down the road. I gave this 4.5 stars and rank it right up there with BioShock, Far Cry 3, Skyrim, Mass Effect 2 & 3, Red Dead Redemption, and UnCharted 2.

I just could not put this game down.  It had a fairly cinematic opening with Terra, Wedge, and Vicks (an error in translation, he was supposed to be Biggs) traveling to Narshe to capture an Esper.  This is still my favorite of all the Final Fantasies, and is one of my favorite games of all time, in any genre.For the first time since the first game, there is no singular main character.  The cast of characters changes throughout the game and even at the end when you can use any character, there is still no main character (most other Final Fantasies had followed one character, Cecil, Cloud, Squall, Tidus, etc).  The leads are usually considered to be Terra and Locke, but several other characters can step up to that position: Edgar, Celes, Cyan.This game has an incredible depth to the story.  Like most games, it starts simply and escalates from there.  The beginning is Locke, haunted by his past, rescuing Terra from the soldiers of the Empire.  Locke is a member of the resistance, The Returners.  As the game progresses, it gets bigger, as different cities and characters get involved.  The main villain, Kefka starts out only trying to capture Espers and Magicite for the Empire as well as reclaiming Terra.  We get to a point and the game branches in three.  Three characters get their own segments to return to Narshe and this introduces us to more characters and more of the world and it opens up the story even more.  Kefka, Emperor Gestahl and the Empire affects more lives than at first glance.The story for this game broadens significantly, and as a whole this is the best Final Fantasy game of the series.  I know that many people who first started with FFVII think that game is the best, and I do love that game as well, but this is where my heart lies.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2003"}

Instead, they chose 'Spore' as the title.  Frankly, I don't see why it's named Spore as you don't use or have anything related to Spores in the game, but I digress.Ignoring all of the reviews that harp on the DRM aspects of this game and almost completely ignore the gameplay, this review will focus on the gameplay.The game is short.  This is the main issue.  Don't go into this game expecting a marathon experience.  It isn't here.  Instead, this is like most of Will Wright's previous Sim named games.  You know the ones.. Sim Earth, Sim Ant, Sim Farm, etc.  In fact, this game is basically Sim Earth rehashed and expanded.  Flashback... Sim Earth basically started your world at primordial ooze,  You progress your world and cities up through space travel.  Instead of focusing on the cities themselves, you focused on the world as a whole and only got 'notices' of your city's progressions (with no direct hands on to the cities).Fast forward... Spore is released.  With Spore, you basically do the same thing as Sim Earth with the exception that the game is now broken into 5 phases and you have direct 3D hands-on to your creations.  Each phase now resembles various other games that have already been done (not necessarily by Maxis) while still basically being a clone of Sim Earth.Cell Phase:  You're not really a cell.  You're a very small organism that must eat its way to becoming big enough to transform into a land based creature.  The point to this level is just eat and eat without being eaten yourself.  The 'Small fish in a Big Pond' kind of thing.  You can collect badges and then romance other members of your species (to enter the creature creator) and modify your organism to be more protected.

You can again romance your fellow species to enter the creature creator and modify your species. However, the point to this level is to charm or eat the other species around you and get big enough to progress to the....Tribal Phase: Your species is now sentient.

But, unlike Civilization IV, it's no where near as complete or complex.  If you want to play Civilization, go buy that game.  Don't waste your money on Spore expecting this level of play.  Once you've conquered the cities militarily, religiously or economically, you move to the ...Space Level:  In this level, you have a Starship.  You hop from solar system to solar system to find or do things and then return to your home world with goods.What's wrong with Spore?  First, it's unoriginal. The bottom line is, each one of the phases are the beginnings of full fledged game ideas.  But. instead of trying to flesh each of these game ideas out fully, they are condensed into small wannabe games.  Effectively, each of the phases is no better than a game you might find on Yahoo Games.  Worse, the phases are unoriginal redone ideas from past games.  So, you're not playing something new.The Creature Editor is included in the game, but there is really no point to using it.  Your vehicles and creatures end up progressively smaller and smaller with each phase that there is no point spending 30 minutes to design something?  The stats don't change substantially enough by adding any particular weapon or feature that it makes your creature or vehicle better than your enemy's vehicles.  And, as I said, the size of the creations end up so small on-screen that you can't even see your hard work.Overall, this game had a lot of potential.  But, it has no real multiplayer gaming aspects.  The only on-line portion is the creation sharing, and that is basically pointless.  This game needed a lot more development time to give it the complexities of today's games.  However, Will Wright's simplistic approach to this game harkens back to the days of Sim Earth, Sim Farm, Sim Ant and all of those much older sims.  If this game had been released then, it would have been a hit.  Today, we expect much more complex simulations.  So, when a simplistic game like Spore is released in among games like WoW or Civilization IV, it really is a let down.If you are a fan of complex sims, then unless Maxis can do some massive retooling of Spore with expansion packs or patches to make Spore much more complex, you should probably skip Spore.  If you like smaller, simplistic, less time-consuming games, then maybe Spore is for you.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2008"}

In another nod to the nonsensical, Rygar is supposedly the greatest swordsman in the land, but instead of a sword he employs a weapon called a Diskarmor, which is essentially a bladed shield lashed to the end of a whipping chain (and resembles a deadly yo-yo). The plotline is very convoluted in an entertaining anime style, and essentially boils down to \"good guy slaying bad guy to rescue kidnapped princess,\" with some twists along the way.The gameplay is so bloody fun, though, that any gaping holes in the narrative are easy to overlook. Rygar, as the playable character, is a strange amalgam of Indiana Jones and the guy from \"Onimusha.\" In fact, Rygar plays very much like \"Onimusha,\" and even the interface is similar. Those familiar with that game will be right at home here - but they should be pleased to discover that Rygar offers a beautiful 3D engine, a more intuitive combat system, and considerably less frustrating camera angles. Add top-of-the-line production values to the mix, and you've got yourself a standout game for the PS2.Speaking of those production values, the music is nearly as good (and sometimes better) than what you might hear accompanying a big budget Hollywood feature. The sound effects are noteworthy as well, and provide the appropriate ambience. Best of all, though, are the graphics, which are easily some of the finest yet employed in a Playstation 2 title. The rendered cutscenes adhere to this same pervading quality, creating a gaming environment that is truly cinematic.It's not perfect, though. \"Rygar: The Legendary Adventure\" is over too quickly, and doesn't provide much of a challenge until you come face-to-face with some of the final bosses. Experienced players will probably breeze through this one in less than a week, and never even break a sweat on the normal difficulty setting. On top of that, Rygar's short list of enemies is uninspiring (not counting the memorable boss battles), and poses little threat to the Diskarmor-wielding hero. Aside from these niggles, though, \"Rygar: The Legendary Adventure\" is a satisfying experience, and is even worth several play-throughs. It is one of the best action-adventure games for the PS2 console, and shouldn't be missed.Final Grade: B (or 4 stars)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2003"}

It sounds like he's on the Obsidian or Lucas Arts payroll.  Actually, I agree with much of what he said.  The KOTOR II gameplay is better, and you are given many more ways (compared to KOTOR I) to build a great Jedi character (Light or Dark).  But the story falls down:  It's confusing/puzzling (read boring) in places, it just doesn't make sense in other places, quests suddenly end for no apparent reason without explanation, the characters are uninteresting and, above all, the ending is totally unsatisfying.  So KOTOR II is half a very good game (gameplay) and half a not-so-great game (plot/story).  I truly feel that KOTOR I is a better, more involving, game experience.  And there is no way this game deserves a 5 Star rating (except to hardcore Star Wars fans) when compared to other titles available.  I'd give KOTOR II a 3-1/2 Star rating if I could. It's definitely not a \"great\" game -- just pretty good.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2005"}

I wish he would remain dazed for a second or two until he actually saw me. The only other reason to knock a star off is the lack of explanation within the game.  There are hundreds if not thousands of items to pick up and use.  The trouble is, you have no idea what many of them will do.  There are rather vague descriptions, i.e. a bottle of wine will cause you more fatigue and detract from your dexterity.

{"product_name":"B00002STFD","reviewerName":"Classic GameFan1991","summary":"Not Bad for an N64 Launch Title, but Does Contain Some Flaws that Detract from the Overall Experience","reviewText":"This game was alright, but to get down to the main point, the thing that has disappointed me the most are the frustrating, choppy controls, but I can forgive that since this was one of the launch titles that came out near the end of 1996. With that said, it is your typical 3D platformer with a Star Wars signature to it. However, if you are not a competitive gamer, expect to have an outstanding amount of trouble with many parts of this game, including a boss that I could not beat that comes right after the stage where you dodge obstacles while riding on various trains. As if the stage wasn't long and punishing enough, they had to throw a boss that involved hiding from hisblasts, which was very difficult, and jumping up through platforms that are extremely difficult to jump on tomaybe have a better aim at the boss. I have given up after losing several sets of lives. I grew up with the N64, andI have never came across a game that was this outstanding difficult in the 13 years I played various N64 games.The story on the other hand wasn't too bad. It filled some plot holes between V and VI just fine, and the overall sound quality was not bad for N64, considering that the sound had to be compressed before it could be released, because of the format limitations of cartridges at the time. Overall, this game is passable, but if you areexpecting a game that has a fair difficulty, and easy to control, I would suggest playing something else instead.UPDATE: Apparently I was quite harsh on the game, considering that the controls are actually not as bad as I made them out to be. I managed to defeatthe second boss with some hassle, but I was too close to the boss itself. The controls do take some time to get used to, but they are not actuallyhorrible, as I have seen much worse, and rather unforgiving controls than this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0002CHJ3M","reviewerName":"Lestor neeker Wong","summary":"A great game on its own, but fell short as a PoP franchise.","reviewText":"There are a lot of mixed reactions about Prince of Persia: Warrior Within. Some people say the game is great. Others say it isn't as good as its previous instalment, The Sands of Time. Without sounding like a moaning pansy, I must say that I'm more prone towards the latter. Warrior Within is a great game on its own, but for a Prince of Persia franchise, it fell short because of its eagerness to please a wider audience.By now, you should have already read countless reviews about the game, so I'm just going to keep this short. The game continues two years after the story in The Sands of Time. Having messed up the timeline, the Prince has been chased relentlessly by a beast named Dahaka, who is some sort of a guardian of the timeline. While on the run, the Prince was led to believe if there was no sands in the first place, he could change his fate. There began his journey to the Isle of Time, to-and-fro time, to stop the Empress of Time from creating the sands.The story looks promising, but the gameplay left a lot to be desired. Responding to feedback about an over-simplified combat system in The Sands of Time, Ubisoft have provided an improvement to how the Prince fights his enemies. Now, the Prince has the ability to throw enemies, wield two weapons, and execute tons of cool combos with different weapons in hand. However, despite the possibilities, you'll find that the test-and-trusted vaulting and wall-rebound are all you need beat most enemies.To be honest, the fighting is not as repetitive as the game's previous instalment, thanks to a larger variety of enemies. Now, instead of figthing the same sand creatures over and over again, you get acrobatic ninjas, birds that come together to form a gestalt, gorilla-like monsters and the likes. It certainly added to the challenge, and should please fans who like a little more fighting in the game. Still, the Prince of Persia franchise is not just about fighting, and with Warrior Within littered with fights so frequently, it took the fun of navigating around the areas away.The game is also considerably darker. Understandably, the Prince has matured into a more ruthless character - if a monster has been chasing you for years, you'd feel a little pissed off too. Yet, somehow, it still doesn't sound right when he utters some of his arrogant one-liners during fights. \"I'm the Prince of Persia, and the King of Blades!\", for example, simply borders on corniness. While I'm all for a darker game, my general feeling that Warrior Within has simply overdone it.Which brings me to two issues of major concern for me. Firstly, the scantily clad women. While it's fun to take on two very powerful female characters, having them with nothing more than pieces of strings and scarves isn't what I was expecting. In fact, barely a few minutes into the game, a good few seconds were devoted to a close-up of one of the female character's backside. I hate to use this word, but it's truly redundant.Secondly, the soundtrack. I love rock music, but the Prince of Persia is not a heavy metal concert. The rather noisy background music interferes with play at times, and it makes you wonder what exactly does it achieve apart from sounding cool to some quarters of the so-called target market. Somehow, it just doesn't seem to fit into the game at all, and true enough, it doesn't.To its credit, Warrior Within has several new concepts that make it quite a journey. One of my favorites is the need to go back in time to complete certain missions, before travelling back to the present to reap the rewards. This highlights Ubisoft's strenghts in creating breath-taking graphical infrastructures. It's also interesting to see how the same area could be so grand in the past, but also so reduced in the present. However, as the areas still spot similar ledges and paths, navigating through the areas soon became rather repetitive.I've also read on many forums about the glitches that are present in this game. I haven't encounter one (and hopefully never will), but I can understand how frustrated it is when you simply can't proceed to fight the final boss because of a bug. This would greatly reduce the enjoyment value.Of course, as I mentioned earlier, Warrior Within is still a great game on its own. Just don't expect the feel-good nature from The Sands of Time in this game though. It just isn't there.And I kind of miss it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2005"}

The tale is brought to life by an all-star voice cast. Fans will revisit this beloved story and come to care for a new troupe of characters in KINGDOM HEARTS II.","reviewerName":"ps2 gamer \"star wars\"","summary":"All hail Disney and SquareEnix!","reviewText":"This game was amazing. I've played the first game, and this game has many improvements. It has new worlds, new characters, better gameplay, better graphics, length, and one of the best storylines ever to be seen in a videogame.First of all, I suggest you play Kingdom Hearts 1 before you play this game, because you might not understand everything's that's going on. However, you don't have to play Chain of Memories to understand it. Take it from me, I've only played the first game, not Chain of Memories.Anyway, the game starts out with you playing as a young boy named Roxas(don't worry, you play as Sora later). He has been having weird dreams and flashbacks that don't appear to be his own. He goes on a quest to find out about the weird stuff that's happening to him, and in the end he finds Sora, Donald and Goofy. Their memories are still returning to them (from the end of Chain of Memories, when they were in those flower pods), and then they wake up, and go on another auest to defeat darkness. Of course, the storyline gets much more complicated and interesting later in the game.The game does have a few drawbacks, though. First of all, there isn't any platforming in this game. There are still a lot of action, adventure, and RPG elements in the game, but there isn't much platforming. Sure, you do get to jump on a few ledges and stuff like that, but there aren't any long plaforming sequences like in the first game. This didn't really other me, but harcore platforming fans might be disappointed. Also, the difficulty modes are pretty easy, so unless you want to pick the hardest difficulty mode which makes the game very tough in a lot of spots, you might find it as a problem. People have also been complaining that the game is too button-mashy, and that you can get through all the buttons by simply hitting the normal attack button. However, this is not a problem, because all of the magic, reaction commands, drives, special attacks, and other things you get in the game help to distract you from simply hitting the attack button over and over again, so I don't understand why people are complaining about this.Now, on to the good things in the game. First of all, the graphics are splendid. They have improved over the first game, and they look really great. All of the environments are very detailed, and they look awesome. Every environment has its own special theme. For example, the Tron world is one big computerized world, the steamboat willy world is black-and-white, The atlantic world is one big sea level, etc. Also, the character designs of your party members change according to the world you're in. For example, in the Tron world, everyone will look like robots, in the steamboat willy world, everyone will be black and white and cartoony, etc. Overall, everything looks really great.The gameplay also improved over the last game. The combat is much better, and you get a lot of new combat abilities. Also, a big difference from the previous game are the reaction commands. At many specific parts in the game, a display of the triangle button on your controller will appear on the screen. If you hit the triangle button at that time, Sora will execute some really cool moves. Some can be simple moves, like spinning around and appearing behind the enemy so you can attack him, but a lot of times you will have to hit the triangle button in a certain sequence to do a very powerful and important action(mostly in boss fights). For example, in one battle, an giant enemy will try to hit you. You then press the triangle button to dodge his attack. Then he grabs you and throws you in the air. You press the button again to dodge his attack and hit him. He then tries to drop you off a ledge, so you hit the button again to save yourself. These sort of things are simple, yet very fun.Other than the physical combat, you also get magic. Some of the spells you get are Blizzard, which shoots a bolt of ice, Thunder, ehich shoots down a bolt of thunder on your enemies, fire, which spins flames around you in a circle, and more. They're all fun to use, and they can be easily accessed through a shortcut menu in which you map your spells to buttons on your controller. There are also limit attacks in this game. These attacks consume all of your Magic Points(which, by the way, start replenishing by themselves when all of your magic drains), and in these attacks, you and another member of your party execute a very powerful attack which is very useful. You have to use the reaction commands(triangle presses)to execute these attacks, and they're very useful and fun. You also get summoning spells like in the last game, and you can summon one out of four different characters. I'll only tell you about one of them, because I don't want to spoil the rest. Anyway, this summon is Chicken Little. He can stun the enemies by using firecrackers, or go into an FPS mode in which you and him can throw baseballs at the enemies while looking through Chicken Little's eyes. All of these summons are fun, but they're pretty much useless. Another more important and fun feature are the drives. In this mode, Sora combines with one of the other members in your group, and he gets special powers temporarily. You have to keep fighting or collect special orbs in order to replenish your drive meter. There are five drive forms overall. One form is the Valor form, which lets sora wield two Keyblades(weapons) at once, makes him much stronger, lets him run faster, lets him jump higher, and gives him new abilities. There's also another form, wisdom form, which lets you shoot magic bolts out of your keyblade, improves your magic, and lets you hover around instead of walking. Another from is the Anti-From. Sora basically turns into a Heartless. His attacks are weaker but MUCH faster, and he is able to jump higher and walk faster. No one is actually sure how you get it, but there are two theories:1.You get it from driving too much while in battle2.You get it from being hit by heartless while in a drive, then driving again when you get the chance.I personally go with the first theory, but that's just me.The AI of your partners is also very good. They will heal you when you get hurt, help you defeat enemies, etc. and they feel like a big help, instead of just a distraction for the enemies to not hit you. You also get to switch Donal or Goofy with a character specific to the world you're in (for example: Mulan in her world, Tron in his world, etc.) You can also customize the way they fight, and when to use their special abilities.By the way, if you haven't already known, the worlds in this game are worlds based on Disney movies. They're very well done, and you see characters from the movies in the game. Some of the worlds are:Pirates of the CaribbeanMulanLion King worldTron worldSteamboat willyand many more.If you like Disney movies, you'll really love these worlds, and even if you don't like Disney, you'll still enjoy these worlds.There are also many characters from Final Fantasy games like Seifer, Sephiroth, Leon, Cloud, Yuna, Rikku, Paine, Auron, and many more. They're also very cool, and the voice acting is wonderful for everyone. There are some people who didn't voice the original characters, but they imitate them extremley good. I swear, you won't know that Will Turner and Jack Sparrow aren't actually voiced by Orlando Bloom and Jhony Depp. You won't be able to tell the difference!All of these things make the game wonderful, but the two best things in the game are its length and storyline. This game is very long, and it will probably take you about 40-50 hours to finish it. There are also a lot of distactions from the main gameplay, like the Gaummi ships, which are much better than in the first game, and the olympus coliseum, which lets you fight in many tournaments for prizes. You can also go back to worlds you already visited in order to level up. Now, the storyline is absolutely great! It's very complicated, and there are tons of twists and things that will surprise you(something very interesting about Ansem too...).Overall, this is a great game for anyone who liked the first Kingdom Hearts, Disney, Final Fantasy, or anyone who has never played any of those. Yous should definitely buy this game if you own a PS2, and you shouldn't be discouraged by the Disney theme to the game. A lot of people complain that this is a \"kiddie game\", and that's just not true, so don't listen to these complaints.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2006"}

The plot of this game has the theme of \"exploring history in search of truth,\" and demonstrates, through allegory, the biases of the societal forces which allow for the recording of history, and the tendency of historians to attribute heroic characteristics to the victors of any scenario, regardless of their true alignment, or intentions. At many points in the plot, unexpected events occur, with the attentive player having received just enough information to speculate on the motivations of the characters involved, and playing through the game, there were many such moments at which I speculated improbably twisted scenarios, only to be shocked when future events actually confirmed my dark suspicions, or clarified the scenario to be even more depraved than I had imagined. This is not an incredibly violent game, nor is it atmospherically dark, in the film noir sense. But it is a deeply philisophical game, which doesn't under-represent the magnitude of human suffering, the tendency of humans to abuse power, or the unreliability one's personal allies in societies conducive to individual scheming. The character of Delita, who comes across as contradictorily skeptical and idealistic, is too much of a master-moralist, in the Nietzschean sense, to qualify as a hero, but is too difficult for a player, sensitive towards his motivations, to villainize. Even the abberant supernatural elements of this mostly human and political story work well from a literary standpoint, as the relationship between Ajora, the Lucavi, and those who seek the Zodiac stones is represented with style and subtlety, adding Faustian intrigue to the plot.The gameplay of Tactics is reasonably balanced, in the sense that there are not many situations in which one overly powerful and convenient approach to winning battles makes every other possible strategy obsolete. Like other job-system games, the player can create these situations himself, by overcommitting to the equipment and abilities for a particular job for certain characters, thereby forcing himself to use the same strategy for every battle, or sacrifice the majority of his characters' power, but the game itself offers many different feasable play possibilities. Different sections of the game will present different challenges depending on how the player's party is configured, such as Ramza's one-on-one battle with Gafgarion, the \"outnumbered\" battle at Golgorand execution site, or the rooftop \"save Rafa\" battle, and unless the player's party is so ridiculously overpowered as to allow for massively inefficient gameplay, the tactical perameters of each battle require a rethinking of the player's strategy, as elements such as attack strength, attack range, and character mobility must be alternately prioritized.The ability to review story scenes and look up public information about the characters adds to the immersive element of the game, and the player's ability to appreciate the plot. This game is superb because its many innovations are effectively implemented, its visual design effectively portrays compelling, medieval-style fantasy, some characters are incredibly well-developed, and even the lesser characters are given enough development to fully serve their role within the incredibly literary plot.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2007"}

It's Skyrim!  Probably one of the greatest games of its type I've ever played.  I've been on this for over 100 hours, maybe 150 and I haven't even scratched the surface.  I've been wandering around exploring the HUGE map that is filled with all kinds of terrains, running into bad guys, clearing out caves and taking on little quests here and there.  The main mission has for the moment been neglected but only because I'm having so much fun doing all the other things.The quests are for the most part unique and fun.  Not like some games in which it's bring me 10 orc heads and 27 bull testicles, etc.  They're real quests in which doing the first part uncovers what needs to be done next.  You investigate someone's house and discover something, then you have to sneak somewhere else to get other info, then make a choice do you confront the person or take another approach.  Lots of options!There's also a lot of great surprising things going on.  Just because a patrol is going by you now doesn't mean they always do that at that point.  You could be walking along and a dragon could swoop down and grab the bear that was about to kill you.  Wild stuff happens here and it really takes you by surprise.I was always a big fan of Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas, so Skyrim has a similar (but way more advanced) gameplay style and feel.  I love the open world in which you just do what you want to do. The options are huge and with all the thousands of mods out there, they're endless!  You can get married, build a house and send your husband or wife off to work while you adventure or maybe you want to engage in some more adult style activities.  It's all there for you!Needless to say, the value for the money is immense!  With hundreds of hours of top quality gameplay that is always super enjoyable.  The story is compelling and interesting, theres a huge amount of in game information for those who want more role play and immersion, or you can skip over all that reading if you choose not to.  Also thanks to mods, a lot of the stuff the developer gets wrong or could have done better is done better.  You get more realistic faces, hair, grass, textures, etc so you get a really realistic and immersive experience.  I kind of wish all games allowed its players to create mods because it means you can customize the experience to what you want and make the game much better in terms of playability and realism.I highly highly recommend this game for anyone who likes RPG games or 3rd person games.  This is by far one of the best of it's kind ever.  And I've played a lot of games like this and that's saying a lot.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2014"}

I actually forgot this game even existed for a long time but found it in a bargain bin and figured what the heck.  I'm not disappointed with it considering I paid under $10.  The turn based combat is quicker then any other FF game I've played.  And it never gets too too tough as long as you're using the right strategy and have spent the time to level up.  Graphics are also impressive...looking just as good if not a little better then FFX did.  The biggest turn off is the light hearted story.  FFX started out with a city being blow up. FFX-2 starts out with a pop concert. :/  I'm willing to put up with this because the game play is solid enough to make up for it.Final Verdict:  If you've never played Final Fantasy X before don't jump into this one first.  Get both used and play them in order.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2009"}

I take my real car for winter driving practice in icy parking lots, and have tried some of these things :)The kudos system helps make the game even more interesting. Instead of just racing to the end of a course, you have to do so with style. Ride on two wheels, do spins, and avoid hitting other cars and objects for more points. The more points you get, the more special features and courses you unlock.The courses and towns are done extremely well.

Dante has returned and , although I didn't think it was possible, he's even more bad... than ever! Plus, there's a new character joining Dante in this new adventure; her name is Lucia (and ooohhhh baby she's caliente!) The only downside though is that Dantes' old sidekick demons, Alastor and Ifrit, are not around this time, but Dante does have a new devil form of his own and so does Lucia. The game also has an enhanced Devil Trigger (I'll let you find out about it yourself when you play the game). Oh yeah, there's one other thing: Trish from the previous game is not around either, and neither is Dante's old sword Force Edge.But, at least Dante does have a new sword called Rebellion (and later in the game you get two more swords that serve special purposes). However, Dante does have his two twin pistols Ebony and Ivory, and later he acquires a new shotgun, missile launcher, and two sub-machine guns. Lucia also gets her own new weapons, but I won't spoil it for you. The story is better this time around, with more frequent cut-scenes with amazing graphics (don't worry though, they're not really long like in the Metal Gear Solid games). There are new demons to face off against- some of the enemies though aren't demons at all; even some of the old demons from the previous game appear to challenge our two heroes: Sargassos, Blades, and the Phantom.

{"product_name":"B00009WAUD","reviewerName":"bixodoido","summary":"A great new addition to this excellent series","reviewText":"The people at Nintendo have really outdone themselves this time.  I have always been a big fan of the Mario Kart series, and each release has been better than the last.  This is no exception.  Mario Kart Double Dash includes all of the classic elements that made the Super NES and N64 versions so much fun--wacky cast of characters, cool weapons, intense battle mode, very enjoyable Grand Prix mode--and yet manages to improve in almost every aspect of the game.The new Karts, which hold two people, are a great new feature.  Not only does this allow two players to team up together, it also allows four people to play in Grand Prix mode, something that was not available on the N64.  In addition, each character has a unique weapon, which adds variety to the game.  With many characters to choose from, and a large assortment of unlockable karts, levels, and characters, Mario Kart Double Dash also has a greater potential for extended game play than any of its predecessors.The graphics are stunning, and the commentary by the characters enjoyable.  It is entertaining to work on various combinations of characters, and try to pick out a kart suited for them.  The game is difficult, but not so difficult that you have to dedicate your life to playing it.  As always, the battle mode contains unlimited possibilities in the way of kart mayhem. In short, this is an excellent game, worthwhile in every way. With this game, Nintendo continues its tradition of excellent, unique games, and provides yet one more reason why the GameCube is a great choice for a system.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00009WAUD","reviewerName":"Moviebuffer101","summary":"WARNING: Addiction is bad!","reviewText":"I agree with the kid that said this was \"Hands down the best racing game ever!\". It's more than a racing game, it's an all out road war. If the other racers don't get you the obstacles on each track will. Mushroom Kingdoms favorite foes like Goomba's, Piranha Plant's, Pokey's and many more are waiting around every turn. There are a number of weapons that you can put to use againist your opponents.. like turtle shells, bombs, banana peels, large spiked King Koopa shells, fire, explosive boxes and more. There are also mushrooms that give you that extra boost of speed that can sometimes help you win the race at the last minute. Not to mention the famous speed boosters that are on each track. The tracks are great, they're  \"Super Mario Sunshine\" themed. I recommend that game highly as well. There are some tracks that are not \"Sunshine\" themed however. I recall one track that traffics regular and not-so regular vehicles, these cars and trucks will slow you down if you don't stay clear of them. I did notice some people say this game isn't much more advanced than \"Mario Kart 64\", don't believe such bologna. This game blows \"Mario Kart 64\" out of the water. Just in case you haven't played this yet, you may wanna know where the subtitle \"Double Dash\" comes from. That's simple you are able to choose two characters that race together. The combination is up to you. For instance you can team Mario with Bowser if you like, or you can be traditional and put the Mario Bros. together. My choice last time I played was Koopa and Wario. An odd team but that gives you an idea of your options. One character drives while the other is equip with an array of weapons (mentioned above), with the press of a button they are able to switch jobs. There are unlockable characters and tracks, but you do start off with a wide variety. Bottomline is, I really believe you won't find a better racing game. It's not Nascar and there's not a woman in a bikini that waves a checked flag, but I recommend it fully based on hundreds of hours in replay value, beautiful graphics, user friendly controls, and Nintendo's timeless characters that I always seem to fiend for more of. \"MARIO KART DOUBLE DASH\" IS A GREAT GAME TO ADD TO YOUR GAMECUBE INVENTORY. 100%","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2004"}

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

I love the fact that the mission design is segmented giving the player a break when they screw up. Saint's Row did the same thing. I wish Rockstar would have done the same with GTA (without the penalty, that is). There is a missing bit of total fun that the Sly Cooper series was \"famous\" for that Sucker Punch didn't incorporate in this more serious title. If you played the Sly Cooper series before you will notice a lot of obvious similarities. On another sour note, there a lot of repetitive main and side missions.Graphics - A mixed bag. Sometimes they are stellar (especially environments), other times they are downright ugly (all the character models with the exception of Cole). Use of graphic novel style cut scenes is overrated.Sound - Voice acting is ok, most environmental sounds are good, while others are cheesy.Story - Ok, not terrible, not great.Technical - The only non-XBOX 360 game I have that actually crashes my console on a regular basis.Despite all the faults of the game (It is not the AAA experience I come to expect from Sucker Punch) I still do recommend playing this game.

{"product_name":"B00GANWVJE","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"This new Legend of Zelda does its lineage proud","reviewText":"No matter what angle you look at it from, this is a special game. What started out as a 3DS remake ofone of the greatest video games ever made, has quickly taken on a life of its own. Now, it's a spiritual successor/sequel to one of the greatest games of all time, something that fans have waited over 20 years for. If I'm not mistaken, it's also the first *traditionally-controlled*, top-down, 2-D Zelda game made exclusively by Nintendo sinceLink's Awakening(my 2nd favorite Zelda game). The big question, then, is can The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds stand up to the hyperbolic hype and expectations that it released to? To put it simply, yes, it absolutely can. I have a strong feeling this one will be up there in the consciousness of most gamers in the long term. Not only is ALBW a nostalgic throwback for fans of classic Zelda games, it is a huge step forward for the series and full of brand new, pretty groundbreaking changes to the traditional Zelda formula. I will try to be concise and avoid overlong exposition, but this will be a long, detailed review, as I want to be as informative and helpful as possible; you've been warned. As of 11/24, I've beaten the game, having been playing this ever since picking it up at a midnight release party, unable to put it down unless I had to because of adult responsibilities and blah blah blah. I can confidently say that this game gives Zelda fans a cause for rejoicing. This is a true masterpiece!The story in ALBW may seem at first to be a retread of A Link to the Past. It takes place in Hyrule several generations after the events of ALttP. A new villain, named Yuga, has arrived on the scene. He plays a similar role to Agahnim from ALttP, turning the descendants of the seven sages into still paintings with his magic paintbrush staff, presumably with some nefarious purpose relating to Ganon. He himself can turn into a living painting as well. Very quickly, however, the story turns into something much bigger than you may expect. The Dark World concept returns in ALBW, but has been expanded to new depths. In fact, this game's Dark World feels much closer to the Twilight Realm fromTwilight Princess, and especially Termina fromMajora's Mask. This game's dark world is actually an alternate version of Link's world, with its own inverted Tri-force, a once brilliant but now forsaken kingdom named Lorule, and its own wise princess named Hilda. Of course, Link will set out to save both Hyrule and Lorule, and by the game's end, he will have met with many twists and turns, as well as encountered many interesting and likable characters. I absolutely love stories that incorporate alternate dimensions/worlds that have their own different version of the same characters, and ALBW uses that plot device to great effect, in my opinion.The storytelling is exceptionally well done in this game, with cutscenes showcasing great writing and localization. New characters are really enjoyable, and the returning characters that are a staple of the series (Zelda, Impa, etc) all have interesting traits that make this game's version of them unique. Hilda is mysterious and has a cunning wisdom, which is a nice contrast to Zelda's warmth and sagely wisdom. As a villain, Yuga is a great balance between psychotic/creepy and silly. He is what you'd get if you put Lord Ghirahim, Agahnim, andKefkainto a pot and then threw in a dash of Ganondorf. Believe it or not, in terms of plot and the way the story unfolds, this felt more along the lines of the darker, moodier Twilight Princess and Majora's Mask, and I love it. The ending is incredible. If you're expecting \"just another Zelda story,\" you'll be pleasantly surprised by how deep and interesting this one is.The visuals are something that may polarize some folks. The gorgeous concept art looks likeSkyward Sword'spainterly style meeting theOracle of Seasons/Agesdesign, but the actual in-game graphics looks more like A Link to the Past meetsThe Wind Waker. Character models have the \"Toon\" proportions of WW, whereas everything else, from scenery to character details, all has an undeniable LttP design. Personally, I think the game looks gorgeous (The Wind Waker is my personal favorite Zelda game). It's quite detailed in places and very colorful, and there's a ton of variety in the different locales. Rather than just being a recolor, Lorule actually looks quite different than Hyrule. Many landmarks are in the same place, but Lorule's version are almost always startlingly different and fresh, and I really enjoyed that. Dungeons all have unique designs as well. There's fantastic variety and attention to detail in this game visually. ALBW does an exceptional job of delivering that sense of discovery and adventure Zelda games are known for. It all runs at a smooth 60 fps too, which is great. When it comes to the 3-D visual effect, I didn't think I'd use it much with this game but I love it! As gimmicky as it may sound, the 3-D effect really makes it feel like you're getting a bird's eye view into a living, breathing world. The dungeons feature more vertical designs, full of things that utilize the 3-D in very cool ways. You'll see what I mean when you play. Overall, this is a splendidly beautiful game with many nods to Zelda's past and a meticulous attention to detail.The audio is equally wonderful. Sound effects are very nostalgic, even down to the sound scrolling text makes. The biggest stand out with the sound, however, is the soundtrack. I don't know what it is about 3DS games having exceptional soundtracks, but ALBW is no exception. Many classic tunes get a huge overhaul and sound stupendous. Rather than be the more string symphony you'd expect from a Zelda game, there's quite a few brassy big band orchestra type songs, and I love it. Overall, though, the whimsical music sounds like it was played by a roaming band of skilled Minstrels, and I mean that in the best way possible. New songs fit in with the old perfectly and are just as good in their compositions. I LOVE Hilda's theme, and it stands proud alongside other great modern Zelda character themes like \"Midna's Lament\" and \"Follow Fi.\" Overall, the soundtrack is absolutely amazing, maybe the best Zelda soundtrack in terms of pure composition bliss since Wind Waker.The gameplay in ALBW can be divided into two categories: the nostalgic, traditional Zelda aspects, and the groundbreaking, new changes to the Zelda series' formula. Let's start with the traditional aspects first: The game undeniably feels like a true-to-form classical Zelda adventure. You'll be exploring a huge, fantastical world, with memorable temples and dungeons interspersed throughout. These temples are filled with unique, engaging puzzles centered around special items, with excellent (brand new) boss fights that are thrilling and challenging. You'll be going to various towns, meeting the memorable characters living in Hyrule/Lorule, and undertaking interesting side-quests. All of these core concepts in Zelda are intact and at the top of their game in ALBW. Much of the overworld in the game is very, very similar to ALttP. The temples are in the same locations, for example, but the temple/dungeons are brand new on the inside, as are their awesome bosses. Some features of the overworld are quite different as well. Treasure chests, pieces of heart, etc. are all in new locations. So while the overworld map may make the game feel more like a remake than a sequel at first, you'll find both Hyrule and the very different Lorule to be surprisingly fresh to adventure through. Again, this game feels like a true Zelda game, and all of the core aspects I've discussed here are wonderfully executed.So what is different, you may ask? For one thing, all special items are available from the get-go via a shop run by a new character named Ravio. These items range from series' staples such as the bow and arrow, to new items never seen before but that fit the series perfectly. They're too expensive to buy early in the game, however, so you'll be forced to rent one item at a time until you acquire enough rupees to buy them outright. If you die with a rented item in your possession, it will merely reset and you'll have to go rent the item again. By the end of the game, you'll own every item. Under this system, rupees take on a much more important role. Whereas in past games, I rarely ever used my rupees for much, acruing massive amounts for Link's retirement instead, ALBW makes rupees a very valuable commodity indeed. I really like that. This new item system also means that the game is much less linear than past Zelda games. In theory, you can go to whatever temple you want in whatever order, as long as you know which item(s) will be needed for that dungeon so you can rent it. Some dungeons can't be accessed until you have multiple items, but the game features a very nice fast-travel system that alleviates any tedium and frustration from trying to enter a temple, only to find out you don't have the prerequisite gear yet. For the most part, I love this new item system. It allows for a lot of choice when playing the game, ditching the characteristic linearity past Zelda titles have had.The biggest addition to Link's repertoire is the new ability of Link to become a living painting. At any point, you can go up to a wall, press A, and Link will go into the wall, depicted in a style very reminiscent of Wind Waker's prologue. This ability is really neat by itself, but the way the developers designed puzzles around it is nothing short of brilliant. This game features some of the most clever, mind-bending level/puzzle design for a Zelda game in years. No joke. There are so many great examples of that, but I don't want to spoil it, so I'll just leave it up to you to discover the ingenious examples of this for yourself. Even bosses require you to take full advantage of this ability, and it is so amazing! This painting ability is also the only way to transport between Hyrule and Lorule, by way of thin slivers of teleporation in various walls in the overworld. Needless to say, there have been many times I've been incredibly impressed by the plethora of ways the living-painting mechanic is utilized. You truly have to think outside the box and I really love that. The painting idea is fresh, it's engaging, and it's absolutely brilliant. Bravo Nintendo!So the item-based system and the painting concept are the biggest new ideas in the game, but there are several others worth mentioning as well. All special items can be upgraded by finding and bringing the children of a massive squid-like alien (?) called Maiamai to their mama. Using this upgrade/collectible system, a bow that could shoot only one arrow can be upgraded to shoot three at once, for example. Very cool. It takes Skyward Sword's concept of upgrading gear to the next level. The streetpass feature in this game is amazing. When exchanging streetpass with someone who also has this game, their uniquely designed DARK LINK will appear in your world to fight you. Approach him and you can enter a battle with him. If you win, you'll win a certain number of rupees as a bounty. You get to design your own Dark Link for others to fight as well, determining which items he'll have when other players fight him. The better stocked a Dark Link is and the harder he is to beat, the bigger the bounty you'll win. I absolutely love this feature. It encourages people to use streetpass, and it does so in a meaningful way that doesn't feel at all like a gimmick. I love that.So are there any issues with the game? Objectively, this game is about as close to perfect as they come, but there are some nitpicky things I noticed that I'll voice for the sake of objectivity. For one thing, the game is pretty short by modern Zelda standards. If you play this through for the story alone, it'll easily take you about 15-16 hours, and if you're a completionist, 20 at most. After playing for roughly 17.5 hours, I had done and seen everything in the game, every Maiamai found, every piece of heart discovered, every special item and upgrade acquired, etc. Is that a huge problem? Not really. After all, the original ALttP has a comparable amount of content, but ALBW is so fun, this amount of time flies by. Another issue I had was with totally unbalanced difficulty. Since the new item system allows you to tackle the dungeons in virtually any order, there can be a rather uneven experience when it comes to difficulty. When I played, I went from the incredibly easy early dungeons straight into a water temple that gives OoT's Water Temple a run for its money. Then I went to the equivalent of OoT's Spirit Temple, another challenging dungeon. After that, I went to a temple that was super easy by comparison. Granted, this isn't really a huge flaw, but I imagine a lot of people's first time playing this game will be somewhat chaotic because of that, so I figured I'd give you fair warning. Finally, one more nitpicky thing: Link's voice is kind of strange at first. At times it's deeper like a young man's voice, at others he sounds like a kid, and sometimes he almost sounds like a gremlin (lol). It took me a little while to get used to it, but I eventually warmed up to it and enjoyed it. It grew on me. Really, those are the only \"complaints\" I have with the game, and none of them are bullet points you'd use to knock the game's score down, but it is good to keep these things in mind so you can know what you're getting with the game.All in all, this is a truly special Zelda game. While it is a very nostalgic experience full of nods to the legendary ALttP and several other Zelda games, I actually find the exciting new elements and design choices to be what makes ALBW such a special game. To play a Zelda game with such an overhauled item system with massively increased level of freedom and openness, the brilliantly conceived/executed painting idea, as well as a plethora of other unique elements, has been a genuine delight. I love the Legend of Zelda series, it is my favorite in all video games, but ALBW truly feels special. Its changes to the traditional Zelda formula ultimately are much better and more meaningful than the ones in Skyward Sword are, and truly makes me excited for the direction the series will go from here. So do I recommend it? Absolutely. I enjoyed the game so much that I couldn't put it down until I beat it once I started it (I did stop for food and sleep though, lol). After beating it for the first time, I wanted to jump right back in and start a new game, and that is incredibly rare for me to do. I've always been a 3-D Zelda guy (even though Link's Awakening is one of my favorite Zelda titles), but ALBW has seriously won me over and I'd place it in my top five Zelda games, easily. I'd even go so far as to say it is another flawless Zelda masterpiece that stands proud right alongside its 20-year-old legendary predecessor. So buy it, get ready for an awesome new adventure between worlds, and go save, not one, but two magical kingdoms in need of a true hero of courage!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

While the world is a lot less detailed than GTA or red dead redemption, almost everything has a purpose. Everything I do in the open world helps lead me to my next fight.

Driving around the overworld was unwieldy at first but you will get the hang of it. There is some odd stuff going on with collision while on the bike also.

The game has a large variety of puzzles that require different levels of skills - some emphasize spelling, others word recognition, and yet others focus on strict word definition.

{"product_name":"B0017HIIWW","description":"Transformed and unleashed, Sonic races to save the world...and himself. Sonic the Hedgehog is on an adventure unlike any other. Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience. Merging blistering 2D action with meticulously rendered 3D environments, players race through intriguing locations across the globe as Sonic to save a chaotic world.The other side of SonicSonic and his alter ego Werehog.View larger.Collect rings for Ring Energy.View larger.Swing into action with Werehog.View larger.A NewSonica New StoryOn a quest for world domination Sonic nemesis Dr. Eggman has managed to steal the chaos emeralds once again and this time drained them of their power. As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new modified game engine,Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.","reviewerName":"N.

However, the seemingly promising combination of genres doesn't result in a particularly fun game.In Borderlands, you play as one of four characters - the hunter, Mordecai, the siren, Lilith, the soldier, Roland, or the berserker, Brick. Each has his or her own special abilities, and basically serve as the game's classes. Mordecai can use his pet bird to attack enemies, Lilith can turn invisible and apply elemental damage to weapons, Roland can deploy a sentry turret with upgradable weapons and bonuses, and Brick relies mostly on his brute strength and power. At the beginning of the game, you pick one of these four; as the game goes on, you can level up certain abilities, which serves as the game's only real stab at customization. You can also change the colors of your character model, but the characters' costumes are so quirky and wacky that it still never really feels like \"your\" character - just like you've painted someone else's character.The game's main draw is the wide range of weapons, which includes the usual mix of pistols, rifles, SMGs, and shotguns. However, individual weapons can have different bonuses and penalties - damage, ammo capacity, scope range, bonus effects like fire or acid, and so on. This is meant to be the game's \"RPG\" element. However, rather than being an interesting way to carry out different missions, each gun basically has you do the same \"backpedal and shoot\" tactic no matter what you do. There's no variety in the weapons - just in how long it takes before something falls down while you shoot at it.The grenades are a little better, but not much. Rather than getting different actual grenades, you get equipped with an item that turns your grenades into different grenades. These include sticky grenades, bouncing grenades, and teleporting grenades. Even these, though, are just regular grenades, in FPS terms. There's nothing that actually changes the way you play the game.As far as gameplay goes, it's basically Diablo or World of Warcraft, except with guns. Shoot things, level up, shoot higher-level things, level up, shoot even higher-level things, level up. In addition to your guns' damage, your actual character somehow does more damage per shot by leveling up. This would make sense with, say, swords, which are driven by strength, but with guns it's just kind of dumb. The game's bizarre attempt to be an RPG is really just kind of annoying - it boils down to how much damage you do per shot to things of various levels. Things far lower-level than you can't really hurt you even if they get the drop on you, while things higher-level than you just need to hit you once with their normal patterns. Things don't get \"more difficult\", they just have bigger numbers. The entire game is basically a cycle with no appreciable gameplay differences, apart from the skills you buy. The game is, on the whole, motivated by quests, like any other RPG, but they just serve as periodic rewards to move the game along, since it's not like you can go around not doing quests - they're the things that open up new areas.The game's other main draw is co-op, which is at least a reasonably good idea. However, it's difficult to say that it's a good game because of co-op - rather, the co-op feels kind of irritating, because you have to be at a similar level to your co-op comrades to get anything done. It's usually best to start a bunch of new characters all at the same time so everyone's the same level, but that's also really annoying. Co-op is much more frantic than single-player, and it's harder to maintain the simple \"dodge attacks, shoot enemy\" gameplay when there's four people and the enemies are going for all of them. There are some bits that are made more fun with multiple people (like the usual Halo-style jeeps with a driver and gunner) but these are few and far between.On the whole, playing Borderlands was more of an annoyance than anything. The guns aren't responsive enough to be fun, the screen is often crowded by the heads-up display (especially in multiplayer), and despite the tight, linear maps, you're required to go back and forth to places to turn in quests. The cel-shaded graphics are kind of neat, and the gun sounds are pretty good, but mostly everything in the game is bland and basically a huge grind. If you're willing to subject yourself to huge amounts of grinding for no real gain, then you might be fine with Borderlands. However, for either casual players who want to move through things quickly, or hardcore players who want to actually get some results for their skills, Borderlands isn't a particularly great game.Rating: 4/10.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXLQC","description":"","reviewerName":"Tstops","summary":"Solid game, but not worthy of the Resident Evil title.","reviewText":"I'm a long time resident evil fan, it was one of the first games I played on the ps1. Since that day I loved survival horror. I loved resident evil from the first and all the way to the 5th, but this title just didn't feel right at all.I almost want to review this game from two perspectives. One from a nostalgic point of view and the other from a very,very open minded perspective.When I first got my hands on the game all I could think was how great it looked. The shadow and lighting quality, the amazing in game facial expressions, and how sweat and water looks on your characters.Then I killed the first few zombies and my heart sank. The zombies are so easy to take down. In Resident evil 4 and 5 I would conserve ammo by taking shots at zombies, hitting weak points, stunning them and going in for a melee finisher. Not in the 6th installment, just run up to them and beat em to a pulp, no strategy, just swing away you'll be fine. I hated this change but it worked. I used this \"cage fighter\" tactic and had an inventory flooded with ammo and never once, NOT ONCE feared death in this game. I felt like I was playing gears of war more than resident evil. This is NOT a survival horror game it's pure action, which isn't a bad thing. The problem is, it's a Resident Evil game, not call of duty.Next is your AI partner. The only reason for a partner is so friends can play coop. Your AI partner(if your playing by yourself) will never die or run out of ammo. They don't need first aid they don't need anything. They're just there for the story and to help you pull a switch or open a door....that has another switch. There's no real strategy to your fellow partner. In re5 you can choose which weapons, ammo and first aid they should take for each situation. I really missed this feature in re6 because it gives the player a real instinct for survival and item conservation, as well as an obligation to protect my AI partner. At no point in the game can you decide \"I'll give myself the shotgun I just found, and hand over 20 9mm rounds to my AI pal\"once you find the shotgun, sniper etc...your AI partner gets one as well. It's a minor change, but that change effected the whole feeling of the game. At that point I realized this isn't survival horror at all, this is the most fast paced resident evil game yet.With all that nostalgia aside , the game works and flows well. the stages are small, but filled with fast paced action.This resident evil title is by far the longest of the series. With 4 campaigns including Ada wongs chapter, there's plenty of content in this game with tons of cinematic, and I stress this.....TONS of cinematics. I would get so sick of it. It began to take my out of the game they became so frequent. Older titles(sigh,here comes my nostalgia again) put you in an area where you back between tough enemies and puzzles then , at key points in the game throw a cinematic in there. This installment pushes cinematics and quick time events down your throat followed by a brief skirmish with enemies. It's an attempt to keep you interested in the story, but just ends up making you yell \" ok! I get it! This boss is really cool and tough! I'm very impressed!\" I felt like I was watching a movie towards the end of Leon's campaign.So from an opened mind stand point. This game was a solid game,that was fast paced and keeps the action coming at you. Rent it or look for it in the bargain bin. It's worth checking out.Now from a more nostalgic view point, this game failed in almost way except for characters and camera angles. Some RE fans didn't like the 4 or 5, but for me, this game was stab in the back by capcom. If your looking for real high value survival horror games don't get this one, check out the dead space franchise, siren blood curse, the silent hill franchise, metro 2033(it's a gem), or even dead island.I pray that capcom will somehow see what they're putting the true fans through and bring back another Resident evil golden age.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2013"}

I bought it because it was Bethesda (can't be too bad, right?) and the previews looked like a pretty cool action game. Really though, it's more like puzzle game. It's broken up into segments or stages, and you have to return to the hub to get to the next stage. There is usually a boatride involved to move the story along, but the story never really gets interesting enough to make you care. Also, the character models are just plain ugly, I'm not sure why they chose this style. Even if you come across, say, a maid - you can't mess with her, she just walks around cleaning the same things over and over on a predetermined path. This is NOT a free roam type of game. If this would be a world setup like Assassin's Creed, I may have liked it more. They make it appear as if it is an open world, but it really isn't.For example, your task might be, \"cross this bridge\". There might be a couple of guards, an alarm system, a turret, and a dog in your way. Now, you can kill them all in a couple of different ways, or you can slow time and run by, you can sneak by, or even reprogram the turret and kill the alarm by removing the whale oil (no kidding). But since you're not really caring about the story or the characters, the fastest way is often to \"blink\" by. Sort of a teleport function. You can use the roof, or maybe a walkway under the bridge, but in the end, you just find a path across the bridge in whatever way suits you.Now there are a few loot items and gadgets etc, but you don't really need them much and they are not all that engaging anyway. You can maybe even swim by, but the fish will hurt you (no kidding, killer fish, although more annoying than threatening really). Of course you may want to posess a fish or a rat, or even another human (which means you can't fight, just move)... So in the end, the game gives you some options to play with, it's a puzzle game that you can solve in a variety of ways. Now for some people, that may be fun, but I felt kinda bored and just wanted to finiah it the fastest way possible so I can move on to the next game - and that is not value for your money.Also, why is this M-rated?I'd say, rent it, don't buy it before you try it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2012"}

Then go play Call of Duty 2. Want to play the best SWAT type tactical? Then go get Half-Life 2 and play Counter-Strike: Source which goes through periodic updates. Want to play the best multiplayer war game? Then before you even consider playing Day of Defeat: Source, go directly for Battlefield 2 instead which is certainly what you have been looking for and probably more. As a sequel to Battlefield 1942 (one of the best multiplayer games ever devised) it is well worthy of its predecessor's name but abandons its World War II premise for modern twenty-first century urban and rural warfare. As the game is built for multiplayer the single player campaigns do not do it justice. You really need to have a broadband connection and join a server to see the game the way it was meant to be played. Player statistics are monitored on-line and allow you to improve in rank and receive new weapons (unlocks). This makes it highly competitive. The same player classes are retained from BF1942 with some additional ones - sniper, machine gunner, anti-tank, medic, engineer, assault and support. The big bonus is the amount of new vehicles that the game has to offer, such as several types of planes, helicopters, tanks and cars. BF2 is one big CTF (capture the flags) with a huge array of photorealistic maps to play in. At player spawn you are given a wide choice of weapons and classes to choose from. Then you have the option of either working as a unit, driving a vehicle (that can also act as carriers) or just leaving your team behind and going on a solo mission frag-a-thon across a vast map (and these are some of the biggest maps ever made). Where BF1942 gave us the historical Pearl Harbor, Petersburg, German Forests, French Country, Operation Overlord, multiplayer style, BF2 goes for made-up non-historical global wars that have a futuristic atmosphere about them. Essentially you will play wars that have yet to be fought with the exception of several Iraq and Middle East type maps. It feels prophetic. The graphics are certainly heaps and bounds ahead of BF1942 giving us better textures, right down to photorealistic grass that you crawl through and branches on bushes that you can snipe behind. You can dash at very fast speeds until your stamina runs out. Explosions rock the world around you, can stun you and send pieces flying through the air. When a black hawk is downed in the town square it destroys everything around it on impact. Medics can revive dying team-mates. This is some of the best multiplayer entertainment you have ever seen. It is the biggest war game that people play online with a very large community (so large that you will find difficulty in choosing a login name for your ID) meaning plenty of 60 player (30/30) servers up and running and for you to join. All though you might just want to start running across a map shooting all around you, as in a real war this approach will probably just get you killed. The game itself takes days to grasp with patients that you must master. You must ensure that for bug free gaming to download and install the latest BF2 patch (currently 1.12 at this time of writing) which prevents crashing to desktop and has extra maps. Never use a CD-DVD crack with BF2 as they don't work. Instead either use the CD-DVD or learn how to load a BF2 mini-image. To be honest the quality of technical support is not the best (but does not make the game experience less) and could be a little clearer. The community is less responsive to answering questions and without something like IRC (internet relay chat) it can be difficult to find a channel of users who are willing to help you learn more about how to play the game. Another gripe is that this game has the hardest controller configuration that simply does not have to be as difficult as it is to program. BF1942 had this problem also. Sadly BF2 hasn't bothered to solve it. A major con is in the load times. High end systems take about two and a half minutes to load each map. The menu screens are not instant. Before Operation Flashpoint 2 brings us the best war multiplayer simulator ever conceived we still want to be able to play a multiplayer war game that will match the experience of Call of Duty 2 on a server with up to 64 players. BF2 does just that.Pros:- Multiplayer must-have.- Fairly realistic simulation experience that you will play again and again.- The only World War II simulation worth playing on-line right now.- Good game engine. Solid Gaming.- Replaces Operation Flashpoint and BF1942 and Day of Defeat: Source as the best on-line war simulation game.- Really big player numbers of servers.- Massive Maps.Cons:- Needs updating and this is not made clear on the EA website.- Needs broadband.- Steep learning curve.- Long load up times.- System resource heavy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00005QDPZ","description":"Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron IIfeatures some of the  best graphics ever seen on a home console, and it is a proper, old-fashioned,Star Warsgame. If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies. The ships move with a fluidity and grace you wouldn't have thought  possible from such a tiny purple cube. The only flaw is that the missions are  needlessly short, but there's plenty of replayability, and by gosh there's those  graphics.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"nintendofan","summary":"good but far from the N64 game","reviewText":"pros. real starwars levels like the attack on the deathstar and the battle of Hoth. wedge Antallies real voice. cool star wars aircrafts like the x-wing and the millennium falconcons. it is impossible to unlock everything whitout cheats. levels are to long.

My experience with online play with COD: MW3 is EXACTLY why I can't stand online gaming.  It's impossible.  Not fun.  I'm sure I could play and play and play and eventually become to the point of being competitive, but any game you ever try to play where you last about 20 seconds, average MAYBE one kill to your 10 or 15 getting killed, and that is a game not worth supporting with your time or money.Bottom-line with online gaming on this game: If you want to actually enjoy yourself and are not some person who has 100-200 extra hours a month to spend on online gaming, then there are better/easier/more fun games out there then this one.  It has made me change my higher-star review to three-star.***Original OFFline-only review:***I am no more or less of a fan of the COD series then any others, I just like a good FPS game, so I'm just writing this from that mindset.This game is fun, though I found it's another one of these where it seems like you're hiding from being completely killed as much as you are actually progressing forward.  Also, there were too many parts where basically you could just make the game progress forward by running through a section rather than shooting guys.  The storyline was epic as in the last one, though this time it seemed somehow less focused on the depth of things.The single player campaign was interesting, but it felt like it was somehow more frantic then in the last game.  Not faster-paced particularly, but where you didn't get very many chances to just look at the scenery (or maybe there just wasn't as much scenery this time).  And it felt like you didn't really get into enough the overall over-arching storyline.  A country's president gets kidnapped as well as someone close to them, but the reasoning is very cliche and you barely care.  World War 3 is supposedly occurring due to a series of events, but they don't really truly delve into the full extent of what's happening around the globe.BUT ultimately you are kept in the game by simply partaking in the action.  And while parts of the storyline do feel a bit shallow, I think this game is much more about the characters I guess of Soap, Price, and Yuri, so that is I think more of what you're following.  Basically it's like there's a chess game going on but while occasionally getting glimpses of the entire board you're mainly just looking at about three or four pieces.The single player campaign is somewhat short, but longer then the shortest games out there.  Definitely longer then Homefront or Medal of Honor.The offline co-op missions are becoming frustratingly rare these days, so getting to play any type of game where you can actually have a buddy sitting next to you and play is great.  There were two different types of these co-op games available - one where it was basically a survive against waves of different types of baddies who got progressively harder, and the other was a similar thing to COD:MW2 where you had set missions you needed to complete.  And you can also do these as a single player, which I enjoyed doing on the survival missions.Bottom-line: if you're a huge fan of COD games you've probably already bought this one.  If you're like me and you're just a fan of well-made FPS regardless of the brand/series, this is still a fun one.  I would simply say it's not as good as Modern Warfare 2, but I would also say it is worth getting.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000ZKA0KA","reviewerName":"M. Donnelly","summary":"Many Patches Later, We have a Solid Game","reviewText":"So, I've owned SOCOM Confrontation since \"day 1\".  I pre-ordered it with the headset, played the beta, and received it in the mail within the first few days of launch.  When the game launched, it was nearly unplayable.  It was awful and didn't work well at all.  Considering this game is ONLINE ONLY (stop reading here if you're looking for a single player experience!) the networked gameplay needs to be very solid.I was a big SOCOM fan in the PS2 days, so I kept playing, though not every day, in hopes that the game would improve.  Finally, a little under a year later, we have (more or less) the game we were promised.This is not quite the same as the original PS2-era SOCOM games, since it was made by another developer. (Zipper made the originals; Slant Six makes Confrontation)  Still, the game is a quality affair, most definitely.  There are two factions in this game, each of which can be customized to your liking.  You can choose different clothing, different camouflage patterns, and different weight/armor levels.  Heavier means you might take a few more shots, but lighter will allow you to sprint to key locations on maps that little bit faster, which could make the difference.  The weapons you bring into battle also affect your weight/speed balance, so choose wisely for your play style.  The two factions have different weapon selections at their disposal, which may also afford different play style opportunities.There is no shortage of guns in this iteration of the SOCOM franchise.  You will find a healthy supply of rifles, submachine guns, shotguns, light machine guns, sniper rifles, and pistols in this game, as well as a good slew of secondary items (grenades of different varieties, claymores, RPGs, etc.) to really fine tune your play style well.The game controls well, and motion controls may be disabled at any time if you prefer, or can be used by holding an activation button (much like push-to-talk chat systems) to enable the motion sensor.  I modified the sensitivity and was able to find a sweet spot to use for myself.The gameplay is good, but can be unforgiving at times.  It doesn't take much to be shot down--this is a much more realistic game than many others, so your health does not regenerate, and you really need to use proper tactics to ensure your own survival.  If you get into a clan, you'll have some great teamwork potential as well.  Since the game includes a bluetooth headset, there's not much excuse for not being able to communicate with your team, but more on that later.  The different game modes work well, though there is nothing that really stands out from the rest of the online shooters out there.Perhaps most important to this game is communication.  That's made much easier by the fact that most players opted to buy the bundle with a bluetooth headset.  This headset is of great quality, featuring a mute button which allows the classic \"baby crying\" and \"Mom!  Meatloaf!  Now!\" moments to be minimized.  One of the biggest flaws with online gaming on the PS3 (in my experience) is lack of communication, and since the majority of players seem to have purchased the bundle, it's quite a positive leap for PSN gaming.In conclusion, the patches since the game's launch have really improved the gameplay, offering better controls, better networking/game matching, and overall a better experience.  Voice communication is better in this game than any other PS3 game online, and customization allows for a wide variety of play styles to bring online.  And for those deciding between the game alone, and the bundle, keep in mind that the headset launched at $50 and the bundle at $60, whereas the game alone launched at $40.  If you consider the value of the bundle, you'll see the clear advantage.  This bluetooth headset is better than the other 4 I've used (I do all the electronics shopping for my family, so the only quality sets I haven't used are the Aliph Jawbones--if you have one of those the choice is yours to make)  There is also a downloadable version of this game on PSN, allowing for gameplay without a disc, which might be nice for some out there as well.P.S.-The next patch is said to offer free DLC to the SOCOM community, though I don't know the details of it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0065NP39E","description":"","reviewerName":"Charles Smartt","summary":"The aftermath of nuclear war never looks so interesting","reviewText":"The game's world is intriguing, but lacks much of the subtleties that Fallout 3 had. There are many quests, but few of the quests are truly fulfilling.Weapon customization and down the sight aiming are fantastic additions because now this game can be played as a first person shooter instead of depending on VATS, but VATS provides strategic advantages. The world is huge, but its exploration is a tad linear in nature as your primary effort is to get to New Vegas, and going there directly will result in, well, death (unless you take time to level up). Leveling up hasn't changed much from Fallout 3 except in two key ways: the perks are more interesting, and the majority of books found in the world only temporarily increase abilities as opposed to permanently increasing attributes. Decisions are important as well, as choices can find you on the right or wrong side of things later on. The game also has multiple endings, creating an opportunity for replay. The expansion content is interesting and they are all divergent from each other and the main world itself creating new experiences with new weapons.The game has technical problems - the once in a while crash, as well as critters getting stuck in rocks and poor enemy AI. The game works fine on Windows 8, and it works with the Microsoft Xbox 360 controller for windows.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2013"}

Among other things, the Dunia Engine delivers realistic, interactive environments, special effects, real-time night-and-day cycles, and smart enemy AI.Expansive, Realistic EnvironmentFar Cry 2 is set in a fictional region of Africa where you are caught between two rival factions at war. The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah. Wild animals such as zebras, buffalo, gazelle are encountered during the game, with both players and enemies allowed to interact with them.Far Cry 2 features an incredible level of detail and realism, with a minimal in-game interface to detract from immersion. For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game. To fulfill your mission, you need to play the enemies against each other, using both strategy and skill.Huge Range of Weapons and VehiclesFar Cry 2 offers gamers a wide range of weapons, from a machete for hand-to-hand combat, to a sniper rifle that can stealthily pluck off enemies from afar. As weapons disintegrate over time, they might jam or even explode in your hand.There are also a large range of vehicles such as gliders, trucks, cars, and boats that will let you fly, drive, slide, and hover over the open landscapes.Multiplayer Options for up to 16 PlayersFar Cry 2 supports up to 16 players and has four gameplay modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond, and Uprising. Players can choose from six different classes in multiplayer, each with its own set of pros and cons.

Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"There's a potentially great game here...","reviewText":"Far Cry 2 does something that a lot of famous First-Person-Shooters DON'T do - it gives gamers the opportunity to say, \"What would I like to do next?\"  At any given time there are probably close to a dozen different options, and that alone gives this game a 4-star rating.Far Cry 2 was built to have a lot of realism.  This is both good and bad.  The ease and ability of creating brush fires is ridiculously fun, and eerily scary at the same time.  The same fire you set to wipe out baddies can end up cornering you between a rock and a hot place.  Guns will jam on you when you least expect it, which can make for some awfully panicky game play.  There is no radar, and there is no pandering.  If you hit a guy with a truck, he dies.  If they hit you, YOU die.  I took a headshot during a gun battle.  I know it was a headshot - I went from full health to falling to the ground.  Luckily a buddy \"saved me,\" relieving my need for a reload.And that's the basis of Far Cry 2.  There's a LOT of challenges in the game, from jamming weapons, to the need for Malaria medicine, to frequent and recurrent gun battles all over the map.  But you can PREVENT a lot of these from becoming issues if you prepare yourself.Tired of guns jamming?  Stop by the gun shop and buy a new one.  Or at least pick up a new one if you've already purchased it - brand new guns are available (once purchased) in every segment of the map.Malaria medicine?  Not that much of a problem, really - I got the first bottle and haven't run out yet.  It'd be nice if they gave us a quantity left, so that I could know how long until I need some.  I'll admit it's a useless addition to the game, but again, it hasn't really posed much of a problem.Tired of fighting the same battle in the same place?  Once you've scouted a guard post, just barrell through in your truck of choice, or go crashing through the jungle to avoid the battle entirely.  I've avoided many confrontations this way.  Also, ride the rails whenever possible - very few areas of hostility along the train tracks.If you're expecting a gunfight (which you should ALWAYS be expecting,) make sure your female \"buddy\" is ready to save you.  You only get one save, then you have to stop any any pre-established safe house to \"reset\" her - then she'll be ready to save you again.The graphics of FC2 are amazing - simply amazing.  You can actually start to recognize where you are - it's not like the city sand-box games where it all just blends together.  There's dizzying heights and deep rivers.  I really like how long a day lasts - games like Grand Theft Auto run through a game-day in about an hour.  FC2's game-days run about 4 hours, maybe even more.  It really lets you plan your strategy and never makes you feel rushed.I get irritated by a few things, like how a civilian drives past me and feels compelled to jump out of his car and open fire on me.  Or how guns you're carrying seem to just dissapear...  Turns out if they jam and you don't hit the unjam button, he'll just throw them away.When a first-person shooter can keep you entertained for 30+ hours, that's a feat.  Few games can pull that off.  Yeah it's not a perfect game, but there's a lot to do here if you understand the intended strategy.  I've actually enjoyed playing Far Cry 2, and I have already found myself aiming for various \"completionist\" achievements because once you get past the challenges, there's a pretty fun game inside.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2008"}

True to its name and following the lead of its predecessor,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, it places players in modern combat settings, as opposed to the WWII environments of the earlierCall of Dutygames. This modern approach brings with it new weapons, action and options. Coupled with a variety of gameplay modes including single player, multiplayer and the co-op Special Ops Mode, it is destined to be one of the most popular games of 2009 and a worthy addition to theCall of Dutyseries..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }","reviewerName":"Too Old for Games \"casualgamer\"","summary":"5 stars for fun, 4 stars overall is about right","reviewText":"First off, I believe this is the best FPS out there.  However, to be better than games that preceded it is to be expected, not revered.  This is a great game, no doubt, but it's not as revolutionary as COD4 was.  That was leaps and bounds better than everything else at the time.  MW2 is just marginally better.  The campaign is decent, but it's been done before.  The cinematic moments have become iterative--the shock and awe moments have become desensitized because we've seen them in COD4 already.  Hence why they had to throw in the airport scene to try to throw something new at you, but it doesn't work.  Spec Ops is a great add on.  Multiplayer is slightly better.  All in all, definitely a keeper, but don't treat it as the best thing since sliced bread.  In summary, it does what a sequel should do, which is enough this time around.  Hopefully, they can start with a blank template for COD8 and revolutionize the genre once again.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2009"}

Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, doubters say it would be suicide.

As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

The majority of the story was around recruiting your team. While it was fun the \"in depth\" main story line just wasn't there. There were plenty of sidequests and side stories that really kept you in the game though. And even though the main story was short, the quality was fantastic.Characters: 10/10You couldn't ask for a better cast of characters. I absolutely loved and grew attached to nearly everyone. Shephard was 10 times better in this game than the last...he actually had emotion...imagine that. Tali, Miranda, Jack, Thane, Samara, Joker, Kelly, and Mordin were great. The level of backstory and development to these characters were just great. I found myself feeling bad if I didn't balance out who I took because I was so attached to each one. The others were good but just didn't grab you like the ones I just listed. But really you can't ask for a better cast.Gameplay: 8/10The gameplay took everything that was good from the first one and improved it...and got rid of the crappy things from the first as well. The mining was vastly improved. The battles were vastly improved and the time spent having to roll through hundreds of different ammos and weapons were improved as well. However, a little more diversity when it comes to armor and weapon builds would have been great. Also, I actually preferred the first where I could never run out of ammo and would just have to take a break while my gun cooled down.

{"product_name":"B002I0J5UQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Mark Carson","summary":"Without doubt, the love it or hate it game of the year","reviewText":"Okay, so it's obvious from my ratings that I loved L.A. Noire. It is at once both homage and evolution, with its old school adventure gaming elements and awesome new tech. But wow, do some people ever hate this game. However, I shall weigh the evidence of its critics and act as judge and jury, because, well it is my review.  Let's take a look at the common criticisms I keep reading and hearing:It is not GTA or Red DeadI absolutely find L.A. Noire guilty as charged on this one, but the obvious fact is it did not try to be either of those games. There are a few open world elements (and the rendered sections of L.A. are awesome by the way) but anyone paying the slightest bit of attention to previews for this game could have immediately gotten the sense that this was not your typical Rockstar fare. I love the fact that Team Bondi took this game in an entirely different direction...Red Dead is one of my favorite games, but open world does not a great game make.The Story/Ending SucksAbsolutely, emphatically not guilty, on the grounds the game itself is based on a genre of fiction it rather accurately reflects. I realize the largest percentage of gamers have likely never partaken of much noir fiction in any form, but it pretty much is what it is and I realize it's not for everyone.  I love the way the story builds and the histories of certain characters reveal over time into a mosaic describing truly human and very personal tragedies and triumphs. I could go into much greater detail in analyzing the story itself, but prefer to remain spoiler-free for those who have not yet played it (or completed it).The Pacing is Slow, Boring, EtcI'll pretty much give you this one and say guilty to slow but take exception on the boring charge. Yes the game is (very deliberately) a change of pace and slower than your average slash/hack/shoot/etc type of game. I for one do not see why this has to be such a slam on the game. I can have as much fun as the next person in a game shooting everything in the face for a few hours, but in my opinion that is not the only gaming experience with merit. I really felt like a living, breathing old school detective playing this game, not some archetypal Supercop unrealistically taking out hordes of 1940s mobsters with mutated genes (or some junk). It obviously ultimately depends on one's own definition of what is tedious or boring...mine would be playing a terrible bowling or darts mini-game for the 7,000th time just so my character can remain friends with another character I personally don't care much for. But hey, this person can get me rides, weapons, etc and then there's the trophy hunting so what are you gonna do?Gameplay is repetitive, sucks and so onSorry the repetition charge is not guilty, on the simple basis it is my opinion it would be like indicting my car because it has tires. All video games contain some measure of repetition...if one examines closely the history of video games one might argue repetitive elements are in fact a defining trait, which also makes it automatically a valid criticism of virtually every game ever made, which ironically thereby simultaneously removes the teeth from said criticism. The key is whether you like the repitition or not, which of course is a matter of opinion. I became truly interested in the way each of the cases played out in the game and enjoyed challenging myself to improve with evidence collection and interrogation.GraphicsI'm not even going to rule on this one, based on the fact people are all over the map in discussing the game's visuals. I for one thought the city itself is incredible, and the facial animations add a level of realism that may not get one across uncanny valley, but certainly put me right in the middle of it at times.CombatYep, guilty...this is definitely where the game shares in a flaw of its Rockstar brethren (although Red Dead did manage to compensate somewhat with its Dead Eye variation).  Combat is certainly not awesome, but for me it suffices for the game and obviously it is far from its center piece.Game Doesn't Change if One \"Fails\" CaseThis is a definite guilty, and the issue that honestly bugs me the most. It is quite odd and even jarring to have one's superior chewing your character out at the end of one case and then heaping praise at the start of the next. It's a shame more attention was not given to this detail, because for me the game otherwise provides a satisfyingly realistic experience.ActingI've seen quite a bit of criticism on the performances, and I cannot find validity to this charge. In fact, I would say the acting is a definite strength of the game, especially compared to so many of its peers out on the market.Length (Too Short)My response to this is not guilty, with my second response being really? I am guessing this comes from it being a Rockstar game, with the expectation that there would be numerous side quests and mini-games to help clock in all those extra gaming hours. Taken more realistically as a non-open world game, L.A. Noire provides a nice lengthy single player campaign. I am usually one of the first to chime in on game length, but for me that criticism does not hold much water here.VerdictAll in all, this was my favorite gaming experience of the year so far, and that's high praise. I would say give this a rental before buying, but even then be aware the first few cases are structured as basically a tutorial. In other words, don't be too hasty to judge the game based on your first hour or two of play. L.A. Noire is a unique experience, making its greatest crime also its greatest asset. It is time well spent for those who appreciate a break from the norm.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2011"}

Apple has cool hardware, but after playing a lot of games on a touchscreen, I didn't really care for it.  I was ready to jump over to the PSPgo, which would deliver a far better gaming experience.To be honest, I love the hardware, its cool, no worries.  Smaller buttons, yeah, well, its ok.  I don't mind.  I have man hands and I can make it work.  I really like the controls being under the screen, I don't have to hold up the PSP as high, it just \"feels\" better.  I love the sliding mechanism.  Some themes you can get make it so that when you slide it shut, a clock appears.  Its really cool.  Some of the controls, like the volume control, are in a truly irritating place.  But its small, and portable, and sacrifices were made and I'm ok with that.  I am a Sony guy, I love their stuff, and once again the Sony hardware team does not disappoint!Problem is, when you roll a piece of hardware that has no UMD slot, you better have some awesome supporting infrastructure.  And we know what cool supporting infrastructure is thanks to the iPhone and its Appstore.There are a lot more games for the iphone than for the PSP.  But the PSP is supposed to be a better, pedigreed gaming machine.  We all know it.  There are more Mustangs than Ferraris out there and most of us would rather have a Ferrari.  And as for the gobs of games for the iphone, over 20,000 I think, how many games does one need, anyway?  And most of them are junk.So i was really excited about the PSPgo.  Sony knows games and gaming systems.  The PSPgo should smoke any wimpy touch screen gaming \"system\".  And in terms of hardware, I think it does.But the PSP go has its own issues.  The bottom line is, you should buy a PSP with a UMD slot - for now.Here are the reasons:There are only 7 \"mini\" game titles in the app store at the time of this review.There are 16 \"exclusive\" PSP downloadable titles.Then there are hundreds of PSP games, but, the issue there is that many of these PSP games cost LESS on UMD than they do on the PSPgo!  So not only do you lose the ability to buy a USED game, and the ability to RENT the game from gamefly, you also actualy get to pay MORE for the games in download format.  Its INCREDIBLE!Ape escape... $13.99 on Amazon.com, $19.99 via digital download on the PSP.beaterator... $36.99 on Amazon.com, $39.99 via digital download for psp.Other games are the SAME PRICE as getting a hard copy.  Except, you don't get to sell or trade that hard copy when you are done.The biggest software source that I have access to a huge back catalog of PSP games that are NO LONGER IN PRINT.  Gee.  I'm super unimpressed.  We all know the only reason games go out of print is because they aren't selling anymore and you can buy a used copy at gamestop for $5.And guess what - I could access all this software from a PSP1000, PSP2000, or PSP3000, and buy used UMDs and sell my games when I'm done.The downloadable games should be CHEAPER than buying a hard copy.  You aren't paying for extra convenience.  You should be paying less because that game did not have to be pressed and distributed thousands of miles to get to you.In addition, the Playstation store - which is your most convenient way of getting games - is very poorly set up.  Forget seeing a video of the game, as you can on Amazon.  None of the games for sale even have screen shots so I can't tell what the heck i'm buying.  There is less information available than on the back of a UMD case in the store.  Hello 1995!There are also no customer reviews, so I can't make a judgement from that.The free Rockband Lite took 30 minutes to download, which seemed waaay too long and a lot longer than the iPhone games I've been buying.  In a world where you can download a Kindle book in 2 minutes, and a iPhone game in less than 5, without even using WIFI, a 30 minute wifi required download is going to get old in a hurry.  Oh yes, I know I could tether it to a computer or PS3 with a USB cable.  Hellllllo 2004.  Lets not brag about that too loudly, the PSPgo is starting to be a King of Inconvenience.The bad appstore, poor download prices, and lack of cheap, addictive games is a total deal killer for me.  Yes, Sony will fix this.  Over time.  Not by Christmas 2009.Buy a PSP3000 this year.

Donnelly","summary":"You'll have to make up your own mind here...","reviewText":"The PSPGo is a point of controversy for gamers.  The general consensus is that it is a flop, and undeserving of the price of admission.  There are a small percentage of users who disagree.  I fall somewhere in between.It is necessary to go into detail to fully explain the portable console, so I apologize in advance for the lengthy upcoming review.Design-wise, I am a big fan of the PSPGo.  I am an adult male with somewhat large hands.  Many complain about the smaller size cramping the hands.  I actually felt cramped on the original PSP, and for me this isn't any worse.  The analog is in a slightly different position relative to where it was on the other PSP models.  I think this is an improvement, in general.  My hands are still cramped, but I have found slightly more comfort with the PSPGo after adjusting how I position my hands to hold the system.  Many will find it more cramping, but I think it was about the same.  Children may welcome the smaller grip, but I'm not sure about that.The screen.  A sliding screen means the screen stays exposed even when the main controls are concealed.  This doesn't serve too much purpose to me.  There are a couple of games that use the shoulder buttons exclusively, and you can use the shoulder buttons while listening to music, but this is not a major factor.  With that said, the screen is somewhat smaller than the older PSP models.  While it provides an advantage in terms of portability of the device, it means...a smaller screen size.  I wish I could say it doesn't make a difference, or isn't noticeable, but I'd be lying.  The screen is attractive, but it's simply a bit on the small side.  However, I like being able to more comfortably fit the PSPGo in my pocket, which I can't say about the larger models.The face buttons are clicky and responsive.  They all feel nice.  The two shoulder buttons are a tiny bit squishy, but not terribly so.  I wish they were a bit firmer, but I can live with what they are without any issues.Bluetooth is an added feature to this model of the PSP, as well.  This means support for audio over bluetooth.  I was hoping to be able to use my Android phone as a bluetooth modem for the PSPGo.  However, I was never able to set this up properly (ever).  I tried many, many times, and was always unsuccessful.  It kind of frustrated me, and I am still disappointed, although again, it's not a dealbreaker.One nice little feature on the PSPGo is that you can now pause any game at any time.  You can only do this for one game at a time, and pausing a new game forces you to overwrite the previous paused game state.  It's quite a handy feature, since sometimes portable gaming sessions get cut short, for various reasons.The major departure from the PSP, however, is the complete lack of UMD support in any form.  UMD is the traditional physical format of PSP games (and media).  16GB on-board memory replaces the UMD slot, and is used to store downloaded content to the PSPGo (this can be expanded with a proprietary Sony memory card).  This means if you're upgrading from a prior PSP to the PSPGo, you won't be able to pop in an old disc and just play.  Instead you'll need to repurchase the game from the PlayStation Network Store.  This means you will spend a lot if replacing a large library of games.  This is the biggest gripe most people have with the PSPGo.  Sony never offered a trade-in/download program to help users replace their UMD's.  Additionally, the price of downloaded games is generally the same as purchasing physical discs from a retailer, for a brand new game at the time of release.  However, many \"new\" games (i.e. non-used) will drop in price, whereas game downloads tend to remain at a higher price, even after discounted.  There is no guarantee either way, but that tends to be the case.  People who like collecting discs, manuals, and boxes will often be disappointed that the same money will often go toward a less satisfying purchase.  Additionally, there are fewer places to purchase PSN downlaods from: Amazon.com now has a store for that, and the PlayStation Network Store is the only other option.  This means sales are going to be more limited as compared to having many retail options competing for your business.Overall, the PSPGo is a great little system...for SOME people.  For others, it is a horrible misstep from Sony.  I wish I could give you a better answer than that.  I didn't own a PSP before, so I like my PSPGo.  I don't have the issue many had with abandoning an old UMD library.  I like the size, despite the issues I have with the screen size.  The controls are cramped, but in my opinion no worse than the original PSP or other portable gaming systems.I hope this has helped you make an educated decision about the PSPGo.  No one can make the decision for you.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2011"}

The volleyball element is simple to learn and hard to put down. controls are as simple as positioning a girl, then using either a hard button press or a soft one to determine what action to take. Earning money, gambling, and yes buying bathing suits is all actually integrated. If you put a girl in a color or suit she doesn't like, she won't play as well. Put her with a teammate she hates, you you'll suddenly see a drop in performance. You'll find yourself scruitinizing over what teammates you want, and maybe balancing what bathing suit seems to increase performance with what suit you'd rather see on a girl.It's simple, it's fun, and it's actually a game.Now onto the other half, the gorgeous women. It's no secret that most people will buy this game for \"other\" reasons. Girls sunbathe, girls hop, girls straddle tree-trunks in gratuitously obvious sexual pandering. This game is NOT for kids. But for guys (and girls) the actual gameplay is more than enough to warrant play by itself, and the sexual overtones only add to the interesting blend. Yes, the gratuitous cut-scenes can be skipped if you'd rather not watch.If you only care about the girls, a 3-day rental may exhaust your urges. If you actually want to try the gameplay, this is a solid choice that will keep you interested for some time. And yes, the multiplayer mode is the best for any volleyball game I've ever played. In fact, perhaps the best for any sports game. Each side gets ample camera time, and the camera works well. Very nice.Is this worth buying just for the girls? Yes.Is the gameplay worth it?

{"product_name":"B000FRS9II","reviewerName":"SB","summary":"Genius.  And I disagree with others: it is not too short","reviewText":"This is one amazing game.  Three years later it has lost none of its jaw-dropping power.  I suppose it could be considered short by some, but the fact that each element of gameplay and graphics is so meticulously crafted, the visuals are so richly detailed, and the combat is so intense, I'd say it is the perfect length.  If it was much longer I think players would get tired of mowing down hordes of similar enemies.If the game has a flaw, though, that is it: that the enemies fall into about 4 categories, and you've seen them all by the middle of the game, so by that mid-point, you don't really have to learn any new tactics or modify your gameplay style at all.  I would have liked to see something new after a while.However, that's a small grievance and shouldn't detract at all from the overall glee that you will experience as you dash from cover to cover blasting the living hell out of hordes of truly despicable aliens.  This game makes you feel like you are inside the biggest action movie ever made: Aliens, Predator, Starship Troopers, whatever-have-you, this game lets you \"live\" your fantasies with more action and intensity than even those movies depicted.

{"product_name":"B002I08CSW","description":"","reviewerName":"Stephanie","summary":"lol no","reviewText":"When switching weapons in a fast paced action game that requires quick reflexes and split second timing it is vital that the player is able to do so as quickly and efficiently as possible. Traditionally this has been achieved using a normal control pad and a single button press, The Wonderful 101 does things a little differently (much to my annoyance). To change weapons in The Wonderful 101 (an action which will be required thousands of times) the player must look down at the gamepads touchscreen, remove the stylus from it's holster, draw a squiggly line roughly in the shape of the weapon they want to select then quickly press one of the face buttons, put the stylus away and look back up at the TV screen and continue playing. Oh and that's when it works, there will be many times you will mess up and have to do it all again, just to change weapons.But the controls are just the beginning of this games problems. Levels are mostly made up of a series of skirmishes involving enemies with health bars that require far too many hits to deplete. With a combat system that has none of depths or nuance of it's big sister Bayonetta you know your in button mashing territory and my god does it feel like hard work.Artistically the graphics look nice but the flashy visual effects make it impossible to see where your tiny little men are or sometimes even distinguish them from enemies. The static camera also obstructs your view regularly.The pain keeps piling on in the form of an indecipherable leveling up system and when unreliable touch screen controls combine with irritating quick time events the game becomes virtually unplayable.On a positive note the voice acting is very good but that counts for little when the game underneath is so horribly broken.

It really helps.- Excellent music. This really helps too.- Complicated story with interesting morality. I never understood irrational \"ends-justify-the-means\" ethics, which this game obviously employs, but it's certainly realistic to our ultra-nationalistic, ultra-militaristic government, so using it as a plot device in this game makes perfect sense. The enemy is mostly domestic so no one can claim anti-Arab, anti-Muslim or racism. Branching storylines and alternate endings as in a special edition DVD.- Very very interesting psychological training levels (although this is far too brief and actually doesn't really train newbies on most weapons and gadgets).- Sammy gotta girlfriend. Aww[...]- Map - don't know where to go? Look at the map.- I never once had to consult the internet due to bad design, didn't know where to go, what to do, glitches, etc. Double-plus good on that.CONS:- Deplorable recycled enemy voice acting during combat. Your enemies will even switch from new voice actors to completely different (old) voice actors if you enter combat. They'll say things like \"let's try something different, fall back!\" and other various quotes from older Splinter Cell games (Chaos Theory). Tons of them are from the exact same voice actor, which again is from older games and there is not even an attempt to make him sound like a different guy each time. How much effort could it take to get some voice actors into a studio to some new lines. You could get a bum off the street to do this.- infinite health nonsense like in Call of Duty 2, Gears of War, Rainbow Six Vegas, etc. no med kits, health packs, etc. I don't get this with the new games. It's a revolt against the old Doom health/armor tradition. Logically, it only makes sense if you have some sort of Halo character with a recharging shield or something similar. Sam ain't got that, WWII soldiers certainly didn't, neither do characters in other games - you might be able to give Gears of War a pass because they are wearing some sort of goofy suit in the future, but they really should either explain it (or explain it away) for this and other games. Infinite health changes the context of gameplay. There is no urgency to get to a health kit or be more careful if your health is down. Get shot a bunch of times? Just duck down for a couple of seconds, no prob.- too many timed missions (entire levels are timed in this game in which you must complete complicated tasks and aren't even able to run - you're forced to walk). It's annoying.- they took away the light and sound meters in favor of a lame traffic-light Homeland Security style color system. I miss the light and sound meters, they were cool. The color system is also redundant (they have it permanently on screen in 2 different places) -- why not have only 1 color alert (on his shoulder strap) and the light/sound meters for flavor. The light meter allowed you to see when you were APPROACHING vulnerability of exposure. Now they just have a yellow light which indicates only the exact moment of vulnerability, not when you are getting close. The sound meter similarly allowed you to see when you were able to surprise enemies more easily due to loud ambient noise.- grenade throwing system downgrade. They used to show you an exact arc of where the grenade would land - this was realistic because throwing stuff into an exact location is fairly easy in real life. Even children can do it, so I gather an expert military veteran can do it. Not anymore because it's gone. Why?Still an excellent game and I'm sure they'll give it a sequel.

[This is sucks if you wanted to play VS against someone and had no online play... but more reason to get your online game going ]These were all one time bugs and online play for the PS3 isn't perfect yet... but it sure doesn't matter to me... haven't had any problems in single player mode.. and haven't had the chance to see how long it is..but this game is OFF THE CHIZZLE! must buy for all racers and PS3 owners.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2007"}

I loved the reviews and I have been very, very close to buying it. However, despite lifting the activations limit, the game still needs online activation when your first install it. Please, please remove activation altogether so I can get it! I just can't bring myself to buy a game that I may not be able to install in the future.It's a superb game and I really want to play it and add it to my collection. Please listen to buyers who don't want activations. Most of them are people who have been fans of the developer for years, like me.Here's an extract from an interview with 2K's community manager, Elizabeth Tobey, who clarified the limited activations issue saying,\"Our other methods of copy protection remain. You will still have to activate your copy, and you will still need to keep the disc in the drive. SecuROM has not been removed - just the activation limits on number of installs and number of computers you can install BioShock on simultaneously.As I promised that the activation limits would go away, I can promise that if we ever stop supporting BioShock in the ways you speak of, we will release a patch so that the game is still playable. I believe, as you seem to, that BioShock will be the kind of game we will want to revisit 5, 10, 15 or more years from now. I want my copy to be playable, just as you do, and so does 2K.\"I know that Elizabeth kindly promises to remove activation, but I prefer it to be removed now. I just can't trust that they will patch this out as I have been tricked many times before by companies claiming to correct issues at a later time.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2008"}

I had imagined this to be a lot like Jeopardy where you side back, choose a category, and answer questions.But there was much more.  You do choose categories (where, except the first round, the one with the lowest score chooses the category) but each round of question answering is different.  Like there is one where you get a bomb and you can pass it when you answer the question right.  When a random amount of time goes by the bomb explodes.  It is the variety of different ways to answer questions that make this really fun and it isn't difficult to figure out how to play it at all (we didn't read the directions and figured it out just fine on the fly).There are a ton of questions and after playing it several times we have yet to hear the same question twice.You also get to choose a character and that also made each of these fun as different characters each reacted to situations differently.  Some of the reactions were quite hysterical and more entertaining than the game itself.I only had one potential problem with this game, which is that you can't play this with just anybody.  Everybody gets the same questions so if I had younger children they wouldn't have a prayer of keeping up with Mom and Dad.  But my 12 year old was smart enough to get a lot of these questions right though some categories were plainly out of his league.  In other words, it isn't really \"fun for the whole family\", but it is great fun when you play with people who are roughly as smart as you.Other than the shortcoming of the previous paragraph, I thought this was a blast and would highly recommend it to people who like trivia games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2008"}
{"product_name":"B005C7R8I8","description":"","reviewerName":"N. Beitler \"Avid Reader\"","summary":"Comic gaming greatness!","reviewText":"Another great PvP fighting game from Capcom! This game is essentially a more robust re-release of the Marvel VS Capcom 3 game, so if you already have a copy of that game, you don't really need this one. The only real difference to this game is the inclusion of more playable characters.If you are not familiar with Capcom fighting games, you may be a bit surprised, at first, as to how fast-paced this game is. It is possibly the fastest-paced game I have ever played. Each character has their own signature moves and combos that must be executed perfectly and at just the right time to maximize their effectiveness. Due to the high amount of skill needed to pull off these moves, some players may find it frustrating at first. They will most DEFINITELY find it frustrating if they jump into the fray against a skilled opponent. Seeing an opponent give your character a smack-down with a 50+ hit combo that nearly vanquishes them in one assault will be more than a little intimidating and humbling. This is a game that really takes some invested time to master, and Capcom HAS included the option to play a \"Simple\" mode, that will allow most players to pull off some devastating moves without fully learning the controls and the nuances of the game. Once players get the hang of the game play and learn the strengths and weaknesses of each character, the game becomes much more fun to play. This is a game where there can be tremendous swings in advantage within mere moments. At one moment it could like like you're getting blown out and the next moment you could be on top. This adds to the fun of the game for me. I don't like games that are too easy or require no skill to play.This game has three modes of play:1) Offline Mode: Just as it sounds, this is where you play against the computer (Arcade), play against a friend (Versus), play through an advancing story line (Mission), or learn the moves of your character in practice sessions (Training).2) Xbox Live: Once you feel as if you have an adequate grasp of the game (or have friends who are not-so-skilled that you feel like schooling, you can use this mode to go online and play against others.3) Heroes & Heralds Mode: This mode of play was not included in the actual release, but was a part of a free download from the company to expand playing options. In this mode you have 3 decks (A,B,C) each deck contains 3 slots for a card. Each card has a buff that will aid you in your fights by boosting a stat or giving your character the ability to do something it would not normally be able to do. You can choose to be a Herald of Galactus or a Hero of Earth and you collect cards to build up your deck as you win battles. Each side has particular cards exclusive to each side.In this game you have a variety of villains or heroes from each respective universe that you can choose to play as/against. (In a fight, you choose three characters for you \"team\" and you will fight against three opponent characters. You don't have to choose all characters from one specific universe, but can mix and match at will.) With the addition of 12 new playable characters compared to the original MVC3, there are a whopping 48 characters to choose from. The complete character roster is listed below, by side:MARVEL:New since MVC3: Ghost Rider, Doctor Strange, Rocket Raccoon, Hawkeye, Ironfist & Nova.Previously released: Captain America, Thor, Spider-Man,Storm, Wolverine, Deadpool, Magneto, Iron Man, Doctor Doom, Dormammu, Super Skrull,M.O.D.O.K., Phoenix, X-23, Hulk, She-Hulk, Taskmaster, Sentinel.CAPCOM:New since MVC3: Firebrand, Frank West, Nemesis, Vergil, Phoenix Wright, & Strider HiryuPreviously released: Ryu, Chun-Li, Dante, Trish, Crimson Viper, Viewtiful Joe, Spencer, Amaterash, Chris, Wesker, Zero, Tron, Morrigan, Felicia, Haggar, Arthur, Akuma, Hsien-Ko.As you can see, there is an incredible diversity of characters, here. While there are a few characters that are conspicuously absent (such as Megaman from Capcom and Green Goblin or Venom from Marvel), the appearance of several characters that have never been included in a video games before was really nice to see. Each character has several alternate costumes that can also be chosen. Some of them are comic accurate and some aren't, but it's a nice little touch to add a bit more diversity to the game. I would suspect that there will be a fair amount of Marvel comics fans who will purchase this game based solely on their love of these characters. In fact, I'd say it will be a safe bet that the majority of people purchasing this game will be comic fans.This game is a lot of fun to play, and any fans of fighting games are sure to love it. In my opinion, this is one game that is a MUST BUY title for the Xbox 360.This game has a Teen rating due to cartoon fighting violence, a few instances of profanity (mostly from the character Deadpool), and some skimpy costumes worn by a few of the female characters (Felicia & Morrigan). I would personally say that a \"T\" rating is the proper rating for this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"MikeB \"Metalhead\"","summary":"Simply amazing","reviewText":"It would be impossible to describe everything in GTA IV, because the game is too big to describe in detail.  Suffice it to say, if you can think it, you can do it in GTA IV.  Previous installments in the GTA series allowed you to interact in a world that was largely oblivious of your presence, only reacting when you made an impression.  This time around, Liberty City feels alive, and things happen around you with or without your interaction.  The city interacts with you, giving you visual, audio, and sensational feedback on a level that borders realism (or at least as real as an HDTV, 5.1 Dolby surround sound system, and a rumble controller can give you).The story in GTA is very well done, although if you do the missions in a random order, it does break up the flow of the story, however if you don't choose to do many of the side missions, you feel as though you are missing out.  Overall, though, the missions are very fun, ranging from simple pick up and delivery missions to kill 50 rival mobsters by yourself missions.The gameplay has been improved, and although not perfect, they work well and make the game very playable and fun.  You can now take cover behind objects a la Gears of War, and I haven't been able to find a surface I wasn't able to hide behind. The driving has also been improved, making the cars feel more realistic and the damage to cars is incredibly detailed.  If someone shoots your tire, the tire will explode and you'll be driving on a rim.  If you hit a wall or oncoming traffic at high speed, you'll be hurled through the windshield.  If you damage any part of your car, the car will be affected realistically.  I even had a tire lock up on the front passenger's side because the damaged metal was wrapped around the rubber.  GTA is filled with astounding attention to detail.The graphics are some of the best on the 360.  There are real-time shadows being cast by every object in Liberty City, giving you a sense of time.  Weather ranging from fog to rain to intense thunderstorms that send shockwaves through your controller all make the city feel even more real.  All of the people, vehicles, buildings, bridges and environments are rendered beautifully.The sound is equally amazing, with no detail overlooked.  Crappy cars will have squeaky breaks, fast cars will have monstrous engines, pedestrians will talk to eachother, pigeons coo, grenades explode, cars crash, sirens wail, and on and on.  I've been playing for about 25 hours now and I haven't once seen an action on screen that wasn't accompanied by a perfectly placed sound effect.  The music, depending on your own personal taste, is also great.  Voice acting is the best I've yet heard in a videogame.The GTA brand of humor is in full effect, from the advertisements to the radio to the television and even to the internet, its all there.  In addition to stealing cars and causing general mayhem, you can also go on dates, surf the internet, watch TV, buy new duds, go bowling with friends, shoot pool, play darts, eat hot dogs from a vendor cart, wash the blood off your new Inferno, pimp out your cell phone, and even get drunk.  The amount of things to experience in Liberty City are endless.A warning to parents: The \"M\" rating given by the ESRB is no joke.  This game is not appropriate for anyone under 17, and should never be played by or around children.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYLRK","description":"","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Great addition, but needed more polish","reviewText":"Assassins Creed 3 manages to live up to the hype of its runup, provided you are willing to overlook a bit too much cutscening, way too labyrinthian tutorials, and a large portion of graphical glitches. While I applaud the attempt of Ubi to push the envelope, their flagship title probably isn't where they want to do the first breakout of the \"new and improved\" Anvil engine.Graphics (5-10/10): Graphics of the environments are simply stunning. Water flows like water on the sea, clouds and landscapes are pristine and crsip, and fog flows naturally and blocks just the right amount of vision. Trees and buildings feel natural and organic, and nothing is left feeling out of place.People graphics are... very unsettling. The eyes especially always look like polished stones because of a persistent reflective effect. Clothes and weapons go through objects and people rag doll way too much when killed. Stutters from officers are the worst, with partolling officials getting trapped on railings, shimmying like they are doing the ants in the pants dance, or sinking into the floor but somehow spinning like tops to stare directly at you.The cutscenes are fantastic, but its almost that they're too detailed. The new engine is great, but leaving it at 60% of capability would've removed a large portion of the problems but still allowed for improvements.Characters (2-10/10): The characters can make or break a story. Alitair was distant but just involved enough that you felt something for the character. Ezio was entertaining, funny, well developed, and flowed organically from one game to the next, plot hole leaps forward in time be damned.Desmond is like a pair of dress pants you dont like. You wear them when you have to, and they're annoying, but they do serve a purpose and you can have a quite enjoyable experience in them provided its brief. In other words, perfect. Desmond's story draws to a well deserved and entertaining close, but thankfully he's not the central character.Haytham Kenway therefore is like slipping into a pair of your favorite jeans: broken in, comfortable, and wearable anywhere. He's erudite, cultured, polite, and willing to rip your heart out through your back after finishing his High Tea.Connor Kenway... Connor Kenway... ... one must pause long and hard before putting words to this creation. Connor is not something that can be easily shoved into a pants based metaphor. He's frustrating, incredibly naive, stupid and brilliantly intelligent, and willing to put his money with his mouth is. All of his positive and negative aspects sum up to almost zero. He's never truly likable, but never annoyed you enough to make him a legitimate detraction. The fact that they've already leapt to a new ancestor is proof that Ubi at least picked up on that.Audio (7/10): Audio continues to be top notch. However, while it was great that they got a dozen Mohawk to voice characters, after ten minutes, it was unnecessary in the extreme.Gameplay (8/10): Improvements abound here, but for one place: the 6 hour \"tutorial.\" Did you know you can choke out a guard instead of kill them if you are empty handed? I didn't, and the game never told you, or that you had a horse summoning whistle, and left you plodding throuh 4-foot deep snow.AC1's tutorial was seven minutes, all in the Animus. Having one mission explain one new command at a time was a ghastly experience, and it still didn't cover everything that was critical.The naval portion has to be seen to be believed. I could play a whole game like that and be content. Between bording actions and cannon warfare, its like watching a naval war movie.New side missions are well placed and a nice addition rather than being a crucial waste of time, ala Codex pages. They help and they're useful, but the game won't screech to a halt so you can go collect them all.Story (10/10): If you see some of the twists coming, you are probably psychic. Not much more can be said without spoilers.Overall (8/10): Packaging and unbelievable glitches are the only spots where this game stutters. Suspension of disbelief is great, but when you ride on a horse with a musket sticking through it, it's kind of like being on a plane during takeoff that sucks in a flock of ducks. They're all small things, but you can't ignore how much bumpier the ride suddenly becomes. A few patches and this'll quickly crawl up to 9-10 range. By the time they make the War of 1812 installment for Connor, they'll have the system nailed down.Update: The Tyranny of King Washington DLC (5/10): The alternate history DLC was very poorly thought out. The first episode is on an entirely new map, an almost nuclear winter New York, and follows a surprisingly bland and boring plot, where Washington is corrupted by the Apple of Eden. New abilities are shoe horned in pretty hard and are absolutely necessary to proceed through the plot, which is a pretty bad thing, as you're supposed to be able to get through on your wit and guile rather than your \"spirit power.\"The future episodes appear to hold more promise, but so far, I'm unimpressed. I've already purchased the season pass, so hopefully this will improve.In addition, MP content continues to be added. Not just player purchased items, if you have money that you absolutely have to flush-I mean spend, but cutscenes and \"glitched\" cutscenes, which can be pretty entertaining. A seroius Gold star for actually adding content rather than just another ten billion prestige levels.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2012"}

Bashing zombies with bats/pipes/plants, all well and good. I actually really like the idea of the missions: Saving people who will all act differently when met with a zombie. The game itself isn't even that difficult. What is beyond frustrating for me and several other reviews that I have read is the saving system. Where you can go to save is not displayed on your map and I have spent hours trying to accomplish one mission, because the mission itself is difficult and walking to get to the mission can take up to fifteen minutes. Because you respawn where you last saved, which in this case is the complete opposite end of the mall.The graphics are okay considering when the games was made. Difficulty is challenging. Aiming is total garbage, be it a gun or a cash register, throwing thins has never been this difficult and the speed at which you move your gun is lethargic. Another thing that bothers me about the game is you can only use a weapon for a certain amount of time/hits before it disappears. This is a great idea and adds a good degree of difficulty. However I don't see how swinging a cactus play and a lead pipe could deteriorate at the same speed.The missions are at times ambiguous and must be done a few times before you figure it out.Interacting with characters there is no audio, just subtitles.Even though your character does \"level up\" you have no control over your character's evolution.The more I write this review, the more disappointed I am, because the game is actually a lot of fun, better than any other zombie game I have played, but it sucks up too much of my time for not enough progress. You can play for two hours and accomplish nothing, because turning the wrong corner can send you back to the beginning. And more time is spent walking from the warehouse to the corridor than actually playing missions.So, ultimately you have to buy the guide or keep your computer with you if you ever expect to get through this game. Which I am not a fan of because then there is no room for you to be creative at handling tough situations. My advice would be skip this game and go to the sequel.

{"product_name":"B00BGA9YZK","description":"","reviewerName":"Sreenadh","summary":"A Must Have for PS4 users","reviewText":"The original Killzone was impossibly positioned as a competitor to Halo; Killzone 2 and its infamous &#8220;target render&#8221; reveal video was caught between impossible expectations and the somewhat subdued reality; Killzone 3 squeaked out to little fanfare tied to the PlayStation Move; and Killzone: Mercenary is best known as the closest-to-a-console-shooter on the PlayStation Vita.Now, with the launch of the PS4, Killzone: Shadow Fall presents the best opportunity for a new beginning for the series. But that opportunity slips from Guerrilla&#8217;s grasp once again, this time under the weight of a poor campaign without a team to root for.Killzone: Shadow Fall takes place 30 years after the ISA forces of Vekta functionally rendered the planet of their enemies the Helghast uninhabitable. Perhaps taken aback at the sheer horror and devastation they inflicted, the Vektans have resettled part of one of their biggest cities with the Helghan survivors, where tensions simmer and eventually bubble over.There&#8217;s some grasping in Killzone: Shadow Fall&#8217;s premise toward higher social commentary and exploration of real world political drama, particularly the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. There are also strong echoes of the post-WWII socialist/capitalist divide of East and West Germany during the 70s in the sorts of maneuvering and secret police actions of both the ISA and the Helghast.Somewhere in all of this, there must have been a story worth telling, and like shafts of light in a ruined building, these bits occasionally shine through. But more often than not, they&#8217;re buried in muddy shades of grey. Killzone has always flirted and later actively courted an early-20th century sort of nihilism with regards to humanity&#8217;s predilections to endless, aimless war. Shadow Fall completes that cycle. Despite the beauty of Vekta and the extraordinary technical wizardry on display, the game does its absolute best to paint almost every character as an awful, irredeemable person engaging in an awful, hopeless cycle.As the story progresses, every offense by one side is one-upped by the other, further muddying the ugly history of the entire conflict even further. Well sure, the Helghast are nightmarish neo-Fascists, but they evolved that way after being used as human chattel by the Vektans and abandoned on a merciless planet. The Helghast violently arrest and murder anyone caught on their side of the giant demilitarized zone that separates the two societies, but the Vektan&#8217;s ISA forces are also coming up with ways to wipe out the entire Helghast race.This literally does not stop &#8212; even as the credits roll, Killzone: Shadow Fall finds another parting shot to underscore the ultimate pointlessness of the Helghast/Vektan war.It didn&#8217;t matter that Killzone: Shadow Fall&#8217;s script was full of awful, overwrought dialogue, plot holes, or general stupidity, or that the voice acting was frequently painful. If Guerrilla was trying to tell me that everyone in the conflict depicted across the Killzone series was irredeemable, then they succeeded. But it also did an excellent job of murdering any investment I tried to place within the characters or the plot. By the end of the game, I didn&#8217;t actively want any one side to win or lose. I just didn&#8217;t care.The tone and presentation are so oppressive that it&#8217;s almost an afterthought that Shadow Fall&#8217;s biggest problem is its deficit of fun.The basic gunplay isn&#8217;t much of a departure from previous games in the series. Aiming and shooting in Killzone has always been a more laborious process than in its first-person shooter contemporaries. Some of this is due to basic latency between the input on the controller and the game&#8217;s response to that input, but there&#8217;s a sense that Guerrilla has embraced this, whether it was originally intended or not. Weapons in Killzone: Shadow Fall tend to be large and loud and onerous. It&#8217;s part of Killzone&#8217;s sensibility.Definitely worth investing in","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2013"}

Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"Survival horror gets off life support!","reviewText":"Many survival horror fans have gotten jaded. They think the genre is dying and in one review I heard someone saying Dead Space was RE 4 in space. While dead space has similar controls as RE 4 and even an over the shoulder 3rd person view point it is NOT remotely similar to RE 4 in atmosphere or level design.For one thing,Issac is not a super elite mercenary. When the Ishumura planet resource harvester ship goes haywire Issac's job is to do some routine repairs. However there is a bit of worry right away when he receives an odd SOS from his main squeeze Nicole who is a medical officer aboard the space ship he is charged with fixing up. Luckily her message is so subtle and obscure it does not give away the whole story right away.Along with Issac is a tough as nails take charge leader type and a female crew mate who is the shiznet at hacking and cracking. While these characters \"help\" Issac through a holographic communications screen with advice our poor protagonist ends up separated from his team and completely alone.Dead Space is really good at telling you everything you need to know WITHOUT accessing a menu. Issac's health is measured by the glowing tubes down the spine of his armor and almost all information is relayed to him through a pop up screen device on his helmet he can manipulate at a whim. Likewise the crescent glowing icon on Issac's right shoulder gauges his \"stasis energy\" used to slow the opening and closing of malfunctioning doors. This makes Dead Space a more seamless experience and lulls you into a creepy train of thought of playing the game without always having the reminders it is a game.Much like Bio Shock Issac comes to terminals where he can buy equipment such as ammo, health packs, and even new weapons. Each main ability or weapon is upgraded by circular disks called \"nodes\" you apply at fold out work benches. Nodes are rare, luckily they can be bought as well albeit at a high price. Issac even gets telekinesis. He can move things around and toss them similar to how Gordon Friedman does with the gravity gun in Half Life 2. Add all this atop of using gravity boots to mag lock onto walls and ceilings when in zero gravity it quickly becomes apparent Dead Space is not a tired retread or lackluster clone of Resident Evil. The only similarities it bears is that it is a hybrid between action thriller and survival horror. Luckily for those of us who love a good scare it is more terrifying and surreal than it is cheesy and over the top epic.You can run and gun in dead space (further accentuating the differences between it and RE). As a matter of fact when hordes of necromorphs attack it is a good strategy to run backwards while firing away, or at least getting your bearings as you occasionally let fly with some sizzling plasma bolts.So what are necromorphs? Apparently after busting apart a planet for resources the Ishumura away team found an odd artifact with ruins on it. Somehow this began mutating crew members into monsters. While that is not very original as a concept Necromorphs make ganados and zombies look tame by comparison. Even after having legs or an arm blown off these hideous freaks will still come after you and sometimes they may play dead after you hammer into them with a few rounds. As you confidently twirl your plasma torch and turn your back \"wham!\" you get a bone blade appendage through your kidney for not being thorough. I wasted a lot of ammo to make sure I decapitated every dead body or slain monster. Call me paranoid but hey, I rather be safe than sorry!Each level has a series of mission objectives that range from refueling the Ishumura to recovering the captain's log. While these may seem a bit dull at least they make sense within a science fiction setting . In dead space you never have to find a ruby and an emerald then put them into the eye sockets of a gargoyle statue. Normally a puzzle requires using your telekinesis to move something or using a stasis shot to slow down a dangerous moving obstacle so you can past through into the next area.While dead space is gory it does not just rely on blood n guts to frighten you. Even when you are not attacked by necromorphs the ship's metal haul creaks menacingly and the voices of the dead are heard whispering in select locations. You even pick up data pad diaries from Ishumura's crew  and as you can well imagine their last moments were filled with dread and hopelessness. Witnessing Issac having to wrestle for his dear life while locked in the clutches of a necromorph is not nearly as bone chilling as helplessly watching the person who seems safe behind a window get impaled and dragged into the shadows screaming or having to look at a nurse cackling insanely right before she fires up a bone saw and cuts her own throat. You wonder who you have to pity more...the grotesque creatures or those who were left unaltered as normal human beings?If you approach all this from the optimistic perspective of an enthusiast instead of an embittered fan boy Dead Space is a wonderful horror game. As much as I covet RE 4 and RE 5 and herald them as awesome games they are \"thrillers\". Dead Space quintessentially is \"true dread\" pumped right into your veins. It's not toying with your emotions or trying to be something it is not.I began playing it in the day time and it still got my heart pounding. For the foolish elitist bigots out there unshakable in their stance that \"western developers\" don't know diddly about true horror this game has arrived to bust their chops!In closing if you have played these games for many years you're not going to jump from fright every 2 minutes. Once you become accustomed to scare tactics it can NEVER compare to the glory days when you were a virgin of the genre playing Silent Hill or RE 2 for the first time. However to me this game is so excellent at what it does it deserves some grudging respect from the survival horror community.Pros+Intriguing story+Unrelenting terrifying enemies that give their all even after their limbs fly off.+Atmospheric creepiness that balances out the blatant blood and gore+Easy to learn controls+Can run and shoot.+Things such as anti gravity exploration and using telekinesis \"mix up\" the usual horror experience.+No annoying menus to jolt you out of the fear. Every aspect of the game from your health to gathered information is all woven seamlessly into the technology of Issac's suit!+Issac's \"weapons\" are actually tools to start with reminding us he is a mechanic and not a steroid popping space marine.Con-It's a space ship so some areas get to look very much the same after awhile.-Reading text logs via Issac's holographic visor is near impossible. In my opinion everything should have been voiced.-Enemies are varied at first but get repetitive later on.Pro or con??+/- Issac is a silent faceless protagonist very much akin to the hero in Bio Shock, Gordon Friedman in Half Life 2, and Master Chief in Halo. To some of you this maybe a problem however my take on it is as follows.\"Issac doesn't talk but it is the very fact he doesn't spout cheesy one liners or ridiculous catch phrases that makes his struggle that much more realistic, horrifying, and genuine.\"+/- There's alot of gore, perhaps moreso than any other game I've played. Sadly those that pride themselves on loving \"psychological horror\" are going to snub their noses at Dead Space a lot for that reason alone and in so doing miss out on the parts of it that are very surrealistic, thought provoking, and haunting.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2009"}

Otherwise I would say that the game rates a 9.5 on a single player scale. Since I don't do multi-player, I can't say any about it.So help was needed to get through the doppelganger, but I finally managed finding my way through that portion. The video helped a lot.I found that the best defense was a good offensive move especially with the flamethrower guys. The limited amount of ammo at the beginning made one very conservative but with the onset of better weapons, the game became more to my liking. It was more enjoyable after I got more skills and learned what to collect and how to use every device.  Attacking seem to be the best way to get out of bad situations.Using the animal repellents got rid of those pesky animal attacks. Great when hunting.Using the hang glider was a high point in the game for me and the time trials were a definite plus in this game.  I liked the added money challenges, I needed the money to buy stuff early.I'm returning to the island for further go around segment. I'm looking forward to finding what I missed while playing the game.Feb 22, 2013Just finished 2nd level of game and learned alot from my first go-around.  Got the best weapons and upgrades by collecting the majority of loot for ammo and other necessities first.  Learned stealth and got pretty good at non-detection. Went for the quests that paid alot of money. With the money, got the weapons and upgrades for the best situations.Loved the AMR with exploding rounds; made my job of being detection-free while attacking the majority of outposts easier. Helped knocking off cohorts in Wanted Dead quests. Killing the pirate/s afterwards was much easier. Non-detection was a breeze with the shoot and scoot method.Saved many of the search for relics, letters and some other quests for last.Went first for getting all the RADIO TOWERS for free weapons.Loved the Untouchable syringe for no-death/60 secs. Made some sections a little easier to get through.Covered the coastal outposts first so wouldn't be bothered by too many roving patrols while traversing the coastal roads.Had to cover the knife fighting scenes partially so not to be distracted by the onscreen action, helped syncing the action buttons. Very tough section ever.Achieved all the Handbook/Progress but the 43rd weapon for me was the Ripper.The most apprehensive moments were the diving scenes in the shark infested waters. Reminded me constantly of \"Jaws\". Next were the Komodo dragons. They always showed up unexpectedly too often.And lastly, those dogs. I ended up just shooting them for spite. Lastly, hated the radio music while driving and turned that audio off.The game I purchased used with 3 former players and is the most riveting game I ever played. Its so intense that even I am considering shelving it too.I really got my moneys worth and if it only had the quests and mini challenges, it still would be worth the money. Felt like \"Indiana Jones\" in doing so.I thought the Mass Effect Series was awesome but I have rank this game as tops in my FPS Category ever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2013"}

The open world sandbox part of the game is fantastic and well done. The problem with this game is the story and the role playing aspects. The story is flat out boring and the characters fairly weak. Bethesda has shown their incompetence time and time again when it comes to creating a well crafted story. The ending to this game is absolutely unacceptable. It's rushed, tacked on, and doesn't make a bit of sense.Moving on, I feel like this game lacks good RPG elements. Sure, you can mess around with different play styles, but your character is essentially nobody. Your character is defined by the people around him. The game constantly tells you what's wrong and right. Who's good and bad. Who you can side with. What you should do and how you should do it. How is that role playing?

I am positive that a good number of players have enough experience to blow past this game with ease like the tutorial level in LittleBigPlanet. That doesn't go for everyone though.

Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience.

If you have not played it you are missing out on a great story and just simply an amazing engaging experience. I remember when the original Xbox came out and I got Halo CE for Christmas and I did not do anything else with my life for months to come, it was come home do my homework and play halo over and over again, not to mention those awesome old school LAN parties when people brought TVs over and everyone put in for pizza and spent the night at their buddies house. Then Halo 2 introduced us to the craziness of addictive online multiplayer then a campaign experience that totally rocked and took us for a spin.We forward to Halo 4 which to me brings back the kid feeling of the Original Halo CE and the fun Halo 2 multiplayer experience. This game from beginning to end grips you, there is no wanting to put the control down, it feels and looks amazing. Usually after I beat a game I am done with it and walkaway for weeks to months at a time, as soon as I beat this game I put it right back in and played it all the way through again and continue to do so. Haven't done that since Arkham Asylum, and before that Halo 1 and 2, and even back to Zelda Ocarina of time days. This game simply is a masterpiece so stop thinking about buying it, and just get it you will not be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2013"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E67A","description":"","reviewerName":"Jesterkloun","summary":"R3!! Get it!!","reviewText":"Resistance is a franchise that I have had a mixed relationship with, I loved Fall of man, was let down by #2, and as for #3...First I'll start with the weapons, AMAZING! To me this is what really makes the Resistance series stand out from the pile of shooters. The weapons are very inventive different and all offer fun ways to vanquish you'r enemies! The wheel is the coolest device for switching you'r arsenal on the fly right in the middle of a crazy firefight, it's smooth seamless and makes for tons of creative play on the players part. I honestly miss it while playing other shooters.The graphics are  good, the environments are what holds it back, a tad bleak and dull and even sometimes looking like last-gen. But the character models for the Chimera are gorgeous! This is where the attention was put and boy can you tell, the creatures almost leap off the screen they are rendered so well, in combat they really appear lifelike and I think it is spot on! The A.I. Is very good too. No covering in one spot to pick off enemies here. They will flank you, try to pin you down, and even rush you in a desperate attempt to take you down with them! Tons of fun!!The story so far I really love, we are loseing the war. As sad as that may seem it is refreshing to see a top tier franchise go out on this limb, to strive for something more then another hero story. You actually feel the desperation as the Chimeran Resistance changes their strategy from fighting to running hiding, and just surviving. But shortly I was let down by a weak narrative and not much depth into the struggle. The ending further let me down, I won't give it away but it was almost a game killer for me.  But it does have a nice dark desperate feeling, I just wish it was more prominent then it is and better fleshed out, I lost the feeling of desperation about half way through.So to sum it all up, it's a great game and well worth the time and money! The story is a bit weak and the ending is not what I desired but for some maybe what they wanted. Beautiful characters, fantastic gunplay and a nice long campaign to boot!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2012"}

They are the only games I know of that have all the features I want. First, you get to customize a lot more than in other games. You get to choose a name for your character, choose a race (fictional groups), customize his/her face, and change clothing during the game. Second, there are tons of weapons you can use, like bows, swords, maces, and more, or you can use a large variety of magic. Third, it's a real open-world game where you go at your own pace, walk around a large map, and do whatever you want. There is a main storyline you can do if you want, but you don't have to, and there are many side quests you can do or pass up as well. There are organizations (guilds) you could join or you can journey alone. As you progress, you customize your skills too. Do you want to specialize more in sneak attacks, like an assassin, or in more regular battle skills and sword action, or perhaps you prefer magic instead of conventional weapons? Even within the study of magic you can concentrate your skills on healing or destruction, among other choices. Another thing is that with one of the DLCs you can even build your own house. You can even get married or stay single in this game. You can be a `bad guy' killing random, innocent people, or a `good guy' helping people by defeating random thugs you encounter.  So I like this game because it's the most customizable game I know of and it's the most open-world as well, with a large map and many side quests.The game has good graphics that you expect, but I wish they were a bit better. They look as good as other games out right now, but since this is my favorite game I wish it had the absolute best graphics. I think maybe Gears of War might have the best graphics out right now (even though I don't like that game), but this game doesn't have as good of graphics as that, but they are still fairly good though.All these games are about the same but slightly different. The way you progress your skills is slightly different in this game compared to Oblivion. The main difference in this game is the new feature of learning Dragon words, which you can use as a special power. In this game, you are in the northern province of Skyrim, where it is cold and snowy, but there are some beautiful green areas as well. Skyrim's main population is the Nords (in this game, they remind me more of Celtic or German peoples), but you'll find all the usual Tamriel races up there too.I am sort of disappointed with the weapons. They are the same and work as good as in Oblivion, mostly, but I was hoping there would be more different weapons made from new materials. For example, there is a glass sword, like last time, but why can't there be a diamond sword or something new? There are some new surprises, like moon enchanted weapons, or whatever those are, but that will be left to be discovered. I also don't like how you can only wear one ring instead of wearing a ring on both hands. They got rid of the chameleon spells, and just kept the invisibility spells. This is good because the chameleon spells were unnecessary. And in this one, you can't turn invisible as easily, or at least I can't yet, like I did in Oblivion (felt like I was cheating a bit turning invisible when there was too much danger).This game is almost appropriate for all ages, it never using the 'S' or 'F' word, it doesn't even use other 'bad language', and sexual themes are more romantic than sexual and they are very tasteful and discrete, or more innuendo type. Like all games, the graphics aren't good enough to show enough violence, so this game doesn't have that much violence. It has more heroic battles. The dark brotherhood is rather dark, but even with their missions, you go out and assassinate people that are consider bad people to most people. There are werewolves, vampires, and some fairly dark wizards. Unlike Oblivion there aren't any random zombies walking around, now you can turn a dead person into a zombie instead, but they look mostly like how they did when they were alive.I like the medieval type theme, my favorite, but I wish there were other games too that had a different theme yet still included all the customizable features of this game, like a cowboy theme or a futuristic theme. No other game compares to this series, only once I played a Star Wars RPG video-game that was sort close to the rank of this game, but now the new Stars Wars games aren't very good anymore. So this game is the best, until there is another Elder Scrolls with better graphics.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2013"}

I have been playing games since the days of Atari and in that time have enjoyed more games than I could hope to name. My rule is: if it's fun, then I will play it. I play many mature rated games (e.g. Resident Evil, Gears of War, etc.), but am never scared or ashamed to pick up (and admit when I love) an E rated game.When I first saw the videos of this game in action I knew it was going to be a blast. It also looked like the perfect kind of game I could play with my girlfriend. Since she isn't a gamer to the same degree as me, she often quits playing any time a game frustrates her. I figured since this game was \"for kids,\" it wouldn't just be something that she could enjoy in her free time (did I mention she likes Spyro :P), but also something we could enjoy together.So far so good!Load times are quick. The game has excellent quality as far as graphics go. They are very colorful and detailed. The music blends in with the worlds. I haven't caught myself tapping my foot to the tunes yet, but haven't exactly been muting the TV either. The voice acting is excellent and the humor is very well delivered. We have chuckled a few times already. Kids will enjoy it too :)The controls are easy to pick up. You can perform pretty much all of your actions with just a couple buttons. They might frustrate on occasion as they lack some things that some might be accustomed to. The ability to strafe is not present and you would think just by glancing at the game that you'd be able to jump, but that too is not a function to be found. These things don't hurt the game, they would have just improved it is all :)My only real gripe is that the Portal of Power takes batteries. Normally I could let this slide, except that this particular add-on is lit up like a Christmas tree during game-play. I haven't played enough yet to suck the life out of the 3 AA batteries that came with the game, but I do not expect them to last long. I imagine that constant wireless communications with your system are enough work on just 3 AA batteries alone, so it really kind of annoyed me that they had to line the darn with all kinds of pretty lights. Kids probably won't get annoyed like the adults who actually have to buy the batteries. They didn't have to include an AC adapter in the box, but a port for one you could purchase separately would have been nice.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2011"}

Then Far Cry:3 Blood Dragon arrived. That game spiked my interest because of the 80s themed environment so I bought it day one and played through it until I beat it because it was so good. Seeing that the gameplay  mechanics were not the same as Far Cry 1 & 2 which was my biggest gripe and having enjoyed Blood Dragon so much and wanting more of it I wanted to see if Far Cry 3 was the same mechanics and found out the engines are identical in gameplay. It was a no brainer at that point so with Amazon having the game on sale for $29 I ordered.Game arrived yesterday,  I played for 12 hours straight which the only other game series I have done this with was Fallout and Blood Dragon. The enviroments are obviously different then Blood Dragon but the gameplay is the same. It is also massive in size and I can see this experience clocking in 50+ hours easily and loving every min of it.So if you were brought here because you have played Blood Dragon and wanted to know if Far Cry 3 played the same, now you know that is a yes.  But story line wise this is obviously very different and has a very dark serious story line compared to the funny and cool Blood Dragon. Doesn't however make the game any more or any less fun. They are both worthy of your dollars and time.Enjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2013"}

I spent 70+ hours on the first play-through and I am in the second round. It is a fun game, but it can be better. There are hits and misses:The hits are definitely the graphics, the combat system, and the dialog wheel. The graphics are gorgeous. Battles are spectacular, especially if one plays Hawke as a mage. If a player wants to experience combat as a warrior or rogue, he/she can easily switch control from Hawke to his/her other companions. The tactics table is a very good idea, with which the player can program the combatants not under player control to response in certain ways under certain circumstances. The player character is fully voiced.  The dialog wheel is taken from Mass Effect; the icon indicating the emotion conveyed by the dialog choice is new.  When used properly, the dialog wheel delivers a seamless and continuous dialog.  It is superior to the dialog system in Dragon Age: Origin, where the player character is silent and the dialog was chosen from a restaurant style menu.The misses are undoubtedly the smallness of the game world and the uninspiring story. Battlefields are used again and again - after one sees the same mansion or cave for 13 times, one gets very tired of it. The entire game, including the main quest, seems like a series of little side-quests strung together. There are a few twists and turns in the main plot, but the overall story is bland. It was as if EA, after spending a ton of money developing the combat system and the graphics, decided that they had to scrimp on the story and the game world to stay on budget. All is not lost, however, if EA will build on the good things they have done so far and expand the game world and improve the script in Dragon Age 3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2011"}

Prepare to experience an RPG unlike any other. Welcome to the world ofShadow Hearts.","reviewerName":"\"bosley83\"","summary":"Shadow Final Fantasy after my Heart","reviewText":"To start off with I believe that it is important that people realize that the company that made this game, Sacnoth, was orginally a part of Squaresoft and thus the game WILL seem like a Final Fantasy clone.  I will admit right away that it seems like Final Fantasy but bear in mind I am relating it to the good Final Fantasy's.  That is before the movie replaced the game (which happened shortly after 7).  You are a half Russian-half Japanese, hence anglo features, named Yuri (japanese name).  You can morph into monsters and can pretty much kick anythings rear-end.  The heroine is named Alice, she exorcises demons (White mage) and is very very good at it.  Yuri has to protect Alice, yadda yadda yadda, you have an RPG. A new feature called the Judgement Ring has been introduced.  Basically you see the ring whenever you do anything in battle other then defend or run.  The goal, hit all the colored areas to score hits.  Interesting to say the least and kinda fun, the challenge lies in hitting a thin blue strip in the colored areas to get more powerful hits (not criticals the game decides those) you get three and you get a perfect.  The ring is also used when buying things (yea discounts) and certain story events.  Also introduced is SP, or sanity points.  Just like real-life getting into a battle can grate on someones nerves.  Every action a character takes in battle lowers their SP one point.  When they get to 0 you go berserk until a party member can raise your SP for you.  I find this to be very realistic as those characters who are not accustomed to fighting monsters (who is) will go berserk faster because of that fact while those who have been doing it all their lives couldn't really give a rats tail.  Also the more monsters you kill you kill the more the 'shadow world' starts to dislike you.  This is called Malice, and every once in a while you need to go to the Spirit Graveyard (you get more monsters to morph into here) to cleanse the Malice or the Reaper will come after you.  And he is not fun to tangle with trust me.  The story could have been better, it is there but not great but at least it isn't because the game is 3/4 movie scenes that the story lacks.  The story lacks because the characters really aren't brought to maturation.  They are introduced and then never really are finished, with the exception of Yuri and Alice.  However it does take many unexpected (and some very expected) plot turns that keeps the player on his/her toes.  Now to address some problems that seem to be popping up.  First, the game is based in China for the first third of the game so of course the people would have Chinese or Japanese names.  I don't think that Yuri is going to walk down the streets of Shanghai and meet a Chinese native worlock (wizard) named Tim.  He will be named Dehaui.  A female in the Japanese army seems extreme in the early 1900's yet note that her father is the General and not only that she is not well liked by some of the men.  So that does kinda cover that problem.  The game is rated M, for violence, gore, language, and heavy sexual induendo (that should be on the box I don't know why it isn't).  So don't be surprised when you see the gory beginning.  Face it 'black magic' is not all posies and butterflies.  It is dark and evil and destructive and it doesn't kill 'nicely.'  Don't whine about it when you are warned before hand on the box.  I like this game flat out.  I like this company.  It is proving to understand the PS2 software better than SquareSoft is at this moment and until Squaresoft gets it's act together and starts making games instead of movies, Shadow Hearts will always beat out FFX for which RPG I am going to play.

Despite the absence of co-op for now, the career is engaging, the music is good, the music has stylistic versatility, and each song is a new kind of challenge (speed or rhythm). The guitar responds well to your motion. even though the star power may be sensitive, it works better when sitting because you can stay in your playing groove when activating star power. Hes how I rate the game from individual catergories.Graphics 3/5: Not much improvement and not available in 1080p.Solo gameplay 5/5: Fun, engaging, and versatileSong selection 5/5: very well done, good new and old music. If you dont like classic rock, the bonus songs have harder (emo, metal) and more experimental alternative music. Classics and fun surprises.Multiplayer 0/5: sadly unavailable at this time unless you buy two bundles wasting you $60 on another game.Depth 4/5: Without multiplayer, the game has many songs but too much paralellism between difficulty levels. Customizable features are adequate, buy unimpressive.Bugs 5/5: In an age of sickening bugs (no pun intended) this game has just about zero major bugs and glitches (have noticed any minor ones either). Well done by the makers to test their game, but they didn't test their sales strategy.Overall 4/5: The exclusion of a seperate controller is shocking and head-scratching, but activision released a fine product ready for the marketplace unlike some games these days. brilliant job of selecting songs and making gameplay fun, challenging, and long lasting.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2008"}

Two decades ago unlimited lives and saving checkpoints would have sounded absurd to those who had to memorize level layouts and perfectly timing jumps and attacks (see Mega Man, Castlevania, Metroid, etc.). Now, those kind of features are expected, indeed it seems as those games that don't hold our hands are critized as being somehow poorly designed or flawed in their execution. That is what makes this game stand out. If you are one of those people who believe that games have lost their edge or aren't nearly challenging enough, then this game is precisely for you. I will warn you that the combat controls and heavily strategic nature of the game make it prohibitive difficult. As such, it should come as no surprise that many professional reviewers give the game relatively low marks (I believe some years ago X-Play gave this game a 2/5).The game is built around a combat system which is reminiscent of Valkyrie Chronicles. The game combines elements of real-time and turn-based battles. In explanation, the game may seem easy, but in execution it is incredibly complex. The combat system does take a long time to get used to, but after you get the hang of it, I think fans of strategic gaming will really enjoy it.Beyond a complicated combat system, the only drawbacks the game has are the overuse of the same enemy designs, and as it type of most JRPGs, the plot is basically nonsensical. However, I think the look of the game is pretty interesting (sort of a steam punk victorian era). Additionally, I thought some of the side quests were really fun (especially when the characters dress up as reindeer and elves, and then deliver presents to children). Finally, while the characters aren't very developed, most of the dialogue and delivery of the voice actors during the cut scenes are hilarious.Overall, I think this is a great game for old-school JRPG fans who want a more challenging experience. However, make no mistake the learning curve for this game is ridiculous.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2013"}

Aikens","summary":"madden10 reaches for the sky but falls far too short","reviewText":"Let me start off by saying that I was never that big of a fan of madden, but i loved the 2k series before EA bought the exclusive license to have the NFL teams and Players. So with that being said it has taken a long time for me to give a madden game what i would consider a fair shot. I actually had quite high hopes for this year's madden and it ended up dashing most of those. Let me start off with the positives...the actually game play is great. Now on to the bad. The game is hampered by its horrible presentation. If a five year old last generation game could do a competent halftime show with competent play calling then how is it that EA puts out this garbage. The halftime and postgame show offers no highlights and the voice over work is atrocious. I also couldn't find an option for turning it off and to skip it you have to skip like 5 things...which wouldn't be that bad but you have to listen to the voice over work each time and it is hard not to laugh...because if this is EA trying then we football fans are in trouble. The play by play is also uninspired as it gets repetitive fast. The actual play by play guy fails to convey any emotion whatsoever and chris collinsworth does his best but after hearing him say the same sayings over and over again I was ready for him to shut up as well. Another thing that is highly irratating is the the constant measuring for first downs that is unskippable and that uses the one of 2 preset graphics over and over...so in other words you can tell if you got it by which angle the camera is at but yet you still have to watch the same exact thing you just watched on the last first down play. The stupid ref scenes continue with Touchdowns...again there are 2 set scenes. One would not think presentation would not be that big of a factor...heck the graphics for the most part are fantastic although some of the coaches look deformed, but the other stuff is just too hard to take after playing a superior quality title that came out years ago. The game felt like an unfinished product. Madden has felt that way to me for sometime as they add new things and take out other things(such as the drills...which i enjoyed) the game keeps running in place. They need to just improve upon what they have and they could make a great football game but then again....people wouldn't keep buying it year after year if it didn't steadily improve each season. Although NCAA football sells great and it is by far a superior game just because it seems more finished and refined...maybe because they leave it the heck alone. I lasted about 3 seasons in my franchise and I couldn't take anymore. The game became frustrating because i wasn't able to turn off or skip a lot of the junk in the game. Another thing that didn't help was the imported draft classes didn't include my players from UAB (I like a challenge so i build up the bad teams on NCAA football) even though i had 2 heisman winners in 2 seasons, it also had random stats for the players that were imported so it kind of makes importing worthless.  The online play was good but not great. The other thing is the EA money grab of dlc which btw i have no problem with as long as its the type \"cheating\" stuff like heal an injured player...you know things that some people may want but are not necessary...to make people buy the game to have an online franchise or pay 10bucks extra if they have a roommate that wants to play one on their own gamer tag is just bad in my opinion. I bought the game but have several friends who rent for blockbuster or gamefly and refused to pay to have an online franchise(which is unfinished as well btw as the trade system is really screwed up) which meant that no online franchise with my friends which really sucks. Regardless if you want an up to date football game with real rosters and teams this is what we are STUCK with. Like i said it could be worse the gameplay was great for the most part but everything else makes MADDEN10 a lackluster experience.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2010"}

It is a lot like Grand Theft Auto, but you have some differences with the setting and a couple of other things. It does take place in Hong Kong, so most of the setting deals with Asian triads and that sort of thing. One major thing that sets this game apart from GTA and Saints Row series is that you play as a double agent. You are a cop going undercover pretending to be a gang member. The fighting in this game is a lot like Batman Arkham City. It is a lot of fun. The driving felt a little weird at first, but it was good. The story gets more interesting as you progress. Be aware that you being a cop does matter because you can't simply just keep going around killing random people and doing \"bad\" things without having your \"cop reputation\" go down.

{"product_name":"B0009VXAM0","reviewerName":"J. DEATS","summary":"It's the games that will save PS3, not the hardware.","reviewText":"Fortunately for Sony, history tells us that a game consoles success is based largely on the games available for it. The PS3 has an excellent lineup of launch titles this year and plenty of good games to come next year, so on that alone you may want to buy one and there's nothing wrong with that.My problems with PS3 and my reason for a two star rating has to do with the technology itself. Sony isn't withholding information, but there are details they aren't telling you. That truth can be found in what we've seen in these first run PS3 games and facts about consumer electronics in general. Perhaps the processing power has just met its threshold, or maybe  game developers are just capped out, but looking at some of the racing and sports titles (both good examples of graphic/performance), last years XBox 360 and the PS3 seem neck and neck. This could be because game developers are using the same 3D models for both systems, the same \"render engine\" to produce the effects, etc. In short, it's the same story we've always had with the two leading consoles since the Genesis and SNES. The graphics are in the same ballpark, it comes down to the games.So when comparing the PS3 with the XBox 360 (comparing both 20-GB hard drive models), the question becomes \"are the PS3 games worth an extra $100\"?The XBox 360 is ahead of the game with their library of titles and on-line play options and Microsoft is doing some really innovative things like making the XBox 360 the first \"open\" console so that hobbyist game programmers can download all the development tools they need and run homebrew games on the system. If you're more the geek type, the XBox 360 is hands down your system.If you compare the PS3 with the Nintendo Wii, right away you're looking at a very noticeable different in graphics quality between these systems. Nintendo opted for innovation (unique \"3D\" controller) over performance, if you think about it like cars. The PS3 is like a $140,000 Ferrari, the XBox 360 is like a $90,000 Dodge Viper and the Wii is like a $60,000 Hummer H3. Like a Hummer, the Wii doesn't fit the same niche as the PS3 and XBox, it's not a \"high end\" system it's a \"fun for the family\" kind of system and that's what makes it the dark horse to win back a large market share for Nintendo and that market share will probably be deducted from Playstation or XBox.Regarding Blue-ray. It' mostly hype and here's why: The High Definition media format war is still new. Blueray and the other competing standard, HD-DVD just surfaced, the motion picture companies are split about down the middle. Sony owns the Blueray format so naturally they are pushing it.  I'm completely against them forcing Blueray on PS3 customers. This sort of cross marketing has failed time and time again when applied to video game consoles (for history lesson see Phillips CDi and also the Panasonic 3D0, both horrible failures world wide.) Sony should know something about media format failure from their Betamax video tape technology) When we moved from video tape to DVD, there were a number of compelling reasons to do so: compact size of media, no rewiding, interactive menus, bounus features, 5.1 theater sound, greatly improved video quality. Notice video quality is only one attribute. The jump from DVD to HD-DVD and Blueray only benefits the consumer in one of these areas, video quality and... that benefit can only be enjoyed by High Definition television owners and.. (it gets better), that benefit is also difficult to even detect on many High Definition sets. You can see the difference on 1080p capable sets, but not much else and the question is is that incentive enough to start replacing your entire movie catalog? Based on economic principle, the answer is NO.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2006"}

It's a little disorienting at the very beginning as habit kept making me look for the ways to switch two, but it didn't take very long to adjust.  While I play around sometimes in the basic mode just lining up the jewels, I really like the challenge mode best though, which turns the Bejeweled into a more seriously thoughtful puzzle game by requiring you to figure out how to arrange a particular chain of events.I've also allowed both my mother (in her 50s and not normally much of a gamer, though she does like the regular Bejeweled and Bejeweled Blitz) and my nephew who's currently 6 and has played Bejeweled Blitz to try it it out.  They both happily spent time playing it and gave it rave reviews.  My nephew was actually begging his mother to let him stay another day when he was visiting me because he wanted to keep playing, and the next time I saw him he was immediately begging to borrow it again.It's a good sign for any game when it manages to keep three generations of players happy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2010"}

There's ARs, Shotguns, Pistols, a rocket launcher, and one sniper rifle. There needs to be more variety. In total, I'd say there are between 8-12 guns.- Some other small annoyances that I won't get intoEven looking at these problems, I have to say that this game is probably THE best on the Vita that I have played.

Is the ability to play this your friends and family with shells, stars, bombs and everything else flying across the screen.  It's no wonder that MK holds such a place in the rankings for everyone.

They serve their purpose but are mostly forgettable.- After completion, the game allows you to replay each mission with all upgraded weapons and suit abilities in tact.:(- There's a glitch that causes npc's (non-playable characters) to get caught in animation loops that has them repeating themselves in one spot over and over again.

There's nothing against the other brands (unless they're profoundly horrid), but as the PlaySation was my first gaming system, I suppose I'm slightly biased.What makes this DualShock better than its predecessors is that it adds SIXAXIS technology--which allows for slight in-game motion by tilting the controller.  Other than that, there's really no other bonus featu--oh, wait.  The fact that it's wireless is awesome.  That may not seem like a big deal, but for someone who's been using this controller since it first iteration, playing it without a wire is fantastic.  And it's lightweight, too.There are, however, two gripes I have with Sony's newest version.  First, I HATE the new L2 and R2 buttons.  I prefer the tactile \"punch\" that the rest of the buttons have, so having these two buttons similar to GameCube's L and R buttons really drives me nuts (that's the only feature I hate in GameCube's controller, too).  There are, however, some Dual Triggers available for $5USD on Amazon.com (and brick-and-mortar stores), so those help out.My other gripe is the charging system.  The USB charging cable is much too short; I have to sit at the edge of my bed when I do this, and when I turn it off, I have to remember to keep the PS3 on during charge.  It's a stinker that Sony requires the system to stay on whilst charging a device.  That wastes much more electricity than need be.But other than those gripes, it's a great controller.  To me, it's the \"perfect\" controller because it rests comfortably in my hands, and all the buttons are easily within reach.On to get a second!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2010"}

J Lewis \"Miss Amii\"","summary":"After 15 Years, Bards are Still Spoony","reviewText":"Here is a blast of nostalgia for your Gameboy Advance. Final Fantasy IV Advance aka Final Fantasy II aka Final Fantasy IV Hard-Type is a treat for old-school RPG players. Back in its hayday, Final Fantasy IV was the gold standard for what an RPG should be. The first in a series of remakes of that wonderful streak that was the SNES Final Fantasies, Final Fantasy IV is back and better than ever.The story is as good as it ever was. Final Fantasy 4 did what Final Fantasy 2 (Japanese numbering) tried to do: mixed a well developed story with memorable characters with good if simple gameplay. This is the story of Cecil the Dark Knight who renounces his loyalty to the corrupt kingdom of Baron. Baron has been making war against the other nations of the world to capture four elemental crystals. When his king commands him to kill the innocent, Cecil sets out on a quest to make things right that will take him around the world, to the center of the earth, and to the moon. As he unravels the mystery of who is really behind the actions of Baron, he is joined by a cast of over ten playable characters. Each of them has a reason to join the fight. Characterization may not seem much by today's standards, but this game was made in an age when Square believed less was more. You revealed a motive once and then you moved on instead of going over and over the same psychological problem again and again.Unlike the Playstation port that had absolutely no upgrades beyond its retranslated script, FF4Advance has a few minor visual tweaks. Some of the game sprites seem to have been tweaked abit to have more definition and character portraits have been redrawn and put in the dialogue boxes to indicate who is speaking. Most of the new portraits are fairly close to the old ones, Edge's and Rydia's are actually an improvement, but the new one's for Rosa, Paladin Cecil, and Edward in particular aren't so nice to look at. There are also two new dungeons and the ability to tackle the final boss with any of the other (still living) playable characters than with the fixed party of five like in the original. All of these new features are very unobtrusive so you can take advantage of them if you'd like the extra challenge or ignore them altogether. Instead of using the script from the original release that contained numerous spelling and grammatical mistakes and was censored due to Nintendo of America's then extremely strict guidelines, FF4A contains a more accurate revamped version. Of course, the \"You spoony bard\" line has, thankfully, been left intact. It's a classic.If not for one issue I'd say that this is undoubtedly the best version of the game available. Final Fantasy IV was a really hard game. FF4A is not that hard at all- at least early in the game. I don't know if the difficulty was scaled back because they thought that people didn't want to waste GBA battery life on hours of leveling up or because I've played this game many times before, but it just seemed too easy. Anyone whose played it when it first came out should remember at least super tough boss battle be it Baigan, the Magnus Sisters, Evil Wall or something else. This time through they where like a cake walk. Also it seems that the Active Time Battle is set up in such a way as it gives your party the advantage. Your party seems to regain their turns twice as fast as the enemy. About half-way through the game, that legendary difficulty starts creeping back and by the final trek to the core of the moon you'll be thankful for any break the game will give you.Final Fantasy IV shows in this port that it stands the test of time. Instead of feeling hoary, old, and outdated, it feels just as much fun as it was fifteen years ago.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2006"}

Fulkerson","summary":"Very cool game with room for improvement","reviewText":"I've read some reviews of this game on Amazon, and most of them do a good job of talking about the strengths and weaknesses of Killzone 2.  For the most part, this is a fantastic game.  The graphics are top notch, the sound is incredible, and the controls are tight and smooth.  Several reviews I saw complained about controls being sluggish, but I had absolutely no problem adapting to it, and I'm somewhat of an intermediate when it comes to first person shooter games.  I typically get bored with war games in general, and this one held my interest all the way through!  The gameplay is just awesome, and it really sucks you into the experience.The typical flaws of war games are all here:  bad voice acting, cliches flying past your head faster than the bullets, and an extremely weak story.  But these are forgiven because, hey, it's a war game!  You need to go into it expecting these types of flaws, and thus, it's not such a let down.The few gripes I have about Killzone 2 are things I definitely hope get fixed for the next installment, should they make one.  One thing that seriously bugged me about this game was the character of Rico.  My GOD, he was annoying!  Constantly chattering, saying the same stupid stuff over and over again, and getting himself killed every 30 seconds.  I understand there needs to be some other characters besides yourself, so I hope they are more interesting than guys like Rico in the future.  What really annoyed me is Rico getting killed every time you turned around, and when you revived him, he'd start yelling at you to \"shoot straight!\".  Uhh, dude, you're the dead one!  Shut up, and get firing already.  The AI in general could be annoying as well.  The level where you need to blow the towers was frustrating because each time you'd try to run down a stairwell after setting the explosives your own guys would be standing there blocking your way.  Little things like that take away from the flow.I haven't had any problems with the online play, so I recommend trying it for sure.  The maps are cool, and offer something different than the normal play-through.All in all, I really enjoyed Killzone 2, and I don't normally get into war/shooter games.

Players will find familiar names like Glass Joe, King Hippo and trainer Doc Louis. These boxers come to life again in cell-shaded 3-D, complete with hilarious fighting animations and backstories that capture all the fun and flair of the originalPunch-Out!!games.The Wii's Motion SensitivityThe motion-sensitive controls of the Wii console mean that when players throw punches, Little Mac throws punches as well. Additionally, you can control hooks and jabs by combining motion control with control-stick movement. The motion-sensing Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers turn real-life swings into on-screen punches, so anyone can play. The game can also be played with classic NES-style controls by turning the Wii Remote sideways.CharactersPunch-Out!!features a total of 13 opponents for Little Mac to step into the ring with. 12 of which are returning from previous games in thePunch-Out!!series. Each have their own backstory and patterns of attacks to learn and learn to counter. Just a few of the characters you can expect to see are:Little MacSmall but extremely game, Little Mac is a young, up-and-coming fighter, who with the help of his trainer, ex-champion Doc Lewis, has set his sights on working his way through the ranks.Glass JoeA fearful French fighter due to his extremely weak chin, Glass Joe will crumple to the mat quickly with just a few well-placed shots, making him an easy mark and a good warm-up for the fighters to follow.King HippoKing Hippo is both huge and an immensely powerful fighter, but can be weakened with the right combinations to the head and body, giving you time to go for the knockout if you can survive his onslaught.Von KaiserAn old-timey fighter whose rumored childhood difficulties have left him eager to dish out punishment in the ring, Von Kaiser is a dangerous opponent, but one who will turn tail if you can find his weakness.Special AttacksPlayers can obtain special 'Star Punches,' which allow Little Mac to take more health from his rival in a single punch. Players can now use multiple stars in a single punch for an extra-powerful attack.Controller OptionsPunch-Out!!features multiple controller options. For players looking to take advantage of the Wii's motion control capabilities,Punch-Out!!uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers to simulate throwing punches. Use the Nunchuck to throw a left punch and the Wii Remote to throw a right punch. Fans of the NES version and core gamers will be excited to see Nintendo has also included the option to playPunch-Out!!using the classic layout from the original NES controller. Use the 1 and 2 buttons along with the cross pad to throw hooks and jabs or to dodge.","reviewerName":"TheRumblePack.com","summary":"If you have a slight masochistic streak and enjoy old-school pattern recognition, Punch-Out!! is your game","reviewText":"From Bald Bull's signature charge to Little Mac's pink sweatsuit, everything from Nintendo's original Punch-Out!! is iconic. For many nostalgic gamers, the series - comprised of the NES game (originally endorsed by Mike Tyson) and its under-appreciated Super  sequel - is just as revered as Nintendo's more prolific franchises. It remains a mystery, then, why everyone's favorite diminutive pugilist has been kept out of the ring for the past 14 years. But Little Mac and crew are finally back. And while the controls remain unchanged, this update still manages to eclipse its classic predecessors.Nintendo has had success in the past farming out dormant characters to outside developers, most notably with Retro Studios' Metroid Prime trilogy. However, I was skeptical when it was announced that Next Level Games would be reviving Punch-Out!! for the Wii. The original game was great fun, so how would a modern sequel beef up the feature set without muddling the series' simple charm?Well, my fears were unfounded, as Mac's timed dodges and counter punches proved surprisingly versatile. Rather than add a bunch of new attacks to the player's repertoire, the developers instead chose to build upon the returning opponents. For example, Soda Popinski was always a bruiser, but now he'll actually take out a soda bottle mid-fight to regain health. Don Flamenco still taunts you, but once you knock off his toupee, he becomes much more aggressive.At the same time, the three circuits will still seem very familiar to series veterans. Among the game's 13 main boxers, only one of them, the flamboyant Kid Disco, is a new contender. However, once you claim the championship belt, the \"Title Defense\" mode opens up. It's at this halfway point that the game cements itself as one of the absolute best on the Wii. After Little Mac knocks out all of his rivals, they all head back to the gym and pick up even wilder fighting tactics.For instance, King Hippo wises up a bit in his second bout. Rather than leave his bandaged navel open to attacks, he tapes a manhole cover to his stomach. This forces you to figure out how to remove the layers of tape before you can do any real damage to him. Almost all of the fighters receive similar gimmicks, such as a squirrel sidekick for Bear Hugger and headgear for Glass Joe. Title Defense mode captures the more outlandish spirit of Super-Punchout!!, making the Wii sequel the perfect synthesis of both games. It's truly remarkable how much mileage Next Level Games is able to squeeze out of such a basic engine.It certainly helps that the game looks as gorgeous as it does. The boxers are all cell shaded and frequently take up most of the screen. For fans of the original games it's a real treat to see that many of the fighters have retained their signature animations. Super Macho Man still has dancing pectorals, Bald Bull still does his chicken dance when he knocks Mac out, and Soda Popinski still cackles menacingly whenever he gets a chance.Speaking of which, the voiceover cast also deserves praise for bringing each character to life. All of the international fighters speak in their native tongues - without subtitles. Though all of the rival boxers are blatant stereotypes, the introductory and between-round dialogue is so silly and over the top that they never manage to offend. (However, some critics, including Scott Sharkey of Retronauts fame, have justifiably expressed concern that Kid Disco's spandex costume and lisp feel out of place).With this cartoony veneer and a throwaway two-player mode, more casual Wii owners may be under the impression that this is a Wii Sports boxing revamp. This could not be further from the truth, as Punch-Out!! is also unrelentingly difficult. The motion controls are ill-suited here, as absolute precision is required to stay competitive.For many fans, this is exactly for what they have been hoping to see. If you simply want to pummel characters into submission, you should probably look toward a Smash Bros. title instead. However, if you have a slight masochistic streak and enjoy old-school pattern recognition, Punch-Out!! is your game.--Reviewed by Justin Hemenway","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2010"}

E Jackson","summary":"it's Mario","reviewText":"My main complaint with Super Mario 3D Land is... what's new?  After Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2, this game comes up drastically short in comparison.  I mean does this game do *anything* better than the Galaxy series?  I can't help but feel the majority of these levels (at least 85% of them) are WAY too easy.  Trust me, if you've ever thoroughly explored the Super Mario Galaxy series, this game offers nothing original, creative or worth replaying a second time.  Many of these stages feel designed for people who've never experienced Mario in a 3D environment and desire something simplistic to get their feet wet, so to speak.That's not to say the game is bad mind you (I *do* believe a 3-star rating is above average after all).  I admire the updated Boom Boom fights.  Let's be honest, when they first appeared in Super Mario Bros. 3 they were WAY too pathetically easy.  Stomp on Boom Boom's head 3 times and he's done.  Now -in a 3D environment- he's more dangerous, though only slightly (again, the game is easy for the most part).  The overabundant green platforms in this game are similar to the ones you found in the Galaxy series.  In fact some of these stages look directly stolen from Yoshi's Star Galaxy (SMG2 level) with the piranha plants, goombas and exceptionally colorful environments.I suppose I shouldn't have raised my expectations so high going into the game.  It's a 3DS game and not meant to be in the same category as a Nintendo Wii game or other high profile video game console.  To be positive for a moment, fighting Bowser is extremely fun, fast-moving and challenging (the one circumstance when you will probably lose several lives).  Not a bad game and in fact, let's say Super Mario 3D Land is basically Galaxy Junior.  This game can be finished in a few hours and that's just unacceptable in todays world.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2013"}

Featuring spectacular songs like the Rolling Stones' \"Paint It Black\" and Metallica's \"One\"; Guitar Hero III also features selections from Santana, ZZ Top, Pearl Jam, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Smashing Pumpkins, Dead Kennedys, The Killers, Social Distortion, Iron Maiden, Slayer, Dragon Force, and the Sex Pistols among others; helping make this installment of the game be all the more memorable.  What hurts Guitar Hero III though is that the third time around, the game doesn't feel fresh anymore, and Activision and Harmonix haven't really done enough to make it all that different from Guitar Hero II.  There's higher difficulty this time around for experienced players, but getting there is a different story that casual gamers won't come close to getting towards.  Not to mention that the battle modes and boss battles aren't all that interesting or fun either. There is more great XBox Live support though, but it should also be noted that there is a heavy amount of in-game advertising as well, which as you all know by now, is more annoying than anything else. Negatives aside, Guitar Hero III is still a very fun installment of the popular rhythm series, and this installment has the best track list yet.  Let's just hope that next time around Harmonix and Activision do enough to spice up the formula.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0094MYU4M","description":"","reviewerName":"D. Everts","summary":"Lacking in key areas.","reviewText":"I want to mention a couple things right off as they had me thrown for a bit after I first got this headset.The little guide that comes with it lists the parts you should have and one will be missing.  Its a cord called PC Stereo Adapter in the manual. The little plastic stickers that usually let you know the box hasn't been open were open when I got it so I thought my product was used.  However, after opening it you could easily tell that the headset had never been removed.  So I got on the web site and found the digital version of the manual and it is TOTALLY different than the one I have in the box.  It doesn't show that cord that is missing in my and doesn't recommend hooking said cord to your PC along with the USB cable as well. So for some reason they decided to remove that cable and I was never able to find out why.  The headset still works fine on my PC though. They went through the trouble to remove it so in my opinion they should have removed the manual that shows you what is in the box and how to hook it up.The other thing that threw me right off the bat, was the fact that you have the cables for optical out and whatnot, however you can \"NOT\" use them for the PC.  They are only usable with an Xbox 360 or PS3.  I was surprised by this. Why would you make a surround sound headset that is capable of optical connections only work with the consoles and not the PC.  As it stands you are limited to a USB connection for your PC and regardless of anything else this means that the surround sound will be simulated instead of properly driven. Likely a deal breaker for many PC users.So after those first bumps in the road I proceeded to get the headset setup on my PC.  These things are very nice looking.  They look like high quality equipment. However, after having spent some time with them there is one glaring problem and for me its a deal breaker regardless if the entire package was stellar.  This headset is \"NOT\" comfortable.  The part that goes over your head looks great.  It appears very nice and padded, so at first glance you would think nothing but good things about their comfort. However, on the underside of that band, the stitched part that looks all poofed out and padded, is anything but padded. All that is there is a thin layer of fabric, stitched for looks alone, and just under it is a hard bar or rod or something that connects the two ear cups together.  After less than 20 minutes of use my head started hurting.  I had to try to adjust them so that the bar did not rest on my head at all, which then of course leads to ear discomfort as the headset is never properly secured to your head.  In my opinion for the price of this headset, this should absolutely not be an issue.  One funny thing about this is that you can't feel the bar from the top of that band, indeed it feels more padded up there where they put their logo than it is for your head. I have literally taken some fabric and wrapped it around the top and then secured it with tape. Its the only way that I can wear this headset without getting a headache.  A brand new, expensive headset with fabric taped to it so the padding is sufficient?  Thats not good.  I have the Diablo 3 headset as well, and while the set is much much cheaper and lacks some of the features, its super comfy.  If you have never seen that style the part that touches your head is detached from the part that holds the cups together.  This band is soft and the only part that touches your head.  Lots of headsets use this style and is is very comfortable.  The thing is, these would be too but they just didn't put any padding in there.Moving on from there the audio settings are complex and have a lot you can do, the only problem is they barely explain to you what the settings are and I had to look online to find out how to use the thing.  After some time the audio control unit, I do feel like its not hard to use, however it will take some time getting used to it.  To be honest though, I found that anything other than the preset number 4 is useless to me.  They have all these settings like one that makes footsteps louder than the rest of what you are hearing for shooters and whatnot, and other settings for preferences, however in my opinion every single one makes the headset volume seem way to low even on the highest setting.  Preset 4 is sufficiently loud however and doesn't need to be turned all the way up.  One thing you can do however is make your own presets, but I have yet to be able to do this as the program they keep telling me I can download links me to their forums where I can not find any download for the program.  I am sure I can probably find it elsewhere but to be honest, something like this should be automaticly easy to get when you go to their site.The audio quality and bass in the preset 4 though are very good.  I can tell the difference between this headset and others I own.  I really like the sound quality.  Which makes me sad as all the other issues just take away from the entire package that I can not justify using this headset over others that I own.If you're going to use these on the PC, save your cash for something else that can actually hook up proper and the surround sound.If you're going to be using these on a console, I would say you're going to get quality sound, and I bet the surround is very good when true and not simulated.  I can tell you this though, be prepared to pad this thing with some extra padding yourself, because you won't have them on long before you will want them off your head.I also want to note that this headset will connect with your phone so you can answer calls while using them.  I was not able to test this feature.  Sounds cool though.EDIT:  I have discovered an issue I never noticed before until just after I posted this.  There are two headsets on this product page.  The set I have is the Ear Force XP Seven.  The box says it, the manuals say it, the plastic piece on the cover of the cups even has the MLG Pro sticker.  However, the headset itself looks like the one for the M Seven.  The band that goes over your head is just like the picture for the M Seven, and not like the picture for the XP Seven. The padding on the cups in the picture for the XP Seven looks different too.  This is weird and now I am worried that someone did a switcheroo on these before they ended up with me.I am going to look into this further, but please take that into account with my review as the comfort on the set I have is bad, I can't speak to a headset with a band that looks like the one pictured for the XP Seven.  It is possible that those pictures are just digitally done and not indicative of the final product, but I don't know at this point.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Van Wagenen","summary":"Don't listen to the reviews without \"Verified Purchase\" tag!","reviewText":"The Xbox One is an excellent follow-up to the Xbox 360. While not perfect, it is a solid machine that I think will be many times more reliable than the original launch Xbox 360s. I have owned each redesign of the previous generation of consoles, so am approaching this review from an objective, non-fanboy context, having a good basis for comparison.What I like:+ The dashboard is integrated WAY better than the Xbox 360 and PS3. There is no longer the feeling of \"in a game\" or \"in the dashboard\". You are ALWAYS in both. Say you are in the middle of a game but want to spontaneously change a system setting or launch another app etc. Both the 360 and PS3 had some semi-dashboard functionality built into the dashboard/home button, but most everything required you to first exit the game and go to the dashboard (aside from some shortcuts to go straight to a different game). Now, you press the dashboard button and without interrupting your game in any way, you now have access to the full dashboard and settings, etc. There is really no such thing as being required to \"quit\" a game anymore, which is awesome.+ The HDMI-In is definitely a unique feature to the Xbox One that Nintendo and Sony's consoles can't touch. It's not for everyone; you might not care about it. But it certainly opens up some neat possibilities. Any other HDMI-enabled device you may be interested in using can be switched to and from at a moment's notice. I plugged my PS3 into mine, not for the purpose of gaming (since there is a tiny bit of input lag), but to be able to have a game disc in my XBO and a Blu-ray movie in my PS3 so I can switch without removing the game. I could certainly live without the HDMI input, but since it's there I may as well experiment with some interesting ways to use it.+ Speed. I always was surprised that through the entire life of the Xbox 360 (including the 360 S and 360 E), there was an unacceptable amount of lag on many core dashboard functions. Something as basic as showing your list of games, or list of gamerpics to change to, or achievement lists, or loading marketplace screens, would often take several seconds or waiting to populate. The Xbox One's startup is acceptably fast, but could still be improved on, but basic things like loading marketplace content or my list of installed apps, achievements, etc, is very quick. Switching between game and dashboard is no longer the slow annoyance it used to be, but rather is nearly instantaneous.+ Day One bonus: Vanity \"Day One\" achievement, sleek black \"Day One\" box (instead of green), and \"Day One\" inscribed on included controller. The value of these may range anywhere from zero to a lot, depending on the person. But I personally really like these small perks, and ultimately pushed me to pre-order the console instead of wait a little bit and likely end up still paying the same price.+ Dashboard Layout: The Xbox 360 dashboard was too cluttered and poorly organized, in my opinion. There were many different 'sections' to scroll through with LB and RB that made it take longer than necessary to get around. The Xbox One dashboard only has three now, it's much cleaner and simpler. Your pinned games/apps, main section to switch back to currently in-use game/app or browse your other apps, etc, and the third section is for browsing/downloading new games/apps. Very easy to navigate. I also like the notification and achievement changes. You can earn 0-point achievements in random apps, like for watching videos and such. It's admittedly pretty pointless, but if you don't like the idea of pointless achievements, you can easily ignore their existence.+ Built-in game DVR. Very cool feature that removes the need for external recording equipment for anyone interested in that. Even if you don't plan on using this feature, it could still benefit you in the form of more & better guide videos from other people that will likely be swarming onto YouTube.+ I obviously can't speak for everyone else, but my Xbox One console, controller, and Kinect, all function flawlessly and had absolutely no issues.What I'm not thrilled about:- Launch line-up. If you are on the fence about buying the console and you're not immediately sure what game(s) to even get for it, you could easily wait it out a while longer. Forza 5 and some of the multi-platform releases are pretty cool, but I'm not sure they're $60 cool. If you are buying the Xbox One now, you're doing it for the novelty of being among the first to have a cutting-edge system. This is true with the PS4 as well. Anybody who swears by any of the launch game is just a fanboy drone. There are a handful of *pretty good* games for both systems, but I see them as more of $30-40 titles. Honestly, I've enjoyed the downloadable Xbox One games the most. Killer Instinct is free-to-play with one character, or $20 to unlock all the characters. KI has some good nostalgia-factor for anyone who liked the old SNES/N64 games. The $40 premium version will even unlock the original SNES version of the game too. Crimson Dragon ($20) and the new Kinect Sports game (free, 1 sport only for now) are also good, inexpensive launch games to try without investing a lot of money.- There are not yet many ways to show the system off to your friends. The games are nowhere close to pushing the graphics to their limit. The cars on Forza 5 are gorgeous. But Call of Duty and any other multiplatform release will disappoint as far as graphical difference between 360/PS3 and One/PS4. But that's expected, and happens with every new generation. I'm sure the exclusive games further down the line will be much more graphically impressive (Gears of War, Halo, etc.)What I'm neutral about:* The Kinect: Luckily, you aren't required to even have this plugged in so it's not a big deal. But you are forced to buy it with your console anyway, so you might as well find out what it has to offer. The voice commands are *kind of* cool, but I'm still more of a controller person. I prefer to navigate with my fingers than with my body or voice. I'm glad they made the new Kinect look a little bit neater than the 360's Kinect though. It does have a very much improved camera though. Skype calls with the Kinect are awesome (though outside of the novelty & testing factors, I probably won't use Skype that much). When the full version of Kinect Sports Rivals, and other games designed specifically for Kinect are released, I will probably see more of the value it offers. But for now: eeehh.* The console's physical design: It actually looks very nice to me. But it does have a small amount of boring-ness to it. It's just a big black box, basically. The key will be to keep the glossy part free of scratches and dust. Glossy consoles are notorious for aging much worse than matte consoles. It's also quite a bit bigger than the Xbox 360 redesigns (but on par with the launch Xbox & Xbox 360 sizes). But I do have to say, I am very glad they are taking precautions to avoid the overheating issues of the launch 360s. The giant cooling heatsink/fan inside, and ample ventilation room inside this ominous monolith, will make it much more reliable and less susceptible to failure; an acceptable trade-off in my mind. I'm sure down the line there will be a smaller version of it. But I didn't want to wait 3-4 years to get it.Xbox One vs. PlayStation 4 vs. Wii U:Strangely enough, despite the criticism of its library, I have gotten a lot of mileage out of my Wii U from a lot of the first-party titles Nintendo has put out. I would say that although none of these consoles have an expansive library of triple-A games yet, the Wii U definitely has the most games worth buying at the moment. It also has the advantage of being the cheapest system. The trade-off to that is the power of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, which greatly exceed that of the Wii U. Both XBO and PS4 are honestly very close in their real-world power. Is one more powerful than the other? Probably to some extent, but I find it irrelevant since there is such a small difference between their raw computing capabilities. On-paper analysis is pointless, at the end of the day, the games will determine which is the best. And right now my ratings as far as game line-up is: Wii U - 6.5/10, Xbox One - 4.0/10, PlayStation 4, 4.0/10. They all have a long way to go. Price-wise, obviously the Wii U wins, PS4 is second, and Xbox One is last. It really just depends on what you want. The PS4 has had some bad press with manufacturing issues though. So for reliability I'd rank Wii U first, then Xbox One, then PS4. We'll have to wait a few months though for a clearer consensus on Xbox One & PS4 reliability. What will really matter is what the game libraries look like a year from now.The bottom line is this: It's a great console with great potential, but as with most launch consoles, the games just aren't quite there to back it up, YET. If you are on the fence over the console because of the 360's launch reliability, I would honestly not let that hold you back on this one since Microsoft learned a very painful & expensive lesson from that, and designed a much more reliable console this time around. If you are waiting because you're unsure of the game library, you may be justified in continuing to wait. I honestly just got it because I knew for sure I would eventually get it anyway when Halo 5 comes out. But it the price is holding you back, you may have to wait YEARS for this to become affordable. So if you are okay waiting that long, great. But otherwise you might as well get it now so you can actually use it while you wait for the game library to improve. Chances are, there won't be any price cuts on it for at least a couple years, and the price cuts aren't usually anything significant until around 4-5 years after launch. So if you have the patience (I didn't), definitely wait. But since I am 98.4% sure the price will still be $499 when Halo 5 comes out, I figured I may as well get it now along with the extra pre-order perks.A solid system; I definitely do not regret my purchase.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

This is a game that probably took 24 months to design, and you can tell, hard work and sweat was put into this DVD disc. This game is so realistic, it is the next best thing to actually buying and driving a car.If you play this game, you will be blown away. Even though this game is more than a year old, it is still fun to play. The graphics are incredible. It is over a year old, and newer games that are released recently such as Sega GT 2002, Burnout, and Project Gotham Racing are newer, but they don't even drive in the same league. Gran Turismo 3 is about absolute freedom to do what ever you want with you car. You start out with $18,000 to buy any car you can afford. You see that you cannot afford the \"big dog\" cars like Lexus, BMW, Cadillacs and others, so you have to buy other cars. Some choices are PT Cruisers, Volkswagon Beetles, Mazda Miatas (excellent choice). You buy a car, you can put things on it such as light-weight bodies on it, which make the car lighter, and easier to turn around sharp curves. You can buy special tires to go over every type of terrain, you can buy more effective brakes, turbos to make the top speed faster, new hubcaps to make it worth more, new engines to make the car more powerful, and to raise the horsepower and more. You can customize the color of your car. The more competitions you win, the more money you make, and the better cars you can buy. Even if the car isn't a luxury car, it will still win races. A one of the best cars we have is a Ford Mustang, with a top speed of 187 mph, 400 little horsies under the hood, 2 stages of light weight bodies to help turning. The farther you progress, the more cars you can buy. You can learn about cars too. They give you tons of information, including top speeds, horsepower, size, weight, wheel size, transmissions, and more.Just to keep it simple, you need to buy this game now! You have no excuse not to buy it, because it was declared a Greatest Hit, and it isn't that expensive anymore. This game can be purchased without putting a dent into your wallet.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2002"}

Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would.

The reason this game is not up to par is the dumbed down candy graphics in place of more atmospheric shading(as PCs are capible of) much as the 60's was to movies as opposed to the Tahiti look of the 80's I see PC games have gone down hill as well(as ported console gaming noobs can play 'em) the dumb black guy last night speaking of Gearz Wars or sum such proves it.  I think FPS is awsome only if the AI, is just that(Inteligient) and the driving takes place behind the dash, not above it in 3rd person mode.  Halo is not a bad game, the rings of the planet are spectaular but in a PC game you can do more atmopshere and less comical lighting(more on the lines of Quake/Doom(ext scenes) less on Far Cry cool island shade \"don't worrie be sappy\".  The interiors are also very sqalid and not realistic as in having a purpose(as in control consoles and view screens and the like) Hell, the bloody space ship you dump from is just a big army truck(in space) what a droll troll de mondain.

Johnson \"Pyrochaos\"","summary":"A Must Buy!","reviewText":"I like Kinect Adventures and all, but this is the game that should have come with Kinect.  Every single game is fun, and it's a huge workout!  Every single one of the sports is fun, and playable through Xbox live.-Soccer.  This is pretty easy, but still pretty fun.  I would have to say it's my least favorite game on Kinect sports.  You basically are just passing when a team mate is open, and shooting a goal.  Not really running around or anything.  The mini game version of Soccer is pretty fun, where you are trying to score as many goals against goalie as possible.-Volleyball.  This is the most fun played with multiple people.  Either on the same team, or against each other.  But be careful!  If you get to into it, you may jump high and accidentally spike your ceiling lamp or fan!  You can do small jumps, and they will register as well.  The mini game version of this involves hitting as many volleyballs back as you can.  With your feet, head, legs, ect.-Bowling.  Probably one of my favorite games on Kinect Sports.  It's pretty accurate, and feels completely different than any other motion control bowling out there.  It's only playable 1v1 or 2v2 over Xbox live, or 6 players( I think) on 1 screen.  The mini game involves throwing many balls down the lane and trying to get as many pins as possible.  It's also fun to use your left and right hand to throw a ton of bowling balls during the mini game.-Track and Field.  Another one of my favorites.  This will probably give you the best workout, as it consists of 6 different events.  The 1st is 100m dash.  Which you basically run in place.  It may sound boring, but when you are against a friend, and you're neck and neck, you really push to get that lead.  I felt like I was going to have a heart attack from this cause I tried to run so fast.  The 2nd event is a Javelin throw.  This involves running, then throwing the javelin.  Once you get the hang of it, you can throw it pretty far.  The 3rd event is a long jump.  Which is pretty hard to win against friends, because if you wait too long to jump, you get a fowl.  The forth even is a discuss throw.  Somewhat similar to the javelin, but you don't run before you throw it.  The last even is the hurdles.  Another \"Feel like I am going to have a heart attack\" event.  It's similar to the 100m dash, but you have to dump over hurdles!  Heck of a workout, but I'll be damned if I'm going to let my friends beat me.-Boxing.  At first, I didn't get boxing, and just threw my hands around flailing like an idiot.  Well that didn't work too well.  You can basically block high, or block low.  You can hit low, or hit high.  But depending on how far you bring your hand back you will either do a jab or a hard punch.  You can also uppercut.  It takes a good mix of blocking, and hitting to win.-Table tennis is basically table tennis.  You can't hold your hand in the spot and flick your wrists, like you can in Wii Sports tennis.  You have to swat like you're actually hitting a ping pong ball for it to register.  It's not very active, but a good sport to wind down from almost passing out from track and field.Overall, the support of Xbox live just adds to the fun.  The computer has different difficulties if you want to play against it (trust me, on the hardest the PC is hard!) but the game is most fun when you play against or with people.A must buy for any Kinect owner, in my opinion.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2010"}

Nguyen","summary":"awesome sports game!","reviewText":"Kinect Sports is the Kinect's version of Wii Sports and it is one of the games you should have for the Kinect.  If you're looking for a modern version of Wii Sports, Kinect Sports is just awesome.  I loved Wii Sports to death.  The key difference is that you will definitely move around in Kinect Sports like no other game.  For example, you can be literally diving toward the ball in volleyball or jumping in the air to perform a spike smash.  I have not sweated like this in a long time.  You can't just reach out with your arm and be successful in any of these events. It's absolutely a great party game and not only does it have great single and multiplayer for a party, it has online play so you can take your athletic skills to the Internet.Note that you should clear space so you don't hurt yourself.  I thought I moved the table away far enough but when I dived for a ball, I banged my shin against the table.Upon booting the game, you have 3 main categories to choose from:  Party Play, Main Events, and Minigames.Party Play is for when you have 2 or more players and you break up into 2 teams to compete against each other in a series of minigames.  You can dress up as a number of costumes such as wearing a shark outfit or as a clown.  Party play cannot be played by a single player and there is no online multiplayer in this mode.The main events can have up to 4 players and has online multiplayer in addition to single player and local multiplayer (people at your house).  The main events include soccer, bowling, track & field, boxing, and beach volleyball.  Note that if you choose track & field, you must complete all the events which include the 100 meter sprint, the discus, hurdles, javelin, and long jump.  If you want to do individual track & field events instead of the entire medley, you can access them in the minigames section instead of the Track & Field main event.Now once you choose the soccer or beach volleyball main events, you are presented with 3 options since these are teammate events:  1) play against a computer opponent, 2) play with someone cooperatively, or 3) play against someone.  With the other main events, there are no teammates so you either play against the computer or you play against someone.If you play against a computer opponent, there are 4 skill levels: beginner, amateur, professional, champion.  Beginner is very simple.  The computer doesn't really try to win.  They'll just keep the play alive.  This mode is for people to learn the gaming mechanics and for children to play.  The computer is not very smart and if you're above the age of 5, you should win without losing any points.  At the professional level, the match play can become very competitive and you will be getting a lot of close matches with some wins and some losses.  Champion level is for the elite athletic gamers.  Strategy and physical skills become critical to winning at this level.  Unfortunately, unless you're in the prime of your physical life (late high school/early college), it'll be hard to have the physicality/reflexes to keep up with the computer.  You can compensate for slower reflexes with cunning skill for some points but at this level, you really need a good combination of reflexes and strategy.  I think most people will play at the professional level.Soccer can have up to 2 versus 2 humans with the rest being computer players.  You basically either play as a striker, a defender or a goalie.  The position of the ball will determine which position you are playing.  When you are goalie, you'll be using whatever part of your body to block the ball.  So you'll definitely be stretching out, moving, and jumping to block.  When you are in the field, the ball will be at your feet and you can pass in 3 directions toward a teammate or you can shoot toward the goal.  A typical sequence is something like pass, pass, shoot.  There is no running around.  You are trying to pass from player to player and then try to shoot in the goal.  You have to make split second decisions as there won't be much time to decide where you want to kick before the ball is taken away from you.  If you see your teammate streaking for the goal, you have to get it to him in time.  There is some decent strategy such as kicking toward an empty part of the field and letting your teammate run to it.  The normal rules of soccer are in play.  For corner kicks, your teammate will kick it to you and you can head the ball in or kick it in depending on the height of the ball.  As a defender, you have to guess where the opponent is going to kick the ball and you have to try to jump in front of the ball.You can kick across your body, kick strong side, kick weak side.  Kick with the point of your foot.  Kick with your foot open faced.  Once you get adept at it, you have some decent control over the ball, especially the shot on goal.The irony is that soccer should have the most movement of all the events (except track and field) but in gameplay, it has some of the least movement.  The great part of soccer is that it takes away the tiresome mundane running aspect of it.  But if you think this means this is a leisurely game, you are definitely wrong.  You will be doing quick darting moves to block the ball or to get the ball to your teammates in rhythm.  I grew up in the United States so soccer/football is not a major event for me.  However, I had a lot of fun with this game, especially as the goalie.  Being a scorer is fun too.  Being a defender is not fun and it's more guesswork than anything.  For me, soccer was a good event but it's not the reason to own this title.The next team event is beach volleyball.  Let me preface that I grew up in Southern California (the land of beaches) so beach volleyball is very second nature to us and rivals football and baseball as grade school/high school events.  I had a lot of fun with volleyball.  Especially if you know the rules and strategy to beach volleyball, you'll have an amazing time.  If you don't know the basic strategies of volleyball (as a lot of people have never played volleyball), there are on-screen prompts on when to hit the ball or when to jump to spike. But if you depend on the on-screen prompts, you won't have long term success because the prompts are a little slow. For example, when you see your teammate perform a set, you should already be jumping to perform your spike.  You shouldn't wait to see the jump instruction or else you'll be a little late in your spike.  But if you play as if there are no prompts and play just as if it's real volleyball, you'll be super successful.And since the game tracks your whole body, you literally have to move! To reach some balls, you have to really go toward the ball! You can't just stick your arm out there. And to spike you actually have to jump! And you can do jump serves as well.  To do a jump serve, you throw the ball up and then jump and smash the ball.Strategy does come into play in this game.  If your opponents approach the net, you try to spike over them.  If they stay back, you just barely dunk the ball back over the net so they can't approach it in time.  It's first team to 7 points and you have to win by at least 2 points to finish the game.Table tennis is just plain awesome! You start by holding your hand out on your hand side.  For example, if you're left-handed, you hold your left hand out.  That becomes your paddle side.  It's actually important where you stand in relation to the table. You can't just swing your arm. If the person hits a ball wide, you actually have to step or jump to the side to reach the ball.  For serves, I stand closer to the table.  For return of service, I stand farther away from the table.  The trick you have to remember is that your hand is not the paddle.  You have to think of your hand gripping a paddle (so your hand is in the shape of a fist).  You can direct shots toward any part of the table depending on how early or late you hit the ball.  You can impart top spin by having an up-and-over motion or slice by performing a downward motion.  As rallies get longer and the ball gets faster, you'll be using slice to try to slow the ball down and change the pace or you can just get the paddle in place without actually swinging it just to block it back.  You really do feel the ebb and flow of a rally.  It just feels great.  Strategy becomes key especially against players who have better reflexes.  For example, you should try to keep the ball on the opponent's backhand side since most people aren't as adept at their backhand motion.  Winner is first to 11 points and you have to win by 2 points.Bowling is another event that is a winner.  I was a huge huge huge fan of Wii Sports bowling.  Let's start by saying that if you like Wii bowling, you'll love the Kinect version. Since the Kinect is tracking your entire body and its position in the lane, it's harder to lock in an easy strike like it was in Wii bowling.  In Wii bowling, once you figured out how much you wanted to click to a side and a consistent motion, it was easy to get a strike.  In Kinect, if you want to stand closer to the left side of the lane, you just step leftward.  You can pivot your body or your arm.  There is a light indicator on the lane (where the lane arrows are located) that helps you indicate the direction your ball will travel.  Since the position of you in the lane depends on where you're actually standing, it's much harder to find the exact spot you want to bowl from like it was on the Wii.  The Kinect is pretty flexible in how you can bowl.  Everyone can bring in their own bowling swing and once you get the feel for how you want to bowl, everything just feels great. I bowl with spin and finesse. I start off in a crouching position, I bring back my arm as I'm striding forward I swing forward, upward, and toward my shoulder to impart some good spin.  Now, you can't take multiple steps toward the line like in real-life bowling.  But you can do the entire motion of that final step like in real-life bowling.  My brother bowls straight with power (you can see little flames around the ball when he bowls). It just feels awesome.  If you get a strike, a clip of a pop song will play which will pump you up.  And there's plenty of cool little touches.  Such as if you throw the ball high and it lands and cracks the wood.  Or if you throw the ball a particular way so that the ball double bounces.  Or if you throw the ball into the crowd and they gasp as the ball is heading toward them.  Not all your Wii bowling habits can directly transfer over to the Kinect version.  But once you're in the zone and powering toward that 300, you'll love Kinect bowling just as much.Boxing is an intense event.  I'm just not very good at boxing.  Maybe because it requires conditioning, reflexes, and strategy above what I have.  You have multiple types of swings ranging from the upper cuts to the jabs to the haymakers.  You can block high or block low.  The advantage of the block is when you are successful at a block, it increases the strength of your next punch.  So if someone is wailing away at you, you block them to build up super strength and you can knock them out with a single punch.  The trick is being able to block so it depends on part strategy/anticipation and part luck if your opponent is adept at going from high attacks to low attacks.  At the beginning difficulty levels, the computer doesn't put up a battle.  You can wail away as if you're 5 years old and knock out the computer very easily.  But at higher levels, if all you do is offense and wail away, you'll be giving major power to your opponent and if they get in a blow, you'll be down for the count.  When you get knocked to the ground, you see stars.  The first knockdown, you'll only see a couple of stars.  Each subsequent knockdown, you'll see more stars.  To get back up, you have to punch out all the stars before time runs out.Boxing is the most difficult sport for me because I've never been a good fighter on any level.  I was horrible at all the fighter games (Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Tekken, etc.).  I have a problem with when to be on offense and when to be on defense.  So not having the mental strategy will affect your physical strategy in boxing.Track and field is a series of events including discus, javelin, sprint, hurdles, and long jump.  These are mostly physical events.  The faster guys will dominate.  Strategy is not really part of the track and field events.  The key for the speed events is to have high knee lifts.  The faster you do the high knee lifts, the faster you run.  Rapid baby steps won't help you.  Picture a little dog shuffling his feet really fast versus a human walking with bigger strides and you'll realize that big strides is far more important than how fast you move your feet.  The long jump is you sprinting toward the line and then jumping straight up to do the long jump.The throwing events are by far the hardest events in the game for me because it'll take you a long time to figure out how the game wants you to throw.  The tutorial isn't very good for the throwing events.  While the people that figured out the gaming mechanism can throw 100-140 meters, people like me can only throw 30-70 meters.  I still can't get a consistent distance.  The discus is you grabbing the discus, twisting toward a side, stepping forward, and throwing the discus.  The far harder throwing event is the javelin where you run with the javelin in hand and then chuck it as far as you can.Now, the minigames bring a lot of life to all the events.  Minigames allow 1 to 4 players.  There are only single player and local multiplayer.  There is no online multiplayer in the minigames.  If you want to learn the game mechanics, minigames are the best way to learn them.  For example, playing the table tennis minigames will teach you all the nuances of how to swing your paddle.  When you first start playing the main table tennis event, you often are just hitting the ball back without much control.  But once you do the minigames, you'll have far more control over placement and pace of the ball.  Playing the bowling minigames will teach you all the nuance of your bowling motion such as when to release the ball.Note that there is a free party pack download for Kinect Sports that added some extra games to the minigames and Party Play.  You should download that now even if you don't have the game yet but plan to get the game eventually.  Who knows if it'll be free indefinitely.There are 3 soccer minigames available:  1) super striker, 2) super saver, and 3) target kick.Super striker is the corner kick.  Your teammate will kick the ball toward you and you have to head the ball in or kick the ball in.  This is a pretty fun event where your teammate will perform a corner kick and you have to receive the ball and either head the ball into the goal or kick the ball into the goal against the goalie.  This minigame is not about actually doing the heading motion or the kicking motion.  It is a reflex event.  You have 3 lives.  Either your teammate will kick you a soccer ball to score or will kick you a soccer shoe which you are to avoid.  You try to accumulate as many goals as possible.  If you miss a ball or if you get hit by a shoe, you'll lose a life.  You have 3 lives.  There will be an on-screen indicator to tell you where the ball will be heading.  So as your teammate sends you balls and shoes faster and faster to you, you're constantly moving around to head/kick the ball in while at the same time dodging the shoes.  You are literally going to be moving quickly left and right to get to the ball in time while also ducking the shoes and jumping over them.  As you get a higher score, the balls come faster to the point where a ball or shoe is coming every second.  It really get crazy.Super saver.  You are the goalie trying to prevent goals.  Computer kicks penalty kicks.  If you block enough kicks, you can earn extra lives.  Once lives run out, game over.  This is a reflex/endurance test.  As your score gets higher, the computer is kicking in faster repetition to the point of kicking a ball against you every split second.Target kick is more a strategic event than a physical event.  You are kicking the penalty kicks against the computer, trying to knock out bullseye targets.  The trick is to trick the computer goalie to jump to the side so that you can hit the bulleye target behind him.  You try to hit as many bulleye targets before time runs out.  If there was a relaxing event in Kinect Sports, this is it (of course, the most relaxing event in Kinect Sports is bowling).I liked the soccer minigames more than the actual soccer main event.  Partly because you have a high score for each minigame that you can strive for.  Partly because it's a better workout since you have to duck, dodge, aim, and move a lot more.  And I like how you're given multiple lives so that one bad move doesn't end the game like in some other minigames like table tennis.There are 3 bowling minigames.The first is called Pinvaders which is a parody of space invaders.  The pins will advance toward you and you have to use bowling balls on your left hand side and your right hand side to knock down the pins.  You are bowling with both hands.  The strategy comes from the fact that they don't refill the bowling bowl immediately.  So if you throw the ball astray you have to wait for the next ball during which time the pins can advance and reach you before you can knock them down.  And the pins advance in waves, not a smooth steady conveyor belt-like progression.  So when the alarm sounds, the pins will jump forward like a few feet.  You'll be side stepping a lot.  You have to figure out are you going to throw both the left and right balls at the same time (leaving you with no balls to throw until it refills) or throwing one at a time so that you always have a reserve to hit pins that you missed.  Pinvaders is where I learned about the position of your wrist and whether your hand is open-hand or not.  You see, I'm left-handed so throwing out of my left hand was normal.  But the ball kept being stuck to my right hand and I couldn't figure out how to release the ball until I figured out I had to have my right hand open-faced and then flick my wrist up to close-face the hand.  That released the ball from the right hand very easily.One bowl roll is an event where they strategically place some pins in front of you and you have 1 ball to knock them down.  Usually it's an arrangement of 3 pins but it varies both in configuration and number of pins.  You have 5 lives.  You lose a life if you don't knock down the pin arrangement.  This is the bowling event that takes the most skill.  You have to really know how pins will fall.  It's not like you can miss balls and then clean them up in a spare.  You get one shot or you lose a life.Pin rush is by far the most exhausting bowling event.  Your job is to knock down pins as fast as possible before time runs out.  As soon as you clear the current set, a new set will appear.  Balls will be available as soon as you throw the ball in your hand (as opposed to Pinvaders where there's a delay to refill the ball).  Here, like in Pinvaders, you are bowling with 2 hands again.  You can throw 2 balls at once.  You can windmill the balls.  Whatever strategy.  Just keeping knocking down pins as fast as you can.  You don't have to wait for the ball to hit the pins down the lane.  As soon as you throw, grab another ball and throw.  You have to strategize.  For example, if you throw 2 balls at the same time and they hit each other, the hit can cause the balls to careen toward the gutter instead of going down the lane.  So you may need to offset your throws so the balls don't hit each other.  Your strategy will change on the fly.  You do get a small time extension bonus for rapid knockdown of all the pins.The Track & Field minigames are the most basic of all the minigames.The unique minigame is called Rapid runner.  Here, you are sprinting around the track from green zone to green zone.  The green zones are intermittently placed and while you're in the green zone you can rest for a couple of seconds.  Then sprinting to the next green zone.  Time is ticking down.  If you get to the green zone, you get some added time.  Once time runs out before you get to the next green rest zone, game is over.  You will be gassed in this event like no other event since it's almost nonstop sprinting that is only ended when you can't run fast enough to get to the next green zone.All the other minigames are just the individual track and field events (discus, hurdles, javelin, 100m sprint, and long jump).  If you wanted to do the javelin without all the other T&F; events, then minigames is the only way to do that.There is one boxing minigame called King of the Ring.  This is where you have to rack up as many knockouts as possible before time runs out.  What happens if that you are boxing against an opponent.  Once you knock him out, you rotate in the ring and face the next opponent.  If you're great at boxing, you'll do great at this minigame.  But if you're like me, you'll struggle in this minigame.  It's exhausting because you have to really get in the punches to get a lot of knockouts.  If you're slow an methodical, you'll only knock out a couple of guys.Beach volleyball has 3 minigames.In Fruit splatter, you have fruit and bombs are launched at you.  You have to hit the fruits to earn points while avoiding the launched bombs.  So you constantly be going from ducking and diving away from the bombs while trying to hit back the fruits.In body ball, you must hit the object with the designated body part (head, hand, feet).  If it says to hit the ball with your head, you have to use your head.  As you progress, it gets faster and faster.  At high speed, you'll see graphical icons flashing on the screen like \"head\", \"head\", \"hand\", \"foot\", \"hand\", etc. and if can't keep track of the rapidly incoming objects and you hit the object with the wrong body part, the game is over.Bump bash is like dodgeball except you don't get to return the pain to them.  A bunch of guys are on the other side of the net throwing objects and you must avoid all thrown objects.  So you'll definitely be ducking, diving, and jumping.There are 3 table tennis minigames.Target smash has a set of scrolling targets.  The first layer is worth 1 point, the layer behind it is worth 2 points and the furthest layer is worth 3 points.  To rack up a lot of points, you can need to strategically place the ball back so that you break the first two layers to get to the third layer.  When you hit 3, a big explosion occurs to break a bunch of targets.  If you just hit the ball back, all you can hit are 1's which don't deliver many points.  You have to accumulate as many points before time runs out.  For me, this is the worst event of all the events in the game because I'm terrible at this event.Paddle panic is actually one of my favorite minigames.  You will definitely be feeling like Forrest Gump.  You have a paddle in each hand.  The computer opponent will be sending balls at you faster and faster.  And you get points for getting the ball back in play.  So at higher speeds, you are swinging both arms and you totally get into the Forrest Gump mode where you're almost windmilling the paddles.  The feeling is amazing and you totally feel in the zone.Rally tally is where you have to maintain a rally.  You have 1 paddle.  As the rally gets longer and longer, the ball gets faster.  The only way to slow down the ball is to slice.  The computer tries to trick up your rhythm by also slowing down the ball on occasion.  This minigame is super tricky and can be frustrating as you try to keep up a high pace and rhythm to return the ball but the computer throws in a slice which causes your timing to be off, ending your rally and game.  The computer is pretty smart to try to change the pace.Whew!  That was a long review.  The bottom line is that Kinect Sports is a fabulous game!  Rare is a company that is known for the little details in the gaming mechanics as well as the construction of a game.  For example, when you're at match point, you feel like you're in a movie.  The crowd noise drains away.  All you can hear is your heartbeat and breathing.  The play slows down a bit to simulate that championship point.  To hear the heart beat and the breathing on a 5.1 stereo system was just amazing.  You also hear the heartbeat/breathing effect when you have the chance to bowl a turkey.  It amazingly builds the tension.  Rare even put in a funny light-hearted event where you're standing in front of a stadium audience.  If you raise your arms, the crowd cheers.  If you point to the audience, that section will stand up and cheer.  So if you move your hand across the audience, they'll do the wave where they stand up and sit down.  If you point toward the sky, you see fireworks exploding.  If you clap your hands, the stadium will clap with you.  When you're getting ready to do the 100 meter sprint, if you reach into your opponent's lane and try to touch the person, the person will jump back and tell you to stop touching them and to get back in your lane.  It's little touches like these that bring the humor.There is an online leaderboard ticker so you can see your friends' high scores on all the minigames and compares it to you.Rare also has a Facebook app so you can join international leagues for competition.  And you can see your friends' high scores on any events.  You can even see how many times you played each event and all the little details like how many spikes in volleyball you had, how many strikes you did, how many times you played table tennis, etc.  It really is an impressive stat keeping app.  My friends can see how pathetic I am at throwing events.Note that during all the events, the Kinect is recording videos of your play.  You can either upload these videos to your private account or not upload them.  Luckily (or unluckily), the videos do not save to the 360.  So as soon as you go on to the next event, if you didn't upload it to the Internet, it will be erased.Another cool thing is that you can stream your own music from your 360 or from your PC during Kinect Sports.  Being able to play all my MP3s from my PC just made the game that much more fun.  Playing some thumping dance music while I was in the zone for Paddle Panic is just a moment you have to experience yourself.Out of the first generation games, you have to have Kinect Sports and Dance Central.  They'll provide you an amazing experience and workout.  But if you want a real exercise game, Your Shape Fitness is a good one.  If you guys have any questions, hit me up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2010"}

Playing as a futuristic soldier with the ability to supe themselves up to almost superhuman capability thanks to a drug called Nectar.  While this little feature does manage to add a bit of spice to the overall gameplay aspects of Haze, as a whole the game doesn't offer up anything that hasn't been seen a million times before in a million other first person shooter's, or for that matter, do much of anything particularly well either.  There are some moments of spectacular action that show off the kind of potential that Haze had to be a great game, but these moments are few and far between.  Where Haze really falters is with the game's presentation: the storyline, dialogue, and voice acting are all deliriously bad, and the game's AI doesn't fare much better either.  Four-player co-op and multiplayer are bland but decent enough, and the game looks good and offers a decent selection of weapons.  However, the overall core of Haze is disappointingly shallow despite the game's interesting premise, and PS3 owning FPS fans are better off giving this a rental and holding out for Resistance 2.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2008"}

The gameplay emphasizes realism. I have no idea if anything is realistic about the campaign. But it is certainly not all-out, no-holds-barred, hyper-hectic, FPS mayhem like CoD does so well. This game is about adult oriented multiplayer and the campaign really only serves as a warm-up exercise so you're ready to face truly skilled enemy squads that work together to defeat you like nobody's business. Best part? The sound. No other game will ever put you so totally inside the, ahem, battlefield just via superb sound effects. The XP system is really annoying because if you're new, you'll be constantly overwhelmed by enemy squad members who have far more effective weapons than you, and you're just gonna have to slog through it until you get that next upgrade so you have a fighting chance, pun intended. A game that has sniper rifles with bullet drop, tanks with overheating turrets, destructible environments and temporary tinnitus from close explosions is realistic enough for my couch. I'm stressed out after 3 minutes because the sound effects keep fooling my brain into thinking that I'm about to get perforated by either shrapnel, or a sniper's bullet. Every time I hear the rattle of an enemy tank, my pulse goes up, because, well, as infantry you obviously don't have a whole lot against a tank, do you...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2013"}

It has a more compact form factor, brighter screens, a side-mounted power button, weighs less, has longer battery life, and simply looks more fashionable. The basic functionality of the DS is still here- same buttons and general button layout, wi-fi, GBA compatibility, etc.Is this worth buying if you already have a DS? Maybe, if you've got some spare cash. Is this worth buying if you don't own a DS? Definitely. The design is far superior to the old DS.No DS review would be complete without further mention of the PSP. While the PSP is undoubtedly a more capable device, it has significant weaknesses compared to the DS. Particularly, PSP games tend to have far longer load times, it has much shorter battery life, and the hardware itself is more fragile. Oh, and of course, there's the cost. The most critical factor, however, is the library of games available. As of now, DS games are more and better, and there's simply no contest when it comes to which has more to offer in this department.

Throughout this journey you go through GLaDOS's puzzles and eventually even dive into the abandoned parts of the huge installation where you get a look at the hilarious (and often dark) early history of Aperture.One of Portal's main strengths is it's writing. The plot of the game is very well done as well as the dialogue. GLaDOS is still the same snarky AI she was in the first game but the dialogue of the game is only better since Wheatley was added in. In which Stephen Merchant did a spectacular job voicing this very funny robot. The graphics are nice and there parts of the game that have a real depth to them. This depth isn't there just for show either since a key part of gameplay has you playing with physics by flinging yourself around using the long falls and the portal gun. In the end the gameplay was really fun, and it offered one of the best boss battles I've played through in a while just like the GLaDOS fight from the first game. The story was memorable filled with sophisticated humor and even some dark themes. The only negative I can think of is replay value.

A game that expands the possibilities of video games as a medium to tell a story.  This is true in some ways.  Heavy Rain feels experimental, and it succeeds in a lot of its experiments.  In the end, however, a person's overall experience with Heavy Rain is going to largely depend on what it is they want out of video games in the first place.Heavy Rain tells a single story about the hunt for a serial killer from the perspectives of four individuals.  The characters' stories intersect at certain points and the outcome of the game is determined by both the player's in-game choices, and their success at getting through the game's QTE (quick time event) - driven action sequences.Heavy Rain's story is very engaging right off the bat.  The mystery is deep and the atmosphere is heavy with dread.  To me, this was the part of the game that I \"liked\" the most (for lack of a better word).  Sure, it's a depressing, sad story, but it's a testament to the game's strengths that it can illicit emotion like that.  For years, there have been special games that have been capable of telling rich stories with genuine emotion and rich characters that feel real, but Heavy Rain brings it to a searing level of realism that I've never seen in a video game before.  Obviously this isn't for every taste out there, but I loved Heavy Rain's story for the same reasons I love the films of Ingmar Bergman and the books of Bret Easton Ellis.  In fact, Heavy Rain has been called an interactive movie and an interactive novel.  I'd say it's somewhere in between the two, but \"interactive\" is the key here, and fans of heavy drama will eat it up.  I know I did.On the other hand, the gamer in me didn't quite love the game as much as the dramatic art lover in me did.  Strip away all the elements that make Heavy Rain's story presentation so unique and what you are left with is an adventure game powered by QTEs.  That's really it.  There really isn't a whole lot of gameplay here.  You move through the motions to uncover your own version of the story.  This is another reason why I can't say the game was \"fun\" for me.  But that's surely the point.  I doubt the developers set out to make a fun game.  They set out to show that video games can tell a story just like any other medium today.  Heavy Rain is sure to come up in the ever-so-popular-nowadays \"Are Video Games Art?\" conversations, and it deserves to be there.  It doesn't break down any barriers, but it's a surely step forward.Whether you buy Heavy Rain or not should come down to what you want out of your video games.  I was impressed by Heavy Rain in a lot of ways, but in the end, Heavy Rain made it a bit more clear to me why it is that I'm a gamer in the first place.  My personal tastes dictate that I play video games for fun first and foremost.  This is why I cannot give Heavy Rain 4 stars on the Amazon scale (I do wish I could give it 3 and a half stars though).  A final note:  I used the Playstation Move controller with Heavy Rain.  It worked out excellent.  The controls were responsive and well implemented and I think anyone with Move should play Heavy Rain utilizing those controllers.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2010"}

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-Fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.Xbox LIVE support including LIVE Achievements.","reviewerName":"Peragulator","summary":"Overlooked","reviewText":"Got to eat some crow on this one because I panned the game without playing it and it's not bad at all.

{"product_name":"B001B1W3GG","description":"BioShock is an innovative role-playing shooter from Irrational Games who was named IGN&#8217;s 2005 Developer of the Year. BioShock immerses players into a war-torn underwater utopia, where mankind has abandoned their humanity in their quest for perfection.","reviewerName":"Sky","summary":"Under the Sea...But This Ain't Little Mermaid!","reviewText":"Not sinceResident Evil 4have I gotten so intensely immersed in a game. What a cool game Bioshock is. Let me say up front that I haven't finished it, and I don't want to be finished. I have played for at least 15 hours and I don't get the impression that I'm even close to finishing.I'm sure that I could have gotten a lot farther in the game than I am a lot faster, but you can prolong the game by exploring areas that may not be the most direct route to your goal. And I spend a lot of time exploring. These little explorations are usually fruitful, because hidden throughout the expansive game are all kinds of weapons, perks and information about where you've suddenly found yourself captive: In the underwater city of Rapture.The game begins with you as the sole survivor of a mid-sea plane crash. You swim to what appears as a lighthouse, but is also the entrance to Andrew Ryan's underwater utopian city of Rapture. Did I say utopian? Well, that may have been the original idea, but the Rapture you ultimately find yourself in is the antithesis of a utopia. I believe the term is dystopia.You soon start receiving radio transmissions from Ryan, a guy named Atlas and a doctor named Tennenbaum with advice on how to proceed in the game. Unfortunately, the advice you get often conflicts. Atlas and Ryan are clearly at war. And I'm not far enough in the game to even know for sure whose side Tennenbaum is on...but I've got a good feeling about her is all I'll say.You are given goals and roadblocks o'plenty to prevent you from easily reaching your goals. The few people (called Splicers) left in Rapture that you run into have all gone stark raving mad, and they'll ruin your day if you let them get too close. And don't trip a security alarm; it'll summon armed drones and more Splicers.Oh yeah, that Big Daddy guy in the old fashioned divers suit on the cover of the game case...they're roaming all over Rapture. Big, slow, doofy things, right? Mmmm hmmm...word to the wise: Don't get it mad. Sometimes the Big Daddies have Little Sisters in tow that seem to be inspecting corpses (um, yeah, corpses) strewn around either because you did some damage or...something else did. Mess with a Little Sister?...Over a Big Daddy's dead body! Atlas says kill `em; Tennenbaum says save `em...what to do...what to do?You get all kinds of weapons and opportunities to upgrade your weapons. R1 switches through the weapons and R2 fires. A pistol. A Shotgun. A chemical thrower. A grenade launcher. You're well equipped. (I'm at the part where you're given the crossbow.) You even get a camera to take pictures that allow you to conduct research on your foes to increase the damage you can inflict on them and lessen the damage that they inflict on you (don't worry...all you have to do is take the dang picture; the research is done automatically).In addition to the corpses strewn throughout the game, so is ammo, money and other knick-knacks that will help you progress through the game. Just be sure to search everything if you want to maximize your strength.And speaking of maximizing your strength, one of the first things you get is Plasmids...or put another way...special abilities. Telekinesis. Pyrokinesis. And a bunch of other Plasmid \"kinesises\" are unlocked pending your ability to find them. Try picking something heavy up with your telekinesis and throwing it at your enemy...better yet, plant a few proximity mines on that thing before you toss it! Switch through your Plasmids with L1 and use `em with L2.You're also granted \"tonics\" to customize your character with. Stuff like armor, various strengths, first aid boosts, and secondary damage your enemies from your weapons or from just plain old being attacked. Really cool stuff.Like the Ganados in Resident Evil 4, the Splicers in Bioshock become quite annoying and redundant, but I suppose that's the idea. Your goals change all the time. Just when you think you've attained a critical goal...it backfires or you're immediately given another that requires backtracking...and then backtracking again. But rest assured it never gets boring. The eerie atmospheres and creepy environments that Bioshock's creators have put together are more than effective. Some areas are really creepy, and there's nothing worse than not being able to find your way out of those which isn't always easy. But that's the fun!The game lets you save at any time, and when you restart play it starts you at the exact place you last saved...not at the last checkpoint. Pretty cool.If you liked RE4 or those kinds of survival / horror games...Bioshock is for you. Add this to your cart. And watch for Bioshock 2: Sea of Dreams next year sometime.(P.S.--I know that video game to big screen conversions mostly seem to fail, but I've got high hopes for the 2010 movie adaptation of Bioshock with thePirates of the Caribbean Trilogy'sDirector Gore Verbinski at the helm. Verbinski is no Uwe Boll!)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2008"}

Its major downfall is that it hasn't improved much on that game, and it's starting to show.The improvements they have made are great -- there are much better graphics, over 50 selectable characters for multiplayer, dozens of weapons (with completely customizable weapon set selections), and even a map editor!  The included multiplayer levels (which are plentiful) are pretty good -- there aren't any that are obvious duds.  Most of the game's plentiful features are unlocked by completing a series of increasingly difficult single-player missions.  Some of these are near-impossible (especially if you want to hit the uber-difficult and unlisted &quot;platinum&quot; times), but you only need a &quot;bronze&quot; medal on them to advance.However, the gameplay feels exactly like Goldeneye, which, in 2003, leaves you wanting something more.  The levels are fairly pretty, but the single-player missions are extremely linear, and everything seems kind of blocky and angular -- none of the cool curved surfaces of Quake 3 or Unreal Tournament.  The weapons are many, but mostly they're variations on the same cookie-cutter guns you get in every FPS (pistols, magnums, machine guns, assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, laser guns, missile and grenade launchers, timed, motion sensor, and remote mines...).  You can wield two of almost every gun, but they kept the bizarre Goldeneye convention of having the &quot;double&quot; weapons count as entirely different from the &quot;single&quot; ones (which eats up extra weapon slots in multiplayer).  Moving your character around feels somewhat awkward compared to the beautiful controls in Halo.  There aren't any vehicles, nor is there much in the way of a storyline (other than a few screenfuls of text describing your mission).  The plot has you jumping around in time, which (unfortunately) gives them a perfect excuse for having *absolutely no connection* between levels.  You go from a Russian military base (full of zombies?!) to 1930s Chicago to the Amazonian jungle to the Old West with neither rhyme nor reason.That said, the multiplayer is an absolute blast if you have 3 friends and you're looking for that old-school Goldneye action the console world has been missing the last few years.  However, it's just not enough to justify the purchase for me.  But at $20, you might consider it if you're a fan of Goldeneye (especially since rentals are like $6 nowadays at Blockbuster).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2003"}

Covino","summary":"Pure Fun","reviewText":"At first glance, this game gave the impression that it would be a mindless shooter, but after watching a trailer on [...], the serious tone of the game grabbed my attention and I put it on my list of games to buy. I wonder what took me so long. Created by the developers of the Hitman series at IO Interactive, and with a music score produced by Jesper Kyd, players can rest assured that this game is not the cheap shooter that the cover and name suggests it is.Imagine the world had Russia been the first to drop the Atomic Bomb and ended the Second World War. Imagine Russia's former Soviet Government now the planet's superpower and America's inferior position therein. As the Communist party builds in strength, consuming one small nation at a time, stretching its bloodthirsty tendrils closer and closer to home - you experience firsthand the demise of the free world, America being the final target.New York City is invaded and America becomes occupied by the soviet regime. They control the news stations and try to instill in people's minds that they are undefeatable and attempt mass indoctrination of Communistic values.You, Chris, were fortunate enough to find a member of the underground Warring Against Reds Resistant Movement in the middle of the invasion and are escorted to their hideout and military camp. There you are debriefed on how to weaken the Soviet hold of New York and are assigned missions by the head of the Warring Against Reds Movement herself. How you play the missions and in what order is up to you, but if certain strategic key hits are made on the enemy, you will find assaulting their main strongholds in New York a lot easier.For example, prior to infiltrating a compound, it might be wise to destroy some of the bridges that connect with that part of town to stop the influx of enemy troops or destroy fueling stations and landing pads to further disrupt enemy reinforcement and supply. If you take this approach, you will find yourself jumping from one part of the city to another, using the sewers, in your attempt to weaken the enemy before delivering the final devastating blow. But before committing any action, you might want to gear-up by assaulting a Russian weapon Depot held within an abandoned city restaurant. So, this game has an element of strategy.You can assault the Reds head on, or cut through city alleyways and flank their position. You can use trucks, or outside ventilation shafts to get inside buildings that can be used to pick off a couple of heads before telling your men (and women) to charge. Which brings me to the easy command system: for Playstation, Triangle is attack, Square is abort, and Circle is defend current position. There has been no easier way to command an army in a game. You can have a max of twelve freedom fighters join up with you, depending on your charisma (charisma is calculated by the amount of time you spend healing wounded civilians, rescuing POWs and blowing up enemy compounds).My only complaint with this great game is that they should have spent more time with the development of the story. The Soviet conquest of America happened rather suddenly. I would think it would take a bit more than a day to completely take control of a country. They should have drawn out the invasion more so that the player can feel a real sense of loss, and perhaps feel more inspired to recapture what is ours during the fights. The game does do a good job at portraying America completely dominated by the foreigners, having all these Russian speakers on TV explaining the current events and the new system. The game is also way too short. After beating it, I got the impression that the creators, although innovative and talented, were rushed. Would love to see this story retold and this game remade under a more generous budget and time table.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2007"}

Stathoulopoulos \"nick9155\"","summary":"Pure mayhem simulator a popular medication","reviewText":"The fifth GTA release for PS2, this is the second title that was an exclusive PSP-only release, following Liberty City Stories.  The producers claimed they wouldn't port this one for PS2, but lo and behold, they did, and thankfully.  Put aside the odd decision to produce games exclusively for a three inch screen...if you love the GTA games, this is a no-brainer, especially at the reduced price.Overall, the game looks like it's been ported in that its slightly squished down so the aspect ratio is not quite the same as GTA: VC.  On the up side, though, the graphics are improved, the movement is better, the colors are better, etc.  Importantly, you have that 360-degree action with the environment at all times (using the right stick) meaning you can move the view around like a camera at any given moment.  Similarly, the Cinematic View (for those who enjoy blowing things up in a cinematic mode) is like the 'old' style from GTA II and VC, meaning you cannot manually change the views like in LCS.  For some reason, this is actually better and gives the action a better performance.  And it can be hilarious.  But it doesn't ruin this game, far from it.  Basically, for Vice City fanatics who enjoyed crime and evil in that town, this is so very welcome.  As before, some of the enhancements of LCS have made it in, so you can enjoy Miami-stand in \"Vice City\" with a few new twists.Story-wise, for anyone keeping score, the game is set in 1984 (the earliest GTA setting now), two years before VC.  Things are a bit different in town, there is much building to be done, it's rather sleazy...it's basically Miami circa the premier of Miami Vice.  With more gangs.  And sleaze.  The story in the game is noticeably darker, which puts an interesting spin on this.  There is even more chatter on the radio, entirely new stations, and generally the same amount of writing and detail as any of the other games.  A real 'bonus' holdover game that does the job.Plenty of violence and insanity, and like LCS, the missions are definitely easier, as if they wanted you to blow through it quicker and enjoy the free-for-all action and endless bonus stuff.  Again, like LCS, looks a little bit 'smushed' on the screen, like the picture was not fully corrected from the PSP.  But it still looks better and moves better, which is what counts.  Like LCS, debuted at a cheap price (interesting strategy), and probably was a big shot in the arm for Rockstar, who are banking big on IV later in '08.  Absolutely recommended for fans and addicts alike, even you have to play on your 'old' system.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2008"}

It's backlit, the buttons feel great, and if you can text, you can use the chat pad easily.The PS3 chatpad awkwardly attaches to the controller and immediately screws up the entire balance of the controller.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"Truth","summary":"One of Nintendos gems","reviewText":"Combining the very elements that make Nintendo, Nintendo, and unleashing them in this game.All of the popular video game heroes.

As Commander Shepard, you must assemble the galaxy's deadliest team and stop the most terrifying threat humanity has ever faced.","reviewerName":"Nick \"Nick\"","summary":"Graphics are nice, story elements and action echo earlier games","reviewText":"Note I did not play Mass Effect (the original).  Standard disclaimer: I never buy new releases, instead usually pick up popular titles 1-2 years after initial release to reduce the cost, and number of duds.ME2 with the DLC is interesting, has some impressive graphics and a well developed storyline, and has decent combat play (controls, physics, shield/health system, reasonable difficulty level, and one or two modest problem solving challenges).  Side missions are OK (DLC included with the version I bought was much better than the side missions).  I have a couple gripes, the primary being the length of the loading screens, and the fact that you have to wait for the entire loading time whenever you die.  Additionally I think it is a shortcoming that you spend so much time recruiting your crew, but only the final mission allows you to take more than two of your crew with you.  My third main complaint is that the second play-through doesn't really seem to add the bonuses and specials that the info-blurbs on the loading screens promise.  While there seem to be many dialogue options, most of the actual storyline seems to progress along the same path regardless of your choices.  The dialog seems mostly to affect the paragon/renegade status, and only in very rare instances actually changes outcomes.  Besides not really offering significantly different action sequences, the second playthrough also doesn't offer the chance to fully max out characters (levels and special abilities seem to be capped at 30), doesn't offer new weapons, and doesn't seem to offer any particularly interesting new enemies or upgrades.  My last nit regarding the storyline is that once you complete all the recruitment and loyalty missions the vast majority of the game is over.  This felt rather disappointing after all the effort it took to assemble the whole team.  Finally the \"planet mining\" side game is I think a missed opporunity to introduce another puzzle/problem solving element (hacking and security bypasses in the main game are reminiscent of the hacking side-game in the first bio-shock).  Instead it is a mindless, time consuming exercise, with no real challenge and appropriately little payoff (the hard part is collecting the upgrades, not collecting the ores).  With all the DLC, side missions, loyalty missions, 100% exploration of all planets, clusters, etc, it will be 30-40 hours for most folks I think.If you've played a fair number of shooters I don't think you'll find too much really innovative in this title.  The story line is a bit more developed (in a soap-opera kind of way) than most, but Resistance, Fall of Man for example has a similarly rich backstory which at least for me was more compelling save-the-earth plot line than the save-the-universe plot line for ME2.  Overall 4 stars because of the (current) low price with included DLC.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2011"}

I mean, for a video game, it is good; but that is damning it with faint praise, because videogame stories are almost always dreadful.  The story would make a mediocre movie at best.  I don't blame the writers, it is hard to make a story that has to justify repeated bouts of killing, sewer exploration, killing, subway exploration, etc etc while still being able to be understood by everyone buying the game.  Oh, and ffs, can we please retire the post apocalypse zombie world as the go-to videogame plot for a while.So after this, my belief that modern big budget single player games always have bad gameplay remains intact.  I wonder what this game would have been like if instead of 95% of the budget being spent on things other than gameplay, if they had spent those tens of millions just on gameplay development.Oh well, there is always multiplayer stuff like Dota2 which is all about the gameplay.ymmv, obviously.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2013"}

Because this game is so good, everything else just seems childish and a waste of time.Before I played this I had just beaten Tomb Raider and absolutely loved it.  After The Last of Us though, Tomb Raider's story and character development seems extremely amateur in comparison.  I understand that the two games are hardly in the same genre but that's just a testament to how go TLOU is; everything else has fallen a couple notches.  I've been waiting forever for a game like this.  The story is touching but don't be mistaken; the overly emotional cutscenes are kept to a minimum.  Everything here is subtle and shakes you down to your core.  A true masterpiece which will be studied by programmers and other developers for many years.There is this unique feeling you get while playing this game.  Some reviewers were complaining that they just could not get into it and didn't feel like firing it up, although they said they enjoyed the time they spent with it.  I realized what this was.  The game is so engrossing that you actually feel like you are in the world, in real danger, and you suddenly become very anxious.  You don't know what is going to happen to Ellie and thus you do not want to continue for fear of losing her.  The last third of the game, you're pretty much playing on pins and needles.I can now call myself a Naughty Dog fan.

{"product_name":"B00149MEVY","reviewerName":"J. Urban \"U2fan4ever76\"","summary":"Almost Perfect Addition To Silent Hill Franchise","reviewText":"Well, I just finished Silent Hill: Homecoming yesterday, as my football team had a bye week and I figured I'd put the extra 4hrs. to good use. I took my time playing the game (I don't believe in rushing through a game, just so I can say I beat it in a day) and found that I thoroughly enjoyed the game and can't understand which game all of the one and two star reviewers were playing, because it couldn't have been the same one I was playing (and no, I don't work for Konami, though I wish I did).(Note: I am beginning the review when the \"real\" game begins, as I don't feel the intro segment needs much comment as it is best enjoyed just playing it.)I started the game out a bit skeptical as it was a little too familar and reminded me of the others, particularly Silent Hill 1 and Silent Hill 2, with completely cloud covered streets and eerie noises all around. I was impressed with the fog as I do believe it is next-gen in the way it varies in volume and dissipates while walking through. As for the storyline and where to go in the beginning, it is pretty straightforward with a some puzzles that may slow you down. The enemies are not too tough at in the beginning, so you find yourself more exploring.I'm a little amazed at reading the negative reviews (and everyone has a right to voice their opinion, me included) and how they chastise the game for a lot of things that I just didn't see. I'll tell you what I saw while playing.The first next-gen Silent Hill blew me away with hi-res cutscenes and a lot of detail to the interiors of buildings and rooms. (For example, in the Shepherd house, in your character's old room, you see little details such as a model jet hanging from the ceiling, not to mention every detail that would make it a boy's bedroom.) All of the locales had the same  level of detail on the outside and inside and made for a very engaging playground for your character to move through.I noticed the graphics got berated a lot in the reviews. I am astonished by that, particularly in the last 1/3 of the game. The character models are very detailed, as is the environments. Everyone needs to remember that a game set in fog (for external scenes) can only be so detailed as a lot is obscured by the fog. Because of this, sure, some exteriors don't jump out at you, but for areas with limited fog or interior scenes, the graphics jump out at you in hi-res next-gen glory.Also, the new combat system seems to be a love it or hate it debate. I found it intuitive and much better than any fighting system of prior-Silent Hill's. The dodge could have worked more consistently, but for the most part the light/heavy attacks, mixed with dodging, helped to keep the battles fresh and heart-pounding. As for those who said that it made the battles easier, I didn't find that to be the case as the enemy AI is in your face with most of the enemies. Also, I counted about 7-8+ different enemy types so I am not sure why there needs to be more as some have complained, as most games of this survival horror type just have a handful of enemy types (even Resident Evil and the new Dead Space).The puzzles are intriguing and thank God they are not impossibly difficult. Some people like intricate puzzles, others like ones that can be solved after some thought, but not ones that hit you over the head and make progression impossible. All of the puzzles made sense and if they didn't take a degree in calculus, I know I certainly didn't need ones that difficult. I'd rather be spending my time moving on and seeing new things.The developers did a very good job spreading around health items and ammo. There was never a time I felt like I was going to have to reload an earlier save in order to progress. And as for weapon types, how many are really needed in a game like this? It's not Metal Gear Solid and I felt that the 4-5 weapons were just right and each had a specific enemy they worked best against, though in all honesty, most could be defeated with the metal pipe or shotgun.The bosses were varied and not overly difficult. I am 32 and have a family and don't have the time to spend a week figuring out how to beat one boss character, so I was happy to find that they were challenging but not overly difficult.The soundtrack was just as eerie as everything else and added so much to the atmosphere.I took my time and got about 16-18hrs. out of it and I think that is pretty good these days. I got a so-so ending that left more questions than answers, but maybe on subsequent playthroughs I will get a one that makes more sense. Really, that was my only serious gripe--the ending I got. Also, to be honest, there could be some improvements to combat and the detection system for opening doors, needs a little tweaking--but that is it. This is pure Silent Hill for the next generation and I only home the next one tries a little reinvention like Resident Evil 4, so as to keep the series fresher. This is a great game for Silent Hill and survival horror fans and do not let the bad reviews keep you from renting or buying it. It is well worth the investment of your money and time.4/5 stars","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2008"}

It uses RPG character creation and advancement and combines it with an action/adventure style gameplay. One of the main differences from regular action/adventure games being that your character's abilities play into how well you can perform a wide range of actions, even in combat. The System Shock series was a precursor to this type of game, but Deus Ex really perfected it. Additionally, you give the player multiple ways of advancing the story, not just through dialog options, but through where you go and what you do. Lastly, the story changes depending on your actions. Alpha Protocol is the first game I have seen this generation that continues the foundation that the Deus Ex series started. As a side note, it gives homage to Deus Ex with some allusions in the game.The PS3 version of the game does lack the polish of AAA games like Uncharted 2 or Final Fantasy XIII. However, those games were or are PS3 developed exclusives that maximized use of the hardware. If this game were a PS3 exclusive I am sure it would be closer to that level of smoothness in texture rendering. Secondly, there are delays in some animations and screen load times which I imagine is because of a lack of time investment to utilize the PS3 hardware properly.However, the successful execution of this type of gameplay has been sorely missed for many years, and the story and gameplay freedom you get from this game are top tier and overshadow any minor technical flaws. This game has a very high replay value as the story can change in so many substantial ways from how you initially build your character to the choices you make throughout. Your character may start out weak as in any game with skill progression, but by the second mission or so you will get the hang of the unique style of gameplay this game offers and you will experience an epiphany of how great this game is that will make it so you do not want to stop playing it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2010"}

I picked it up from my local library thinking it would be a fun trip down memory lane, but with 3D.  It wasn't all that impressive to tell the truth.I played Starfox 64 quite a bit.  I mastered pretty much everything and worked to play through all of the levels and max my scores.  So going back to this game, I thought I might have 'lost' something in the 10 years or so since I last played it.  But I started playing it like I just put it down yesterday.  So if you played the original to death, there isn't much that would be new or exciting.Also, the 3D doesn't play as well as other 3DS remakes such as Zelda.  It seems the 3D doesn't have much depth, even on higher settings.  Also, using the gyroscope for steering while trying to see 3D on this system is a joke.  But luckily you can turn that option off.  But it really does have a wonky 3D look.  And after a few minutes I pulled the 3D slider down to zero.  Every now and then I turned it back on to see if there was any improvement, but alas, no.  Games like Super Mario 3D land and Mario Kart 7 have such amazing 3D depth, that this game comes off as a cheap attempt at cashing in on an old title with new technology (kind of like all those old movies being re-made in 3D.  Looking at you Disney and James Cameron!).I gave the game 4 stars because it is a great game.  For those who haven't played this version of Starfox, I rate it as the best.  The challenge is not in beating the game, but in taking the more difficult routes to beat the game and maxing out your scores (hits).My advice?  Well, if you own (or owned) the original, it might be worth playing a bit.  But I recommend getting it on a Nintendo 64 emulator.  Or dusting off the old N64 and playing it.  The 3D just isn't worth it.  And it does play better on a large screen.  If you have never played this game, then it might be worth grabbing a copy.  But I think Nintendo could have and SHOULD have done a bit better with this title.  Like Zelda The Ocarina of Time, which is a flawless 3D remake.Also note: no online multiplayer.

Now, Super Mario 2 was of course the worst of the series, because well it originally wasn't meant to be a Mario game. I was disappointed, well, until Super Mario World was announced. At first I was skeptical because most ports have some problems, however, for this game it wasn't the case. Super Mario Advance 2: Super Mario World is everything you could want and more if you want a solid platform game, or if you are like me, want to relive the memories. It is truly amazing that there are some games that are over 10 years old, yet when you play them again, it feels like a new experience all over again. Super Mario World is one of those kinds of games. I remember my first boss battle, meeting Yoshi for the first time, clearing that last jump at Butter Bridge, and avoiding the dangers of the Sunken Ship. This plainly shows that if you want a platform, no one does it better than Mario.The graphics are remarkable, and even to this day still amaze me. From the watery depths of Soda Lake to the mud covered Chocolate Mountain, the backgrounds are wonderful for each level, and the Game Boy Advance truly brings them out in full. The character animations for Mario and Luigi are well done, and the enemies look as good as ever, and so does the interaction animation. For example, when koopas lose their shell they will search for it, and when you stomp on a skeleton monster it will fall to pieces, only to surprise you by coming back to life. The lighting effects, backgrounds, and character animations will not disappoint, and have made a great transition to the Game Boy Advance.Some would think that because this is a Game Boy Advance game the sounds would be below par. However, if you are familiar with the music from the SNES version you will know that they were all brilliant. The transition from the original to the Game Boy Advance has done nothing but improve on the music quality. The haunting music from the Ghost Tower is still there, as well as the relaxing charms from the water levels. The music will definitely not disappoint, however the voice acting is another story. It is interesting they gave Mario and Luigi voices in the game, and they actually sound good. However, they soon become a tad monotonous. After hearing \"Mama mea\" a hundred times every time you lose a life, it eventually will wear on your nerves. All in all, the good outweigh the bad here, and the music is good enough to keep the volume up on your Game Boy Advance.Basically the flow of the game is that of a classic Mario game. The story is no different from the usual rescue princess from Bowser, but hey do you play platforms for the story? Back to the gameplay, you move along throughout the levels overcoming obstacles, enemies, collecting coins, and power-ups, and trying to get to the end of the level, or the \"goal.\" The goal looks like a field goal post with a bar moving up and down the post. The higher you connect with the bar the more points you get. When you get 100 points something special happens, but you will have to find out that secret for yourself.  The other concept of gameplay is the additional item grid at the top of the screen. The item grid will hold a power-up that you have stored away. By pressing select or when you are attacked the item will slowly fall and you can grab it, restoring your power. Speaking of powers, you all should remember the classic mushroom and flower. However, the new cape ability gives you the chance to fly for a short time. You can also use the cape as a weapon. There are other abilities but I won't spoil them for you, even if you know what they are.  Lastly Yoshi makes several appearances throughout the game, and his addition makes the game even betterHow about that replay value? Some would say because it is a platform it would get boring as soon as you complete it...that is wrong. The wonderful thing about this game is the secrets. In some levels there are alternate ways to beating it, and if you find the hidden goal you will be rewarded. Sometimes with a new type of item, and other times you will get a new level. Speaking of levels there are over 90 stages of gameplay, each with their own unique puzzles and challenge. You will also have noticed another game option on the title screen. That is the Super Mario Brothers Arcade. It is a classic multiplayer game that you can play with your friends, the objective? Get a lot of points by defeating enemies while staying alive. While it was in the first Super Mario Advance, that doesn't mean it isn't fun. It is always fun to beat your friends, and this extra option is another reason the game is a joy to play.Overall, this game is incredible. After, all these years the game is as fun as ever, and its light hearted gameplay will give any gamer, whether old or new, a great experience.  It is also shows that Nintendo really knows how to port some great games. All in all, if you are in need of a great platform for the road or just missed out on the original, be sure to pick up Super Mario Advance 2: Super Mario World, it's a winner!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2003"}

If you find the hidden key in Star World, you'll gain access to the extremely challenging Special World, which has its own hidden secrets.Mario and Luigi can jump up and down pipes, climb vines, swim, and toss Koopa shells. Yoshi the dinosaur can spit eggs, munch, and climb with his ever-helpful tongue. Cool touches include spinning platforms, forced-scrolling levels, and great attacks such as the spin jump. Mario and Yoshi fly with the aid of a unique feather, shoot fireballs when equipped with a special flower, and can even raise cute baby Yoshis. Each boss poses a unique challenge. Cross-eyed Lemmy Koopa likes to play hide-and-seek in pipes, while Iggy Koopa prefers to battle on a giant Koopa shell floating on a lava lake.","reviewerName":"Xebec51","summary":"Its um...mario","reviewText":"Mario games as of other platformers always were a bit of a challenge for me, my person srtong suite is fps games, however I enjoy a varity of genres.

Audio voice-overs accompany cinematic cutscenes and serve to reinforce the strong cast of characters.","reviewerName":"Dressi \"K N D\"","summary":"It was fun, simply fun...","reviewText":"And being fun is what it's all about, right?  Yeah graphics, yeah story line... those too can make a game worth it... but just all around fun is another part of a game that can just make it good for those long endless, half-mindless (in this case, really mindless) leveling sessions a lot of people do with RPG characters.PROS: a unique battle system that's enjoyable and unique.  The skill system is very unique and works on a point system.  Customizing characters can provide for a whole new game experience and the development of new and interesting strategies.CONS: the graphics are a little buggy (two common combat glitches will occur half the time) and the PS2 even slows down the performance just to handle the demand, could have been reworked.  The music gets on my nerves in a lot of places, no Uematsu or Mitsuda... sounds a lot like Mega Man Legends.  The voiceovers a great but there are too few of them.The battle system is a nice new gem that shines brightly.  It involves several things.  Ok so you have a character and he progesses through this IP gauge based on his Agility and Speed.  At the last quarter of the gauge comes the Command point where the character enters a command.  Then he progesses to the Action, the end of the IP guage, where he executes the command.  This short stretch between Com and Act is used for spell-casting time or the time it takes to charge or prepare a technique.  Simpler commands like attack take hardly any time and the more you know the spell or skill the less time it takes.  Some skills can be mastered out so that they occur instantly.There are a who new set of commands for hte battle system which include defence, evade, combo(2 good hits, which hits for more HP damage) critical (a strong hit that cancles any command and knocks the target back in the IP guage, hits for less HP than the combo) and skills and magic and, of course, items.  There is a chance to escape the battle.The skill ranking system works on three things, XP, Skill Coins, (SC) and Magic Coints (MC).  The XP level up characters, duh.  The SC and MC are distributed among three more things...  Moves (or character skills) use SC and Mana Eggs (Magic containing eggs) use MC.  There are also skill books which can use either SC or MC.  Moves are personal character skills... simple enough.  Mana Eggs contain a list of spells that the character has access to if he/she has the mana egg equiped (only one can be equiped at a time).  The Skill books are a list of skills that grant new abilities and attributes or 'up' current stats and attributes like HP MP, Speed, one grants evasion, one grands counter attack.  Every entry in these Eggs, Books or character moves has 5 ranks, once filled up it is maxed out.  Some can take 800 coins for their final ranks while some are around the 6000 mark.Then there are the items, weapon, armor, headgear, footing, and accessory which can help modify your character.  Experimenting and mixing all these around provides for a great customization and ability to up your party to its potential.  Though you will see that certain characters fit certain roles and you just might end up not customizing them but advancing their natrual abilities.The Story line is a little wierd and provides a few surprises along the way.  The characters are smart (in most places) and don't do stupid things or not do the smart thing that could have prevented everything (Like if Fate had only started explaining first instead of attacking then maybe Serge would have listened and the Dragons would have lost -ChronoCross-).  It is a rather easy game and doesn't have much replay value, excpet for customizing the characters and trying out new combinations of skills and Coin distribution.  But i have never had a character die and have only fought 3 bosses that posed any threat, even the final boss seemed too easy at level 80, didn'y even heal once.  There is only one secret in the game and no sidequests.  But, like i said, it was simply fun...  that's about it.  No FF7 here but defenitly worth a rent or two, can be beaten in less than 50 hours.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2002"}

The premise of the game is to have your child read each story aloud (with the included microphone), earning stickers as they do so.These stickers can then be placed in your child's album.2. The game is truly interactive - you not only use the Wiimote, but also the included microphone.3. The stories are paced well, with pauses after every sentence, with a press of the [A] button required to continue. The controls also make it easy to navigate back and forth through the book using the arrow keys.4. A built in voice changer modifies your voice to match the character in the story. (This is a bit hit-and-miss, but is interesting nonetheless.)5. There are 4 nursery rhymes (Twinkle Twinkle, Old McDonald, Row Row Row your Boat, and Mary had a Little Lamb) that children can sing along with.6. There are other playtime activities such as a canvas painter that is controlled by your voice.7. Accessing the game's functionality is pretty intuitive - the metaphor used is that of rooms based on fruit. The Orange room is where you work with stories, the Grape room is where you adjust the game's settings, the Apple room is where you perform your activities, and the Acorn room is where you manage your album and stickers.Conclusion:#############Our first grader couldn't get enough of this game.She's read a number of the stories and has completed all the available songs. Her favorite story is a Norwegian tale that I liked as a child - \"The Boy Who Went To The North Wind\".The downside, unfortunately, is that the content is extremely limited. Once she's worked her way through the game, the potential for replayability seems to be minimal.  This may not be such an issue for children learning to read, however.As a parent, I much prefer reading old-fashioned books with her - there's something personal that is lost when trying to read words off a television screen. (There's enough television in her life as it is.)However, she insisted on a 5-star rating, and so that's what we awarded this game.Happy Storytelling!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2010"}

There are plenty games out there that take place during real battles and campaigns of World War Two, but here we have a \"What If\" scenario. What if Winston Churchill didn't survive a fateful car accident that he had while visiting New York in 1931?The folks at Codemasters seem to think that the Third Reich, after conquering Europe would launch an invasion of the United State eastern sea border in 1953.This game took only seven hours to play, and I whish I had those seven ours back. It's as the Angry Video Game Nerd saids, \"a TISH load of KUCF.\" The game feels like it was rush out with chucks of content cut out becomes they didn't meet the ridiculously short deadline.You control a New York construction worker Dan Carson who seems to know how to use German weapons, knows something about hand to hand combat, and how to wire bombs, this is never explained. Like Master Chief and the Marine in \"Doom\" you are fighting this invasion single handedly, your NPC resistance fighters and national guard soldiers are killed within five minutes of their introduction, at least they provide you with ammo for American weapons because it doesn't show up anywhere else.The controls are hideously stiff, making movement and aiming abysmally slow and even jerky, it's like trying to move around underwater. The graphics are not as sharp or as detail as they could be (yes I know this game came out in ought six, but Half-Life 2 came out the pervious year and that game is still beautiful today).The game is also plagued with various video bugs that are never fixed, unlike other games that routinely update their games; Codemasters has no update patches for Turning Point. There seem to be jump cuts in the video when you reach a draw point, there would be about a two second freeze then a wall or a door would appear right in your face and a nazi would spawn right behind you and club you to death. The only ragdoll physics is when you kill some one, the fall to the floor or onto a table and then freeze with their arms and legs at ridicules angels. There's also lousy hit detection.This is a massive shame because on the surface it's a great idea of a game. Alterative World War Two. But Codemasters doesn't take advantage of the game's setting and there doesn't seem to be to many history buffs over at the Codemaster office.What about the Japanese? Won't we've still gone to war with the Japs in 1941?  And developed the atomic bomb? Maybe Carson is a veteran of the War with Japan.No mention of Japan is every made. In fact there is no back round information about what is going on aside from the death of Churchill. The player doesn't know that after conquering the British Isle in 1940 the Reich goes on to conquer Russia and most of northern Africa and the Middle East, giving German access to lots of oil, that they trade to Japan, allowing Japan to conquer the rest of Asia and making the US's trade embargoes against Japan redundant, thus no Pear Harbor attack, no War with Japan, thus no war with Germany. And no nukes for the US.None of this appears in the game, it is only mention in publicly material and the games profile page on Wikipedia.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2010"}

They're not that big a deal on lower difficulties, but on higher difficulties, you have to wrestle the camera to see enemies who attack off screen and this becomes in issue in more then a few boss fights. Also, dodging is way too difficult to use. Many times, I've tried to execute a dodge, because some enemy attacks require you to do this with good timing, and I end up running into their attacks rather then dodging-and on higher difficulties, dodging becomes essential to survival. With the camera issues and the impossible dodge mechanics, you cannot ever clear this game 100%-ever. Doing so is literally impossible! I cannot truly recommend this game, and only give it two stars for the story and the graphics and nothing else.

What pleased me even more is that, compared to the first game, the graphics here are photo realistic.The people look very real.  The character creater lets you choose your Sims' face and body, you can even make Michael Jackson.  The food looks real, the items in the house and the world around the Sims themselves are all presented with top notch graphics.  I believe that you can actually learn how to cook spaghetti by watching how it is done in the Sims.That's one of the other upgrades.  Meals are no longer generic Breakfast-Lunch-Dinner.  As your Sims' cooking skills improve, they learn to make different types of meals.  Be sure to stock the fridge, it holds alot, but it is no longer a perpetual food machine.Plus, there are now days off!  Each job has a scheduled start time and end time, as well as days of the week when you work, and days when you do not work.  Also, your Sims have aspirations and fears.  Fullfill the desires of the Sims (e.g. dance with partner) and avoid their fears (see a cockroach).  These greatly affect your Sims' happiness.Finally, the big change is that Sims have stages of life.  Infants become toddlers become children become teens become adults become elders become ancestors (they die of old age).  So you won't be perpetually playing a handful of people and then starting a new house - you'll be playing a few people and then their children, and their children's children.  This will be a challenge for those who never got the hang of handling newborns in the Sims.  Those who don't like this feature can enter a cheatcode (provided in the manual) and turn it off.My one complaint is the absence of parental controls to allow us to modify the gameplay for younger members of the family.  Instead, the designers again went for a one-size-fits-all philosophy.  It would have been appropriate to have included a means to have some control beyond \"yes you can play\" and \"no you cannot play.\"The game is a blast, however.  Anyone who enjoyed the Sims will love the Sims 2, and be amazed by the graphics.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2004"}

Firstly, and most famously, it looks absolutely stunning. On maximum settings the island on which the adventure takes place truly comes to life. The quality of the graphics and the physics remain unsurpassed, in my opinion, even when compared to more recent games. Immersion is critical in games such as this and the CryENGINE used provides this in spades. There's also a pretty good storyline behind the action and the pacing is good, with the action steadily ramping up to an impressive big finale. The voice acting is always convincing and the cut-scenes fit seamlessly into the flow of the game. The combat is challenging and rewarding. I have just two criticisms: First is the fact that the single player game ends! I wanted much more but this is a game that can be played more than once as the \"sandbox\" nature of the island allows for different approaches to the gameplay, plus there's a good multiplayer version to continue the fun, and there are custom maps and mods out there. Second, there's not enough humour. I think any game benefits from a few laughs (the Half-Life series is an excellent example) but I can't remember any in CRYSIS.

All the challenges of the popular sport combined with the weird, wacky fun of Mario's world come together, for laughs and thrills.","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Batter Up!","reviewText":"Arguably, Nintendo really knows exactly how to put the Mario franchise within the worlds of sports extraordinarily well. It first started with the status of the fast and furious Mario Kart series. Then, it was more laid back towards the putters with the wild and wacky Mario Golf series. After that, it took a turn towards aces with the Mario Tennis games for the Nintendo 64, and last year with the Gamecube. Still, there are a few other sports that are going to have the Mario bandwagon soon. Within the next year, there will be the European football, or soccer hyped Super Mario Strikers. But in the meantime, a Spring and Boys Of Summer tradition called baseball.Mario Superstar Baseball for the Nintendo Gamecube, is a fast paced and eclectic gamers paradise through the world of baseball. The game really goes a lot deeper from the Super Mario Briothers series past and present with so many characters like Yoshi, Luigi, Mario, Peach. Also, some old favorites like the flying goombas, and dry bones from Super Mario Brothers 3, Koopa Troopa, and so many others. Arguably, the graphics are just delightful, and the gameplay and control is very easy to learn for some characfters, whether it is in the pitching, or the batting, and simply within the outfield. The fields also blend within each unique feeling of the Mario worlds with courses from the Princess Castle, and even the wild and wooly jungle worlds of Donkey Kong. The musical score is as cutesy, but not over the top for the game, but that arguably doesn't matter at all.Mario Superstar baseball is a great addition for any fan of Mario, and baseball alone. While, there have been so few baseball games for the Nintendo Gamecube, this happens to really be one of the very few that does stand alone. This is a great sports game, and one of the few that really does hit a home run.Graphics: B+Sound: B-Control: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B- if you're playing solo; A- if you're playing with othersOverall: B","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2005"}

I don't think that's really necessary.  Halo has been around for years and has held the championship title for first person shooters for quite some time.  The entire Halo series provides a compelling story, great graphics and excellent FPS controls.  So, if you don't know that Halo is a good game, you've either been in exile for the last decade or simply not a gamer.  That being said, I am impressed with this port to XBOX360.  Why?  Because this is not just an old game that the developer through into a new package, marked it \"HD\" and put it back on the market to cash in.  they actually did some work - and some very fine work - at improving the visuals of the game.  The difference between the original XBOX version and this installment is vast.  I actually went from playing Halo: Reach to this game and couldn't really notice much of a difference.  That's how improved the graphics are.  So, if you are a Halo fan or you've just returned from exile and want to check it out, this version is certainly worth picking up.  This game should be in any XBOX360 owner's library.PROS- Same great Halo game - controls, story, gameplay all rock- Vastly improved graphics for the 360CONS- Some of the AI voice acting seems a little outdated compared to newer titles.

He gets locked in, and ignores anything but the game, goes in guns blazing, player dies, puts the next character on the portal, rinse and repeat. When all his characters are gone he bugs mom and dad and his uncle for new characters from the store $15 bucks a pop.

Why do you think Disney went scrambling to make this game? Skylanders was monopolizing the market making money hand over fist.The point of the developers making these games isn't to make a fun game for your child, it's about selling figurines.Solution ?

They're just so clunky, most of the time you can't tell where you're going, you don't know if an enemy is behind you, (Or at times even in front of you, if you get a weird camera angle) and plus might I add that you can't see your character, which does not really, (For me, most of the time) give that whole imaginative feel that you ARE that character.Well, Goldeneye is an excellent and well made game.I don't know why people complain about the graphics...it's actually kind of cool, and plus the enemies in this game are from head to toes so detailed that you think they're real.  The scientists in the facility level are well detailed, and most all the characters are animated incredibly.Besides, you take on the role of James Bond.  James Bond! The hero that defined action! This game is not dull, and at times it is so scary when you are overswarmed by a bunch of enemies in one small room.The multiplayer mode, is, of course, wonderful.  You can choose from power weapons, sniper rifels, Dostovals, Shotguns, PP7's, proximity mines, hand grenades, laser guns, and basicly everything else that you can think of.  It is an entertaining game, and it is well worth the money.The camera angles rock.  you never get lost.So, why didn't I give this game Five stars?  Read below and find out.THE BADS OF THE GAMEThere are some major glitches.  You can see your enemies literally walk through walls, not completely, but almost there.At times the doors, when I command it to open with the B button, it still won't open, even if I already DID get an access card for the door in the first place.  The reason behind that is the fact that an enemy is probably trying to open the door as well, but how am I supposed to know that? So, I stand back, the enemy comes in, and oh, guess what, it turns out that there isn't just one of them, there's thirty, so they all shoot at me, and I die.  You can easily die in this game just due to glitches, which makes it very difficult and frustrating.If you forget one thing on a mission, just one small thing which most of the time has nothing to do with the story, then you have to start the whole mission over again.  You don't just do the thing you forgot, either, you have to do all the things that you did do, as well as the things you did not.The game is predictible, due to the fact that it follows the movie, although when it does not follow the movie, (Which it does a lot) then it gets kind of dissapointing because what you expected did not happen.The puzzles can be frustrating.  I'm still trying to figure out how to get the bottling room on the facility level.The game is also very gory.  I don't know why they gave this game a TEEN rating instead of a mature...it should of been rated mature.Now, for the GOODS of this game.GOODSUse an incredibly large arsenal of weaponry and more weaponry...prepare to save the world, it's gonna be a rough ride.It follows the movie really well, (Most of the time, anyways) And if you're a big fan of james bond you will really enjoy this game.  Even if you aren't you'll still enjoy it.You play the role of james Bond, which is worth it within itself.This game is the greatest First person shooter game for the N64.  The controls aren't so difficult that you'll get lost and forget which buttons to use while you're losing, but they are simple and easy and at the same time fun.  And even if you don't like the controls, you can decide which buttons you want for which ones the controller screen.There's nothing that you can't shoot or destroy.The cheats are FUNNY!  I mean, honestly, try the invisibility mode. You can shoot a near bye dashboard when a Gaurd is near, and that gaurd will start freaking out and look around to see who did that.  This makes the game easier also, and the invincibility mode is good too, although I tried and realized that you can't have the invisibility mode and invincibility at the same time.  You can also make the bad guys heads small and stuff, which is really funny to see.The way that the characters are animated are almost identicle to the characters in the movie...they look exactly like the actors.At the end of every level, it tells you how many kills you did, how many limb shots, how many head shots, and how many body shots you had.The artificial intelligence with the badguys aren't all that challenging, but when there's a whole crowd of them, watch out!This game is excellent.  Did I mention that it's excellent? Let me repeat it again: This game is excellent! Excellent I tell you, excellent!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2002"}

They have improved the gameplay somewhat and the Single Player is funner in this game than Socom II. When you go online and register a name, they ask you for a credit card number to get a rank, stats, friends list, etc. What the heck! Oh Well. Another bad thing is that there is no maps from Socom II which was disappointing. All the maps in Socom 3 are from the Single Player Missions. A good thing is that there is better hit detection than Socom II and there is more weapons and attachments like scopes, front grips, M203's, etc. Also you can swim and dive underwater. Finally they have vehciles and tanks!  I'll break it down for you.Graphics: 5/5 They have certainly improved the graphics in this game from Socom II. All the gun models are very nicely done along with the vehciles and tanks.Sound: 5/5 The explosion and gernade effects are nice. Also the sound movement. When you are crawling through bushes, you can here the crunching noises and when you're in water as well.Control: 4.5/5 They kind have mess with the controls somewhat, but good overall.

{"product_name":"B003R783IY","description":"","reviewerName":"Joseph Sayre \"Venom Computing\"","summary":"\"It offers improved accelleration, and a slightly higher top speed\"","reviewText":"The thing with Need for speed in the years since the last Hot Pursuit title (which was HP 2 on the PS2) was it drifted away from what Need for Speed really was. It brought in a new era of games with underground, but underground wasn't about the cops and the exotics, it was about fast cars you find on the street every day. Basically, it was Need for Speed: Fast and Furious Edition. The trend continued for a long time, and continued onto the new consoles with Most Wanted, Carbon, and Undercover. The thing was, as they drifted further from the roots of what need for speed was all about, the games lost the essence of what Need for Speed is. And honestly, the name says it all.Enter NFS: HP, a new revolution or a \"reset\" to the series, that picks up right where the PS2 dropped it off. Hot Pursuit comes back to what Need for Speed is all about, and why so many of us were hooked on the PS1 and PS2 versions of the games (yes the PC gamers too) Driving fast cars, getting away from the cops, and going so darn fast you have trouble dodging a car because your brain can't register its there before your taillight makes a beeline through your skull.But, that's enough background, on to the review.The good:The Menus:Simple, easy to read, and coherent, even down to the Autolog, and all of its messages and information. The menu's are very easy to navigate and easy to understand. The Career Map reminds me of Burnout 3, which I'm not surprised about really considering Criterion made the game, the menu works the same too, you highlight a sign and select an event to run. You only start with a few for either Cops or Racers and you earn more as you level up and complete events. The Map doesn't look cluttered, and is presented intuitively (and flashy to boot)if you hate driving around all the time to find events you'll love this. They also included a free roam if you want it. The Career menu has sister menus accessed by the buttons on the controller rather than finding them through the main menu which is also nice. Everything is just, easy.The GameplayThe best way i can put this is if you somehow made a lovechild of Burnout 3, and NFS: HP2. you'd get this game. The cars handle weightly like Hot Pursuit 2's do, but they FEEL like Burnout 3 cars, (touchy and drifty)Its actually a surprisingly good balance. The car's are much more subject to speed loss and much less receptive of wall bouncing than Burnout as well. What's the most interesting is the game's approach to damage in normal driving. You can be wrecked, and you can total your car (at least i think so, i never actually managed to do it) but you can cause this by brawling like in burnout. What's so strange, is though you CAN do it, it slows you down so much you'll probably lose if you do it on purpose all the time. Despite its flashy crashes and damage, Hot Pursuit rewards you for driving clean, not dirty in relation to bumping and grinding.Picking Sides:You can race as a Racer, or a Cop, in multiple race modes like you would think including time trials, i'm going to say \"Burning Laps\" as a reference because they feel so burnout. (game calls them Previews BTW) Or cool stuff like taking out the racers before they finish as a cop, with much more. I won't tell you everything, but each mode is attacked a bit differently.An Arsenal, IN YOUR TRUNK!:Later you unlock some \"Potent Treasures\" as a racer or a cop, like EMP, or Spike Strips which gives a new element to races including them, you're not just a danger to the cops or the racers on the opposite faction, you're dangerous to everyone. Imagine its two racers left, the cops are right behind, and you've got a spike, you can shake the cops with a spike and fight your rival to the end, or you can take HIM out and fight the cops yourself, or better yet, get him busted. Its decisions like this that make this game awesome online, and off.The Bad:There are issues with everything, HP is an arcade racer, it doesn't behave a predictably or as harshly as a game like Forza, Gran Turismo, of NFS Shift will. They're not the same kind of game That said, there are some issues i have with the game:Some cars seem underwhelming in a class:The balance at times will make itself much more evident online but in my experience, some cars seem to be bottom tier in the tier they are in, either due to the fact that they handle like a barge or that they have a rather low top speed. We'll see online soon enough, but i'm sure there will be a \"Competitive Car\" as any racing game has when it goes mainstream public after about a month or two. Still there are no settings to dial in so maybe we'll see a good mixed community.Pacing:Though good, i thought it moved a bit, slow. I got to level 4 racer in about 4 hours, that said, i unlocked a lot of stuff in that time. I guess i just had this notion that i'd level up faster, and then it kind of hit me that to get to max level, i would have to play a long time, and that likely without the online component i'd need to do a lot of re-racing to get there. Though i could be wrong entirely, it certainly does not seem that career will net you max level.Learning CurveThis game has got some really impressive difficulty, to win, i had to try, to put that in perspective i've had to try to win in Most wanted, once, and that was the last time i did. However for a newcomer, it may be very frustrating to compete with opponents. But once you get the hang of it, its fun.These things don't take really ANYTHING from the game as a whole. This is the best TRUE Need For Speed title in a decade, and Criterion needs to be praised along with EA for once for finally taking the Need For Speed series back to where it came from. Its a Missing Niche in gaming, and it was very missed.Excellent title for any age, Strongly Recommended for PC, 360, or PS3","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2010"}
