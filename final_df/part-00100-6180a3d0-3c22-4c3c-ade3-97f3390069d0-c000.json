{"product_name":"B00004YUWA","description":"Icoweaves the tale of a young boy trying to escape his  imprisonment in a large, vacant castle. Along the way, he discovers another  captive--a beautiful princess named Yorda. Players control Ico with the goal of  escaping the castle with the princess safely in hand.Although it looks like an adventure game and has some rudimentary action  sequences, Ico is mostly about solving puzzles. Players will run, jump, and  climb their way through the gargantuan castle as well as figure out which  objects and environments are interactive. Yorda is very much a damsel in  distress, and isn't nearly as capable as Ico. A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike. The  ambient soundtrack and simple controls let the player focus on the tasks at  hand. Sony has crafted a very unique game that anyone can play. Few games are as  elegant in their simplicity as this puzzler from Sony.--Raymond M.

Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Stunning","reviewText":"ICO is a dream of a game...you'll be hard pushed to find a bad review of it from anyone. There is a simplicity to it that's very rare to find. It's a third person adventure, but there are no menus, health gauges, hit counters, files, items or memos anywhere to be found. The only thing you have to interact with are your two characters and the gigantic location they are lost inside.ICO begins as a young boy is imprisoned in an ancient fortress by a troop of soldiers. It's made clear that he is considered cursed because of a strange birth defect (he has been born with horns), and also, that he is not the first. But luck is on his side as, for the first time in who knows how many centuries, he manages to survive the incarceration and finds himself free of his stone coffin, but still trapped withing the castle walls. Your job is to get him out of the castle alive.The castle itself makes ICO breathtaking. A simply dazzling piece of virtual architecture, it sprawls off into the distance as you stand on ramparts and balconies, taking in the view from all around. The game takes you from a vast \"burial\" chamber through many different environments, including many staircases, vaults, towers and even gardens and a windmill. Yes, much of the gameplay takes place outside, as the castle has extensive grounds, and you'll find yourself wandering thorugh bright sunshine among fluttering pigeons for a lot of your time. The castle is not a spooky or ominous ruin, it's simply a building, and many of the areas are beautiful and peaceful havens of tranquil silence. You'll soon realise that there is no music in ICO, but the sense of location sound is perfect. Most of it seems to be birdsong and weather and atmosphere effects, set off by your tiny echoing footsteps as you run around the environment. It all establishes even further just how real the situation feels. The effect of bright sunlight on some of the grassy areas is wonderfully created, and yet the atmosphere is one of a crisp winter chill. I find it hard to describe, but the game actually made me feel cold, as though I was putting myself right into that location, and thats something that very few games succeed in achieving.But onto the more important aspect of the game, Ico (the character) has a companion that he meets early on, a reed-thin and fragile girl in white called Yorda, with whom he bonds instantly. They do not speak the same language (Yorda's seldom spoken lines are not translated, where as Iko's language is given English subtitles), but they become united in their wish to escape the castle. Now comes the meat of the gameplay. Yorda is weak and defenceless, but only she can open the magically locked doors that act as end-of-level checkpoints. To reach these doors, Ico must lead, help or make a pathway for Yorda so that both of them can advance. Ico has a variety of moves, such as jumping, rope swinging and climbing, but Yorda can do nothing unaided, and success relies on your solving many puzzles to assist her in reaching the sealed doors each time along with Ico.Too bad that it's not always that simple, because there are dark forces dwelling within this otherwise tranquil castle. When Ico first finds Yorda, she is in a cage, and it seems that something doesn't want her to leave the place. Every now and then, black shadowy figures erupt from the ground in attempt to drag Yorda back to where she came from. Herein lies the combat section of the game, and although it is a very simple job to whack the shadow creatures into oblivion, the skill lies in getting rid of them quickly before they can drag Yorda off into the darkness. The creatures work in packs, with some surrounding Iko while others bundle Yorda off towards a black portal in the ground where she will sink into oblivion. And if this happens at any time, the game ends. No second chances here! Plus some of the shadow creatures can fly...maybe you can imagine now that the combat portions of the game cannot be treated lightly. Luckily you can save your progress at stone chairs that are dotted liberally throughout the castle, and you should not miss any chance to do so, as they can often be at the end of a very complex puzzle section.Puzzles...that's what the basis of all non-combat sections are about. Every part of the castle requires a different approach. Every seemingly unclimbable tall tower, or sealed off room, or high-walled dead end can be cleared with a bit of thought and exploration. You'll spend many happy hours working out what to do, and things really do get quite fiendish at times, so completion of some levels is supremely satisfying. Remember that you have to work un-prompted, there are no items, codes or clues to carry around. Everything you need will be in the area you are currently stuck in. It's pure genius.I could go on, but it would spoil things for the new player to reveal any more about the story. Rest assured though that there is a final confrontation, and many moments that will have you reaching for your hanky. I'll just add a few of my favourite moments to round of this review.Yorda trusts Ico completely. She won't jump across gaps alone, but if you go to the other side and promise to catch her...try it and see what happens- it's totally heartwarming.If Yorda gets too far away from Ico, she is at risk of capture...the game cleverly adds random shadow creature attacks if this happens, or you stay too long in one place.You can hold Yorda's hand! And if Ico runs while doing so, Yorda stumbles delicately behind him never complaining or letting go, despite the obvious effort it costs her to keep up.The double doors at the castle gate!! I daren't add any more, but when you finally get these two monolithic doors to open and freedom beckons, the most moving and exciting last level of the game begins. Plus the ending! (hankies again!)There's also a replay bonus of getting Yorda's language translated on your second play-through - it worked for me, I was so in love with Yorda at the end of the game I had no hesitation is playing it all over again to find out what she was saying. Hopefully you will too - the game requires that you want these characters to find freedom, and it succeeds in amazing style. As ICO provides such a totally satisfying and emotional experience, I really can't fault it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2006"}

Sanford","summary":"Ready to rawk (mostly)","reviewText":"The biggest problem with ROCK BAND 3, and I'm surprised more people haven't brought this up, is this:You can't have three people playing guitar, bass, and keyboards at the same time. UNLESS you go into a different mode which disables scoring as a vocalist. This means,you can still have a singer, or singers, but they can't fail or score. Also, you can't go on Xbox live in this mode. Even if you have ONLY three people playing, if they're playing those three instruments (b/g/k),  it will still go into this mode. Or you can opt to NOT go into the special mode and be without one of those three instruments.So, yeah, you can have 7 people play (bass, guitar, keyboards,drum, lead vocals, 2 harmonizing vocals), but the singers aren't really doing anything. There's lots of info about this design flaw, as well as glitches, around the web.Otherwise, the song selection is great. I had Rock Band 1, so it automatically imported those songs, as well as my DLC (you gotta pay tenbucks to download all but 5 of the RB2 songs. I haven't done this yet.). What little I've played of the career path seems better; you unlock clothes and other goodies by completing various tasks, like creating a custom character, and song challenges. The graphics are otherwise pretty similar. There's more sorting options, and similar UI improvements, which add to the overall flow of the game. It's easier to drop out, if you want to take a break, without forcing the band to back all the way out. And, of course, playing the keyboard is a complete blast, esp in pro mode.It's a good game, and probably the last Rock Band, but the keyboard issue is a major drawback.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2011"}

This game is by far the greatest RPG I've ever played. It is big and sprawling and almost literally allows you to do anything you want. After the character creation process and the initial 'start' of the game, you walk outside and are free to go *anywhere* and do *anything* you want. You don't even have to pursue the main game, and there will still be 100+ hours of things to do.I played this game for several months non-stop and never once got tired of it. Even now, a few years later, I still have memories of doing things in the game that are so vivid that I feel like I've been there myself and actually *did* do those things.A quick anecdote: I was used to playing console RPGs (old-school types, like Breath of Fire, etc.) in which everything was linear, and you (and everyone else who played the game) had to progress at the same pace and in the same way. This meant if you came to a river, you'd have to wait until you found the 'boat' or 'canoe' and then you'd have access to that part of the map. In Morrowind, I chose to play as a mage, and one of my starting spells was \"Waterwalking\". I didn't know what to make of this at first, but then I used it and my character was walking across the water! I wasn't used to having that kind of ability right at the start of the game, but that's what makes this game so great -- you can do virtually anything, and at your own pace.The world is huge and the cities you can visit are numerous. You can spend time in each one almost as if you were in a real city and you were touring it (especially Vivec).The expansions are good also, but naturally they aren't as large as the original game.Just an amazing, unbelievable experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Rogan Derrick","summary":"Great","reviewText":"I love 64, I thought it was the best console when it came out in 1995.

The gameplay and story of this game is amazing and much better thanSuper Street Fighter IV, which I also purchased.Story: The story was decent overall, but it was a little confusing. For a newcomer like me, the text that they had on the touch screen was very helpful. It described everything that I wouldn't normally know from just watching the clip scenes. I admit that I had to go online websites for a better comprehension of the story, but people who played the past DOA games wouldn't be as confused as me. The characters are very unique, and the end-of-the-chapter clip scenes look amazing, especially the ending to chapter 5. The other clip scenes, however, look kinda bland. The Chronicle Mode lasted for four hours for me, which was shorter than I expected. In my opinion, I think this was more like a tutorial mode because they were teaching the basics in every chapter.Gameplay: Simply amazing. It was challenging yet fun to try again over and over again. The complexity is much higher than any other fighting game I've played, and I enjoyed the immersion with the 3D environment. The touch screen provides a list of attacks along with their button commands. Beginners could press the move they want to use, or they could use the list to help them do the moves themselves and master it. There are plenty of characters to play as, and each one is fun to play as.Overall: The game is great, and it has many features. I highly recommend it to fighting game fans and people who have a small library of 3DS games. Personally, my favorite fighter is Tengu and my favorite stage is Geothermal Power Plant.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2011"}

Their big claim to fame is borderlands which is essentially if you put world of warcrafts boring quest system into a wasteland, put it in first person mode, then tout how it has millions of guns but the fact is 1 out of 10,000 are actually an upgrade (repainting the same crummy pistol 5,000 times doesn't make 5,000 different guns) and finally start pimping DLC for the game before it even releases and then keep releasing more to nickel and dime your customers to death by turning a 60 dollar turd into a 100 dollar turd. They also made duke nukem forever which as we all know is a giant steaming pile of you know what and is a god awful abortion from start to finish. The best games they actually made were the brothers in arms games which aren't as terrible as those other two games but its still incredibly sterile, generic and uninspired. BIA is your basic mediocre WW2 shooter and nothing else. They have a few other games under their belt but they are all titles no one really cares about and faded into obscurity as soon as they were released. Bottom line is Gearbox is a terrible game maker and this is a terrible game.Now for a quickie about colonial marines.The story is nothing short of fan fiction written by someone who cannot write but still posts to their blog and believes themselves to be a great writer. It's kind of like how a young girl will take pictures of furniture sitting in a shadow in black and white and then think they are really deep and brooding for taking such artistic photographs when in fact it's just garbage. They tried to wink at the fans so hard their eyes have fallen out because of it. Everything about it feels very amateur, boring and forced. It feels more like they did a sci-fi channel original aliens movie, or something that went direct to video.The game is buggy as you can get. I've flown out the side of things and floated high in the air stuck. I've had allies that would stick in walls. Hell I found out in section you were supposed to be stealthy starting out and I just ran past every alien and once I passed them they forgot about me and I finished a level without firing a shot. I see environmental objects get stuck in things and so on.All the pretty and cool looking screenshots and videos I've been seeing for over a year from now weren't from the same game they released. You can easily find comparison videos showing the game released looks just awful compared to the \"in game footage\" they showed in the past.Multiplayer is very sterile and pretty much what you'd expect. It's so boring in fact that multiplayer will be a ghost town in 2 months.The game play its pretty much call of duty. It's just a mix of \"it's the last stand....again\" and \"quick run through fast as you can\" with some boring corridor stalking in between.I could go into great depth, I could go on and on naming other things I didn't like but you can read other Amazon reviews and see exactly what I've got to say.So really if you must play this, wait till its 10 dollars. Trust me it won't take very long before it gets there. And next time, don't pay full price for a Gearbox title.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2013"}

It has too much pop in as well as draw in and lag and it can be annoying at times especially in combat- Horse Control is simply out of control it may be easier to simply just walk- Mapping: One of the things I loved about Oblivion is that the map is detailed enough for you to find whatever it is that you need and get to where ever you have. This game it's difficult and the quest log doesn't help much eitherThere are other things to be considered which other folks have covered (such as bad camera, shoddy voice acting etc) but moving on...There are a few redemptive qualities of the game.Item stacking - how many times have you had to carry 5 duplicated of \"the short sword?\" this is a great idea that lightens the load and keeps me from running back and forth to a merchantMaking your own magic - just toss a few ingredients together a viola! You get something new!  A new power up or new potion and best of all you can do it right out of the gate.Tons of enemies to fight - This may be one sore spot I didn't like about Oblivion is that there was just too much time between fights where you can just roam at will and not find another character.

It doesn't help either, that the Euorpean PC release has had 4 patch updates since it's release in late May early June and one could only wonder if the 360 version will get one (and hoepfully it doesn't start a trend of patching console games)I haven't tried the multiplayer yet so I have nothing to say on it.My final score on this with be 3 out of 5 stars","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2007"}

Coolest bad-guy spell Balrog is set so high and so far towards the end that you hardly use it at all except when you're about to defeat your enemy.YES if you like RTS/Strategy you'll LOVE this game, and if you REALLY like LOTR you'll LOVE this game, but I was kindof disappointed because I REALLLY wanted to capture the ring and bring Sauron on the battlefield.I figured this game would allow you to explore different scenarios ....(GAME SPOIL ALERT)....but when you capture the one ring....not much happens.You capture the one ring and all that happens is you get 4 power points or something stupid like that.  I mean CMON!  It's the ONE RING!!!I captured it and I expect BALROGS to be ERUPTING from the Earth and Sauron to march on the White city with his armies in TOE.  4 friggin'powerpointsmymousebutton!!!  Sheesh.Another thing is the Balrog itself.  It requires 20! powerpoints to reach the point where you can summon it and the respawn for summoning is like 15-20! minutes.  I took the White City on Hard in 20 minutes.  When you summon the Balrog it only stays for like 1-2 minutes and then disappears.  I was pretty dissappointed about that.I mean CMON!  Just think about it this way. (For the LOTR fans) What if the Captain of the Nazgul swallowed the One-Ring.  Suddenly you'd have SAURON, with a BODY, with his POWER, riding a FLYING-SERPENT!  BLAM!

{"product_name":"B00007KQC4","description":"Resident Evil 2 FOR GAMECUBE","reviewerName":"J. Jongeling \"slice of heaven\"","summary":"Resident Evil 2 for the Gamecube","reviewText":"Resident Evil 2 is easily one of the most fun and enjoyable games that has come out in the past decade. It scares you enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, but the difficulty level is set exactly right so it doesn't get you frustrated. Not to mention that both of the playable characters have two missions, and once you complete those, there are several different gameplay modes rewarded to the player for completing the missions. This enhances the game's replay value quite dramatically.So assuming that you have played this game on the original Playstation, I bet you're wondering what is different about the port offered on the Gamecube?Well, disappointingly enough, not much. The RE2 port is just that - a port. Naturally, however, the Gamecube is a much more advanced system capable of handling much faster polygonal rates, shading, texture, and load times. The overall look is a bit smoother, but not enough to make you say \"wow!\". More like \"hmmm...interesting\". The blood is not so polygonal, and the characters are a bit smoother. If there really is any difference in the load time, it is minimal. The controls are about as good as the original - pending that you can get used to the game on a Gamecube controller. The CMVs are not changed at all. Nothing smoother, nothing overdubbed, nothing brighter or duller, not faster or slower. This can either be a curse or a blessing for you, depending on how devoted you are to the original CMV's, as the CMVs are identical to the Playstation's in every way.So while I can't really justify owning a copy of Resident Evil 2 for the Gamecube, I would recommend it to anybody who has never played the game or does not have access to the PS version of it. Resident Evil 2 is a great game, and it continues to hold its value even to this day. If Capcom would have just done the same thing for RE2 and RE3 that they did for the original, I think we would have probably the best series in history on our hands. However, CAPCOM got lazy and decided to port the rest of the titles. Too bad, so sad.So to sum it up, if you currently own Resident Evil 2 for the Playstation, save your money because the Gamecube version is really not all that much better.Original game rating and contents = 9/10\"lazy\" Gamecube port rating = 2/10final score on the re-release for the Gamecube = 4/10","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2006"}

Unless a handful of heroes can protect the remaining crystals, the world will fall into ruin. Set off on a grand adventure in the finest version of Final Fantasy V ever released!","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Not the Best in the Series but Still Good","reviewText":"The first time Final Fantasy V was releasd in America was with the Final Fantasy Anthology package.  Now the game is where it belongs.  On a handheld system.  The GBA is pretty much at the end of its life, but it still manages to get a satisfactory game every now and then.  Final Fantasy V is by no means the best in the series, but it is, for the most part, an RPG that deserves appreciation and acclaim.Final Fantasy V begins with a character named Bartz witnessing a meteorite come hurdling to the ground.  When he goes to investigate he meets up with Lenna.  Lenna is searching for her father who has gone off to the wind shrine to check on the wind crystal.  Lately, the wind has been weak, and it can only be because something is wrong with the wind crystal.  In addition to meeting Lenna, Bartz also meets Galuf, a man who has lost his memory in light of the meteorite crashing.  All he can remember is his name, and that he too must also go to the wind shrine.  Eventually Bartz decides to travel with them, and so your adventure begins.In truth, Final Fantasy V doesn't have a good storyline... at least when compared to Final Fantasy IV and all the Final Fantasy games that appeared after the fifth installment.  It's pretty basic and generic.  This is obvious by how fast you'll meet your main party, and how much more emphasis is put on gameplay.  These characters are not well developed nor is the story full of unbelievable plot twists.  Except Final Fantasy V was not meant to be about storyline.  It's all about the gameplay, and that's where Final Fantasy V excels the most.As with Final Fantasy IV before it, Final Fantasy V uses the ATB battle system.  All your characters stand on one side of the screen while all the enemies stand on the other.  When a character's ATB gauge fills up, you'll be able to issue commands.  The game then plays out in turn based fashion.  Final Fantasy V is simple, yet it's a lot of fun, and it also provides a challenge.  The gameplay is enhanced even more by the games complex job system.The job system is extremely complex, even by todays standards.  As you progress through the game you'll obtain job classes for your characters.  There are plenty of jobs.  Monks, thieves, white mages, black mages, and plenty more.  Each of them learn several different abilities all of which can and will be useful to you on your journey.  When you select a job with a certain character, you'll have to battle to earn ability points so that they can learn all the abilities they can.  Some abilities are more useful than others, and the possibilities are endless.  Also, once a character learns an ability, you can change jobs and have them equip it.  So a black mage could, in fact, use white magic, provided he's learned the ability to do it.You'll spend a lot of time on the field battling to get ability points.  The more abilities you learn, the more ability points you'll need for the next.  This is fine and all, but most enemies don't give up loads of ability points.  So the game puts a huge emphasis on battling.  This is also seen by the low amounts of experience enemies also give off.  Leveling up is a slow process.  The good news is battling is fun, especially with the job system in place.  Unless everyone's jobs are the same, there's a nearly endless possibility of commands you can give in the middle of battle.Final Fantasy V Advance sports the same extras as all the previous Final Fantasy re-releases on the GBA do.  An extra dungeons and some extra bosses, and that's about it.  Nothing too big, but worth the price nonetheless.  It'll probably take you 20-30 hours to complete Final Fantasy V.  It's not filled to the brim with secrets like future Final Fantasy titles, but mastering all the jobs will really keep you busy for several hours alone.  It's also cool because along with the extra dungeons and bosses, you'll get four new job classes.  This only adds more to the already complex gameplay.Graphically, Final Fantasy V is a little dated, even by GBA standards.  It looks far better than it did in Final Fantasy Anthology.  It's much smoother and does have a little bit of an update, but it doesn't go the extra mile it could've.  Enemies still only flash to attack your characters, and they're hardly animated.  At least the game has a great soundtrack.  Final Fantasy V goes on to show why the Super Nintendo era for Final Fantasy music was one of the best in the series.  The game just sounds really good.Final Fantasy V is a golden treat for Final Fantasy fans.  It may have a weak storyline, but what it lacks in story it more than makes up for in gameplay.  It's not the best in the series, but it's still a really fun game.The Good+It's a lot of fun to play+The job system makes for a lot of variety in your party+Great music+The minor graphic updates are welcome+Bonus dungeons and bosses+There's a huge emphasis on gameplayThe Bad-Not enough of a graphical update-Weak story and characters","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2006"}

{"product_name":"B001E8VB6O","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"Batman's a bad ass. Just give him time to get there.","reviewText":"Let me start by saying I really like this game. The Unreal graphics engine is lovely overall and the voice acting is engrossing. This really does take Batman games to a new level. And the gameplay is very much an original experience in a lot of ways. What bogged the entirety of the experience down for me was how long it took Batman to gain all of his abilities. You're practically through with the campaign before you're the badass you're meant to be. And if you've given up on the experience before then, you end up missing out on something truly phenomenal. Another drawback is that the game often leaves you with little clue as to what you're supposed to do next. And the bat's stealth capabilities are kept to a minimum in this regard. Too many times you'll find yourself in hand to hand brawls with thugs because you've no good way to take them out stealthily. You don't realize just how limited your character is at first until you find yourself being sniped from 100 yards away and you're left with nothing to do about it but hide or run a snake pattern at the gunman until you're close enough to take him out. That doesn't mean this isn't a good game. It's a great game which offers up a fair share of innovations that I look forward to seeing other games picking up on. Just don't expect this to be the greatest gaming experience you've ever had (like some would lead you to believe that it is). I'm a fighter fan, but the combat system here wasn't something that caught me in any major way. It is certainly unique though! The game's style, storyline, voicing and the fact that it's Batman make it feel like a 5 at times. And the true beauty of this game is the puzzling. Solving 100% of the puzzles was more addictive than most any collecting I've ever done in any video game before. It's a game you should definitely own. There is nothing else like it out there at the moment. It just had its pitfalls for me. You, like many others, may think it's a 5 in all respects. Regardless, you should own it!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002I0HAC6","description":"","reviewerName":"MJM - The Franchise of the VGF","summary":"A decent addition to the Duke Nukem Family.","reviewText":"I would give this game three and a half stars, but since I can't I figured I would be generous and go with four. It's not a must play game by any means, but it's also not fit to be a beer coaster either. It's an enjoyable experience, but honestly you're feelings towards the franchise as a whole would will be the deciding factor as to if you should pick it up now, or wait.This game has been in development for over ten years, so for someone to say with a straight face that this game feels dated, really needs to put things in prospective. Anyone with any common sense wouldn't expect this to be a FPS of this generation, it just goes without saying, at least I would assume.If you are a Duke Nukem fan and/or just a fan of the 90's style FPS all together, than you'll most likely enjoy this game. The game isn't without it's faults, but for what it is, it's not too bad. It's very tongue and cheek and by no means does it try to hide that fact, if anything it smashes it in your face like a clown with a cream pie.Would I recommend this game to someone who exclusively plays games like Call of Duty and Halo, probably not, but for someone with a diversified palate in gaming this may just satisfy.In today's day and age the old school gets no respect, however as the latest Mortal Kombat showed, there's nothing wrong with going back to a different time for the sake of nostalgia. I'm not saying every genre should jump on the old school band wagon, or even that they need to, but in my opinion there's nothing wrong with attending a class every now and then.Now on to the game itself, which by the way I've only played the single player campaign so that is all I'm reviewing.First issue, which honestly really isn't that much of an issue for me personally, but other's may not agree, is the graphics. They are dated but considering when this game was started I would have to say it was pretty much expected that this wouldn't compare to Crysis 2. Truthfully it's not the graphics that make the game anyway, sure it makes for a prettier package, but over all as we all know it's the gift inside that makes the present something special.Second would be the story, the backdrop and pretty much all the dialog are of a very immature nature. Someone looking for a deep story and well developed characters may want to move along, there's nothing here to see. However f you're not one of those \"butts so tight they squeak\" kind of people and you're able to let your inner child out to play then you'll be fine. It's light hearted and meant to be played with a smile on your face.Finally, this by no means is a run and gun kind of game, there is a lot of down time and the story does move along at a slow pace, especially in the beginning. So if you're an action junkie, who wants all the explosions and bullets flying all over the place nonstop, then again this is not for you.Bottom line, if you're a fan of the series take the risk, the game is a lot of fun. If you have no idea who Duke Nukem is, then you may want to wait until the price drops.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2011"}

Also the vehicle repair tool that you just grind against the side of a car to make it run again.  What's the point of that?

That's the beauty of these games.  You don't need to be a fan of the sport to get hooked on them.  And I can almost guarantee that you WILL get hooked on them.The best part of the this series has always been the simple control.  It will take you minutes to learn, but you'll spend forever mastering it.  Once you have the buttons properly laid out in your mind, scoring huge combos will begin to become second-nature.The single-player game is awesome, about as good as Tony Hawk 2, but with the Revert move you can link vert tricks as well as grinds.  There are some more flatland tricks as well.  The objectives are imaginative and funny, the graphics are impressive, but far from the best you'll see on the system, and the soundtrack is outstanding.Play with a friend and the two of you will have a very hard time stopping.  The two-player mode is flawless, (except for very brief, very rare slowdown).  All of the two-player modes return from previous Hawk titles, including trick attack, HORSE, and my favorite, graffiti.The game has almost infinite replay value, as you can create your own skater to use in all of the game's modes, and, better still, create your own skatepark and save it to your memory card to play in on any future occasion.Pure gaming brilliance.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-28-2003"}

{"product_name":"B004EDJOYC","description":"","reviewerName":"The Mandrew \"Coop\"","summary":"disappointed?  not by a long shot.","reviewText":"In reading a lot of reviews of SGW, I was hesistant to buy it.  If, like me, you gravitate towards the sniper-role in most shooters (and you know who you are), this game seemed like gold to me,but there was a semi consistent theme of it being a let-down.  To me, this couldnt be farther from the truth.Had I paid full retail for it, perhaps I'd be a bit more critical, but even then, this feeds the headshot urge in a big way.  From stealthing on enemy encampments, to utilizing cover and misdirection after each shot, I felt it to be as realistic as I wanted it to be.  I havent tried it on hard yet, but I will, if for no other reason than to accurately portray real-life conditions such as elevation, windage, range, etc. I think this game is as easy or as hard as you want it to be, and frankly, that's a trait that's missing too often with today's games, i.e., \"hard\" setting isn't about realism and accuracy, its about smarter and more numerous NPCs, or limiting capabilities of the player.The graphics got some bad reviews, but I dont see it.  They arent Uncharted, but they are lush and atomospheric, strong details with foilage, and accurate ambient noise.  The Bullet-Cam is a lot of fun, except towards the end, when youve done so many headshots (or two, or three kill shots) that the quicktime cut-away and seemingly floating arterial spray become repetitive.  Still, it does add satifaction to an otherwise static shot (and sometimes gives away accidental recon of the surrounding area of the kill-shot)There are problems: sometimes buggy graphics and textures.  Insultingly repetitive spanish dialogue (did the developers really think we wouldnt notice the guys having the same coversation, over and over?).  Occasionally arbitrary NPCs, i.e., sometimes they will not notice their buddies laying dead next to them, and sometimes they wlll spot you in cover that there is no possible way they couldve seen you, especially frustrating after successfully stealthing almost an entire level.  My biggest gripe is the Out-Of-Bounds countdown of 5 seconds...not only does it make an essentially linear game moreso (come on developers, its a jungle!) but actually knocked me out a couple times because I was running and got too far into the out of bounds territory (again, 5 seconds guys?).  I've never liked faux-sandbox game-play, and this comes to the forefront on many occasions.All that being said, I'll play it through again in a few months or so, and in the same way SOCOM (the early games) had strong replay value, I think SGW does as well.  If, when playing any shooter, you instinctively pick up the sniper rifle, trust my mutual admiration and love for games celebrating the long-shot, and buy this game, I promise you, it is worth the money it costs.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000IMYKQ0","description":"The Wii Nunchuk controller is a secondary controller that adds even more innovation to the next generation of gaming, and does it all with less physical movement.Used in conjunction with the standard Wii remote, certain games need the Nunchuk controller for additional control options. Contoured perfectly to fit a player's hand,The Wii Nunchuk (left) connects directly to the Wii remote.View larger.the Nunchuk controller builds on the simplicity of the Wii Remote controller. The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance. Just be careful not to knock out your significant other, or bruise the dog, severely, while using one, or two Nunchuk controllers.","reviewerName":"ssteussy \"steussys\"","summary":"Perfect for sitting in a box.","reviewText":"It's a shame I don't play more games on the Wii, or that the few I did play never used these.

We have obviously come a long way.I must give the creators of this one a lot of credit. RPG's for all consoles for the past few years have usually been great graphically, but always so darn short. This one has a lot of depth, for the most part is not linear, and what a great story of which you can follow it in any order you wish. It was great just walking the country side. It seems like you can walk forever.Some minor annoyances but overall a good job. Unless I have not met any yet, it does get a little repetative walking the country side and only running into wolves as your foes.

With their latest entry in the Ratchet and Clank series, the team managed to once more up the ante and make the tried and true formula feel fresh, while retaining the elements that have drawn people to the series since its beginning.A Crack in Time introduces a new character, Alister Azimuth, who, much to Ratchet's surprise, is a fellow lombax - the first one he has ever encountered. Azimuth has been in exile, spending his time seeking The Great Clock, an entity with the capacity to turn back time, in an effort to undo the disaster that befell the lombax race. Coincidentally, Ratchet's longtime partner Clank, mysteriously vanished following the last game's cliffhanger ending, winds up in The Great Clock, as well as in the hands of an old foe, Dr. Nefarious. A Crack in Time is definitely the most narrative-heavy Ratchet and Clank title, and to great effect, as the game maintains the series' clever humor and witty one-liners, but adds a sense of depth and investment to the characters, while also providing cohesion and, in some instances, closure to the long-running series as a whole.Adding to the immersion are solid voice acting and beautiful visuals. The cut scenes in particular rival - even outdo, in some regard - Pixar films. The in-game visuals, less impressive than the pre-rendered CGI cut scenes, are also stunning, bringing across beautiful, color-laden worlds rife with countless explosions. It's a visual treat.Of course, these newfound narrative chops don't hinder Insomniac's natural ability to craft tight, polished gameplay, either, which is at the series' best in A Crack in Time. Staying true to its roots, the game has some of the best platforming around, and well as the series' staple, frenetic gunplay.The huge arsenal, as always, is incredibly creative and a joy to toy around with. Each spin on typical gun classes (Shotgun, rifle, etc) is as unique as ever, such as a living organism's mating call acting as the game's shotgun, and mesh nicely with the other, less typical weapons.One of the most pleasant surprises for me was the Plasma Striker, a long-range crossbow akin to my old favorite, the Flux Rifle. The game also retains some past weapons, such as the Groovitron Glove, which throws out a disco ball and causes all enemies in the vicinity to break out into dance, and a new addition of the fan favorite Ryno.While the gunplay itself remains largely similar to past installments, new enemies and the whole new awesome arsenal keep it completely fresh. Equally impressive is the outstanding level design, which Insomniac built off of the concept of warping time and keeps gameplay fun. Catching some of Ratchet's old pirate nemeses crashing to earth in the form of time-frozen scenery was a great nod to past titles, and aspects such as that constantly display the inventiveness of the development team.Mainstay gadgets, such as the Swingshot and gravity boots, return as well, but most notable is the new addition, the Hoverboots, which Ratchet to traverse environments more quickly and add another element of frenetic speed to the gameplay. They also serve as a bit of a replacement for Clank, who spends most of this game, for the first time, separate from Ratchet.Clank has his own segments, which are some of the freshest and strongest puzzling the series has ever seen. His segments revolve around time, and using time pads to send multiple pre-recorded versions of himself to accomplish tasks in conjunction with each other. It's a little bit complicated to imagine, but incredibly clever, and executed nicely.Also expanded in A Crack in Time is ship navigation, with various galactic sectors to explore. Along with adding a nice element of exploration, it does open the world up a bit more. Unfortunately, the aerial battles leave a bit to be desired in terms of both difficult and interest, but it isn't much of a complaint.Ratchet and Clank: A Crack in Time is an impressively polished, clever, and fun game that is likely to fly under the radar amidst a packed fall season in gaming. The fact that after so many iterations, Insomniac was able to piece everything together so nicely and that people are still interested in the series serves as a testament to consistency and excellent execution put forth. I don't think I'll ever tire of the Ratchet and Clank games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2010"}

W. Mullins","summary":"Another Call of Duty","reviewText":"There is certainly nothing revolutionary about CoD 4, more evolutionary. The DNA from the last 3 CoDs can clearly be seen in this game. The new modern setting is a nice change and it is nice to be shooting someone other than Germans. But like the last 3 games you will spend a fair amount of time dazed from shell shock as you crawl around and progress down the very linear story. There are of course improvements like being able to shoot through certain bits of cover, which is cool and annoying in equal parts, but at least a bit more realistic. The weapons all look very realistic and are accurate representations of their real world models, expect perhaps in the ballistics department. But to be fair this is a video game. The single player game is fairly short, but you will get a good mix of missions at least, from sneaking to all out attack. Like all CoDs before it though you will spend quite a bit of time fending off wave after wave of bad guys. The save system in this one is at least pretty good. The levels of difficulty are pretty good with veteran being so hard you really feel you have achieved something when you beat it. Actually veteran difficulty is so hard that when I finish the game on veteran I am going to shoot the disc with a shotgun.  And speaking of achievements, all the 360 achievements are pretty good, making a couple play through even more enjoyable. All in all I think CoD 4 is a great game and well worth the time and money, though I don't think it has, or even could of, lived up to the hype preceding its release.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2007"}
{"product_name":"B003O6HLOK","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"An experience that puts story and spectacle ahead of all else","reviewText":"The only other product out there that I can reasonably compare to Asura's Wrath would be Telltale's excellentThe Walking Dead. Both Asura's Wrath and The Walking Dead tread the line that marks what can be classified as a \"video game\". By making gameplay a far smaller priority than the games' main goal of telling a story, these games would be much more suited to be labeled as Interactive Digital Stories as opposed to games. But the similarities end there. Asura's Wrath is a very, very different experience than The Walking Dead is. And it's also one of the most surprising, original, and amazing games to come out of the PS360 generation.Taking heavy queues from Japanese mythology, Asura's Wrath puts you in the shoes of Asura, one of 8 Guardian Generals - ancient demigods who protect the world from an evil entity known as the Gohma. The Gohma manifests itself as horrific monsters, often resembling animals, who terrorize the human tribes of the world. Early in the game, Asura is betrayed by his fellow Guardian Generals, his wife murdered, and his powerful priestess daughter abducted to be used as a tool to fight the Gohma. The game tells the story of Asura seeking revenge against the Generals who betrayed him, using his incredible powers which are channeled through his wrath. The story is told in an episodic nature that closely resembles episodes of anime, and also has heavy doses of hardcore science fiction as well. Japanese mythology, anime, science fiction - it's a heady mix, to be sure, but what is amazing is how well it all comes together, and how it is all incredibly brought to life by CyberConnect2 (of the .hack series) and Capcom.Gamers who are considering buying this game should be well aware that a large chunk of their time spent with the game will not involve much gameplay. Yes, there are very decent melee combat sections, mostly consisting of Asura fighting the Gohma, and also a handful of fast paced rail shooting sections as well. But the major feature of Asura's Wrath is its brilliant cinematic sequences, often pushed along with the aid of the player via quick time events. This is a game that if it connects with you, will have you very emotionally vested in Asura's struggle, and makes controlling his godly powers satisfying on a level that few games are. This game is about battles that pit gods vs. gods, and they're every bit as spectacular and epic as you can imagine...probably more so. Swords that are thousands of miles long, bosses that are as big as planets, and the ability to blast huge motherships out of orbit with your fists, are normal in the fantastic world of Asura's Wrath. The word \"epic\" is thrown around very often when describing video games nowadays, but Asura's Wrath gives new meaning to the word. It's very likely that you've never played any other game that will make you feel so good when you finally destroy a foe who has helped ruin Asura's existence. Few games are as satisfying as this one.But it isn't all spectacle here. The story of the game is very good. It's fantastic actually, and it lends emotional weight to every act of seismic violence that Asura commits. Asura will gain and lose allies, he will be felled and reborn, and he undertakes a journey of vengeance that is unparalleled by any other game I've played. Asura's Wrath makes Kratos' battles against ancient Greek titans seem like games of little league baseball.Asura's Wrath isn't for everybody. Gamers looking for something like Devil May Cry or a more traditional Capcom action game will be disappointed. But for gamers who love science fiction, Japanese mythology, and/or anime, and for gamers who appreciate a fantastic story that is told in the most unconventional way a story like this can be told, Asura's Wrath is pure gold. It is a game that has genuinely surprised more than any other game I've played in the PS360 era. And in an era where rehashing another sequel is the common way to pay the bills in AAA game development, Asura's Wrath's sheer exuberance and originality is a breath of fresh air.

And for us PS2-bound RPG hackers, the Final Fantasy series is a long string of notables.  Final Fantasy XII is no exception to this rule.  In fact, it proves once and for all that the PS2 is capable of remarkable quality IF (big if) the producers and directors are willing to put out the energy to get the best they can out of the machine.  And FF XII is definitely going to go down as one of the best.Artistically and technically the game is simply perfect.  The detailing is so fine that the shift between game resolution and actual CGI is barely noticeable.  Ivalice is an ornate world, replete with images that are a lush combination of Asian potentates and steam gothic science.  The game brings this to life memorable animating things down to the weather in the next sector over.  It is as real as an imaginary world can be.Character animation is every bit as good, and sound, and...  Well, take it from me, one can quibble about some details but, from a technical viewpoint the game is a pleasure to play.  Whether you are fighting or touring you are enmeshed in a cinematic tour de force.Story line is just about as good.  Your primary player is a 15 year old street kid named Vaan living in the recently conquered city of Rabinastre.  Vaan, and his best friend Penelo, are orphans, making their livings helping out at the local store and pickpocketing when the opportunity presents itself.  Vaan dreams of being a sky pirate, but the first order of business is sneaking into the palace and building a decent nest egg.  But all does not go as planned and Vaan is catapulted into the high adventure of helping a queen win back her kingdom - and keeping Ivalice from going belly up while he is at it.  If you have ever liked a Final Fantasy story you will love this one, a complex tale set against a huge world.Of course, nothing is perfect.  The real flaw in this game is that you almost have to buy the 'official' guide to play the whole game.  You can get through the main plot without much help, but over half the game is actually in the side quests, plus the clues to the 'special' weapons.  A straight run at the plot takes about 100 hours, but if you try to play all the game expect to put in about 250 hours or more.  However, it's not all that often that a purchased guide gets you an extra 100 hours of game play, so this is hardly a fatal flaw.The other flaw is that the characters are a bit flat.  The Final Fantasy series has a long tradition of ringing emotional as well as battle-oriented bells.  FF XII doesn't develop the same strong relationships.  If you look at some of the marketing materials it seems there were plans for an Ashe (the deposed princess) and Vaan pairing, but this simply doesn't happen.  Instead, the endearing personalities award go to Balthier, the wry tongued sky-pirate and his partner Fran, who is best described as the sexiest rabbit-eared battle maiden in the history of gaming.The only other negative comment I have is that there are way too many bats in the game.  Every time you turn around you are being chased by a horde of hero crazed blood drinkers.  Sheesh!One of the interesting innovations in battle is the use of gambits, which are literally action programs to control how characters act in battle.  You know, hit the weakest opponent, heal your friend from terminal slime, etc.  The commands are many and once you get the hang of them it is possible to have a team that does all its fighting automatically and only occasionally requires human intervention.  Obviously this is a big plus for those of us who don't really care for frantic console smashing.  For those that do like the intensity of realtime battle, that option is available too.All things considered, in a world where nothing is perfect, and RPGs are often loaded with bad compromises, Final Fantasy XII succeeds in being one of the best of the best.  It has too many facets to number, so everyone will find a few things they wish were better.  But there are few games that have inspired me to play them twice in rapid succession.  This is probably the last great RPG for the PS2 so get it and prepare for having your money's worth for a change.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2006"}

The amazon is by far the most powerful of all. She shoots arrows like a machine-gun, and can change her attacks to cold and fire arrows by only expending a few skill points. The zon is best if equiped with a mana/life stealing bow (putting a perfect skull in your bow is best).To enjoy the game more I simply would not go to the Hell difficulty at all. It is insanely difficult for even the most experienced players. There are monsters which are immune to every form of attack (physical, cold, fire, lightning, poison), so you cannot get very far with say, a barbarian with no elemental attacks or a sorc who specializes in only one school.On the multi player games, watch out for PK's (player killers).

Final Fantasy had a long story with a turn based battle system. It was my first adventure RPG. Final Fantasy wasn't like all those action platformers that ran wild in the Nintendo universe. It was more grown up and fulfilling than those non-thinking games out at the time.Story: 4/5This game taught me to read and to have patience, that not every minute in a game had to be filled with flash and heart pounding adventures. The story in Final Fantasy has been updated many times. Final Fantasy has been told on the NES, PS1 and GBA. Now it has made it's way onto the PSP. This time around they have added more tidbits to the major story line. I enjoy a good remake and the story was redone enough for me to enjoy it.Sound: 3/5It's hard to update a Final Fantasy music soundtrack that is over 20 years old because it still stands up to the test of time. Square Enix has added some new beats with the same hauntingly mystic sounds the will follow you into your dreams. I enjoyed the music to this game.Graphics: 4.5/5OMG! The graphics upgrade on this game is phenomenal. What a difference from the PS1 version of the game. The sunlight flowing through the woods in the Elf village was such a nice touch. That was when I started to really notice the graphics over haul. Oh, this game is so pretty.Game-play: 3/5Final Fantasy's game-play is the same as it was 20+ years ago. Turn-based attack system. You attack, then the monsters attack till one of you dies. I, for one, will never tire of this type of battle system, as long as the story keeps me playing the game.Replay Value: 1/5Once you complete the game there is no reason to play the game over unless you want to see the whole story over again.Overall: 3.5/5I'm one of the biggest Final Fantasy fan EVER! This was a great remake. I recommend this game for everyone that has loved the final fantasy games that appeared after this one, just to see where it all began. In a word WOW! If Square-Enix can remake all the Final Fantasies like this one than I'm going to be a very poor man from buying all those games again!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2008"}

This is one of the last games where Capcom decided to take a risk and make a new unique IP.Ghost Trick is a game like no other. You play as a man named Sissel who is already dead when you play the game. He then sees a girl with red hair name Lyn who is going to be killed. The only way he can save her is to turn back time 4 minutes and manipulate the objects around him in order for Lyn to escape. Sissel only has 24 hours after saving her to figure out who he is or he'll disappear forever.As expected, the entire game takes place in one night. This game is unique because the game requires timing as the most important key when trying to save a person's life and the game really empathizes on trial and error to save the person. Fortunately, the game is lenient toward you and you can whine time back as often as you like when you mess up.The characters themselves have their own quirks similar to Ace Attorney. And you would think you would hate someone like Lyn who gets killed so many times in one night but she's actually vert likable and it's out her hand if she's being a target for murder. Naturally everyone involved in the story are all connected to each other. You travel from destination to destination from a telephone line to prevent getting to other locations faster.The story drives you to solve the mystery very quickly. The music matches well with the tone of the game and overall, it's one of those games that you can never forget even after beating the (difficult) game. Yes this game gets ridiculously hard as time goes on because of timing and then adding in small factors like how some characters can apparently tell you're there and then move the object preventing you from doing anything.Overall, a definite pick up that you won't be disappointed with. Enjoy the plot twists because this game has A LOT of them.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2013"}

Paolucci \"Collector of Entertainment\"","summary":"Hopefully This Series Keeps On Running","reviewText":"Kingdom Hearts wasn't a favorite of mine. It was fun, but also a little frustrating at times. The battle system wasn't very good, and at times it felt a little tedious. (And then there was Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories, which was essentially a card game disguised as an RPG.) It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the greatest either. So, when Kingdom Hearts II was announced and the news was that it would keep most of the same elements of the previous PS2 game, I thought, \"Well, at least it's made by Square, right?\"Right and wrong. Yes, Square made it, but that isn't all Kingdom Hearts II had going for it. Everything that Kingdom Hearts I had was enhanced to the point of perfection in this, and old problems (like when Goofy or Donald got in the way during battle) were fixed. Not only was the battle system fun, but the few added elements, such as the forms--alternate versions of Sora capable of different abilities--and limits--special techniques that require certain party members to perform--added a little strategy as well. And the story was good enough to push Kingdom Hearts II back through the same world exploration process; only on a couple occasions did I find myself skipping scenes (at Atlantica and with Poo). Oh, and let's not forget the Gummi Ship, which was so innovative in KHII that I think more ten hours of my game-time was spent building ships and blasting enemies.The story of Kingdom Hearts II, though, is definitely where the gold is. It picks up right after Chain of Memories ended, bringing back the cloaked figures, as well as introducing a new main character. I won't spoil anything, but the first sixth of the game has nothing to do with Disney and everything to do with the power of Square storytelling. After that, Sora and friends are back, and once again the Heartless have invaded the many worlds. Yet the Heartless seem to be the least of their problems, as Organization XIII, the cloaked figures, have their own, more powerful version of Heartless called Nobodies. Now, Sora must not only lock all of the worlds with his trusty Keyblade, he must figure out what Organization XIII is all about. All this while continuing his search for Riku, Kaira, and King Mickey.This game made up for everything that the last two made me bitter about. Though they weren't bad games, the first Kingdom Hearts game definitely wasn't the masterpiece that people proclaimed it to be, at least to me. Kingdom Hearts II, though, is a masterpiece. Not only is it fun, but very addictive. I'm on my second play-through trying to complete Jiminy's Journal on a harder difficulty setting, and I'm having a blast. I highly recommend this to fans of the first two games, and for fans of Square games as there are a lot of familiar faces here. However, if you're new to this series, I'd definitely go back and at least play the first PS2 game to get acquainted with the systems.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2006"}

Not in terms of looks, as it looks almost exactly the same. However, in functionality, this is much better. The applications are really great. The camera is pretty good...infact, I should say cameras. There are two cameras one that is \"inside\" and the other is \"outside.\" By this, I mean that you can switch between a camera that (if you are holding the console open) can take a picture of yourself, or of someone standing in front of the console. the neat things are the filters and frames, etc. You can modify the pictures, distort them, add frames, sunglasses, etc. The picture quality is fair, but blurs easily with movement. The console found my wireless network easily and set up was a breeze (much easier than setting up my PSP). This has an MP3 player, however, you are asked to enter an SD card with mp3 files. I am not certain if you can listen to mp3's off the internet. However, they are currently offering a *FREE* web browser in their online store. They offered a web browser for the Wii, and it was free at first, but now you have to pay....so, get over there and get it while it's free!!! Just tap the shopping icon on your DSi and pick the free downloads. I should also note that if you register your DSi and sign up on [...], you get 1000 points to download software, and extends your warranty. You also get 160 coins if you take a survery and fill out some info....then with every game you register you get more coins and can buy accessories. Not a lot of great stuff, but it's \"free\" and is worth looking at. The site said you get another 50 coins every time you register an item. Game play is the same. Sound options are stereo or mono. Set up is a little more personalized, and the parental controls are password protected. The browser is very basic and does not seem to support Java script, so some websites may not be able to load games, etc. I think for the price I paid for this compared to the DS, the DSi is the clear winner. For the amount of upgrades in the system, it's worth while getting it. I love that it gives you the mac address easily. All of the DS features work as expected, and I have no problems.

You&rsquo;ll get a competitive advantage by hearing sound cues that youcan&rsquo;thear with speakers, such as the soft footsteps of an enemy sneaking up behind you, or the loading of a weapon far in the distance, regardless of the direction. By hearing sounds others can&rsquo;t - and by knowing where they&rsquo;re coming from - you&rsquo;ll react faster and take them out before they takeyouout.If you&rsquo;re serious about XBOX 360 gaming, get serious about the sound. Invest in an Ear Force X41 and experience the game the way it was meant to be heard. It will help you to become a better player and you&rsquo;ll have a lot more fun enjoying your XBOX 360.&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround Sound Technology!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Take your gaming to the next level by experiencing how your Xbox 360 was meant to be heard!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Enjoy late night gaming without disturbing others!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround SoundThe Ear Force X41 transmitter uses a 150MPS Digital Signal Processor (DSP) to deliver genuine Dolby Digital sound, Dolby Pro Logic IIx, and Dolby Headphone surround sound processing technologies - the industry-standard formats for encoding multi-channel sound in XBOX 360 games and DVD movies. The X41 uses the latest version of Dolby technology to create realistic game sound in 7.1 channels for improved surround sound accuracy.Dolby Pro Logic IIx and Stereo EnhancerThe X41 transmitter incorporates the latest Dolby Pro Logic IIx decoding system for surround sound realism from Dolby Pro Logic II encoded audio. When used with stereo sources, the Dolby Pro Logic Decoder also enhances the sound by spreading the stereo signal to provide a &ldquo;wider&rdquo; effect. This results in a richer, fuller sound than normal stereo - almost as if it originates from outside of the headphones.2.4GHz Wireless Digital RF TechnologyThe Ear Force X41 transmits game audio to the headset with an uncompressed wireless digital radio frequency (RF) signal to deliver CD-quality sound that rivals professional-grade wired headphones. Best of all, the wireless RF signal does not require &quot;line of sight&quot; to operate. That means you can stand anywhere near your XBOX 360 and hear a clear, noise-free signal.Chat Boost&nbsp;Dynamic Talkback&nbsp;ExpanderIf you&rsquo;ve ever had trouble hearing teammates on XBOX LIVE when the game action heats up, then you know how frustrating it can be when you have to keep adjusting the chat volume. Chat Boost fixes this problem by automatically adjusting the XBOX Live chat level when the game gets louder, so chat from teammates isn't lost in the exciting parts of your game. As the game sound gets louder, Chat Boost turns up the chat volume automatically so you can still hear what everyone is saying.It's a simple solution to an annoying problem, and it all happens automatically - so you don't have to adjust anything!Microphone MonitoringIt's hard to hear yourself speak when a headset is covering your ears. The X41 corrects this annoyance with its microphone monitoring feature. The X41 adds a portion of the microphone signal into the headset signal, so you can hear a portion of your voice along with incoming chat and game audio. Microphone monitoring not only prevents you from talking too loud or accidentally yelling into the mic, it also eliminates that annoying &quot;clogged ears&quot; feeling when talking while the headset is covering your ears.Bass BoostThe X41 headset DSP also lets you turn on a Bass Boost feature that produces deep, rich bass tones by increasing the volume of low frequency sounds - just like turning up the volume on the sub-woofer on your home theater system. Bass Boost improves your gaming experience by kicking-up the sound level of explosions, gun shots and other deep-bass sound effects, making them even more dramatic.Wired Headphone ConnectionThe X41 transmitter includes a headphone output jack with volume control to connect an optional pair of wired headphones in addition to the wireless X41 headset. This jack outputs the same high-quality Dolby Headphone 7.1 surround sound that&rsquo;s being transmitted to the wireless X41 headset, which allows two people to hear the game sound at the same time.Independent Chat/Game VolumesSeparate volume controls let you adjust the game and chat levels individually, so you can easily balance them and never have to worry about missing a cue from your teammates.Advanced Battery Booster CircuitryThe X41 has a &ldquo;battery booster&rdquo; circuit that squeezes every last bit of power from the batteries and assures high quality sound until they&rsquo;re completely dead. This allows a pair of AAA Alkaline batteries to last for as long as 25 straight hours of game play.

(updated)","reviewText":"First things first, there is no way I would have paid $200 for this headset, but that can be said for any headset including the turtle beach PX5.  Thankfully I got this for a song after Amazon's Cyber Monday $100 deal, and some credits I had kicking around.  I paid less than $75, and I was willing to pay $140, which is what they're selling for now.Everyone says wireless routers cause a problem.  YES they do.  I have a router about 3 feet from this and every few minutes the audio drops for a fraction of a second.  It's annoying.  But since that router is secondary, and it's only so I can use wireless devices like my cell or tablet in the living room, I can pull the plug on it, and play with no audio issues whatsoever.  I imagine that if you can get your wireless router 30 feet from this device, it shouldn't pose a problem.  I know the wireless router I have 60 feet away doesn't interfere.  So clearly there is a relatively short distance you can move the router that it will not be problematic.  If you know this going into this purchase, you will not be surprised when and if the issue arises.  I'm not sure if having the Xbox wireless adapter will make the problem more prominent, but it might.  If you want to prevent this distortion, your only option is going to be to pay $200-$250 for the Bluetooth equivalent of this; The Turtle Beach Ear Force PX5 (I'd post the amazon link if it would let me.)All that being said, I don't see any other negatives with this headset.  It performs as I expected, and probably a little better considering how many people were crying about the router interference issue.  I've been paying a lot of Skyrim with it lately, and the 5.1 surround is really impressive (yes I know it supports 7.1, but the Xbox doesn't).  You can really hear things creeping around, and all the subtle conversations the NPC's have that you'd otherwise struggle to hear.Probably the only thing that bugs me is that I get such heightened senses from not being able to hear external sounds, that it really weirds me out when someone in the house comes up on me while I'm playing.  I suppose that's a testament to how immersive this headset actually makes the experience.Bottom line.  This is a good buy.  It might be worth what they are currently asking for it ($139.99) but I think a $100 price point would make this a must have for all gamers.  If you have the coin, pick it up.  Or you can always send your gently used games to Amazon's trade in program and get credit good for use on Amazon products.  That'll ease some of the financial burden.  These are great, and I am absolutely satisfied with their performance.[EDIT]  I recently tried connecting to this by analog cable and was greeted with horrible amounts of hiss.  This must be the source of many of the complaints.  If you cannot connect this VIA an optical TOS-link cable, don't bother buying this.  But if you can connect it that way, DO it, it's awesome!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0000TSRA6","reviewerName":"Jacob Joseph","summary":"Very Cool","reviewText":"Five scenarios and eight characters means a lot of replay value. The game is excellent. The graphics are flawless, however, the controls take some getting used to. Also, some of the zombie sounds are recycled from Resident Evil games of the 90's. You'd think they'd be able to afford to record new sounds by now! And the virus meter is very annoying. The first scenario, Outbreak, takes place on the streets of Raccoon city, reminiscent of Resident Evil 2 and 3. The only problem with it is that there is seemingly an endless supply of zombies, who can open doors. The second scenario, Below Freezing Point, is a lot of fun, as it takes place in Umbrella's secret lab from Resident Evil 2 and 0. The third scenario, The Hive, takes place in a hospital, I think the same one from Resident Evil 3. The only problem with this scenario is that there's a monster that always follows you around, and it reminded me of the Leech Monster from Resident Evil 0. The fourth scenario, Hellfire, takes place in a burning hotel, and is very cool, since it features the return of the Lickers. The fifth and final scenario is called Decisions, Decisions. It takes place at Raccoon University, and has many routes to explore. I haven't played it online, so I can't comment on that aspect of it. This game is an excellent mix of old and new, and a must-have.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2004"}

The first thing I saw was the quick loading times. Even though some magazines have stated that the load times are fast, I really didn't believe it. How could an open-ended game have 3-second loading times but, guess what...it does! Everything loads quickly and it doesn't ruin the game. Even Grand Theft Auto series for the PlayStation 2 had long loading times which sometimes were a pain in the neck. Another thing I noticed is the graphics! The graphics are pure amazing and it really looks the same and sometimes even better than it's PS2 counterpart. The framerate is jittery but, the game runs smoothly with almost no hold-up. Especially since this game is open-ended (or as Rockstar atleast says it is) the graphics aren't diminished. You see the clouds and the rain and everything else you are expecting to see. Some of the effects are actually better than Grand Theft Auto: III! The cars are cool and are similar to GTA III but are a little bit older, since the game is set a few years behind #3. Final thing I noticed so far is the depth to the game. The missions aren't easy and shouldn't be which, tells me that Rockstar put a lot of effort making it hard but still fun! You can see the expressions and hear the gunshots which all sound so real. Can you believe though how Rockstar even fit a game like this onto the PSP? I don't know but, they sure have done a good job and this deserves 5-stars. If you think this game isn't as expecting you're wrong because you will be suprised, like I was, on how well manufuctured this game is. You can't put it down and your PSP will be in use 24/7! I love this game so far and I think this is the best game (and savior) for the PSP.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2005"}

This is practically the poster child for what is wrong with a lot of the games today.  With the coming of xbox, ps3 and wii we have a generation of gamers clamoring for high end graphics, holywood style cinematics, and mind-numbing ease of playability. This in itself is not bad, but the current gen systems demand much higher development costs and when ratings are earned more on superficialities where do you think they are funneling their assets? Ultimately this paints a very ugly picture for the future of gaming. Games like these are basically killing innovation and originality in the industry and the only people we have to blame are ourselves because we are the ones feeding the monster.OK enough complaining.. here is my honest opinion:Graphics:  Good - some screen tearing. This is a pet peeve of mine but I know some people don't care.Sound: GoodCinematics: GoodFlow of play and pacing: GoodStory: Below average. Generic plotlines.Characters: Lame - Annoying at bestAction - average at best - point and shoot 3rd person action. useless melee attacks. Some vehicle driving thrown in for variety.Puzzles & platforming - some are ok, but mostly very easy. Platforming is fluid, but very easy. Good for little kids who have not developed enough dexterity to play more challenging games.Replayability: very little, there are some treasures you can find throughout, but they don't do anything so chances are you will stop caring about them almost right away. There are plenty of other easy 3rd person action games for you to enjoy.Overall: A mindless romp for the masses, but the developer hit the nail on the head and achieved exactly what they were going for. It will entertain you for like 2-3 play sessions maybe. If you have the attention span of a chipmunk you might find more to like here. If you have the attention span of a slightly smarter animal you may have a rough time. Bottom line: Shame on you for over-hyping this pile and shame on me for buying it. I really would only recommend this game to people who are newer to video games and maybe need something cheap and easy.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2011"}

Featuring detailed environments and complicated new battle mechanisms, this game demands a different kind of perspective than the first-person shooters from the original Halo series. You'll need to uncover the hidden strengths and weaknesses of each unit and play them to your tactical advantage, and that's just the beginning.UNSC: Be Part of a Legendary ConflictThe story opens with UNSC forces retaking the planet Harvest from the Covenant. At your disposal -- should you choose to take command of UNSC forces -- will be everything from a corps of highly-trained Marines to the Warthogs, Scorpions, and Hornets you'll need for air and land attacks. You'll take stock of the map and decide between holding your ground or advancing on enemy strongholds, all while trying to navigate the local terrain and outsmart Covenant forces. And when you need something extra to tip the tide in your favor, UNSC leaders can provide you with the ability to mobilize highly specialized units or call the Spirit of Fire vessel for support from above.Covenant: A Capable, Playable Enemy FactionThat's right, Covenant is playable in this corner of the Halo universe. This alliance of alien species has manipulated advanced technology, firepower, and tactical prowess into a powerful force that is engaged in a Genocidal war against human race, having branded humans as heretics. With the ability to play as these tough, alien fighters, you'll have advanced shield technology, the modular Citadel at the heart of Covenant's colonizing power, and, of course, the iconic Scarab attack vehicle at your disposal, adding a whole new dimension to your strategic warfare. The Scarab is a terrifying military vehicle crafted from heavy mining equipment. And with a mining laser that delivers massive damage across battlefields large and small, turrets for taking on air attacks, and the ability to clamber over any terrain, what's not to love about commanding Scarabs instead of fighting against them?Developed Exclusively for Xbox 360Most console RTS games are adapted from existing PC games, which can make their controls bulky or awkward, butHalo Warshas been developed for Xbox 360 from the ground up. This means the controls are sensitive, intuitive, and easy-to-operate in the midst of battle. And the UI is just as intuitive, so whether you're managing a unit of marines or a deadly machine, you can focus on creating a battle strategy instead of worrying about how to overcome a clumsy controller.No matter which faction you choose to play as, you can test your skills against those of other players in online skirmishes that allow up to six players with the New Xbox Experience through Xbox LIVE.","reviewerName":"Denise Fnord","summary":"The Lesser of the Halos...","reviewText":"I like it but my husband, an adamant Halo fan, refuses to touch it.

It is so ridiculously believable that it's easy to get the feeling that you are driving a real car, especially with the interior view. I remember on one of the Ferraris I own you could clearly discern the difference between the high sheen carbon fiber reflectiveness and the low luster of the vinyl on the dashboard. The environment looks brilliant. You will be hard pressed to find a video game anywhere on Earth that looks better than this. It is the equivalent of pornography for a car lover and truly a 1080p game.Races and AI - 6 of 10The single worst issue with the racing itself is that damage is all cosmetic in the regular game. Aside from that, there are no penalties, and I mean none. You can run into other racers, run into the barriers, flip your car and even drive off the road without penalty. In fact, at the Top Gear Test Track you can cut corners so easily it's possible to shave 10-20 seconds off your lap. To give you an example of how unrealistic this is: I once saw an F1 race where a driver slightly cut a corner to avoid running into somebody and he was given a two second penalty, which is a lot in an F1 race. And all the while you don't have to worry about actually damaging your car (not even an option) so it's just like bumper cars.Race events range from no restrictions to absurd restrictions. But what matters isn't the level of restrictions but that in many cases you don't even have access to a car that could race in the event. A good example is the Japanese Classics event, where you need a pre-1980 car from Japan. I owned one car at the time and it had to be heavily modified. For the most part, the racing setup heavily resembles GT4. The endurance races are back (they are hidden until later), but I'm not even going to touch them. I used to race these back in the older games but it's just not my idea of fun anymore. One race is I believe 8 hours. That's a day at work and I'm not getting paid real money to do it. AI is pretty good, but it won't really blow you away. For the most part the AI follows a programmed path and they basically regard you as a nuisance. On occasion the AI will run a lap maybe a few seconds faster inexplicably, which shows this is probably compensating for an underdeveloped AI programming.Gameplay - 6 of 10The game can be broken down into three constituent parts: A-spec, B-spec and special events. I don't consider the license tests to be a large part of the game because if you just wanted to obtain the basic bronzes for each it would take maybe an hour to do the B, A and iC license tests including loading times. Moreover, the cars awarded for the gold license trophies are not worth your time. I believe that the Nissan GT-R Spec V is the best given and by that time you'll have enough money to buy that. So, A-spec is the meat of the game. This is where all the real racing takes place. It's broken up into beginner, amateur, professional, expert and endurance (hidden) races. It's a really similar setup to GT4. The difference here is that many of the races are now enjoyable and can be won without spending weeks of your life tuning your car(s). Aside from the endurance races, the game is quite simply - short for a racing game. After about two weeks heavy play (2-4 hours a day) I was at 70% completion.B-spec is the portion of the game where you \"control\" your driver. I use the term control, loosely. The races and events are identical to A-spec but you don't get to drive. You create a driver by a lottery program which gives you random driving stats such as mental strength, accuracy, stress level and so on. The B-spec aspect of the game seemed to be an afterthought however. Most of the problems stem from the fact that you don't have the same restrictions in A-spec as in B-spec. What I found to be the case is that you need a considerably better car to win the identical race in B-spec, even if your driver has a high experience level. The reason is because the tire restrictions are really bad. In almost every race for A-spec you have no restrictions; it is the flip in B. Many times you're stuck with sports hard which are the equivalent of consumer sports tire. You can imagine how inadequate this is on a car with 400+ hp. The other large issue with B-spec is that you cannot skip ahead in the race. You have to sit through every second of it and make sure your driver, however skilled he might be, stays on top. You have only four commands for your driver: lower pace, maintain pace, increase pace and overtake (pass). If you don't tell your driver to maintain pace every once in a while, he'll get complacent and actually start slowing down. What bothers me more than anything is that you can't get your driver to race any races for you in A-spec. So think of it as GT5 and a separate game called GT5: B-spec. The only thing that does cross over is the credits (thank God.)The special events are what I'd call the \"make everyone happy\" part of the game. They're split up into distinct sections: kart racing, Nascar, Top Gear, Mercedes driving school, Rally races (dirt and snow), Gran Tour and the Sebastian Loeb Rally Challenge. This is where you can really make some money if you are good. On some of the upper level challenges it's possible to earn 150,000+ credits for a single race or event. But once you've obtained the gold for that event you can't ever get money from it again. They are interesting enough, but are mostly a footnote. The only events that take real time are the rally races and the Mercedes driving. I found the Nascar portion to be particularly difficult. Maybe they were making a statement here....Advancements - 4 of 10This is the most embarrassing part of the game in so many ways. In fact, I don't think they would have added the driving line if Forza hadn't already added it to their game. The only real impressive part added is the driving assists which really add some much needed playability to this \"real\" driving simulator. They are active stability management, skid reduction, ABS, steering sensitivity and a few others. A driving line was added which gives you the optimal location to be on the track and braking sections. However it doesn't have sections that tell where to let off the gas which is almost as important as the braking. Everything else added to the game is far from substantial such as the ability to overhaul the chassis on an old car or add racing mods (there's only like 10 cars that you can even put racing mods on). It may look shiny and new on the interface and have mind blowing graphics, but at its core this game is a small step up from GT4.Cars - 6 of 10You may ask yourself why I didn't give a perfect score to a game that has over 1000 of the most realistic cars in the gaming industry from seven or more decades. Here's my simple response. You cannot use most of them for racing. I mean, you could, but you won't win. It seems as though the creators became self-indulgent, because there are at least 500 cars that are worthless. Sure they may have sold well or be historically important, but not necessary in a game. And in fact, you can only buy a few hundred of the cars. That includes the online dealership and the user car dealership. The rest HAVE to be earned. Easily my biggest complaint with the cars is that you literally cannot sell half of the ones you're given. They want you to grind. Is this a racing game or an RPG?  And unlike other games which have the ability to sell and buy other user's cars via the network, GT5 has an \"online\" dealership. I say online with quotes because it is just a set rotation of cars they have via PSN and there's only 20 at a time available. One bright spot for me at least, was the return of the F1 cars which weren't present in GT4. There are, however, only four by my count.Difficulty - 6 of 10 (not factored into rating)For the vast majority of GT4 I felt like the developers were trying to make the game so hard that it would take you months or years to beat it as opposed to just giving you more races. In the case of GT5, the difficulty has been lowered considerably. Gran Turismo 4 was easily in the top five of hardest games I've ever played. This game is in the above average category for difficulty of games in general; meaning that it will require some skill, intelligence and quite a bit of practice to win the upper level races. What always was disappointing and still is with this franchise is you have no actual AI difficulty setting. You can adjust the assists, but this doesn't make the AI any slower. It just makes your mistakes less costly.Tracks - 9 of 10Variety and number of tracks in GT5 is probably the most impressive part of the game for me. They've brought back all the old tracks and finally managed to get some of the more popular ones such as the Nurburgring. There is said to be over 20 tracks with 70+ layouts and I have to admit they really provide a considerable change in difficulty and scenery. The only minor problem is in the races you end up racing in less than 10 tracks most of the time.Tuning and Modification - 5 of 10This part of the game still works, and is slightly easier to use than before. You cannot tune the car while driving. What were they thinking? This slows down everything and really prevents you from getting a feel for what your adjustments have done. Plus, all of the modifications (so far) cost the EXACT same amount for every single car. A low rpm turbo for a Honda Civic costs 4500 cr and runs the same for a Ferrari F430 Scuderia. Number one, this is erroneous because the Civic turbo is probably accurate but the Ferrari is likely 3-4 times the cost. Also, I spent the same amount modifying my 26000 cr Civic as I did the Ferrari which cost almost ten times the price. This is very unrealistic and it seems like the people at Polyphony really got lazy here. If they even just based it on the caliber of the car it would have been more believable. The only real upside to the tuning is that they added a data logger and the tuning is more noticeable than it was than in previous games. However, the data logger is only available as an after-race playback.ConclusionWhen it comes down to it Gran Turismo 5 takes an evolutionary step and a small one at that. Far too much time was spent making every single one of these 1000 cars to look identical to the real thing. And I would have been satisfied with 500 cars and better gameplay in general. The franchise is beginning to look indulgent, by keeping many of the old things that were wrong with the older games and not listening to the fans. What is more disappointing than anything: all of the big advancements were made back in GT3 and that was 10 years ago. The recent trend with these established Japanese franchises is that they just aren't pushing the boundaries like they used to. It's not that they're resting on their laurels, but it just seems as though the rest of the world is passing them by in terms of gaming advancements. Were this a standalone game it would be an 8 out of 10. But given this is the fifth game, I believe a 6 out of 10 is appropriate  because they just had so much time to finish this game. In essence, the good is almost completed balanced by the bad. All the little problems add up and really take away from the gaming experience. It would be a rental game for most unless you are seriously into racing and even then you've got to have a lot of patience.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2011"}

Of course there were other reasons such as a Blu Ray player, free online play, and built in WiFi to name a few.  One of those games of course was Little Big Planet.  We watched videos on it, read reviews, and then made the decision to make it one of our first purchases for the PS3.Our expectations going into it was that this was a game for kids and adults where a lot of problem solving was required.  We had imagined a series of puzzles with perhaps various ways to solve them.  After all, we love brain teasers and puzzle/strategy type games.  The levels had a great style and looked very original.  Then being able to play with others online sealed the deal, as we thought that would be awesome.As advertised each level we played looked great.  The style was very cool and original.  The game play for what is was (while not what we wanted) was really well thought out.  Then to top it off there was a good amount of solid user content out there where the attention to detail was obvious that the creator spent a huge amount of time.The Character itself was neat with all the customization you could do.  For us that turned out to be our favorite part of this game really.  All sorts of different outfits and colors... heck you can even graffiti yourself.  Not to mention there is also a ton of download content on the PS3 store to take this to the next level.The game play however was not exactly as we were expecting.  Things started off very slow and we kept playing through hoping it would get better or more interesting.  Instead of puzzles, most of what the game consisted of was just running through levels, timing jumps, and collecting things along the way.  We kept thinking \"Is this it?\" and unfortunately it was.  For us it was boring and the game play reminded me of older 2D games like Super Mario Brothers where you just kind of run through levels, time your jumps, collect coins, and try not to get eaten.  Of course you can do a lot more in this game than Super Mario but it was similar game play to us.Overall we think this was a very well done game but kind of boring.  It feels more like a niche game rather than some huge \"must have\" that everybody will love.  It especially feels more geared toward children though many reviews on here talk about how much fun it is for them as adults.  In any event this game was just not our cup of tea nor was it anything like we were expecting.  We are holding onto our copy however so that our young daughter can play it here in a few years, as we think it will be perfect for her.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2009"}

{"product_name":"B006GHA8EE","description":"","reviewerName":"That Guy","summary":"Now this is a console game for adults.","reviewText":"When playing games over the last 20 plus years I always had the same verdict on PC games vs Console games.PC games usually always get the games that satisfy adults. Why is that? Because I believe the mainstream public has always had the thought.PC=Used by adults, hense PC games are mainly for adults. So why in over 25 years when you have pc games with adult content (nudity etc) you hardly ever hear anything about it.Gaming Consoles=For kids, basically considered a toy.So any adult content is automatically is met with outcry that video games are showing porn to kids. Why even M rated games are watered down where regular tv is more taboo than any console game.Like Bioware games where romance scenes are women in bras and granny panties etc.Witcher 2 I figured would be censored to the max when ported from PC to Xbox. I was surprised it wasn't this how games for adults on the consoles should be made. A great RPG experience which has doesn't shy away from content meant to be played by adults.I would recommend this game to adult console gamers.A strong story with choices. So far this game has been fun to play and also has different outcomes based on choices you make..I hope more games like this are made for console, and a Witcher 3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E1JS","description":"","reviewerName":"Da Jester","summary":"The Best Mortal Kombat since MKII!","reviewText":"At first I was skeptical about the return of the Mortal Kombat franchise especially how much it got milked into a dumb wasted bloody corpse with the last generation console releases. At the time, Mortal Kombat was becoming a joke and I was on the verge of being one of those people who will say that nothing the creators will release will be better than Mortal Kombat II.Lo and behold, more trailers arrived and game play videos emerged of a new Mortal Kombat game getting ready for round six. The game surprised the nether out of me. Combat looked fluid with a similar but different Dead Or Alive 3 style of fighting but not super crazy. Multiplayer with tag support and king of the hill modes had me screamed finally. The implementation of an actual decent story mode which caught my eye several times on youtube.com. And lastly, of course, really brutal and devastating fatalities.After playing the demo for almost 30 minuets a day, then finally getting to play it for 2 weeks straight with friends, this became my new favorite Mortal Kombat and recently released fighting game. The roster of characters is huge with plenty of nostalgia if you played MK through MK3 back in the 90s. I personally think to get your full money's worth, buy the PS3 version for the Kratos kombatant and his awesome stage fatality area. Both fit perfectly in Mortal Kombat. Pulling off moves is so super easy compared to the latest Street Fighter 4 releases. I ended up selling my copy of Super Street Fighter 4 and started playing this recently again.I have three main gripes about this game and one of them could be related to the PSN. Firstly, after you press start, the title menu screen lags as it's loading data and it seems if you don't have a good connection at all, even getting into the game takes a bit. I suggest unplugging your Ethernet cord (if you use that) if somebody is taking up your bandwidth.Secondly, you can unlock everything in the Krypt (graveyard) fast. Once you do have everything and the achievement, you will still be racking up points even though there is nothing more to unlock. I wished the developers would have added more when you purchased any add ons.Thirdly and final, the cheapness that can happen is pretty reminiscent to how the 90s Mortal Kombats were about. Boss fights will aggravate even the most skilled and hardcore players. Having to use cheap tactics to defeat cheap bosses does suck very much, but this only happens in the single player portions.Although there is the obligatory Ultimate edition coming out soon and I have not heard if Kratos will be in the Playstation 3 version. In my opinion, this version of the game is worth it's Amazon price or used retail price. If you want the DLC kombatants, get them if you want. Just remember, you get free skins for select kombatants regardless if you purchased anything or not!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2012"}

While there is noticeable commonground between them, Rage manages to inject enough creativity and uniqueness to justify it's own existence as an original, and thoughtful gaming experience, and not a copycat.The environmental detail in this game is staggering how realistic it is. I almost died several times while I was simply admiring my meticulously crafted surrounding's. The amount of care, and attention to detail that must have went into developing this world is simply beyond my comprehension. It's breathtaking, and it's the best looking game on consoles.The gameplay is deep, yet very intuitive and accessible. Honestly, Rage is very smooth across the board. The gunplay is varied, with different ammo types for each weapon. Enemy encounters often require tactical thinking, and strategy. Considering the computer AI is so immensely intelligent, conventional shooter methods of engagement would prove futile. Enemies will smoke out campers, dodge incoming attacks, and always respond in such an individualistic way, that there really is no scripted enemy response pattern. This makes the shooting segments so utterly enjoyable for me.I was initially a bit apprehensive about the implementation of vehicular combat, as i was concerned that it would would come off as tacked on and half-baked (looking at you Borderlands). My concerns were put to rest though, because this isn't a lazy, reproduction of the character movement control scheme. The vehicle controls are fully fleshed out, and function as well as anything the game has to offer.The story is serviceable at best. If the same amount of investment went into crafting a compelling story, as it did with every other aspect of this game, then Rage would be right up there with Red Dead Redemption as being a modern masterpiece in gaming. As it stands, Rage is a memorable experience, and a great game. Lets hope the inevitable sequel places a greater emphasis on story development, because this franchise has the pottential rise above the competition.Pros:Beautifully rendered characters and environments. Everything in this game looks amazing.Excellent gameplay mechanics. The gunplay is stellar, with interesting gadgets and devices at your disposal. The vehicle sections are fully realized, and not a tacked on afterthought. The enemy AI will blow your mind, as they scale walls, duck for cover, and even shoot while they are bleeding out on the ground. They are not drones with guns, they are very smart, and will kill you swiftly if you underestimate them.Local Co-op!! Over the last few years, the online movement has pretty much renderend local co-op obsolete. Not Rage though! And thank god for that. I love \"split-sreen couch co-op\" more than anything online multiplayer has to offer on their best day. Thank you ID software for not leaving gamers like me in the dark, like so many developers do these days. Rage does support online multiplayer too, for those who were wondering. But it is limited to vehicle combat modes.Even though the story is bland, the voice acting is actually quite good. John Goodman really shines, as do ohers.CONS:The story is merely serviceable, which really stands out as a glaring blemish considering how incredible everything else is. Step up your game for the sequel ID!This game really doesn't support a checkpoint save system. It will save when you enter a new area, but that is it. Instead, it employs a manual save option. This does not bother me persoanlly, because i like being able to save whenever i want. But I realize that most people find this to be annoying, so I thought I would list it as a con.In Closing:The expectations for this game were insanely high. I managed to keep my perspective grounded in reality. I wasn't expecting Rage to reinvent the gaming industry. My hope was that it would be a great shooter/rpg hybrid that would bring something new to the table. I can honestly say that Rage met my expectations. I recommend buying this game as soon as humanly possible.9.5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2011"}

And funnily it took 3 for me to replay the first 2 and just begin the 3rd one. The whole series is like a great star trek/star wars movie that is incredibly deep with tons of side missions. The best part is you choose your dialogue during the game that changes events. For example in the first game i brought a krogan species on a mission where they where cloning his rare people, needless to say the lines were blurred on whos good and whos bad and things woulda been different had i choosed another team. Anyway the graphics are also amazing they actually remind me sort of like dead space in the shooter aspects. I enjoyed the 2nd a bit more as it lets you run with gun more and is more shooter like yet retains rpg elements. The third game is like a revelation combining the best parts of the first 2 with better graphics story and everything comes together especially if you play the old ones your old decisions affect things in the new games i never saw that in GAME BEFORE.

Food references aside, this game blends the qualities of the The Precursor Legacy and GTA; namely the platforming and combat of the former, and the free-roaming and vehicle stealing of the latter. So while Jak II does change things considerably from The Precursor Legacy in terms of overall presentation and gameplay, it still manages to remain faithful to its predecessor. At the end of The Precursor Legacy, Jak, Daxter, Samos the Sage, and his daughter Keira opened a Precursor door atop Gol and Maia's Citadel and stood in awe of what lay within. This game opens with the group back at Samos's Hut with what they found in the door set up outside the hut: a Rift Rider. When they activate it, a portal opens, out of which a swarm of strange flying creatures comes out, along with a large beast who appears to be after one of our heroes. The Rift Rider then takes the group into the portal, with Jak and Daxter getting separated from the other two and landing in a large, industrial metropolis known as Haven City. Is this the future, another planet, or another dimension? Play the game and you'll find out. Anyway, Jak is immediately arrested by the Krimzon Guard, a Storm Trooper-like security force who serve the tyrannical Baron Praxis. Imprisoned for two years, Jak is pumped full of Dark Eco by Praxis, who hopes to create a \"dark warrior\" to combat the Metal Heads, dark mutants who seek to enter Haven City and slaughter its inhabitants.After being rescued by Daxter, the duo escape into the city and join an Underground resistance whose goal is to dethrone Praxis and free the city, although Jak's goal to stop the baron is driven more by vengeance than the city's well being. By the way, Jak finally speaks in this game. When Jak and Daxter's journey begins, they'll go on missions for the Underground and other interesting characters to sabotage the baron's schemes and defend the city from the Metal Heads. The missions you undertake in this game all vary greatly: you'll shoot down flying enemies and ships inside a gunpod, take part in high speed races and chases, hunt Metal Heads, escort allies to safe zones while outrunning the Krimzon Guard, escape exploding buildings...the list goes on. Most of the missions are also very challenging, and a handful of them are incredibly difficult. The most difficult mission in the game by far has Jak running through a pier with many intersecting walkways and an endless army of Krimzon Guards coming at him from every direction, giving Jak no alternative but to shoot his way out. Despite the game's difficulty, I always found myself itching to undertake the next challenging mission, since they're all a blast to play. The game's enemies and handful of challenging boss fights add further to the game's fun factor. The Krimzon Guard who patrol the city function like cops and will attack you if you attack them or the citizens; even if you accidentally crash into one of them, the city will go on alert and they'll chase and shoot at you. When this happens, you'll have to either outrun the Krimzon Guard or stay out of sight for a few moments until they call off the search. Outside the city, the Metal Heads are your main enemies, and there are many kinds of those creatures: four legged grunts, scorpion things, hornet-like bugs, cloaked hunters, and other freaks of nature; and they're all fun to kill.Jak himself controls the same as he did in the first game, with his jumping, climbing, and fighting abilities all intact. But he's got some new tricks up his sleeve as well. As mentioned earlier, Jak gets to shoot enemies in this game. After the first few missions, Jak gets a morph gun with four different firing modes utilizing Red, Yellow, Blue, and Dark Eco as the ammunition for each mode. He'll start with the Scattergun (shotgun), next the Blaster (rifle), then Vulcan Fury (gatling gun), and finally the Peace Maker (brings instant death to non-boss enemies). Each weapon is useful against certain enemies and specific situations. Also, thanks to Praxis's Dark Eco experiments, Jak can absorb concentrated amounts of Dark Eco from fallen enemies (falling into pools of Dark Eco still brings instant death) and temporarily transform into Dark Jak, where his skin and eyes turn dark and he grows claws and a pair of horns. In this state, Jak attacks faster and harder, and he can utilize Dark Eco to destroy large groups of enemies in one fell swoop with shockwave and electrocution attacks. Traveling in this game is sort of its own adventure. First off, Haven City is HUGE and has lots of winding streets and paths, so you'll have to utilize a handy in-game map and follow icons to your destinations if you're to have any hope of not getting lost.To get around, Jak and Daxter can ride zoomers that are similar to the one in the first game, only in this game there are many different kinds of zoomers, some large and some small. They can either hover just above the ground or ten feet in the air. Jak can...\"Jak\" zoomers from people or take unused parked ones. Later, Jak gets a jetboard which is slower than a zoomer, but much more maneuverable and is actually needed to traverse certain areas and complete missions. It functions like a skateboard and allows you to do Tony Hawk-like tricks and jumps; you can even hover over pools of Dark Eco with it. Navigating yourself through the city streets can be irritating at first, since they're normally crowded with lots of other people riding zoomers, and the lousy drivers make no attempt to get out of your way if you're moving at high speeds, which several missions require you to do. In fact, it's hard NOT to crash into other zoomers in this game, but it helps build the tension in certain timed missions to know you have to be very careful if you don't want to fail the mission. The game looks great too, whether you're traveling through Haven City's bazaars, ports, slums, sewers, and parks, or if you're outside the city exploring forests, mines, and pumping stations. The character designs are similar to the ones in the first game, only smoother and more detailed. Jak II even retains the first game's cartoony sense of humor, once again utilizing Daxter as its main source of comic relief, while adding somewhat more mature content and language, but nothing offensive or inappropriate. So yeah, this game has an interesting story, beautiful graphics, very challenging and action packed gameplay, and humor. Really, what more could you ask for in a videogame?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2011"}

There are two ways to reload, a lockable grenade button, and the trigger is digital so you aren't wearing out your T-Button with extra hard trigger pulls.  Besides the new levels etc, this grindhouse game classic now features 3D and not just high falootin' shutter glasses 3D but also old school Red/Blue or Magenta/Green stereoscopic 3D.  I tried out the TRIOVIZ goggles you can get for Batman etc. and for some reason they ghosted the edges badly but I switched back to the gel cardboard batman glasses and the game looks and plays great with 3d intensity at about 55%.  The movies ghost but the visuals here look sharp with zombies popping out at different depths and your sights sitting in the forefront.  Also on offer is a single player unlockable dual wield mode for maximum trigger happy fun.  I wish there had been more new levels and that the game had included glasses for the non 3D t.v set, also the profanity filter should be unlocked from the start.  The minigames aren't in 3D but they are just an aside to what is a profane, graphic and thrilling on rails blast of splatter loving indecency.  If your gun is drifting on other games it shouldn't here as calibration is rock solid and simple.  No hand cannon needed the Sharpshooter is perfect for this game.  After playing this game in both types of 3D(ana/stereoscopic) I noticed that only the movies on the final added OVERKILL level don't ghost horribly with BOTH types of 3D.  Besides that I found the sense of depth greater with the nicer 3D but not much better ghost wise than the old type Magenta/Green.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00027CXEM","reviewerName":"John Salerno","summary":"Just as good, and sometimes better, than the original!","reviewText":"At the time of this writing, the average Amazon.com rating for KOTOR II is 3 stars out of 5. I simply can't believe this! There were a few reasons I held off getting this game (after playing and very much enjoying the first):1. I knew it was so much like the first that I didn't want to start it right after the first, because I feared I might get tired of too much of the same thing.2. I bought KOTOR for $19.99 and I hoped KOTOR II would drop in price as well (from $49.99).3. So many reviews I read about KOTOR II criticized it to the point that I worried it wasn't even a good game.Well, reason #1 stopped being an issue after a couple of months. Reason #2 disappeared when Amazon had the game for around $23. So I was stuck wondering if the game was still worth playing despite the negative reviews -- and the answer is yes!In all honesty, I don't understand the criticism leveled against this game when it is so much like the original. Yes, you can argue that it does not improve the graphics much (it uses the same engine, Bioware's Odyssey engine) and so the game does have a sort of \"more of the same\" feel to it. But I enjoyed this game even more than the first, if that's possible, and here are some reasons why:1. I was a little put off by the combat system in the first game. Either minor tweaks have been made in KOTOR II, or I'm just used to it now, but it seemed to be a lot smoother in the second game (although still the same system).2. Many small improvements that really enhance gameplay:- Level cap is now 50 (although you'll only get to around 28) which means you can become so much more powerful- New Force powers: tweaks to the old powers, and new powers  that you learn automatically based on your class- Force \"Forms\" (sort of like abilities that you learn) that enhance your ability with a lightsaber and that improve your mastery of your Force powers3. And most importantly: a huge, long and involved story. What I like about the story in KOTOR II, and what I think is better than even KOTOR I, is that the story plays out on two levels. First, it is a story about your character and his/her motivations. Depending on if you play Light or Dark side, you will have certain reasons for doing the things you do, and it is these reasons that drive the story forward. There is also a villain in the story (or perhaps two), but in a way this takes second place to the mystery surrounding your character. The driving force behind making progress in the game is fulfilling the desires of your character, not just chasing some Sith Lord around the galaxy until you reach the final battle with him. This makes the story very involving.One minor complaint I had was that unlike in the first game, where you have amnesia and only learn things about yourself later, the character in KOTOR II remembers most of his past right in the beginning. Unfortunately, *you* as a player do not know his story, and many times you are presented with dialogue choices about things that happened to you. At first I thought that I had to choose the \"right\" answer, but I think it helps to consider it more as \"whichever answer you choose *becomes* the right answer,\" so you are basically creating your characters past as you see fit. But still, I always had a slight sense that I didn't always know what was quite going on, but perhaps this is a result of the choices I made in the game, and maybe other paths would have revealed more information.At any rate, if you enjoyed the first game, do not be put off by any negative reviews of this one. It is just as good as, and probably I would say it's ultimately better, than the first game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2005"}

He can also use tons of items like hammers and thunderbolts.","reviewerName":"GintaxAlvissforever","summary":"The Best in the Paper Mario Series","reviewText":"I got this game almost immediately when the game came out and made a resolve to finish this game since I failed to do it with Paper Mario originally. I was not disappointed.The plot of this game is very generic like the first game with slight changes. Peach finds a treasure map and asks Mario to find the treasure behind the 1000 year old door. She sets him off to Rougeport where Mario quickly saves a female Goomba named Goombella who is attacked by these strange figures called X Nauts who demand that she tell them about the Crystal Hearts she's been researching. After saving her, she takes Mario to Professor Frankly who sets Mario off on his quest around the Rogueport area.Now I find it funny how Rogueport serves as the Mushroom Kingdom but seriously, when you look back on this game, there seems to be a lot more adult humor if you pay attention to the smallest things people say. The town overall is much darker and feels like the hood, but once you leave the port, you either go to a sunny side or a creepier town. Regardless, there is a lot to do in this game and it fears like leaving the Mushroom Kingdom (which is vast) the outside world is even wider.In this game, the gameplay remains the same but action commands are more important to pull off a perfect combo. Now you have the audience that give you star points to fill up the crystal star bar once you get it. Pulling off STYLISH (-insert Devil May Cry joke here-) moves to entertain the audience. By taking too much damage or failing to entertain them, the audience is capable of leaving. Also, the audience might throw helpful items at your or harmful items. You are allowed to attack the audience if you catch them. Hitting the wrong audience means a group of them leaving (like the Toads and Punnies) while attacking the X-Nauts attracts more people in. You always need to pay attention to the audience reaction beside the throwing of items. Bob-ombs explode killing people around it while some enemies will go and eat or the kill the audience for life force. As you level up, more people attend Mario's matches thus making it easier to regain star points (he can also appeal to the audience instead of praying like in the original game).The partners are pretty much recycled from the last game or expies. You got the Goomba, Koopa Troopa and Bob-omb followed by a baby Yoshi, Madam Flurrie, Vivian (who is Bow in terms of outside powers but is still the best party member in the game) and Ms. Mowz (an optional party member). Most of them don't really have a good backstory and usually just join Mario for connivence sake. Otherwise, Mario being nice to them and returning something or completing a side quest (Ms. Mowz) usually means they'll join you. Did I mention Vivian is not only more fleshed out than the other party members but she's the best one able to handle herself on her own. His (Vivian is a he in the Japanese version but changed the gender to female for obvious reasons...think Sailor Moon dub. -_-) fire magic is the best easily able to be stylish and do extra damage as well as helping Mario avoid the attack.Overall, you get a lot more hours into this game given there are more side quests to fulfill (some are tedious like getting Ms. Mowz where you have to go all the way to this one castle and get to the very end of the level and then use Flurry to find said item she wants) and then you get the 100 trial challenge (I manage to complete it~). If you complete the challenge before the final boss, you pretty won, but its best to do it post game with many items in hand. ..although the secret boss is disappointing compared to the final boss who proves to be difficult.Oh yeah! Bowser is just a side character now unaware that Peach is kidnapped by the X-Nauts until later and is just there to make it obvious it's a Mario game. Also, Luigi eventually shows up in Rogueport but like the first game, doesn't do much except talk about his own adventure (I demand a game with Luigi as a main character that isn't Luigi's Mansion).If you can find this game, pick it up. You won't be disappointed. It's one of the best Gamecube games made as well as the best in the series (gameplay wise).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2013"}

Why the need for so much virtual blood anyway?Plus this has a Ninja Mode and a Bikini mode. You never run out of throwing stars and never need to reload but long distance requires that you aim high and even higher for the Bikini mode where you squirt the Bikini girls with the Dolphin squirt guns and blue ink.The first time you \"kill an enemy Bikini girl\" with a Banana across the throat is kinda shocking in a funny way. It's like Whaaaat???My wife likes that mode.You get cool guns and just try beating it single player with the 6 shot shotgun or the Penetrator which can shoot through trees and even rocks! Very fun game, lots of replay value, this one is a keeper for us.Biggest letdown is you can't switch guns during the game and of course more levels would be awesome. But it's the same as the arcade except it doesn't have the arcade lightguns.I modified a Wii Zapper into a Bullpup, like a P90 and it works really well for this game, similar to the arcade guns.Overall this is a great game, highly reccomended by myself and my wife.I just hope they make a sequel or something equally as cool in the future.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2008"}
{"product_name":"B004DI5H26","description":"","reviewerName":"stevie","summary":"The Show is Stagnating","reviewText":"This is a late review of the game:I have been a huge fan of the show since 08 for ps3. Mlb 10 felt a little stale compared to the amazing 09 game and now I think the show has officially stagnated. Its virtually the same game as mlb 10. The upgrades in 11 are basically as follows:1.) Some graphical updates. New shadow and real time day progression with enhanced light and shadowing are a nice touch. However, there is no major graphical overhaul that stands out.2.) New fielding practice modes added to regular practice and road to the show modes. They are nice additions, but are as about as exciting as the base running drills we have been doing for the past few years. There is very little control in these practices. Simply catch the ball and then throw to the correct cut off man or base. These can get tiring fairly quickly if you are playing road to the show, which will often invite you to do these drills to gain points.3.) Road to the Show is a little more forgiving this year, although it still takes a lot of work to keep your stats up.4.) And of course, the new hitting stick was the big addition this year. I found myself liking it a bit more than the x button. I found that I didn't have as many of those faux check swings where you want to hit, but your guy checks instead. It also makes bunting a little easier because you just push up on the stick. No need to push \"O\" anymore. Its an appreciated tool especially if you want to lay a bunt down at the last minute. It definitely feels more comfortable with the stick. That being said, this new hitting mechanic hardly revolutionizes anything. The 2k series has had it for a long time. Although I have never played with 2k's mechanic and cannot compare the two, this feature (although nice) is not something that justifies a full purchase, especially for people who still prefer using the \"x\" button. If you are one of those people, you mine as well skip this game.On the other hand, the show still has those lingering problems such as the streaky pitcher performances and the clipping issues. I really hoped they would fix the clipping, but its back and more prevalent than ever. Its so hard not to notice it when everything else looks so realistic. This has become an issue for me because the home plate collisions and tag outs don't look very good when a players arm goes through someones head. Its hard to imagine that EA could make a whole football game with decent hitting animations, but sony cant make a couple decent looking home plate collisions. The new \"hit\" stick also is applied to the pitching in this game. It can feel clunky at times as you have to pull back the stick and then push up slightly left or slightly right to spot the ball. Sometimes its hard to match up the stick with what they are telling you to do on screen. Also, those way off balance pitches are still too prevalent (having an ace pitcher throw balls way outside when you know you timed it perfectly) and this seems to happen more with the stick.Overall, this adds to a game that does not feel all that new and disappoints for failing to fix past issues and offering no real improvements. If you are new to the show and think you might enjoy the hit stick, then this is not a bad purchase. If you are an avid player of the show, there is not much new here to get excited about.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2011"}

Although compared to some games that offer less than 50 vehicles, Prologue seems standard.Gran Turismo: 5 Prologue begins like any Gran Turismo game.  Stunning and beautiful intro transitioning to the menu.  What is a first is the ability to play online and GTTV.  Both are welcome editions in my book.  The racing physics have improved in this version which make it much more challenging.  With previous iterations there were times when you could slam your call into a wall when coming into a curve without any consequence.  This game makes you pay for arcade racing.  What is an added bonus is the ability to use the all new Dual Shock 3 controller.  The DS3 makes racing that much more enjoyable.Their are nearly two dozen makes of cars.  Although each dealer is only limited to two or three cars.  What is missing is the ability to tune your car.  That is probably the biggest drawback for me.  Now you do get the ability to do this after finishing all three licenses.  There are no skill tests to acquire these licenses.  Just completing a license to get to the next.  The first license is easy to complete but it does get more challenging after you finish the first license.With this game you only get a paltry six tracks.  Although each track has different variations which does add more to the game.  This is one of the few games where I enjoy mastering the tracks.  So playing on the Suzaka or London track is a lot of fun for me.  The tracks are some of the most beautiful I have ever seen on any game.  Playing in London looks so real I almost think I am watching the real thing.  Watching the replays are so incredible that they are great ways to show off your PS3.Lastly I want to talk about GT online.  The format is rather simple.  Pick a experience level based on how far you have progressed in the game.  Getting into the race is simple and only takes a few seconds to get into a race with eleven others.  You position in the race varies depending on nothing.  What is irritating is some of the people you may play against.  On more than one occasion I have been knocked off the road by others who seem to have only one intent.  This makes the racing not much fun as people tend to not want to play right.  I am hoping they will eventually allow for more user control on these races to help avoid these problems from becoming overwhelming.All in all GT5 Prologue is really a fun game.  If you can look at this game as a challenge that will keep you playing for hours on end this should be a must buy.  If you are someone who has loved every Gran Turismo game then GT5 Prologue is for you.  Now if you are someone who thinks they will get bored by six tracks and sixty plus cars don't bother with this game.  For forty dollars it is well worth it to me.  A great racing game for the PS3.  A great game until the full GT5 is released.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2008"}

Rise of Nations is one of the most entertaining and addictive games I've ever played. There's a lot of similarities between it and Civilization III and the other top RTS games, but for some reason this game really pulls me in. There's so much entertainment value seeping out of it that I can't stop playing. I won't list all the pluses I have for it because that'd be too large of a list, but there's a few miniscule minuses. For one, it's great that there are 18 nations to play as, but once you get going which ever you choose doesn't really matter; the nation special abilities don't alter the game that much and can even be disabled. My other complaint is that the game goes pretty quickly no matter the speed setting. I like to relax and build up my empire when I play sometimes, and that goes by too quickly to really enjoy the different ages within the game.

Now what was then, still remains as now.The Sony Playstation 2, is a much more powerful video game system that really delivers. This smaller, thinner edition of the PS2, absolutely delivers to where other CD-ROM systems have fizzled. The video game system doubles up very nicely as a DVD Player, for all your movie watching need for films of all kinds. The game library remains absolutely endless for so many video gamers of all kinds that you can play here like Jax II, the reved up Gran Turismo 4, Madden '06, the highly acclaimed Reseident Evil 4, and many others. You also can play games on this system with the backwards compatability from the earlier PS1 pr PSX.  The control of the system is also as unique and similar to the previous edition, but it is very simple to respond, and easy to use for all gamers.All in all, with all the hype for the next generation consoles like the Xbox 360, and the Nintendo Revolution, the Playstation 2 by Sony is a absolute delight for all gamers of all kinds.

{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"stevie","summary":"Singleplayer gets boring","reviewText":"When this game first came out, my friends and I all huddled around watching a buddy play. The graphics were pretty good...I still thought they looked a little hazy even by 08 standards, but the physics and gameplay were awesome. In fact, most of the time was spent doing things besides the main mission: stealing cars, seeing how fast you could go, and trying to outrun as much cops as possible. The new care physics made this way more exciting than past open world games. And today they are still really good. My friend convinced me to buy because the multiplayer was really fun. We would often lan or play online. I soon realized that I had not even touched the single player. \"Wow, I thought, this game is so much fun and I have not even begin to play it really!\" Well, what happens in this game, is that it gets boring about half way through. The reasons why I still don't really understand. Maybe it is that even sandbox games are linear in scope. You can only steal so many cars and do so many chases and escape missions until you realize nothing really ever is new. Sure, the story changes, but I found myself not caring in this one. It was go here and do that. Drive to this point. Sit through 5 minutes cut scene explaining why you must shank this guy. Gets old after awhile surprsingly. Also in along for the ride is some buddies. One of them is Rastafarian type character, always speaking quickly and can never understand the guy. You can also do some missions with him and he helps you in the game as well. For some reason, rockstar implemented a weird friendship mode in this game. Basically, you have to keep in touch with some people if you want to stay close to them. It was a cool idea, but whappens is your cell phone keeps ringing because someone wants to hang out (usually go play pool or hang out, its always insignificant and just for fun). If you reject, your friendship goes down. Its an annoying feature because about halfway through the game, you are tired of going to those gimic hang out spots. They were cool in the beginning, but feel like a chore later on.I still have never finished the single player. Thankfully, the multiplayer was more fun to play especially with friends, driving around in cars trying to crash each other. If you go on youtube, there are numerous videos of those scenarios. Its much more fun to just mess around. I wish they would make a game strictly tailored to that or added more goofy stuff in GTA IV like the jetpack in the older GTA's.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2011"}

Don't buy this game!","reviewText":"Hello everyone, I just wanted to throw my two cents into the pile and give any prospective buyers a second chance to heed everyone else's advice here.DON'T buy this game! I saw a lot of complaints about copy-proctection...no big deal if you don't steal games right? It seems natural if you're not doing such things to be resentful to all the whining from thieves.Unfortunately the copy protection ruined my dvd drive, making it fail to recognize discs (to include obviously) GTA IV. I have a top of the line PC, way beyond the recommended specs on the game, and I've got a history in networking and systems administration, so yes, the software really is horribly designed. Long story short, with a massive game that is on two DVDs it took me two hours of trying every trick in the book to admit that it would never complete an installation, let alone play.If you buy this game you have a very good chance of wasting your money. It's very annoying since I, like so many others, was looking forward to losing myself in another amazing GTA game. Hell, I even have the map of the city on the wall next to my pc already. I'm sure it's a great game...but you have to be able to install it to enjoy.Update: I updated some hardware and got the game to install - Still not worth it! You have to sign up for several online accounts to access the game - all of which require personal information as well as the CD key, over and over and over again. Once you have all these services setup you can finally play the game. At this point you can finally realize that this is truly a terrible port from the Xbox. The controls are so obviously meant to be accessed from a control (esc to go back, enter to select arrow keys to change - anyone have a mouse? Anyone?) unresponsive, sluggish and slow even on low settings - I play recent games on maximum settings at 1680x1050 resolution.

You can play for hours and not even do a single mission.  You can lose yourself just driving around jacking cars, planes, helicopters, bikes, boats, and whatnot.  Fun!Yes it does have lots of foul language but it seems that all really good sandbox style games do.  So it's just put up with it and play a great game or not.  But because of the language, violence, and certain sexual parts in the game, I only recommend this for adult gamers since it's not for the little ones to play, see, or hear.  I do highly recommend it for those adults who love the GTA series.Saints takes the already great GTA series and makes it even better.  There are some really hilarious dialog in this game.  Some of the funny stuff is in the cutscenes which you can go back and rewatch.You can customize all kinds of things in this game including your cribs, your character, your gang and their rides, to your rides.Lots of storyline missions and sideline missions.  You can jack cars for the chop shop, be a hitman, drive a sewer truck and spray buildings, people, and the cops chasing you in a mini-game.

Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement. While driving players also have access to five in-game radio stations and use of their weapons. Your PDA provides efficient management tools for your growing crime empire, including quick weapons switching, a running total of available cash, in-game e-mail and Internet access and nearly instant game saves any time. The control scheme inChinatown Warsutilizes an easy to use and comfortable to play combination of steering via the D-pad, choice of action through the face buttons and/or stylus taps and manual and automatic weapon locks and unlocks via shoulder buttons.Key Game Features:The Largest DS Game Ever- Contemporary Liberty City is a massive world complete with pedestrians, weather and traffic patterns, five different radio stations and four different sprawling boroughs to explore.Endless Gameplay- Mature storyline with over 70+ story missions; plus dozens of side quests, collectibles, contextual mini-games and the all new mission replay feature.Street Economics- Addictive drug dealing side game with 6 different drug types, 80+ drug dealers and a supply / demand driven narcotics economy.Play with Friends- Nintendo Wi-Fi mode for head-to-head and co-op multiplayer mayhem.Bragging Rights- Chat, trade guns and commodities with your friends, and compete for glory via online tournaments and leaderboards on the Rockstar Games Social Club.PDA Interface- Use the touch screen as a PDA device to set GPS waypoints, change radio stations, communicate via e-mail with in-game characters and order weapons on the Internet.Online Bragging Rights and MultiplayerCare has been taken to ensure that players can share theirChinatown Warsexperiences with friends and fellow players in different ways.

We had two great outings so far with Liberty City Stories and Vice City Stories which were you're standard traditional GTA games that were executed almost flawlessly. Chinatown Wars is a great treat because it is not a \"mini\" version of past console GTA games, but the first top down GTA game since GTA2, but this time it doesn't suck.There are a lot of new elements in Wars, but we'll get to that eventually. You play as a Chinese guy (instead of all those Italians and that one black guy...) named Huang who is supposed to deliver a sword to his dead dad's boss so his uncle can become the new leader of the triad. It turns out the sword gets stolen and you are on a wild goose chase to find it. Like previous GTA games this one's story has great plot twists all the way to the very last mission and it will keep you playing for hours. Since this was a port from the DS there is no voice acting, but drawn panels with written dialogue which is just fine for this type of game.If you're thinking  top down GTA hinders game play you're dead wrong. The controls are so smooth and easy to use. Unfortunately, lock on targeting is still an issue, but everything you love in a GTA game is here plus some. You can sprint, jump, shoot, toss grenades all in you're criminally intent glory. Controlling the cars in this game is sweet and smooth (unlike GTA4) and they turn without a fuss. You can shoot from your car, or pretty much anywhere.The GPS system is similar to GTA4's with the lines telling you the best route to your destination, and using cabs can get you there faster. One thing that you can't do, however, is use cabs during a mission so you are forced to drive yourself which is fine. Missions vary from escorting, to shooting people up, to blowing things up and so on just like in other GTA games. Wars has a great variety of missions from using boats to homing in on wireless signals, so you never feel bored.One disappointment is that you don't get your huge income from completing missions. You get it from dealing drugs. Yeah, it's  new element and not one that's warmly welcomed. You can deal anything from weed to heroine to coke, but you have find these dealers from tip offs you receive in your email. Some times you even get rewarded with drugs on missions instead of cash, and lots of times nothing at all.You're going to need lots of green if you want weapons, especially through the express order from your phone feature. Having it delivered can be a bit tedious, but it works. You can also hijack certain vans for drugs and ammo if you're low on cash as well.One of the most noticeable additions are the mini-games there were carried over from the DS. Anywhere from attaching a bomb, to opening a panel in a car, to rummaging through trash for guns, and assembling a sniper rifle has some pretty fun and interesting mini-games. These don't hinder game play, but make you feel more involved in minute details which has always been missing in previous GTA games. Another great additions is how you shake off cops. You get your wanted level then underneath are icons of cop cars, and if you make them crash hard they disappear and it lowers your wanted level. Each level adds a car so getting 15 cars to crash can take a long time.The game also looks amazing and has a cell shaded style in terms of graphics, but the game is still full of life. This is probably one of the best looking PSP games out right now, and this includes no load times. Chinatown Wars is superior to the DS version, and may also be a reason to buy a PSP if you haven't already. The game is short for GTA standards, so if you just do the main missions you can beat the game in less than 10 hours.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"jmpg","summary":"Evil has evolved on Nintendo GameCube","reviewText":"It has been a long time in coming, but Resident Evil 4 is finally in the hands of gamers. As the third RE game made for GameCube, RE4 contributes more than its share of innovations the series desperately needed. From the amazing visuals and the stirring soundtrack to the startling yet pragmatic storyline, RE4 is everything a survival/horror title should be. Now if only more developers saw the capabilities of the GC console the way Capcom did, it's possible that the system's fate would have been a completely different story today. But in the meantime, RE4 is Capcom's crowning achievement and as if this writing it can only be found on GameCube.You play as Leon Kennedy, hired by the U.S. government to rescue the President's daughter in Europe. With the absolute absence of Umbrella's presence, you'll uncover the secrets taking place there as well meet new friends and foes. What differentiates this game from the other Resident Evil titles is purely one thing: action. Like a roller coaster ride that seems endless, the game has little room for breaks and you'll be spending a lot more time keeping enemies off your back. As one may have guessed, there are no zombies in this RE. It may turn off gamers who are used to the previous games and the action may grow tiresome one boss battle after another, but it does give the series the new direction it deserves.Like Resident Evil and Resident Evil 0 before it, the visuals of RE4 contain some of the best seen in a console game. Hats off to Capcom once more for creating another gem. The static pre-rendered backgrounds are now replaced with full 3D environments, allowing the player to roam freely with a newly implemented third person viewpoint. Capcom made excellent use of the GC hardware, with amazing fire, water and fog effects, detailed areas to explore ranging from villages to castles and some of the most memorable monsters yet. Although the fresh gameplay scheme may take time getting used to, RE veterans and non-veterans alike should be able to get a grasp on the controls quite easily.New gameplay additions include buying and selling weapons and ammunition with the help of money you collect throughout the game as well as upgrading items. Interactive cutscenes and quick button responses also accent this action-oriented title. Those who think this can't possibly be Resident Evil will be happy to know that not all the RE traditions have been forgotten. The typewriter is still here, as well as the herbs and the fact that you still cannot strafe or move during times of attack or reloading. At its heart, it is still very much in fact a Resident Evil game and one that could draw in players who aren't fans of the series. It's truly one of the best GameCube games available and a great way to start off this new year of gaming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2005"}

The Intercooler TS provides increased air flow away from the 360 which allows the console to perform in a cooler, better ventilated environment ideal for cramped entrainment centers. No internal modification of the Xbox 360 is required. Nyko&#xBF;s TempSmart technology automatically powers on the Intercooler&#xBF;s fans when needed, and continue to cool the console even after the system has been powered down till a proper ambient temperature has been reached.

The design of the Intercooler TS blends seamless with the design of the Xbox 360 console, and works in both the horizontal and vertical position.","reviewerName":"O. R. Rodriguez","summary":"Everything is better in pairs","reviewText":"The Nyko intercooler TS is the long awaited cooler to finally put rest to the problems of the past (draining power from the console), but it falls short of delivering the ultimate solution.  For people in warm to hot climates (Caribbean) like me, the problem of the Xbox 360 overheating is very serious, as i can testify that my first one went the way of the RROD, even with a fan next to it.Nyko's new product does works as advertised, it gets some hot air out, but to my surprise it does have a mixed effect on the console performance.  While playing Gears of War i noticed that the intercooler caused some noticeable lag that was not present before.  In my opinion it is because the fans are under powered (low RPM) and to that you add that the intercooler blocks the original fans exhaust, resulting in a half way solution, or increased problems.What i am doing now is a combination of two imperfect products:The Intec Cooling Station(a cool base with a fan) + the nyko intercooler TS =the results are great, the game disc comes out at room temperature, and the console performs as good as ever (note that there is no air conditioning in the room).My recommendation is that if overheating is a serious trouble for you, dont rely in just one product to solve it.*****Edit  Dec 6 2008******Almost a month later the intercooler is working great.  excellent purchase for any xbox 360 player***2nd Edit  Feb 3 2009****As stated in the first two paragraph, the intercooler performs as advertised, but beware.  IF you plan to use your 360 in the HORIZONTAL position, this product might not be enough.  Given to the limited space inside the console, the motherboard and all computing components are sitting below the DVD drive.  In the horizontal position the heat is not dissipated and therefore it stays concentrated between the 360 and the tv table, very problematic scenario.  My solution was to get one of those laptop cooling fans and use it for the 360.  Its compact enough and it looks decent.  Just remember that the 360 is nknown to have heat issues, take the necessary measures to prolong the life of your console.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Samario C.

The Nintendo Game Cube's wireless Wavebird controller is more fun and useful for the downloadable Nintendo 64 games because it's bigger and is also good fun to play all of your favorite N64 games wireless.You can even use it to play the Super Smash Bros. Brawl disc and it works just as well as it does on Super Smash Bros. Melee(by the way  Brawl has some of the best stages from Melee as playable levels)!However the Game Cube controllers border on unplayable for Super NES games like F Zero and Super Mario World.Way too awkward to have any fun or make progress.The Wii Classic controller however is perfect for 16 bit games like that. It's about the size of a standard Super NES controller,has more buttons and is also more comfortable in your hands. NES,,Sega Master System,Sega Genesis and Turbo Grafx 16 gamesalso work very well with this controller.You can even use the classic controller to use on the Wii shop channel which is easier to use than the Wii remote alone.So in conclusion a Wii Classic contoller is essential for playing 8 bit and 16 bit games but if you want to play Nintendo 64 and Game Cube games so is the Wavebird or standard Game Cube controller.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2009"}

Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"It's All About the Metal, Man","reviewText":"Growing up in high school, I was not a Heavy Metal fan. I looked askance at the dudes in their black t-shirts and doodling death symbols.  I was struggling to be accepted as a gamer, and although the Metalheads played Dungeons & Dragons as much as I did, they came from a very different background.As an adult it's much easier to embrace this form of counter-culturalism. Heavy Metal was rebelling at a time when 80s conformity was emerging, overhyped, oversynthed, and carefully marketed.  Heavy Metal was at turns loud, angry, and violent or melodic, sorrowful, even romantic.  But it's not too late. Brutal Legend will show you the way.A lot of people criticize the short playing time of Brutal Legend, as if tearing from scene to scene, save point to save point, is the only purpose of the game.  In fact, Brutal Legend is entirely the opposite - it's a world meant to be explored, a culture meant to be absorbed, a state of mind meant to be embraced.  You've got to let go of your hang-ups if you really want to enjoy Brutal Legend.Brutal Legend follows Riggs as he journeys through this strange land.  He finds himself in a familiar role: supporting a better-groomed star from behind the scenes.  With its twisty plotline of love and loss, allegiance and betrayal, players may be surprised to discover that Brutal Legend has a strong romantic element - an important part of Heavy Metal.But mostly Brutal Legend is about music.  Jack Black as Eddie Riggs is our comedic tour guide through this insane universe, which occasionally pretends it's part of pre-history but is actually a mad mix of Nordic legend, Heavy Metal sensibilities, and Frank Fazetta and Heironymus Bosch's art. It all ties together through a back-story that can be discovered piece by piece by wandering the land, digging up artifacts, musical solos that act as spells, and releasing bound and gagged stone dragons for blood tributes. On paper Riggs is a roadie, but in practice he's a bard of musical Metal, capable of summoning wild beasts, melting the face of his enemies, or even changing day into night.Music is its own character in Brutal Legend.  Riggs can create a vehicle known as the Druid Plow, an incredibly souped-up car that can drop mines, fire heat-seeking rockets, blast foes with sound, and - most importantly - provides the game's kicking soundtrack. This soundtrack is the perfect mood music for the game itself, which feels like you've been thrust into one of those Heavy Metal album covers.Brutal Legend is highly original too.  Forget the usual fantasy tropes of elves and dwarves.  This game features carnivorous deer, porcupines bristling with metal quills, huge steel-headed beasts, monsters made-up like Kiss that breathe fire...and that's just the local wildlife.  There's a whole coterie of Tim Burton-esque undead foes, the aforementioned Bosch-inspired demons, fire-trailing bikers, speaker-toting roadies...this game is as much as feast for the eyes as it is for the ears.In fact, this game turned me on to groups I'd never heard of before: Angel Witch, 3 Inches of Blood, Motorhead, Riot, Omen, and KMFDM.  I may not be a Metal-head, but Brutal Legend made me a fan of groups I would never otherwise have listened to. That's the highest compliment I can pay a game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2010"}

{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"A One-Stop Shop for what you need to know about the Wii U","reviewText":"[Please Note: I have just gotten my Wii U at launch (November 18th), and am loving the system after several hours.  This is a very long review, meant to give you exhaustive information on the Wii U based on first hand experience and research.  The first portion is editorial; the second portion covers technical aspects and features.  Each section is broken up by CAPS to ensure for easier reading and ease of use; if you are looking for specific information, simply look for the CAPS headers]The eight generation of video game consoles is upon us, with the Nintendo releasing the first console of that era, the Wii U. Nintendo has a lot riding on the Wii U. While theWiihas been the most commercially successful console of its generation, the perception has been that the Wii is firmly for causal gamers, and the XBOX 360 and PlayStation 3 is for the hardcore gamers. Also, given the bumbled launch of the 3DS (Nintendo's most botched debut of new hardware, with the sole exception of Gunpei Yokoi's 1995 Virtual Boy), Nintendo has to get the Wii U right. Here are some concerns that Nintendo wants to address with the Wii U.THE WII IS ONLY FOR CASUAL GAMERS: One item that effectively fueled that (largely incorrect) perception is the packaging of \"Wii Sports\", which clearly demonstrated what the motion-controlled driven Wii was all about and what it was fully capable of accomplishing. Interestingly enough, the basic edition (covered in detail later in the review) does not include the Wii U's version of \"Wii Sports\", a game called \"Nintendo Land\". Most likely though hardcore gamers will want the Deluxe Edition due to the extra features included, including quadrupling storage space. It was only because of \"Wii Sports\" dethroned \"Super Mario Bros.\" that \"Super Mario Bros.\" finally had to relinquish its title as the best selling video game of all time. \"Wii Sports\" moved over eighty million units, and according to the Nintendo channel people played that game a LOT.BAD NETWORKING: Another notorious weakness of the Wii was its weak network infrastructure. Online gameplay is the order of the day, and Nintendo has been behind the eight ball for this generation due to poor implementation of online gaming. Although some Wii titles included online gaming (\"Mario Kart Wii with Wii Wheel\" and \"James Bond 007: GoldenEye\" come to mind), the XBOX 360 and Playstation 3 offered much more robust gaming options in this milieu. \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\", one of the biggest titles of the Wii era, notoriously did not include this much needed functionality.LACK OF THIRD PARTY TITLES: One of the major selling points of any Nintendo console is the Nintendo IPs: we all know the only place you get Mario (\"New Super Mario Bros. U) and all his various sub-series, Link, Samus, Pikmin, Super Smash Brothers, Kirby, Donkey Kong, Star Fox, Pokeman, Kid Icarus, Animal Crossing, Fire Emblem, The Legendary Starfly, etc, are on Nintendo hardware. As strong as these IPs are, to flourish Nintendo MUST have the support of third party developers. The Wii missed out on some of the biggest titles of the seventh generation, largely due to the radically different control scheme of the Wii compared to the other two consoles and the lack of HD support, as well as the required work to convert XBOX 360 and Playstation 3 titles to the Wii.The Wii U fixes the issues that were keeping away the third party games. Despite all the brouhaha regarding the GamePad, in one way Nintendo has become more conservative in their approach to third party developers. TheNintendo Wii U Pro Controller - Black(largely similar to the XBOX 360 and Playstation 3 controllers) appear to be built directly for the third party developers to be able publish titles across multiple platforms with very little technical adjustments required to adjust for each console. Bringing the Wii U into closer technical proximity to its brethren means that developers won't have to have the added cost of having a production team set aside especially for the Nintendo console. The launch shows promise that third party developers are getting behind the Wii U, with exclusive titles of \"Bayonette 2\" and \"Rayman Legends\", as well as game series making their debut on a home Nintendo console (\"Assassin's Creed 3\",\"Darksiders II\", \"Mass Effect 3\") and also \"Call of Duty: Black Ops II\". And rather than limiting and potentaily discouraging multi-platform titles with their radically different controllers, it's quite possible the Wii U GamePad will really strengthen the Wii editions of their perspective titles, affording gameplay design options unavailable on the other consoles.And, just maybe, my dreams of playing a current generation \"Elder Scrolls\" game on a Nintendo Console is this much closer to a reality. Only time will tell how the eight generation works out and who comes out on top in the market. Even though Nintendo had the weakest system of the seventh generation, they came out on top despite some obvious deficiencies. While the Wii U can give you the impression Nintendo is trying to get out from behind the eight ball (to use the pool analogy a second time), but remember: the Wii dominated, and I have a feeling that the Wii U will dominate as well.TWO  IMPORTANT POINTS OF KNOWELDGE FOR NEW WII U OWNERS: Before we get into the technical aspects, there are two items of which you should be aware1.  SYSTEM UPDATE: You must run a required system update (available at launch) to use the Miiverse, Wii U Chat, eShop, in addition to backwards capability for playing Wii games on the Wii U.  To perform the system update, you must have an Internet connection, so if you purchase the Wii U and do not have an Internet Connection you will not have these functionalities.2.  AUTOMATIC SYSTEM SHUTDOWN: Please note that in the system configuration options, the Wii U is automatically set to shut down after a certain amount of time after no system input.  If you pause your game and come back an hour later, you may very well find the system has been shut down due to this option, losing any progress you have made; you will want to disable or recongiure this setting if idle time is a concern for you.3. TVii will not be available until sometime in December.That largely concludes the editorial section of the review. The following content will focus on the technical features of the Wii U, as well as the new features that the Wii U offers as opposed to the Wii.STANDARD EDITION (Suggested Retail: $299.99) vs. DELUXE/PREMIUM EDITION (Suggest retail: $349.99)- Here is a break down of what is in the two different launch versions. The Standard is White and the Deluxe is Black. Also important to know: the Standard Set and the Deluxe Set DO NOT INCLUDE the necessary AV cables to hook up the Wii U to a standard definition TV. You will need to either purchase the AV cable in addition to the console itself, or use the Wii's AV cables if you have one. Also, PLEASE NOTE neither edition include Wii Remotes.STANDARD EDITION:-Wii U Console with 8GB of Internal Storage-Wii U Gampad-Sensor Bar-GamePad AC Adapter-Wii U AC Adapter-HDMI Cable.DELUXE/PREMIUM EDITION:-Wii U Console with 32 GB of internal storage (four times as much as the 8GB of the Standard)-Sensor Bar-GamePad AC Adapter-Wii U AC Adapter-HDMI Cable-Wii U GamePad Cradle, GamePad Stand, and Console Stand (for those wanting their console to stand vertically like the Wii rather than lying flat horizontally)-The NintendoLand game.Looking at the list, the chief differences between the two editions is the 32GB of storage as opposed to the 8GB, the three individual stands (although the Wii U Console Stand is comprised of two different pieces) , and the inclusion of \"NintendoLand\".CONSOLE: Like its predecessor the Wii, the Wii U features a brand new and innovative controller scheme. The GamePad, the Wii's new controller, is attracting a good deal of attention, as the controller functions almost as a separate gaming device in conjunction with the Wii U. The new controller is the GamePad. Like the Wii before it, the Wii U is inextricably tied up in its controller and the potential of added functionality via the controller. The main driving design ideology behind the controller is pushing what Nintendo calls \"Asymmetrical Gaming\". In plain English, this means that by virtue of the Gamepad individual players can assume different roles in a gaming session. For example, in \"New Super Mario Bros. U\", players with the Wii Remote can focus on clearing the course, whereas the player with the GamePad can actually assist the other players by creating platforms and clearing obstacles from the other players' paths.CONTROLLER SPECIFICATIONS: At launch additional Gamepads will not be available. The Wii U will only support two Gamepads at once, and performance will suffer when running two GamePads at once. Here are the features of the Gamepad. The Wii U can support four Wii Remotes and one GamePad. At the time of launch it is unknown if it can support two GamePads and four Wii Remotes at once.-6.2 inch (15.7 cm) 16:9 resistive touchscreen-Functions as an Infared Universal TV remote controller, regardless if the Wii U is powered on.  Syncing the Gamepad as a Universal remote is very simple.-Gaming Functionality independent of the Wii U. Nintendo has described video game consoles as being \"parasites\" to TVs, and the Wii U resolves that issue with this innovative controller. If other people in the family or those you live with want to watch television, you can still play games using the Wii U GamePad, completely separate from the Wii U. The GamePad can also play videos as well.-Supports social media, such as Facebook and Twitter-Internet browsing on both the Gamepad and TV-Able to draw pictures and upload these pictures into the Miiverse-Users can replace controller batteries, unlike Apple products.  Battery life is 3-5 hours; after approximately 500 charges, battery will only retain about 70% of its charge.  The Wii U Pro controller also features swapable batteries.-Share content (such as video) to the TV-Stylus (like the Nintendo DS)-Includes camera, microphone, and a 3.5MM headphone jack along with volume control and stereo speakers. The GamePad supports video chat.-Built-in 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope and a geomagnetic sensor-Near-Field Communication included, where you can get stand alone devices that the Gamepad will interact with if placed in close proximity to the Gamepad.-Two analogue thumbsticks that function as buttons when physically depressing them-Select, Start, Home and Power buttonsA/B/X/Y face buttons, L/R bumper buttons and ZL/ZR trigger buttons-Controller sync button-Motion control (this is a no brainer, given the legacy of the Wii), rumble vibrations (like the N64 Rumble Pack)-Rechargeable battery housed inside the device.-You can power on the Wii U from the Gamepad-IMPORTANT TO NOTE: the Wii U Gamepad is NOT backward compatible with Virtual Console/Wii Ware titles.  You can only play these titles on the TV via regular Wii controllers.PRO CONTROLLER: Nintendo is also releasing what is called a Wii U Pro Controller, which is largely identical to the Wii Classic Controller Pro.  The Pro Controller is sold seperately. The Pro Controller is wireless, also has an internal battery and clickable analogue sticks and buttons on the top of the device like the L and R button from the Super NES controller.  This controller will last up to 80 hrs on a single battery charge. Recharging to maximum capacity takes 4.5 hrs.HD GAMING: Another sore spot for Wii players has been Nintendo's lack of support for HD gaming. This has been fully addressed in the Wii U. One of the most famous pre-release pictures of what the Wii U can do graphically has been Link form \"The Legend of Zelda\" fighting a giant spider that resembles Gohma. The artwork is gorgeous and really shows what the Wii U can do artistically graphically.Please note you must have an HD TV that supports the resolution to maximize the full potential of the Wii U. Again PLEASE NOTE you will need to either purchase the AV cable in addition to the console itself if you have a standard TV, or use the Wii's AV cables if you have one. The Wii U only comes with an HDMI cable. The Wii U supports the following video resolutions: 480i, 480p, 720p, 1080i and 1080p.BACKWARDS CAPABILITY: The Wii U supports all Wii peripherals/titles. However Wii titles will still be in their normal resolution of 480p, so no HD gaming for you on Wii titles, my friends. Likewise (and this isn't surprising, since later versions of the Wii removed this functionality as well), the Wii U will not support Gamecube titles. Nintendo has not confirmed whether they will release Gamecube titles as future digital releases at the time of launch.Also (and this is huge), you can transfer ALL of your Wii data to the Wii U (retail data, downloaded content, game history, etc), including Virtual Console and Wiiware titles. Nintendo has attracted the ire of the gaming community from its rather backward network setup for the Wii - rather than VC and Wiiware purchases being linked to online accounts like Apple's iTunes, the purchases are tied to the individual system and a lot of people (myself included) were worried about what would happen to all the titles we bought for the VC and Wiiware. It's quite easy to have a lot of money tied up in those types of purchases. Thankfully this problem has been resolved.  At the end of the review is the step-by-step process in transferring your data.NINTENDO NETWORK AND NETWORK ID ACCOUNTS: Finally, Nintendo is addressing its weak network infrastructure that so limited the Wii. The Wii U is thankfully account-based like iTunes, with one Wii U supporting up to twelve unique accounts. Like the 3DS and the Wii, the Wii U will include its own version of the eShop, will full length games available for download upon their release dates. Also if you purchase the Delux Set you will get a Nintendo Network Premium account. This is a two year subscription account and features discounts and exclusive content.Nintendo Network comprises the following: Nintendo eShop, Miiverse, Nintendo TVii, and Wii U Chat.  In order to use these different components, you will need to register your Nintendo Network ID.  This Nintendo Network ID will replace the previously cumbersome Friend Codes.  To register your Nintendo ID account, you will need to enter an ID, a password, your birthday, gender, location, and email address.In order to use the Wii U, you will have to set up an account.  The Wii U can support up to twelve individual accounts.  Once you set up your user accounts, you will select your own Mii each time you start up the Wii U.  Each account will manage the following: Game settings, Game Saves, Internet Bookmarks, and Playhistory  After selecting your account upon system startup, you will be taken to the Waruwaru Plaza, a giant gathering spot for Miis.Your purchases from the Nintendo eShop will be registered to your specific account; however, any account on your Wii U can play software from the eShop that is purchased under a specific account.  You will be able to use the Nintendo Network ID on non-Nintendo devices (such as PCs and Smartphones) in 2013 to access Nintendo services such as Miiverse and the eShopNINTENDO TVii - Available only in the US and Canada, TVii allows Wii U owners to watch TV content from multiple online sources, such as Netflix, Hulu, and even your DVR or Tivo, although most likely you will have to connect your DVR/Tivo to the Wii U as the Wii U doesn't have that functionality.MiiVERSE - Nintendo's vision of a social network, the Miiverse is essentially just that: a social network. The big question regarding the Miiverse is content moderation, which at the time of launch has not been fully explained by Nintendo. Like the Nintendo Channel for the Wii, the Miiverse collects data on what games are being played globally and will work as a key marketing tool in pushing the big games everyone is playing. Thanks to current technology, game companies can get data about what people are actually playing that back in the 1980s and 1990s they could only dream of.You can easily switch between gaming and the MiiVerse, asking for assistance, bragging, or making comments, and then seamlessly go back to the gameplay.  The Miiverse also has filters for spoilers; when posting to the Miiverse, the player can mark the post as a spoiler, and  you can configure your system to ingore these posts.  Also, if enough players vote a post as a spoiler, the system will mark the post as a spoiler.The Miiverse is built directly into the system, so all Wii U games are compatible.  Game developers can all use the Miiverse for added functionality; if a player fails multiple times in one specific spot, the game can display comments made by other players regarding that exact spot.INTERNET, MANUAL, AND ACHIEVEMENTS: Wii U will not feature Achievements or Trophies.  You can pause your game play, by pressing the home button and on the Gamepad open up the Web Browser, and then likewise return to gameplay.  Although there is some brief printed materials, the Wii U Manual is digitally stored and accessible within the system itself.PORTS AND OUTPUTS-4 USB 2.0 ports, two in front two in back-SD Memory Cart Port-AV Multi Out port supporting composite video, YPBPR component video, S-Video (NTSC consoles only), RGB SCART (European consoles only) and D-Terminal (Japan only)-HDMI 1.4 out port-Sensor Bar Port and Power PortPHYSICAL DIMENSIONS, MEMORY, PROCESSORS-approximately 1.8 inches tall, 6.8 inches wide and 10.5 inches long-CPU: IBM POWER7-based multi-core processor-GPU: Custom AMD Radeon High Definition GPU.-Total memory: 2GB.

{"product_name":"B00007LV7Y","description":"Silent Hill 3continues the series' trademark brand of psychological horror and terrifying gameplay. As a teenage girl named Heather, players must explore and unravel the mysterious connection between the god-forsaken town and her inner fears. The game features enhanced graphical detail, a more complex storyline, and even more grotesque monsters than the previous games.","reviewerName":"Review Lover \"ReviewLover\"","summary":"Reviewed Review, New Opinion","reviewText":"What with all the excellent reviews of SH 3 floating about the web, I decide dthat my previous 3-star review clearly didn't take all aspects of the game into account. So I went and bought a walkthrough guide, took three days and completed everything.And I'm sorry to say, I now think less of Heather and her ensemble cast of cliched characters than I did before.SH 3 is a game only to be played by fans of the series, and even then, only if those fans can get it cheap. It follows the story of Heather, a young girl thrown into a nightmare world of androgynous, ambiguous creatures and hellish ocations, in the search for who killed her father. Of course, there are plot twists, but only those of us that have completed SH 1 will understand them fully - and even then, they're about as predictable as a wino with a $10 bill outside a liquor store.This game is all mouth and no trousers - or, in game terms, all graphics and no substance. I guess that criticisms against the PS 2 are fairly levelled, then, when people say Sony's developers aren't concentrating on originality anymore.SH 1 (on the PS 1) is a magnificent title, and, despite the now-poor graphics, still packs a creepy, dramatic punch, full of melancholia and tense atmosphere. Silent Hill 2 (PS 2) is an Opus, going far deeper into the psychology of fear than many films and novels do, and show exactly how affecting a Survival Horror game ought to be. It wasn't action-heavy, but was all the more affecting because of that.SH 3 does none of the above. It takes some highly-accomplished character models, throws them into anonymous backgrounds that lack character and originality, poorly-designed, and rehashes some of the best-loved levels from the prequels (as I remember, SH 1 had 2 hospitals listed on the map - why are we still stuck in the same one now??) and really pointless characters. Where are the endearing, innocent Cheryls and Lisa Garlands? The morose, powerfully enigmatic Angela Oroscoes? The magnificently disturbing James and Marias?Missing. And what we're left with is Heather (consummately annoying), Douglas (hopelessly underdeveloped as a character) and Claudia, a cult member whose total lack of reason and sense of purpose is matched only by the weakness of the game's 'explanation' of her raison d'etre.Controls do nothing new, Survival Horror in this incarnation will always be a slightly flawed system, but does the job just fine. Sound is good, too, with the voice acting being of a slightly higher standard than before. Shame the script is so awful, then.I have played Silent Hill 2 repeatedly. I will not play Silent Hill 3 again. Five times through this mess is enough for anybody. If you're into gorgeous graphics without any substance or atmosphere, knock yourself out. If you're looking for something a little more mentally challenging, get Fatal Frame 2 or wait for Silent Hill 4.Very poor indeed.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2004"}

{"product_name":"B005C7R8I8","description":"","reviewerName":"Saito Hajime \"My reviews are short and sweet....","summary":"Tremendous value, but is it any good?","reviewText":"As soon as I heard this game was coming out, I sold my regular edition of MvC 3 immediately, knowing that the sooner the better b/c the value could only go down.(Got around 20 bucks...not bad.)I finally received this update, knowing that I was buying a glorified dlc, but anyway...I don't know what I was thinking both times. I love Marvel, love Capcom...and the novelty of it is great, but unless you enjoy playing games with outdated senses of challenge, don't buy it just for the novelty. What I'm saying is, I really don't see how this game is really any fun...at all. Is it cool? Yeah, its awesome...but fun? Not really.The additional characters are pretty cool, but after a while its like...I want my money back...They have made a few changes to character moves and have de-balled Wolverine. :/My major problem with MvC3 is that it is just messy. You have to be one of those people who plays nonstop and memorizes every move to be any good at it. Even Galactus in arcade on very easy can be a chore for someone like me. I consider myself a gamer. Not really competitive, but I think it should feel like less of a grind playing arcade. Pretty boring really.Plus no story or anything worth unlocking.Also, dashing is pretty lame on the 360 controller. I would get it for ps3 if you really want it.You could argue that dlc characters Jill and Shuma were 5 bucks a pop, and the addition of 12 characters alone, more than pays for this game...that's very childish thinking. For one, these characters would have been released over time and paying 5 bucks here and there is sometimes easier.Also, if we are pricing a game at 5 bucks a character, then why wasn't the first game like 180 bucks? Secondly,I could just as easily say, WHY DOES MVC2 HAVE MORE CHARACTERS THAN MVC3?!! Shouldn't they have added more characters in the first place? Also...the lack of stages is just embarassing. Don't get me started. I'm ashamed I contributed once again to Capcom's dirty, filthy, low and disgusting tactics.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0087OZ5FG","description":"","reviewerName":"Closeyou \"Joe\"","summary":"SONY PULSE (Good and Bad)","reviewText":"So I just bought two turtle beach headsets earlier in the year and I got excited that Sony was releasing a new headset and decided to give myself an early christmas present even though I was content with my TB MW3 Bravo wireless headset with a DSS2.  I am SORELY Disappointed (no pun intended).FIRST IMPRESSION: Very nice looking headset out of the box, no carrying case though.  Sleek design with no extruding mic(one of my main reasons for buying it) and good solid weight compared to my Turtle Beach sets the PULSE feels like it is a better quality headset and better built than my Turtle Beach Bravo set that ran $180.OPTIONS: The big feature on this headset, hence the name PULSE is a gimmick that willnot be replicated again.  HORRIBLE sound, the other reviews on the most part were spot on.  IT DOES SOUND LIKE A BUSTED SPEAKER, and drowns out the actual game sound if you turn it up more thsn a little, I find I just leave it off.  FULL PULSE mode is a joke every footstep is a loud busted speaker sound or like sony SONY calls it a PULSE.  EPIC FAIL, but not a dealbreaker yet.SOUND:  Great sound probally not as good as my BRAVO set with DSS2 equipped. - MINUS the PULSE sound.CHAT:  Going from Turtle Beach to Sony there is a difference in chat.  TB you can hear what you are saying so you dont yell and sound all muffled, the PULSE DOES NOT, so the result is when you are playing game sound up above low, I find myself yelling sometimes not sure if they can here me. UPDATE:(Holding mic mute button down gives 2 talkback modes, still a little muffled but betterREAD COMFORT!*COMFORT: This is the reason I will return this set.  I have used for a week plus and the problem with this headset still exists. IT HURTS MY EARS!The innovative design is great on this set, but the way the headset inner ear is at an angle and I have been gettin EXTREAMLY SORE on the back of my ears and head where it feels really sore after only a half hour or more. I am sure not everyone has this problem but it is the REASON I am returning to Amamzon. UPDATE:(Soreness after 2 weeks is less with periodic removal during gaming sessions)CONCLUSION:  I would keep and like these simple easy to use plug and play wireless headset if the comfort was good even though the PULSE feature was a gimmick.  However, comfort comes first and sound is a close second.  The SONY PULSE fails on comfort for me but other than that and the useless PULSE feature, I overall liked the sound and design, no extruding mic was one of the reasons I purchased this and if it wasnt for the soreness I would keep these.  Hope this helps, thanks.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2012"}

One thing is certain, in this city, you will learn how to run.","reviewerName":"Davidovich53","summary":"A fresh new idea is shot down by terrible implementation","reviewText":"I tried this game via GameFly because of its refreshingly new premise, but I was disgusted after less than two hours of playing.  Needless to say I sent it back the same day.  And to think that I was considering buying it at one time!  Ech!Okay, let's crack my knuckles and prepare to rant!  (Ha ha)The biggest problem is how often you'll die in this game, over and over and over and over and over and over and over and... yeah, I think you get it.  As you're being chased by cops (who for some reason seem to commit the city's entire police force just to stop you), you need to be on the lookout for your escape route, that next jump, that next ladder, that next alley which will take you to the next checkpoint and one step closer to the level's goal.  The problem is that these key passages are devilishly well hidden, so it's all too easy to pass them right by and run face-first into a dead end.  So by the time you realize you overshot your escape route and turn back, you're cut off by the fuzz.  Oh, and did I mention the cops shoot?  Yes, they open fire on an unarmed, non-violent suspect.  And you drop dead after just a handful of hits.  Stopping to survey your surroundings isn't an option either, because the fast-moving cops are right on your arse; you need to be constantly moving if you don't want precious Faith painted red with her own blood.  Trying to fight the cops isn't the answer either since Faith is a lithe, agile athlete built for speed rather than combat; trying to engage a cop with her fists is suicidal, and will again get her painted red with her own blood.So it's a cheap trial-and-error system that's in place: you'll get painted red repeatedly, replaying the same segments over and over again, trying to find the obscure key passage.  The hints that Merc, your boss, feeds you over your radio is completely useless, since he says redundant crap like \"Cops are coming!  Get out of that building now!\" or \"Get off that roof, Faith!  I don't care how; just do it!\"  No, really?  Cops are coming?  Wow, Merc, you figure that out all by yourself?  Speaking of hints, holding down the hint button does nothing except to confuse you further because half the time it points in a completely random direction, nowhere near where you're actually supposed to go.Wait... I'm not done!The control scheme also suffers from bad design.  The \"Up Action\" function (which is the game's fancy-pants way of saying \"jump button\") is central to gameplay and the most frequently used function.  This function is mapped to the left bumper, one of the less reliable buttons on the 360 controller.  Your only alternative is the RIGHT bumper, the OTHER unreliable button.  Genius!I give the developer, Dice, kudos for trying something new.  I really wanted to like this game because it was so different and new: the free-running premise, the MTV-style cartoon cutscenes, and the visual style of the city you inhabit are all fresh.  The city, in particular, is rendered in blinding, stark whites and grays which look artificial and sanitized.  This color palette does a good job of reinforcing the game's storyline wherein an all-powerful totalitarian government has established what seems like a utopia at first glance, but at the cost of all freedoms.  The concepts that Dice tried to implement are a breath of fresh air in the video game industry, but it's truly a shame the game's mechanics and design choices leave me frustrated and scratching my head.Now, having said all this, I know all the fanboys out there will be looking to string me up, but I DON'T GIVE [...]If I don't like a game, guess what, I don't like it.  Games are meant to be enjoyable, not torturous.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2009"}

This review is for those who are not familiar with Ratchet and Clank.Ratchet, supposedly the last Lombax in the universe, receives a distress call from his self-inflated friend Captain Qwark who gets kidnapped by mechanized vehicles operated by the evil Drophyds led by their Cragmite emperor, Tachyon.  What follows is a hilarious adventure that includes the race of Zoni aliens who are only visible to Clank (Ratchet's robot companion).Ratchet and Clank has successfully done for Playstation 3 what Mario has done for Nintendo and that was to generate an all-exclusive platformer that's fun to play.What sets Ratchet and Clank apart, however, is the game play.  Mario has his temporary powerups whether you play him in Galaxy, Super Mario Bros (old and new), etc.  Ratchet has his weapons which are upgradeable in many different ways.  Just using the weapon alone gradually upgrades its power and, eventually, its capabilities and the collection of bolts allows you to buy additional weapons and ammo.  Collecting Raritanium (sp?) allows you to upgrade weapons in other ways including ammo capacity, range, capabilities etc.  And there are weapons galore, including something resembling a simple blaster, to other weapons that attack enemies through nano-bots, grenades, guided missiles, goo that turns into beasts, etc., etc.And the weapons are not completely the same across the board either.  Some are fire and forget, some are guided, some require active aiming...and some are downright hilarious.  The Groovitron, for example, is a disco ball that forces your enemies to dance to various disco tunes thus allowing you to mop up an area as they helplessly strut their stuff.  Another device, Mr. Zurkon, is a small robot who follows you around and protects you to the best of his abilities via a laser as he hurls insults at his foes.  Mr. Zurkon is by far my favorite as he interjects his own commentary for every situation.  If you happen to drown, Mr. Zurkon will growl in his mechanical voice, \"Mr. Zurkon cannot swim\" as he hovers over the water calmly as you sink below the surface.  It's one of those things that you have to experience through actual play to fully appreciate how funny Mr. Zurkon can be.The humor is very tame (read \"age appropriate\"), but funny nonetheless.  Just as an example, Qwark runs through a plan with you to break into a prison and he shows his confidence in the overall operation by giving you the code name, \"Dead Meat.\"  When Ratchet and Clank flee in an escape pod, the computer announces that its passengers will be administered a sleeping gas to make their journey easier.  Clank amusingly observes, \"It's a good thing that robots are immune\" to the sleeping gas.  At this point, the glove compartment opens and Clank is punched unconscious with a mechanical boxing glove.  Again - you have to play it to appreciate the comedic timing; words don't do the game justice.Many reviews have said that this is about as close as you can get to playing as if you were in a Pixar movie.  I was skeptical at the claim, but after having played it, I can honestly agree with that assessment.  The environments are beautiful and there is never a frame rate drop despite the mutltitude of explosions, bolt gathering, movement, and combat occurring all at the same time..  The levels are cleverly designed, too, and just when I thought that they couldn't think of anything new for a platformer, I am floored by the next level.  Even the mini-puzzles (the Decryptor) get increasingly challenging, but never frustratingly so.  Whereas Mario occasionally has its \"you must jump with exactly this timing to clear a level,\" Ratchet and Clank have never made me feel like hurling my controller at the wall.  It's pleasantly challenging, and never impossibly so.  All the gadgets (Robo wings, heli-pods, etc.) are fun to use and I find the time to experiment with everything.  Obsessive-compulsives (including, admittedly, me)...beware!  You will find yourself trying to be a \"completionist\" with every device that you own, every Gold Bolt that is hidden, every Leviathan Soul that there is to collect, etc.What else is there that's good about it?  The story is fun and the music is awesome.  The music walks the line between electronically generated sounds and a fully orchestrated soundtrack and the merge between the two is flawless and sounds natural.Ratchet and Clank is a game that is fun for all ages although that I would say that it's probably quite a challenge if your kids are under 7.  But then again, there have been other reviews stating that the younger children seem to grasp it quite well so take it with a grain of salt.For those of you worried about violence, Ratchet and Clank is violent only in a cartoonish sense.  Aliens get blown into goo and robots get blown to pieces.  It's not over-the-top by any means, but if you run a household where violence of any kind is unwelcome then you may want to view the video link that Amazon shows on this item to see if it's something to worry about or not.  You can also download the still-available demo for this game from the Playstation 3 Store.  The demo will definitely give you a superb taste.And ... not to spoil the ending ... but what an ending, sating your appetite for the bridge-between-games episode of Quest for Booty (on PS3 or Amazon download) to come to its ultimate conclusion in Ratchet and Clank:  A Crack In Time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2010"}
{"product_name":"B007XVTR5S","description":"","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"All 3 elements rated and reviewed","reviewText":"If you've read any Black Ops review, then you likely realize that this is not just 1 product, but 3. You have Campaign, Zombies, and Multiplayer. I could make the argument that this alone makes the product fairly priced and worth owning. But what if all 3 elements are terrible? No, let's take a closer look...CAMPAIGN: 3.75/5 starsThe more I've played the campaign, the more I've grown to appreciate it. From the ability to change loadouts to the well-spun narrative, the campaign is quite memorable and user-friendly. I'd give it 4 stars were it not for a number of checkpoint glitches and complete mission crashes I've experienced during my Veteran playthrough. It's easy to forget just how linear these experiences can be at times. Some players will prefer these guided cinematics to something more tactical. But I am not that kind of player. This is one of the most fine-tuned shooters on the market. And I would love to have more from it in the way of options when approaching each mission directive. Especially in the beginning of the campaign, if you stray from the path you're expected to take (which is often unclear), then you will die, period. From the outset, I was strategizing amazing chokepoints and stealth takedowns, when all the game wanted me to do was run forward and shoot a few people in the process. The breadth of options does improve vastly as you progress through the campaign however. There is also great satisfaction to be found in the replaying of the storyline for different outcomes; though the often unskipable cutscenes are as unwelcome as ever. While some reviewers clearly hated the bonus missions, they offered me a breath of fresh air. They were a pain in the ass, sure. And playing them safely from above is almost impossible. But at least there's something to be said of their switching things up. They are a matter of trial and error. If that sounds terrible, just be glad they're optional. Everything is definitely AAA here in terms of graphics and sound. The adult content comes out swinging from the start. And, even though the fairly linear campaign often has you feeling like you're part of an interactive movie more than anything else, at least it's a damn good movie; easily one of the more brutal storylines I've encountered. The story also holds together better than it did in the first outing, and the futuristic elements succeed in all places.ZOMBIES: 3.5/5Here again I am likely not in complete agreement with the average player; in that I want an end-goal, so the zombie modes of these games always fails to sufficiently satisfy me. If you discount that negative in my score, then you'd likely have a 4.5, because this version offers more than any other ever has. You can prepare for more of the same as well. Zombies still down you entirely too easily, and the purchasing functions exactly the same. But the additions of environmental elements, new modes (such as playing against another team) go a long way to making this a worthwhile piece of the whole experience; one that I actually use from time to time, AND have fun with. There's still no way to eventually fight off all the zombies. They're just going to keep coming until they kill you. And I understand that's the point. Just not my cup of tea. Still, even for someone like me, this version of zombies proved to be fun.MULTIPLAYER: 4.5/5Let me just say that I'm no fanboy for this series. Mostly my crowd played the first Black Ops because it allowed online splitscreen; something my favorite online multiplayer games don't normally do. I'm a sucker for tactical gameplay, but I also like having a goal to chase. While Black Ops 1 satisfied one of those sides to my personality (hint, it wasn't the tactical side), Black Ops 2 hits home on both counts MOST of the time. These stages are constructed much more thoughtfully for all manner of playstyles. Sniping will actually work well on most maps and shotguns are a literal blast in this outing! The scorestreak system is a welcome change from the killstreak system. Guns have to be leveled to earn their attachments. And class personalization is almost always better here (thanks to the point system) than it was in the first game. There's a real sense of making difficult decisions in your loadouts; knowing that there's probably no such thing as the perfect handful of loadouts (as there was in the first). That doesn't make the system perfect. My crowd was pissed right off the bat that you had to choose between semtex and claymore no matter what (such whiners). And little limitations like that will drive you semi-nuts at times; especially since you can only fill 10 slots in public loadouts and your wildcards actually count as 1 of those 10 choices. It's also a lot to take in at first. But there's still plenty to love. In private matches you can create almost any type of game imaginable. You can fill up to 17 slots, personalize bot setups, and more specific mode options than you ever thought COD would give you. Plus there are party modes (always a blast). And those of you who play privately with friends will be glad to find that you don't have to earn things in public matches before seeing it available in your private matches (you'll have immediate access to everything in prive matches). The random respawns are still one of my least favorite elements here, but I understand their necessity in a game that is still seeing the majority running and gunning. Even in 1st person, the multiplayer somehow manages to scratch my Socom itch (can't believe I'm saying that about a COD game). This is mostly thanks to the stage design. And the party modes remind me of why Goldeneye 007 was such a hit for most of us in group settings. Even with all of this said, I've barely scratched the multiplayer surface. The new games modes like Kill Confirmed (team deathmatch where you get points not for kills, but for taking dogtags off downed enemies), and scorestreak additions (such as the Hunter Killer) deliver something which is so fresh that it cannot be ignored. Also, it's different enough that you're likely to continue playing the first game from time to time. But multiplayer is even more immersive here than in the first, and is the obvious reason to own this game. I've given it a 4.5 only because some of the limitations here don't make sense to me. But they're easily forgotten in the grand scheme of this epic multiplayer experience!So it's obvious that I think you should own this game by now. To drive that point home I'll point out that I've bought 4 copies so far. Some people I know feel overhwelmed by the seemingly endless string of COD games and refuse to invest as a result. But I want everyone I know playing this game with me. So I'm throwing my money at their stubborness. The multiplayer aspect is just that good. If there were no multiplayer here, I'd recommend waiting until the price came down and (even then) possibly skipping if you are looking for a strategic shooter. But multiplayer's there. And that makes this a must-own game. If the next Black Ops provides the same experience with added freedom in customization, then it will surely be deemed the finest multiplayer game ever made. Wouldn't hurt it they let us incorporate ALL of their maps into a single game either... Where were we? Oh yeah, buy this beast already!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000UZVL58","description":"Set after the events of Contra III: Alien Wars, the game follows mercenaries Bill Rizer and Lance Bean as they battle to save the world from a new extraterrestrial threat. Contra 4 takes advantage of the dual screens of the Nintendo DS to deliver larger than life action, with massive enemies, detailed platform gaming and mind-blowing set pieces.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Oh yeah baby, this is the Contra I remember","reviewText":"Konami's legendary Contra series makes it's debut on the DS in all it's old school, arcade shoot 'em up action glory.  Proving that the series is best in the realm of 2-D, Contra 4 is a throwback to the glory days of the original arcade game and the 8 and 16-bit era of gaming, as it provides huge levels, insane weapons, and unnerving difficulty.  The game's grueling levels are spread about using both of the DS' screens, as enemies come at you from all sides.  This alone makes Contra 4 worth checking out, and only adds to the game's difficulty, which even on Easy mode, is provides quite a bit of challenge.  The controls are dead-on, the level designs are flawless, and the boss battles are epic; all of which adds up to one of the best action games to hit the DS yet.  There are extras included as well to celebrate the Contra series' 20th Anniversary, including a Museum that reflects the series' run on consoles over the years, and an interesting Challenge mode that once completed, can unlock the NES versions of Contra and Super C.  The only downside to Contra 4 is what has already been said: the difficulty.  The difficulty may be a turn-off for new age gamers who didn't grow up with the Contra series, but for the rest of us who did, Contra 4 is a sheer blast.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2007"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYV70","description":"","reviewerName":"Jub Jub","summary":"Far Cry 3 Game Review","reviewText":"Ubisoft squeaked in Far Cry 3 at the very end of the year which can be risky for games since the major game release time tends to be between October and November and sometimes the general gamer public might look over something that comes out this close to the years end. However, Ubisoft definitely saved their best for last as Far Cry 3 is hands down the best in the series so far. If you're not familiar with Far Cry, they are an FPS series that is characterized by its exotic settings with danger all around and with the need for survival. The first Far Cry caught the eyes of many PC gamers for its beautiful graphics and game play in 2004 and was set on a tropical island. I personally did not like it but I think that's because the version I had was messed up or something because I could never get it to save correctly. Far Cry 2 was released in 2008 and was set in central Africa. It never seemed to be as popular as I felt it should have been and it was and still is one of the most realistic shooters I've ever played. It had a very raw feeling and took into account many things other shooters do not, such as keeping your weapon maintained or else it'll jam on you and rocket launchers with back blast that can hurt you and cause fires. As for Far Cry 3, it once again is set on a tropical island in the Pacific which honestly turned me off to it as it seemed they were going for a pseudo-remake of the first game. Also it being called `Skyrim with guns' has not turning me on to playing it (Sorry Skyrim is overrated) but I was wrong about FC3. While Far Cry 3 doesn't do anything revolutionary for games, it does a great job with what it has and makes the series stand out more than the previous titles.STORY: You play as Jason Brody, a rich college graduate from California on the vacation of a life time with his two brothers, girlfriend, and closest friends. As the final part of their trip through Asia, they go skydiving onto an island located somewhere between Indonesia and Australia. When they land on the beach they are horrified to discover that the island is controlled by pirates and they are captured. The pirates and the PMC that handles them are lead by a man named Vaas (pirate leader) and a man named Hoyt (PMC leader). They control human trafficking and drug trading in this part of the world and use these islands as a base of operations. Jason and his older brother try to escape the camp however Jason ends up fleeing into the jungle and is nearly killed. He is saved by a man named Dennis and explains how the island's natives, the Rakyat, are leading a guerilla war against the pirates and need his help. Jason reluctantly joined as it seems to be the only means to save his friends.Now I usually try to avoid spoilers in my reviews but I will have to mention some borderline spoiler things here and there. So if you don't want any spoilers, skip down to the game play section. First of all, Far Cry 3 has hands down the best story and characters of all the Far Cry games. I can't help but feel there is some social commentary going on here with these privileged white Americans getting thrown into the situation. Jason, while I really didn't like him at first, changes a lot of over the game and the change is a believable one up until a certain point. Vaas is one of the best villains in a video game this year. He reminds me of the Heath Ledger Joker, when he's on the screen, you can't take your eyes off him. Now this game is divided into two halves and I have to say, the first half is stronger than the second. The game starts out strong and ends strong but the 2nd act, it kind of falls flat and feels pretty different from the first half of the game. It doesn't make it so you will want to stop playing but you'll definitely notice the change and it makes Jason's character development feel less believable though this does come to a head at the very end of the game. Also this is when Hoyt becomes the main villain and he's just not nearly as interesting as Vaas. Jason's friends are very believable as they react to the situation they are in and you meet some other messed up characters along the way. As I said, the strong characters that this game has sets it apart from the other FC games. I should also mention that there is some very heavy subject matter in this game. In addition to all the usual violence you see in an M Rated FPS game, there are also drugs, human slavery, and implied raped.The tropical island setting is used well as for the story and game play and seems to use it better than the first game. While this game tries to be realistic much like Far Cry 2 was, there are some mystical elements to it as well. There are bizarre drug induced segments and boss fights and this subtle Alice in Wonderland motif going on. The game also has a lot of Rambo references. If you've seen the 4th movie, you'll know what I'm talking about. This is a pretty long game, around 20+ hours especially if you try to do all of the side quests, which there are many. As I said, the game has a strong start and finish but the 2nd act is where the game kind of falls flat as it just seems to take on a new tone. Also the game has a very long credit roll at the end. Might be one of the longest credit sequences I have sat through since Metal Gear Solid 4.GAMEPLAY: Much like Far Cry 2, it's an open sand box world but because of the island setting, it gives you freedom to REALLY explore everything. The shooting is pretty basic if you're familiar with most FPS games these days and you have a large variety of weapons to acquire in this game which are all customizable. They range from assault rifles, machine guns, launchers, bow and arrows and flamethrowers. The flamethrower is fun. All the weapons can be customized and are fun to find creative ways to use them which leads to the best part of the game: the assaults. Observing, planning, and making attacks against enemy positions are a lot of fun in this game because you are given complete freedom on how to go about it. You can try storming in with guns blazing but most of the time that will end with you dead. You have to plan your attacks, make use of the environment and the weapons at hand. You can sneak in and disable the alarm and then attack or sneak in and take down enemies one by one with knife (which is a lot of fun to do) or set the camp on fire or shoot open the cage of a predator in the camp and have the animal attack people. There are many possibilities to play with.Hunting and gathering is another major game play point. Unlike in other games like Red Dead Redemption or Assassin's Creed 3 where hunting wild life can be done but isn't needed unless you want to make some extra cash. In Far Cry 3, you must hunt if you want to be able to progress through the game. At the start, you have very little on you and you must craft rucksacks, bandoliers, holsters, wallets ect. If you want to be able to carry more stuff and you will need to be able to do so or else you're going to have a bad time. Everything requires certain amounts of animal hides to make so it's a good idea to try and get most of your hunting done as early as you can in the game and be aware, you're not the only one hunting. Predatory animals will hunt other wild life, humans, and you which add a much more realistic feel to the game's wild life. You need to watch out for leopards, bears, and tigers on land and watch out for sharks and crocodiles in the water. You can kill these creatures, of course, but they do not go down as easy as many of the human enemies in the game. You also gather plants for making health items, combat and hunting items as well.Plants and hunting grounds are clearly marked on your map which is handled differently from the previous game. This is where some of the rawness from FC2 is taken away in FC3. In the previous game, your map was literally a map that your character pulled out and looked at while holding a GPS device. In FC3, it's just a map screen that gets pulled up when you press select. There is nothing wrong with that but the map screen and menu screen for crafting and item management will take you out of the immersive feeling the game is going for. The map itself is easy to read and has easy to use fast travel stations that you unlock by liberating enemy camps across the island so that's another reason you want to assault enemy positions. Your map is not all there however. You must unlock more sections of the map by finding and climbing radio towers. The more you turn on, the more of the map you see. These are pretty fun as they act as mini plat forming segments and are sort of like climbing vantage points in Assassin's Creed games. Other side missions include assassinating specific enemies with your knife, hunting animals with a certain weapon, and odd jobs you'll find from other people on the island. You can also find and collect relics, WWII letters from dead Japanese soldiers, and memory cards that give you drug recipes. You get some exp points from these but not really worth collecting everything unless you're an achievement hunter.You level up like you would in an RPG and you do it fairly often. When you do, you gain a skill point which you can spend to unlock new skills and gain more on your arm tattoo. Some of these skills are helpful but some of these are throw aways like faster turret cool down or shooting from zip lines. You're never really going to use it. You get the most exp points from killing enemies and completing main missions. The game has a much improved money system from the previous game as it uses actual cash instead of diamonds and the money is much more plentiful. There were many times when I had too much money and I had to just spend it on stuff to free up my wallet. Driving vehicles is much more realistic in this game. Take that as a good or bad thing. Some cars have trouble driving on rough terrain and some roll over pretty easily. Thankfully the hang glider is much easier to control in this game and not just a death trap like it was in FC2. The weapon selection inventory is the last thing I'll hit on. It's kind of confusing to use as it is never explained and if it is, it's not explained well. I had to check in the instruction pamphlet. You hold the left bumper to make it appear you use the joystick to select the weapon. However, if you switch between weapons like normal it will go back to whatever weapon was previously selected. It's kind of confusing to explain but it can be annoying especially in the middle of combat when pulling up the inventory screen isn't easy to do. While the game play over all is fun, it runs into the similar problem I find with games like Skyrim that there are a limited number of different types of side quests and once you get the hang of how these missions go, it gets kind of repetitive. This is more evident the 2nd half of the game as well.GRAPHICS: Visually Far Cry 3 is a beautiful game. The landscape, water, people, animals, plants all look amazing and life like. There is nothing here to honestly complain about. However, if you are someone where the best possible graphics are a must, then you should definitely play this game on PC if your computer can handle it. The 360 version looks good but kind of has this weird slight flickering when you're looking around sometimes. Also the game did freeze on me once but I am using a used game so if you get it new, hopefully you won't have that issue. Like the games before it in this series, FC3 is very easy on the eyes.SOUND: All the sounds of the jungle and combat sound great in FC3. The audio is very helpful in hunting animals as you can maybe get the drop on them by hearing animal grunts and growls through the brush. It can also be tip off as you turn around to see a tiger jumping into your face. There is this sound you where whenever you pull up the map or menu screen that sounds like a picture being processed out of a Polaroid camera. It sounds cool at first but considering how often you will be pulling up those screens, it gets annoying after awhile. The music of Far Cry 3 is odd. The main theme is the airy electric rock song that kind of reminds me of the theme from Mirror's Edge. The majority of the music you hear though is this foreboding, suspense building music you hear when walking around in the jungle or you just hear nothing but the wild life. I'm not saying FC3 has bad music, I'm just saying hearing the good music is fairly rare.  The voice acting is the best in the franchise so far. As I said before, Jason and his friends sound and act believable to people in this situation and the more corrupt characters are also fun to watch and come to hate them but in the good way you should come to hate a bad guy. Vaas is the one who steals the show however. Like I said, he's like the Heath Ledger Joker, when he's on the screen you can't take your eyes off him because you're terrified and also mesmerized by his insanity and the crazy things he is saying. Ubisoft knew he was an awesome character and it's why he's on the cover of the game. Sadly, he's only in the first half of the game. Notice a pattern here?Overall, Far Cry 3 is the best game in the series so far in terms of story, characters, and general survival game play. There are a couple things I wish they had kept from Far Cry 2 but it doesn't hurt it much. As I've said multiple times in this review, the 1st half of the game is stronger than the 2nd. Survival with the elements becomes less of an issue by then and your character's objectives change but it does start and end strong. If you're tired of typical CoD like FPS games and like big open world games then you should check this one out. It can be repetitive but it's the kind of repetitiveness that makes you feel like you're moving towards a greater goal and it's rewarding because of that so come take a trip to this island of madness. If you're going to play one Ubisoft game this year, let it be Far Cry 3, not AC3.OVERALL: 8.5/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B002I0GX88","description":"","reviewerName":"humanbeldot","summary":"Exceeds the first in almost every way","reviewText":"After two long years of waiting, \"Infamous 2\" has finally reached the store shelves. Leading up to its release, and even for the couple of weeks afterward when I balked at the idea of buying it new as I could not find it used, there was a large amount of feedback ranging from complete praise to negativity. Having finally picked up the game for myself and paying the full sixty-dollar price, I can truly say that it is, just like the first, worth every penny spent on it.STORY: Infamous 2 continues the story of Cole MacGrath, who went from a humble bike courier to a bolt-slinging hero. The game, as most people know by now, opens with the Beast - the monster prophecised by Kessler to show up and lay waste to the world - appearing in Cole's world much earlier in the timeline than in Kessler's world. Cole immediately gets owned and is forced to abandon Empire City, fleeing south to the New Orleans-esque town of New Marais. With the Beast approaching from the northeast and mere days to go before it arrives, Cole must work fast to gain the power he needs to the destroy the monster for good. Of course, none of this is made any easier by the reign of the totalitarian Militia, directed by the game's foremost baddie Betrand, and of course other Conduits and monsters prowling the streets. While \"Infamous\" had a deep, engaging story with plenty of twists, \"Infamous 2\" has a long story with fewer twists but more emotion, making it stand on par with the first as far as storytelling goes. Also, the story, if played on Good karma, is more lighthearted throughout the first two-thirds, and there are some genuine LOL moments this time around.OVERALL: Like the first game, Infamous 2 is concerned with gaining additional powers, making choices, and proceeding through a story that is much grander in scale than the fist - this is, after all, a tale of the end of the world, and the mood make it that much more obvious. This time around, karmic choices affect the game's dialogue and cutscenes, changing the ending dramatically. Also, the trophy import feature, allowing you to import trophy data from the first Infamous, allows you to start the game with three choices: 1) start with good karma and 1,000 free XP; 2) start with evil karma and 1,000 free XP; or 3) start from a clean slate. If you earned the majority or all of the first's trophies, you can also start with up to two additional battery cores, see how certain side missions change, and hear how the game's Dead Drops, this time in the form of pigeons, sound different, all with great attention to detail. Completing both the Good and Evil stories nets you 15,000 XP and unlocks other little tidbits unavailable during regular play.GOOD AND EVIL: Having played through both sides of the karma meter, I can easily say that the Good ending is much more satisfying than the Evil ending. Also, if you are capable of getting through the Evil storyline without cringing at least once, then you must be completely desensitized: unlike the first game, this one makes the good and evil choices tougher, and unlike the first's often petty Evil choices, these are downright sadistic. Whether this is good writing or a sign of the times is really a matter of opinion, but it certainly made me very uncomfortable. Also, the good ending is wonderfully epic and perfectly done, while the evil ending is gut-wrenchingly painful to watch. You might want to play both sides at your own risk.It is still more satisfying to be a hero, and depending on your karmic alignment, you can gain pyrokinetic powers (gaining such abilities as a concussive airborne shockwave attack and an area-of-affect Bio Leech) or cryokinetic powers (such as a very useful launch ability and a shield made of ice and lightning, replacing the Polarity Wall). Fire-based powers are deadly, but their somewhat stubborn refusal to do what you want or be of much use beyond just blowing stuff up makes them boring and even dangerous to the player. Ice-based powers are defensive and much more useful, as they offer such things as a way of getting around quickly without using much energy or struggling to climb a building without ground-level handholds. The Evil karmic choices tend to offer highly destructive but occasionally useless abilities, while the Good karmic choices net defensive but useful abilities, such as an enhanced moveset.GRAPHICS AND WORLD: far superior to the first's network of three islands is the two-island, heavily varied makeup of New Marais. Whereas Empire City was lovingly detailed but bland, New Marais has neon lights, static but still varied weather conditions, bayous, a flooded neighborhood, and an industrial center, among others. Areas are recognizable immediately due to a wealth of landmarks. In spite of the large amount of water, unless Cole falls into the ocean or a bay, he will merely discharge electricity until he dies, which takes longer than it did in the first (perhaps he's learned to control it better) rather than die immediately. Most water is only up to his waist, making traversal slow but not impossible if need be, and if you should plummet off a boat, near the shore off a bridge, or in the middle of the flooded neighborhood, the game will take pity on you and allow you time to head back to dry ground. The amount of water makes downing enemies that much easier, as well.The graphics engine is absolutely gorgeous, with highly detailed buildings, objects, foliage, and character models. There are more breakable objects such as power poles and verandas, and Sucker Punch's performance capture work is beautifully done. What amazes me is that they appear to have done a full-body capture comparable to Cameron's \"Avatar\" system or Disney's \"Tron Legacy\" - Cole's throat, of all things, can be seen moving when he speaks, and although it is a minor perk, it still adds an additional level of detail and immersion that makes it that much easier to believe he's a real person. Characters such as Zeke, Nix, and Wolfe are done with exquisite detail and enough attention to expressions and movements to remove the \"uncanny valley\" feeling of the first game.SOUND AND MUSIC: New Marais is a living, breathing city, with street performers, crickets chirping, and ravens squawking. The soundtrack is occasionally superior to the first's but also turns mediocre as well, although there are standouts such as \"The Beast\" and \"Plight\". The end credits song, however, is pitifully inferior to \"Silent Melody\" and really doesn't seem to reflect the overall mood of the game as well as \"Melody\" had. Still, voice acting has been stepped up to beyond Hollywood quality, and although Amon Tobin's urban mix is woefully missing, this one's jazzy riffs combined with \"Dark Knight\"-esque strings and brass still works pretty well for the game's somber mood. The inability to adjust the volume or switch anything off, however, is unfortunately missing from the options menu.Now for the cons.STANDARD DEFINITION: while the game still looks great on SD screens, there are two particular warnings I would like to put forth. First, much like Infamous before it, the icons on the minimap have an issue with not being where the actual location of the event or object really is. For example, a bomb may look as though it's on this side of the street as it \"detaches\" itself from the minimap's edge, but as you get closer, you may discover it's actually on the other side of the block. This issue has caused quite a few headaches for me. Also, the map accessed by pressing the \"Select\" button does not zoom out very far, although it zooms in much more than it does in HD. It's rather obvious that the game was created for high-definition screens, but only at 720p, as running the game on a 1080-capable screen causes some texture and anti-aliasing issues, as well.CAMERA: the game's camera is, at times, your worst nightmare. I have had it spin wildly in place, get stuck behind objects, jump \"helpfully\" to a place where I can no longer see anything, and give me close-ups of... a wall. Or worse, the floor. Most of the time it operates exactly how it should, and for me worked fine in melee combat in spite of complaints as to otherwise. When it DOES work, it's a great piece of code. When it doesn't, it gets you killed. A little more playtesting would've solved this problem, but as it is, beware.CONTROLS: Cole STILL sticks to things like a fruit fly on flypaper, although the \"drop\" button has been fixed so that he lets go altogether and usually doesn't stop unless he hits the ground or the floor. He's still just as bouncy and twitchy, too, randomly hopping off railings (or ONTO them), plummeting into thin air, or sliding off into the water. The Car Jump feature is more of a pain than actually useful, and the Kinetic Pulse can be extremely fussy: touch an object with the one you're holding, and Cole immediately drops it. Although most other controls work just fine, some of the powers are mapped to some strange buttons, and it's often easy to forget you have the wrong power equipped and end up doing quite the opposite of what you planned.UGC EDITOR: not so much a con as a fifty-fifty good-bad feature, the User Generated Content editor is a nice touch, but a little weird. It's impossible to know what you're doing without tutorials, and even with them, making missions can be a genuine pain. Certain features are lacking, such as the way enemies react, and the requirement of a PlayStation Network account is understandable, but it still kind of sucks. Missions can be very difficult to create and often take hours of tweaking just to make them run correctly.LANGUAGE: the use of language has been at least doubled and although, occasionally, it is used for comedic effect, more often it's used merely for the shock value. To me, the first game's use of language, while still a bit overdone, was just about right for its type - this one's is just absurd at times. Nix, I can understand, but Cole is awesome enough without spewing some pretty poor word choices as often as he does.Overall, the game is a worthy buy and a beautiful work of art. It ties up the franchise wonderfully and provides hours of entertainment for the hero - or villain - in all of us. \"Half as long, twice as bright\", indeed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2011"}

Also, hidden collectibles are available allowing the player to go back and find all the items to develop gadgets. This is more than a simple beat-em-up game; the enemies have abilities that complement each other, thus attacks have to be thought out or you will be left open for attack. Also, Knack's size will change approaches to enemies, bringing both balance and strategy to the gameplay.The game is a stylized with great colorful graphics. Unfortunately, however, there are frame-rate drops, both when transmitting to the PlayStation Vita as well as in certain instances of game play (especially in area transitions).Back on PlayStation, the second game I played was Crash Bandicoot. One of the people behind that game, Mark Cerny, was responsible for this game as well. His influence can be felt in the music and gameplay: the camera is fixed like in Crash Bandicoot and the music, simple and eloquent, has similarities to Jak and Daxter: the Precursor Legacy (another game he influenced).

{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube. For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"AMAZING!","reviewText":"This is obviously superior compared to the orginal on the PSX.  Although to me this better and harder, its still easy.  The controls are still the same frustrating controls they always were as well, and the story is unchanged (though there have been new things added).  So how do I rate this game? Well, its a little in between a four and a five.The gameplay is astonishingly good, but as with most RE games this doesn't have much replay value.  You go through it once and then its on the shelf for a while before you remember it. The gameplay is pretty cool none the less though, but it lacks replay.  But what does boost its replay are the extra modes the game has after beating it.  You can select harder difficulty levels and even an invisible enemy mode (but that was a little insane).The frustrating controls from the PSX version are back, and if you prefer to use the D-Pad then you'll need to get adjusted to the joystick, being that if you have big hands like me, the D-pad on your GC controller is a little hard to reach.  Yes, the footstep sounds do get annoying but you get used to it.  Where as the controls are frustrating, so is the menu system.  I was hoping they'd fix it up this time.  You can only hold 8 items, and I don't know about you but the fact that an arrow head takes up one full space in your inventory was kind of stupid.  Yes, ammo is all over the place, but the inventory management (especially for Chris) looks designed so that you only carry around one weapon at a time. So the inventory management is still the same as it always was, and thats another reason why I couldn't give it a five.The graphics and sound in this game are amazing, but as I stated earlier the story is unchanged.  The voice acting is perfct as well.  The puzzles in the game have changed drastically this time around, and have become harder.  The game presents more threats as well.  For example if you kill a Zombie you must torch the body or they will become a crimsom head later in the game.Most people say this game is hard...I found it to be somewhat easy.  While harder than the PSX version this is, it still isn't quite as hard as I expected it to be. But the game does present different endings (six for each character) and the objectives to get them all can be tough at times (like you have to get your partner to stay alive in the final battle), but the overall game isn't hard.I like the game a lot but because of the lack of replay its hard to do again, even for the endings and the secrets obtained.  The game is great the first time but because of the darkness and silence and footsteps the game is boring to play a second time.OVERALLOn the good side+Cool graphics and sound+Great update+New puzzles for PSX masters (thank god as if it weren't easy enough)+New Bosses and Enemies+New layout and design for some areasBut on the bad side-Lack of replay value-Footsteps get annoying at times-Still too easy for an RE master-Inventory Management","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2002"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"StephLadder","summary":"between jobs 'shoot-em up'...

I don't want a cakewalk either. I want something that when I play, they'll be moments where I'll kick ass but then other moments where I need practice, forcing me to get better. And that's how all games should be. But after the recently released Ninja Gaiden and Metroid Prime 2, you got to wonder why the difficulty's being ramped up so much.Story: Basically in this game, you're dealing with Dante before we know him as Dante, the kick ass, cool oozing guy from the first one, and to a lesser extent, the 2nd one. Here, you're dealing with how he started and the rivalry with his brother Virgil.Graphics: Maybe I'm being spoiled but after playing Resident Evil 4, Star Fox Assault and Halo 2, I'm look at DMC 3's graphics with a state of \"meh\". It's not that these graphics are bad. Hell they're so neat and fit into the gothic look of the surroundings perfectly. But as a PS2 title, it's nice but you've probably seen better.Sound/Music: Always a lowpoint for this series. Dante has that cheesy one liner type voice where he has to have some pun or joke before he does something. And when the action gets going, it's not sweet epic music like Halo or energetic like the boss fight music from Final Fantasy VII, it's these horrible metal guitars.Gameplay: Ever have one of those experiences where you love doing something but you have to deal with something else while you're at it? First of all: this game is downright fun. Pulling out combos and acrobatic maneuvers with your sword or your twin handguns has never been funner. Like the Prince in the Prince of Persia sequel, he's given a lot more moves and some classics like Air Hike or Whirlwind.However.....the game is %$#^ING HARD. I mean, I literally died on the 2nd mission and almost died on the first one and I'm fairly good at the DMC series. The problem is the developers had enemies coming at you in spades with close to 5-8 at one time. In one early level, you're dealing with enemies that can actually split in 2. And of course, you have to buy special moves and your items(stuff like potions, extra men, special meter filler etc or holy water) are quite expensive. It's like the developers just made the game hard just for the hell of it and said to gamers \"have fun, kids!\". Ugh.However, if you can get passed that, it is quite fun to play and it's intentionally or unintentionally quite comical. If you have a gameshark, turn on infinite health code.

In truth, the main story line is great and the game's \"conversation system\" is essentially flawless and excellent.  But unfortauntely nearly everything else about the game needs lots and lots of work.  The main story is SHORT for an RPG type game.  You can complete the story line in 7 hours and I'm not exagerating.  The side missions are as generic as can possibly be made:  the levels (both indoor and outside) during optional side missions all look the same and the enemies, you got it, all look the same.That would be forgivable but the lame enemy and team AI is not so easily forgiven.  Enemies are braindead.  Most will stand there and shoot or wose simply run toward you.  That makes for easy target practice.  The game at any difficulty level is easy -- simply grab the weapons with the greatest accuracy and stand behind objects for protection.  There's simply not enough _genuine_ strategy needed to win at combat.  Your teammates are just as dumb as your enemies and they will simply stand in front of you even when you direct them to move out of the way.In sptite of the many faults, I enjoyed the main story.  I dont think the game is worth more than 30 bucks retail given the short length of the game.  Replayability is fairly pointless since there are only a few decisions you can make at the end that really matter and you can simply load a save to see the various endings.  Its a good game but not remotely worth a 5 star rating.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2008"}

This refers to the PS3 version.I've played a lot of shooter and survival games, but Dead Space adds some great twists that make it fresh and exciting.First, fighting tactics.  As others have said, you don't go for the usual head or torso shots, you go for the limbs.  This is great fun.Second, the graphics.  Absolutely gorgeous and faultlessly detailed.  No render errors, no load snags, no frame rate problems.  None.  And no constant reuse of pipes, walls, etc. except where it's appropriate for them to look the same as another spot.Third, environment and sound.  You're kept on your toes by the creepy atmosphere and the sound is fantastic.  Distant clangs, soft nearby noises and other sounds constantly keep you wondering if there's a baddie behind the next corner.Fourth, realism.  There are many zero G areas where you have to leap from surface to surface (your boots are magnetic).  These are challenging but not annoying and add a nice twist.  There are also areas where there is no atmosphere and you have to watch your air supply closely.Fifth, perspective.  For the first time, your health and your suit's special power meters are on the back of your suit itself, not in a corner of the screen.  The over-the-shoulder perspective is nicely judged - you're not so close to yourself that you can't around, but far enough back to get a good, wide view.  Your body does block a part of the left half of the screen, but I've never found this a problem.The not so good?  Mainly two things that are far from a killjoy but could have been better.One, the on-screen displays when you view your \"rig\" inventory, the map, and text logs you collect have absolutely puny text.  They're almost impossible to read on a 34-inch conventional TV using the 3-prong high-quality video (not hi-def).Two, you upgrade your weapons and suit powers at \"benches\" using \"nodes\" you collect along the way.  Both the nodes and benches are few and far between, so you don't get to upgrade as much as you'd like.That's it.  Dead Space is simply the best game I've played on the PS3, and possibly the best ever.  It's richly detailed in every possible respect, brings fresh ideas to the 3rd-person shooter experience, and has no functional flaws and no real controller-throwing frustrations.Absolutely highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002I0KOSI","description":"","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Gorgeous, emotional, awesome: kinda crap on PC","reviewText":"Bioshock Infinite follows Booker DeWitt, a former Calvaryman and Pinkerton who is given a job to find Elizabeth Comstock in the floating city of Columbia, which is ruled over with an iron fist by the Prophet Father Comstock and being undermined by the Vox Populi, made up of the minority citizens who're treated barely better than slaves. To avoid spoilers to a fantastic and organic story that I already can't wait to play a second time, that's the only mention of story I'll make.Gameplay is traditional Bioshock, though they seem to have upped the weapons unnecessarily, as there is simply copies of every Columbian weapon with a Vox Populi copy. Vigors replace ADAM, and is powered by salts. During non-combat, enemies freak out way too easily, but otherwise, this is what you'd expect. And not a Big Daddy in sight, replaced by powered enemies that focus on a single Vigor. One major improvement is the ending decisions are influenced by far more esoteric choices than just whether to kill certain enemies(which is almost entirely predetermined), and the depth of some choices is incredibly faint to see at first: heads or tails, bird or cage?Elizabeth, as is no secret, is a companion character, and is genuinely useful. She remarks on important finds, provides health and salts and even cash for you. She is complex, emotionally engaging, charming, and so entertaining its worth following her around just to hear her pop-up conversations.The world is gorgeous, and after you get over the cringworthy racist overtones you're bombarded with, the world is almost more fun to explore than to play the game. Hidden passages are everywhere, code phrases painted on walls, locks to pick to find side quests, everything hides secrets just below the surface. The conversations of the populace flow naturally and are a treat to see, like the job auction which is a ten minute or so sidebar with no story influence, the kind of touch that makes the world feel alive.The only issue is some PC performance problems. My comp is ~4 years old, and I've upped RAM and the video card, but even on medium graphics, there are problems. Clipping issues, Elizabeth falls through the floor periodically, and during conversations she'll start to stutter or have her head spin like the girl from the Exorcist.Nits are limited to experience and other PC issues. You have to know to glitch every vendor machine in order to get enough cash to get the boosts you need, conversations overlap to easily, especially critical ones, and you don't cut away to listen to voxophone records like you should. The duplicate weapons make it harder to plan, as you don't know what ammo will be available in the next area. The PC UI doesn't allow equipment management at all, despite giving you a command for it. Some lights are blindingly bright. The Handyman enemy is drastically overpowered, as his movement alone makes you have a seizure and he can knock you across the map like a ping pong ball. The interface should've been modded to allow map views, play all your voxophone records, and easier equipment maintenance.In short, this is absolutely gorgeous, engaging, deep, and emotional. Just make sure you have a Lamborghini level computer if you want to avoid piercing the veil of disbelief. Otherwise, this would be 6 stars","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2013"}
{"product_name":"B002V16T0Q","reviewerName":"M. Fulkerson","summary":"Creative, thoughtful, and a total blast!","reviewText":"Metro 2033 is one of those games that will only garner more respect as the years go on.  Most first person shooter games would have you shooting and fragging your way through levels as if you were Rambo on speed, but what makes Metro 2033 so unique and playable is the fact that your character is vulnerable, and, thus, realistic.  Sure, you're shooting flying demons and other-worldly mutations that continually spawn before your very eyes, but the game does a fantastic job of staging the levels where you feel like you're fighting for your life in a very real predicament.The main thing going for Metro 2033 is the story line.  Based on a book of the same name, the story pulls you in immediately, and you are instantly caught up in the trials and tribulations of your peers.  The narration from the character you play is fantastic.  The guy who does the voice has such an interesting and introspective tone that you can't help but get sucked in to his plight.  The dialogue, for the most part, is well written and acted, and a good deal of humor manages to work itself into the story as well.  You always feel like you're propelling the story forward no matter what missions and battles you need to accomplish.One of the best aspects of 2033 is its variety.  Each level presents you with a different challenge, and you never feel like you're repeating yourself.  It's this diversity in the gameplay that makes one feel something is getting done, and the unpredictability makes it hard to put the controller down.  Some levels involve fighting monsters and demons, but there was a surprising amount of battle that goes on with other humans as well.  They all have different abilities and skills, and you have to adapt to your surroundings in order to push to the end.  It's a very fresh way to approach a video game, and the developers do an excellent job in changing it up.One definite attribute about Metro 2033 is the difficulty factor.  This is not an easy game.  I can't remember a time where a first person shooter was so challenging, and I very much respect it for this fact.  Too often we are offered games that just involve shooting as many moving targets as humanly possible with no real end gain.  Metro 2033 really makes you work for your success, and while some levels are easier than others, a few will have you really scrambling to achieve them.  Since Metro 2033 isn't a terribly long game (10-12 hours), it makes up for it in laying down some significant obstacles for you to clear.The most effective and creative part of this entire game was the ending.  While most games are content to just throw a boss at you and make you wear down their health meter, 2033 comes up with an incredibly clever take on making your final move.  The real challenge lies in the entire game leading up to the end, and once the finale takes place it further tests your cognitive skills in a way that is wholly original.  I can't recommend playing this game enough, simply so gamers can experience the end scene.There is very little this game does wrong, and the issues are minor at that.  There have been complaints about graphics and textural colliding, but really, are you going to let that ruin your experience?  There were, maybe, three times during the entire length of the game where slain enemies will sort of mesh into the walls around them, or their bodies will spasmodically twitch because they're jammed between a door and a railing, but that stuff is kind of amusing.  It certainly doesn't detract from the gameplay in any way.  The graphics are just fine.  This game has a heavy duty atmosphere that is almost entirely set underground, so it is, by nature, a very dark and depressing looking game.  Gamers need to get right with this idea.  It's a very dark setting with a dark story, and the graphics do a fine job of reflecting that.The only feature of the game that outright annoyed me were the scenes set in the underground cities where your character talked to people.  You'll be trying to listen to someone about the details of your upcoming mission, and three other random city dwellers will start yakking in your ear.  Simply walking by people in this game will trigger conversations, but when three or four of them are occurring simultaneously it just turns into a jumble of noise.Despite these minor gripes, Metro 2033 very much surprised me in its originality and story line.  There is nothing new this game brings to the table, but where it succeeds is its fresh take and execution in an otherwise tiring genre.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00004TSXC","reviewerName":"-- \"--\"","summary":"OVERRATED - but a decent RPG","reviewText":"Neverwinter Nights has been praised by much of the gaming press in the time since its release, yet I can't help but feel that they have somehow overlooked the game's numerous and glaring flaws. I'm not claiming that Nights isn't a fun combat-oriented RPG (with more brains than Diablo and most of its ilk) - but does it have problems? Oh yeah, it definitely does!First of all, here's a list of what the game does well: As one might expect from a Dungeons & Dragons product, the character creation segment is deeply involving for die-hard RPGers, and it is worlds better than the \"here's your pick of classes and a name\" system that so many shallow RPGs employ these days. The graphics are immediately appealing to the eye - particularly where the player character models are concerned. Swords shimmer in the light and armor flickers as you pass by flaring torches. The hand-drawn artwork that accompanies this polygonal world is also top-of-the-line. This game is massively replayable (assuming you dig the game in the first place). With all of the character options and quests, the official single player campaign is quite massive (although the story-driven part of the campaign is rather brief). On top of this, the mod community is thriving, and should produce material that is even better than what the folks at Bioware have given us. The combat animations are the best I've ever seen in an RPG. You can actually see your character deflecting incoming blows and generally fighting for his or her life. Your opponents do likewise. The best thing about Neverwinter Nights is that it generally allows the player to tackle problems in various ways. For example, you can enter that dungeon through the main entrance, sneak around the back, or enter through the cellar in some cottage nearly a mile away.Neverwinter Nights certainly has its strengths - some of which should henceforth be required in a self-respecting RPG. Unfortunately, the game has more than its share of faults that you may not have heard about at PC Gamer or Gamespot. Here are some examples: Despite all of the things there are to do in and around the city of Neverwinter, the scenery is horrendously repetitive. Sure, the outdoor segments of the game really shine from a graphical standpoint (most notably the druid encampment mid-way through the campaign), but once you head indoors, things get really bland. It's not because the level design is poor, but because the game suffers from repetitive textures. For example, you begin the game in the Academy at Neverwinter, which, oddly enough, resembles pretty much every other indoor locale the game has to offer. Get used to it, or you're not going to enjoy adventuring all that much. As I mentioned before, the game sports some impressive visuals - but somehow, despite this, the enemy character models tend to look rather silly. Orcs look like blocky rejects from WarCraft, and panthers' legs disjoint as they run to catch up with you. Needless to say, the enemies probably won't impress much. The storyline is severely lacking in Neverwinter Nights. The game does include some memorable characters, events, and one particularly good surprise, but apart from that, it's just another \"bring down the evil cult\" sort of scenario. Note to all you game-makers out there: hold the evil cultist stuff. It's tired. Neverwinter Nights also suffers from poor writing. Conversations with NPCs are most often boring, and that's a shame since there's so bloody much conversing going on throughout the course of the game! On top of this, the voice acting is generally bad. These people like to chew the heck out of that proverbial scenery. \"Ha-ha-ha-ha! You are too late to stop me!\" Yeah, it's like that. There are many portraits to choose from when you're setting up an alternate persona, and yet the NPCs wandering about in the game world can end up looking just like you! It was annoying in Baldur's Gate, and it's annoying now. NPC portraits and PC portraits should be completely different from one another, and I don't care how busy the artists get. Buggy. I reached a point in the game where a bug prevented me from continuing, and I had to RESTART the entire game. That is BAD, folks.All in all, my take on Neverwinter Nights is that it's a good, enjoyable adventure that's worth taking, provided you know what to expect and don't subscribe to all that media hype floating around out there. Don't be fooled - this game has its problems, and it is completely undeserving of its 95 of 100 score in mags like PC Gamer. Fortunately, solid gameplay keeps you coming back for more... provided some of the bugs don't force you into early retirement.Final Grade: C+","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2002"}

There are issues which are tied to the core engine of the game, and really aren't a surprise if you've played Fallout 3 and/or Skyrim.Now, I will say this is lesser of an edition than the Fallout 3: GOTY, as that gave you:- A really awesome poster that is in my office at work- A foldout MAP, which of course is several levels of invaluable, especially if you don't want to waste a perk on \"Explorer\" (which shows all locations on the map).Whereas Fallout NV: Ultimate Edition doesn't give you anything.So, in closing:- If the bugs, glitches, etc. are a deal breaker, stick with the regular Fallout:NV (without the DLC).  It was the DLC that ramped up these occurrences and won't be patched as Obsidian/Bethesda have moved on.- If that DOESN'T bother you, then this is the definitive collection of New Vegas and will give you weeks, if not months, of gameplay, and also holds the record for the most spoken words of dialogue in a video game (over 60,000!).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J6KU","description":"","reviewerName":"Adrian Jenkins \"southerndudeman\"","summary":"Late to the game, but in a few words...","reviewText":"...I like it. It doesn't hold a candle to Dark Souls (I'm not even sure why Dark Souls keeps coming up in the conversation), but it's a relaxing adventure which holds little interest beyond a first playthrough for non-trophy-hunters.Dragon's Dogma concerns the adventures of a nameless character (called the Arisen), as he battles to win back his physical heart from a nameless dragon (called, apparently, the Dragon). I have no idea what the dogma of this dragon is. Most likely, a developer/localization team just thought the word \"dogma\" sounded cool.The game is a 3rd person affair. You have the choice of 3 initial classes, but this later extends to 9 (6 pure classes, and 3 hybrid classes, assuming my memory serves me). You can pretty much switch classes at will. In fact, this is key to creating the best possible character, stat-wise, in the game, but nothing in the game actually tells you this, and truthfully, it's not that important. You also have helper characters, called Pawns. One pawn is your creation, and you have pretty good control over him/her. For example, you can choose his/her class (although I think pawns only have access to 6 classes). In addition, you are allowed to hire 2 more pawns, of which you have little control. Basically, these pawns fill in the gaps for your party. If you have a friend who has played the game, you can hire that pawn for free. This causes severe balancing issues in the game - I advise against it, unless you are looking for a quick path to platinum. You can also send your pawn out for hire. As s/he progresses, she will learn abilities against particular enemies, and knowledge about particular quests, even if you've never seen these enemies/quests before, which is helpful.Battle is...frenetic. Enemies will swarm you, and your pawns will often do much of the work (particularly on an initial playthrough). Later, you will encounter huge, boss-like enemies that are more readily dispatched with special tactics. It's quite fun, but it can be difficult, particularly if you stray off the road and run into an enemy you are not prepared for.The story is laughably stupid. It's not terrible. It's just...stupid. However, you'll probably lose interest, unless you're a fanboy-in-the-making.The single biggest problem in the game is the difficulty of movement in the overworld. While there is a teleport feature, it's horrible. You have access to a very limited number of gate-type stones (I think you have one, in fact, for most of the game), and the warp stones necessary to utilize them also cost money. If you play through a few times, you see why the developers did this. The game is very short if you have warp speed between towns. I think I beat the whole thing in around 7 hours without really trying, and under 5 when I was trying.There are some bonuses as well. I particularly liked the online dragon. If you play him offline, he's a relatively tough enemy who gives you good loot after defeating him. If you fight him while playing online, he is a holy terror who will likely rip you to shreds unless you have gone through serious preparation. The loot he drops in his online form is awesome (including special armor and masks off legendary heroes such as Beowulf and St. George). I beat him twice myself, which I why I know of those two particular masks.However, outside of this, there is little reason to play the game past an initial playthrough. Unlike Dark Souls, whose New Game + is a great experience, there is absolutely no change in the enemies level or power. You will cut through everything the game has to offer, and if you use your money to purchase gate-type stones (I think they were called \"Rift Stones\"), you will blow through subsequent playthroughs in record time.For twenty bucks, though, it's not a bad game. I think its \"sequel\" Dark Arisen was a free game on PS+. Happy gaming!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2014"}

Everything you loved about the console titles is present in this game, so you can take the adventure with you in the palms of your hands.While the game does utilize most of the Vitas gimmicks (Motion sensing, touch screen, touchpad on the back, light sensitivity), but doesn't rely too heavily on them, and they don't hinder the game at all since many of them are optional.If you love Uncharted, grab this! Don't wait as long as I did to experience the greatness of this title.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2013"}

They made it a bit bigger so it fits better for all hand sizes, and they adjusted the triggers so it's better for shooters. It feels very solid and well made and it is immediately apparent that the controller is good quality and will last for a long time. The lightbar is a very cool addition and is used well in games, Tomb raider definitive addition is a good example of that. When you shoot your gun the light flickers and adds a sense of realism, and when your health is low it goes red to warn you. There are more examples from that specific game but I'll leave it at that. The speakers are cool and are used for the same game for various things and they are decent quality. The touch pad is cool because different games take advantage of it for different things like spray painting in infamous second son, and I'm sure it will be good for strategy games.I am pleased that Sony listened to their fans and adjusted the Dualshock in various ways, it is a great controller.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2014"}

Unless you utterly despise the genre, you should have bought this a long time ago.I cashed in on this amazing value despite the fact that I had no idea what Fallout was- other than another CRPG. At first I was a bit put off by the graphics and turn-based system, having played a bit too much Baldur's Gate and the likes. However, these games are amazingly addictive, and I ended up playing through them both several times. The setting is unique and interesting, and you really have a sense of urgency about accomplishing your main missions. The graphics are also not so bad once you get into it.

The two most important things a gamer needs are a comfortable headset and a comfortable mouse.  On the mouse side of things, I've been using theLogitech G9 Laser Mouse, a laser gaming mouse I've really enjoyed.  But I'm always curious to try other mice and jumped at the opportunity of taking a look at Microsoft's SideWinder series.On a purely tech level, the SideWinder is pretty nice.  With a high click count (10 million!) and 2000 DPI for tracking purposes, it's a durable, fast mouse that should satisfy gamers everywhere.  I also appreciate the \"on-the-fly\" DPI-switching feature (the three bars down the center).  However, I didn't find the DPI-switching to be as effective as the ones on the Logitech G9 mouse, which offer a few more options in between.  I found myself wanting a setting between the fastest and the mid level once in awhile.  I also wasn't sure how I'd feel about the vertical buttons on the side of the mouse, versus the horizontal, \"slit-type\" buttons on most mice.  I actually liked them better than I thought I would, but it's purely a matter of preference.The problem I have with the mouse is that I don't find it to be very comfortable.  The way it's designed isn't ergonomically fit for me and I find it sometimes cutting off my circulation, due to the way it fits my hand.  I find my wrist/hand on a slight upward slant that didn't really feel comfortable, especially when you add in the circulation issue.  For this very reason, I probably won't use the mouse as much as I'd like and I definitely prefer the feel of Logitech's G9 instead.Which is a shame because I do like the options it offers, it's not as pricey as the Logitech G9 and it's a solidly-built mouse.  But, like I originally said, it's all about comfort and this mouse just isn't doing it for me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2009"}

{"product_name":"B002I0K780","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Little Sack Boys Return with a BIG Heart","reviewText":"Just over two years ago, the first LittleBigPlanet came out and blew some of our minds.  It first showed that the platformer wasn't dead.  Mario wasn't the only one who had staying power in the genre.  Turned out a little Sackboy could hold his own as well.  But the real joy of LittleBigPlanet was that it was a game that almost never ended.  It was a game where you could create your own levels and enjoy the creations of others.  As a result there is generally always something new to discover in the first game.  The second one is bigger, better and allows for far more creativity.  The best part about it is that anything you accomplished in the first game isn't lost.  It is carried over.  So fear not fans of the first game, your hard work isn't lost.The first game had a campaign that more or less showed you what the game was all about.  There was absolutely no story to speak of in that game.  The second one is different.  There's actually something of a narrative here.  The denizens of Craftworld are being attacked by a force only known as the Negavitron who is slowly absorbing everything in Craftworld.  It's up to your Sackperson (because you can also play as a Sackgirl this time around) to stop the Negavitron and save Craftworld. It's not much of a story, but there are actually tons of cutscenes scattered about, complete with voice acting.  And it's really good voice acting, and some of it is really funny stuff.But much like Mario, you'd have to be crazy to actually be playing LittleBigPlanet 2 because of its actual storyline.  It's all about the platforming and all about the gameplay.  The main campaign to stop the Negavitron isn't very long at all.  You'll go across six worlds, all of which have anywhere from 5 to 7 levels.  In each level you can find several objects that can be used later in create mode while plowing through the levels to see just what Media Molecule has decided to show you.  If anything the campaign here is much like the first one.  Yes, there's actually a story here, but much of what the campaign has here is showing you what you can soon create on your own.  The good news is that there's nothing here that is simply tech demo status.  There is nothing but pure creation here and many of these levels are expertly designed.  Even better is that EVERY level will throw something new at you.  One moment you're running through a basic level... the next your introduced to the grappling hook that allows you to swing across gaps.  But it doesn't end there.  You'll find yourself going into levels where you ride on furry little critters or find yourself in shooter style levels similar to those R-Type game.  No level ever feels like the previous one.There are also plenty of gadgets.  There are, of course, the grappling hooks, but you'll also find the Grabinator which allows you to pick up heavy blocks (or your allies if you're going about it co-op style) and you'll find the Cakeinator which allows you to shoot cakes that you can step on and use as platforms.  You'll also get water guns to put out burning platforms etc.  Likewise just like the first one there are certain moments in levels where you'll be given the chance to place stickers to reveal new objects you can use later on in levels.  Collecting all the objects is the challenging in LittleBigPlanet 2.  Not only are they important to use in create mode, but it shows true mastery of the game.  And there are hidden goodies in every level, many of which you'll have to play through a second time to find.  And if you want to get all of them you'll have to team up with a friend.There are, of course, a few things that LittleBigPlanet 2 still stumbles about.  As you play through the levels there are three planes you can stand on.  The background, foreground and inbetween the two.  Shifting between the two can be a pain.  Especially in puzzles that may require such.  It's a pain to lose a life simply because your Sackboy didn't switch planes like he was supposed to.  Luckily there are checkpoints scattered all around and they're most certainly a lot more lenient on the lives than the first game.  The floaty jumpy also returns, a complaint some fans had with the first game.  Personally, I was not bothered by this at all.  Especially when compared to the issue with the different planes.  It's a fun game and you'll find it's totally accessible, but one of the major means of collecting objects is going through a level without dying.  And yes, you'll find that the issue of the planes might ruin that.  You've got be precise with LittleBigPlanet 2.The other issue actually involves multiplayer.  As much fun as it is to play with friends, four of you running around at once is sure to induce the New Super Mario Bros. feeling.  It's much more tempting to want to screw one another over or turn it into a competition.  This is actually ridiculously fun, especially when you've got all the different gadgets.  You can latch on to other allies with this grappling hooks, pick them up and toss them in pits if you wish etc.  This is all fun stuff, but the downside is that if you want to get through the campaign it's easy to leave one another behind, or for things to get crowded when you want to progress further in some levels.  Multiplayer is fun, but it can also be a pain simply because you and your friends will constantly be getting in one anothers way.  You HAVE to use at least 4 players to get a hold of some of the goodies scattered about... but you'll find that a great deal of them are a lot easier to grab when there's just one player in the mix.  This is actually a minor complaint as it truly depends on who you're working with.  But the point is simple... the more friends you're playing with, the more fun (and frustrating) LittleBigPlanet 2 is apt to be.One of the big staples of the first game was the ability to create your own levels.  It's the same thing here.  What makes LittleBigPlanet's editor different from nearly every other game editor is that it actually gives you access to everything you saw in the game.  This includes vehicles, tools, landscapes, backgrounds, music, etc.  Many games--even now--that have level editors tend to limit the player somehow.  As with most things in LittleBigPlanet 2 there's an upside and a downside.  The upside, of course, is total freedom.  You can do anything you want with all these objects.  The downside is that it takes a LOT of time to learn if you didn't play the first one.  The editor is fantastic but it has a steep learning curve.  And in order to make good, competent levels you'll have to invest a lot of time, meticulously playtesting them, etc.  For many of us it's the closest we'll get to actually  being in the game design business.  For others it's too much work.  You're not FORCED to create anything, though, and you can easily spend much of your time playing the creations of other players as well as more by Media Molecule themselves.  You'll get lazy levels, of course, but you're sure to find a lot of good ones too.  There were millions of levels already created for the first game, there will surely be millions more for the second.  It'll take a lot of care and devotion just to pop out ONE great level, but I'm sure many players will find the work and the creativity liberating.As I mentioned at the beginning, your work done on the first LittleBigPlanet doesn't get lost in all this.  The costumes you unlocked in the first one will be back for you to wear and utilize in the second one.  The levels you created in the first one can still be accessed here as well.  So if you played through the first game, totally mastered it and got everything you could (as well as invested in all that downloadable content) you can use it all here.Production wise, LittleBigPlanet is nothing short of awesome.  The level designs themselves are good but so are the graphics.  The backgrounds are amazing as are some of the decorative environments.  Sure it's a 3D side scroller, but the game makes sure to utilize what it can well.  You'll see objects in the foreground and background that are amazing, you'll see cinematics that are also pretty cool and gorgeous.  It's cartoony to look at, but it's a great style.  More amazing is the sound.  The background music is absolutely fantastic and catchy.  So are some of the sound effects.  Production wise, LittleBigPlanet 2 is a technical masterpiece.Those who loved the first LittleBigPlanet are sure to love the second.  It adds a few new gadgets and is definitely bigger and better.  How much bigger is a mystery.  Until you get in there and start creating yourself (or play other creations) there are apt to be some gamers who don't realize how big a step forward the game has really taken.  The campaign, as I said, serves more as a demonstration of what you can do more so than anything.  If the campaign is all you experience I'm sure much of the new stuff you see with LittleBigPlanet 2 will come off as nothing more than bells and whistles.  But when you begin to dive into LittleBigPlanet 2--and I mean really deep--you may discover that LittleBigPlanet 2 outdoes the original in almost every way.  For those who loved the first one, the second one demands your attention.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2011"}

Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Ok but not fantastic","reviewText":"I'm working my way through all the PS3 RPGs and it's taken me a while to get to this one as it's never really stood out in reviews plus it's also not for sale in a lot of stores but I have finally caught up. Most reviewers are accurate however, because it is not remarkable in any way, however it is a solid game that works and is fairly fun to play.So, as befits a Japanese-style RPG this adventure sees you take on the role of a feisty, spiky haired teenager who is going about his business when a terrible and mighty power threatens the world. Unbeknown to you, you have a secret hidden power, which means that you alone are capable of fighting the menace that threatens life as we know it. Together with a rag bag assortment of team mates that include a high born female character with healing powers, a hulk of a brute palace guard with strong physical skills and a perky comedy sidekick who has skill with guns, you make your way through various dungeons and settlements to eventually meet up with and wipeout the terror for good.I swear in my reviews I could have copied that last paragraph and pasted it every time I review one of these games...it's unbelievable that RPGs are STILL slavishly following this formula after so many years. But there you go. Nuff said.So, onto battles. Turn based, random encounters. Nothing new there. But there are some clever touches. First of all, battles take place on a grid, and part of your turn involves moving to a square on the grid before attacking. The reason for this is that each character has attack moves that hit a selected range, sometimes this is a strict line in front of them, sometimes a fan out or a single square directly in front of them. So you can see that the \"move\" step gives depth to the fighting because you need to make sure each character moves to a square where an enemy is with their range to hit...hopefully more than one at a  time. After moving you choose your attack move, then repeat for all characters, and then once they are all set, the attacks all play out, and the enemy takes their turn.The reason I liked this is because of the additional strategy. Because, all of the following can happen and affect the flow of battle:1. The enemy also has set attack ranges so you should also take care not to bunch up so all your team are in range of too many attacks.2. Characters and enemies have elemental classes that do double or half damage for opposing or same element attacks.3. Putting character behind other characters gives the ones at the back \"cover\" and reduced damage from some attacks4. Some enemies also do this, often a weak boss is behind a clump of big fat tank supporting enemies that cover him.5. Sometimes you get combos if several characters target the same enemy, the attacks stack together ( a combo meter has to fill for this)6. Enemies can also get combos on you - this can be devastating7. Characters have a \"limit-break\" attack called an EX move that can only be used sparingly - save this for bosses. EX moves are also elemental.So as you can see the battles can be fun. What lets them down is minor, but the camera view for battles is dreadful, it has about 4 fixed view points, none of which let you see every part of the battle grid clearly - and you need this to plan your positioning. Which is the shame as normal gameplay has a very good player-controlled camera view. But apart from that I enjoyed all the fights. You get better experience for better fights (for example, winning with \"overkill\" moves rather than just scraping a victory by attrition earns you more points) so it pays to fight smart.But now I'm afraid I have to list a few things that don't score so well with this game. The environments and scenery are not that good. Some places like the towns have quite poor textures on the buildings and are low on detail. All the NPCs are built using the same basic models (about 6 of them) just with different clothes. The external scenery is also quite drab - trees have few branches and sometimes just sprout from the ground like posts with no effort made to create realistic roots or foundations (the area outside the Earth Temple was particularly bad). Sense of height and distance is good, you can be quite high up (in London city for example) and enjoy some nice views, but on the whole the environments are not that impressive. Watch out for the stage set in Kyoto where there is an appallingly bad attempt at showing reflections in water which really should have been fixed before release. The other niggle is that nearly all the cut scenes are done via static portraits of the characters with recorded speech and subtitles. So an anguished confession or heated argument will sound great on the soundtrack (the voice recordings are quite good), but might be played out over a 2D image of the character set in position with a hand over their face.My other drawback is the golem collection aspect of the game: as you progress you can find and create \"golems\" which can be used in your team. There are supposedly up to 140 different golems that can be found created or won in the game. It's very reminiscent of the Shin Megami Tensiei series of game, in that you find creatures and use them in your battle team, and the further into the game you go, the better the golems. Each golem has a unique design, character and skills. This sounds like fun, but my issue is this: once you have met the four main human characters in the game, you have no more rom in your battle team for any golems. The four human characters have very flexible skills and abilities - the golems do not. They never learn new skills., but the human characters keep evolving. So as soon as I had my main four, I hardly ever used golems in battle again, and I even stopped synthesising the ones that I had found as they all just got stuck in my inventory and did nothing.Apart from those niggles, I did enjoy the game. It's relatively easy if you level up properly although there are some tricky bosses . There are optional bosses and an optional dungeon, a casino/battle arena where you can play for fun, and some ultimate weapons and skills to earn. All standard fare for an RPG and all fairly satisfactory.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2011"}

Depending on what state you are in there is no tax. So if that's the case it's a straight shot at 15.97 which is a nice deal. So many great games have come out on XBL lately you really are missing out on gems if you don't buy some of these AAA + arcade titles like Braid, Castle Crashers, Bionic Commando Rearmed, Geometry Wars 2. Plus a bunch more coming soon, and others if you have never bought any from the past.The Xbox Live Arcade is a big part of the 360 experience, if you are not taking advantage of it you are missing out on a lot of the best original games to ever come out anywhere. Plus so many great remakes and updates to old classic games. Don't miss out on XBLA, if you have never bought points before it's not a big deal, just don't do anything foolish, like scratching off your code by rubbing too hard. Also buy these from Amazon or true retailers, not from Amazon Market place. To avoid some of the not so funny horror stories I have read here. If you follow those simple rules you will be fine, and will be enjoying a new way to get great original games you can't find anywhere else.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2008"}

The soundtrack is terrible (the blandest of dubstep) and the menus feel too cartoon-y and childish for my taste -- you're greeted with a giant-headed animal thing. The cutscenes aren't animated, just still images with voices. In this day and age, this is completely unacceptable for a game.I begin a match in some sort of Chinese restaurant that looks like it was drawn in MS Paint. There are onion-headed onlookers and a Kung Fu master who also has an onion head. I'm pretty confused as to what is going on. The stage starts breaking apart, I die once -- and still, I somehow defeat Sly Cooper. The next match, I have to face two others enemies. Okay. The stage appears to be some sort of building with low-res textures that rival PSX graphics. I defeat them after a long and boring battle, and the number of opponents goes to three.And it goes on and on from here. Pretty soon, I get to the final boss who looks like a giant unfinished model. I'm not sure if the game has problems loading the boss, or if this is what he's supposed to be. Unimaginative, if you ask me. And then there's an ending that is no different than the beginning.There has been a drought in good video games -- discounting Halo 4 and BO2 -- and Playstation All-stars is a testament to that. Boring game, waste of time and money. I strongly suggest that no one buy it. We don't need to encourage Sony to make more incomplete games.

That is something I rarely do but it wasn't that bad of a price and I was ordering some other stuff and I love D&D games.  Well I wasn't disappointed.  I didn't expect much of anything from this game and so I was more impressed than someone looking for a classic Baldur's Gate game.  I have the computer version but haven't played it yet and I knew this would be nothing like it.  The first time I popped it in I didn't stop playing for like 5 hours.  It was just fun.  THe battles are crazy and the graphics are very good especially when walking through water.  A few knocks on it are the camera which is kinda far away and can be awkward at times especially in massive battles (You tend to fight like 10 or more enemies at once in a big swarm and it is hard to see who you are hitting.)  I haven't tried a magic user yet only the dwarf and it is just pure enjoyment.  If you are looking for classic RPG deep story or non-linear gameplay stay away cause this game has a simple story and pretty much forces you in one direction.  It reminds me a lot like Vampire Redemption for the PC.  The controls are easy and the level up system is nice and just like Vampire since you can control how your character levels up instead of just predetermined stat boosting.  Only problem  with this system is if you plan wrong your character will suffer later.  One thing I didn't get was what the developers were thinking when they put thos stupid Mega Man like floating boulders over pits that sunk when you landed on them.  Aside from looking stupid those parts were just terribly frustrating but passable.  It's sad to say but for the type of game this is I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for those ridiculous things.  But all in all if you like a good action game like Maximo or Jak and Daxter but with a darker D&D twist then go for this game and even those hardcore RPG fans may like this game as a vacation from complex plot lines and massive hours required to complete a game.  GIve it a try it is fun and worth it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2002"}

But not to worry, you can quicky \"regenerate\" at a nearby save point. Overall it's a beautifully rendered, fun, silly, and deadly world. The mission implimentation could use a bit of refinement and the random gunplay could be eased back a little --- mainly because it's usually unprovoked but also because you never get the sense that you make any progress in calming down this gang violence since the enemies simply keep regenerating. All this regeneration (you and your enemies) has it's good and bad points though. I mean it's good to know that there's always a casual enemy to fight and that you can always come back if things go bad.That said, I think the RPG style leveling up system here is a positive step in the right direction for games of all kinds. It's perhaps the most addicting element that video games can have --- it allows the player to make an emotional investment in and take ownership in the developement of the character. So I hope we'll see more of it in the future and, of course, even more compelling leveling systems.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2007"}

Weapons of mass destruction, deployed with complete impunity razed the land in the blink of an eye. The dire situation forced the two opposing factions to negotiate a cease-fire and an agreement was quickly reached, but although the war may have ended, its effects remained. With the deteriorating environment, Earth's population was drastically reduced and those who survived lived a confined existence trapped in underground cities. Eventually countries joined together to form the Greater United Nations and turned their eyes skyward, to space. With the establishment of the USTA, the Universal Science and Technology Administration, man began to seek new worlds beyond the stars.AD 2087...The first year of the spacedate (SD) calendar. Thanks to the success of Professor Trillas Bachstein's warp drive experiments, mankind's dream of a spacebourne existence has inched closer to reality and the USTA secretly began to implement its SRF project, the Space Reconnaissance Force. Now it is SD 0010, and the first official SRF mission and your adventure has begun.CharactersPlayers ofStar Ocean: The Last Hopewill meet and interact with a wealth of characters from different parts of the galaxy, each with their own history and weapons of choice. Just a few of the more prominent characters to familiarize yourself with include:Edge MaverickAlthough generally possessing good judgment, this young Earthling commander of the maiden deep space voyage of the SRF ship the Calnus, can be reckless. His signature weapon is the sword.Faize Sheifa BelethA young Eldarian committed to etiquette and logic, and capable of astounding feats of engineering, Faize is always honorable of those possessing abilities he lacks. His signature weapon is the rapier.Reimi SaionjiThe kind and levelheaded navigator of the Calnus, Reimi was born in an aristocratic Saionji family and has a shared history with Edge back on Earth. Her signature weapon is the bow.Lymle Lemuri PhiOrphaned on her home planet of Lemrick long ago, Lymle is mischievous, but friendly and inexplicably retains the appearance of a young girl. Her signature weapon is the wand.Gameplay and CombatAlthough Edge Maverick is the main character inStar Ocean: The Last Hope, players will of course experience gameplay action in the form of a number of different characters and utilize the signature attacks assigned to each. The game features a real-time combat system which allows for up to four party members to remain active in battle at a time. Improvements to the game's combat system include 'Rush Mode,' where players can switch out active members of their combat groups for reserve members in real-time; 'Sight In/Sight Out' which allows for timed evasive and counter moves against enemies; and the BEAT (Battle Enhancement Attribute Type) system, through which players can change a character's fighting style at will. Other actions players will master through gameplay include piloting of the spaceship Calnus, a first in theStar Oceanseries; item creation in the form of weapons, healing items and accessories; and Private Actions (PAs), a cause and effect relationship between character in-game actions and the acquisition of new abilities and scenarios. Through the increased flexibility mastery of all these skills provides, players should be able to more easily increase their team and individual team member's combat experience and status, and so unlock more advanced combat styles and linked combinations.Key Game Features:Series prequel-Star Ocean: The Last Hopeis a prequel in the classic series, combining sci-fi and fantasy elements, spanning multiple planets and the vastness of space itself to recount the origins of the Star Ocean universe.Exciting Battles- Exhilarating combat expands upon the franchise's famous real-time battle system, including the amazing graphics and visual effects only possible on Xbox 360.Compelling Scenes- The game features breathtaking CG movies by Visual Works, the cutting-edge studio whose previous work includes cutscenes for the acclaimed Final Fantasy RPG series.","reviewerName":"Deal Stealer \"GPS Nav\"","summary":"Tri-Ace is bringing SquareEnix back into the track!","reviewText":"Probably all of SquareEnix games for latest gen console have sucked w/ horrible reviews.  The reason is that SquareEnix felt that Westernizing the artistic style would help sell more for western countries.... well their plan obviously failed!!! Well, at least Tri-Ace is not following that tradition and made a full JRPG w/o any westernizing crap.  So far, Star Ocean is the best JRPG to date.Graphic wise, it's nothing ground breaking.

Also, it's really hard to spend your money to buy weapons/upgrades.  Most of time, you'll be purchasing recipe ingredients or non-upgrade items.  Still, usually I never had to buy any weapon/armor as I find most of them through dungeons.  Also, I'm about half through disk 2 and I don't think they have \"warp\" functionality.

I ran into some problems with it which I would attribute more to user error than product design.Do yourself a favor and watch the video instructions embedded with the pictures of the product at the top of this page.  Me, being the overconfident person that I am, assumed that I knew how to figure out how to apply the protectors, having done it a half dozen times with my older DS, my phone, camera, etc.  Messing up the application process is SUPER FRUSTRATING, especially if you're perfectionist and OCD like me.  If and when you mess up, you feel like you just flushed your money down the drain and want to scream.  Such is my love-hate relationship with screen protectors.  If you want to screen protector to be applied perfectly, you only have one shot!The application system is pretty effective, though counter-intuitive (at least for me).  Which explains why my bottom (second try) screen is pristine, and my top (first try) screen is all messed up.What I didn't really get on my first try, is that the screen should be applied such that the instructions are facing YOU.  This hopefully will make more sense when you have the product in your hands.  How it works, is that there is an instruction panel that folds behind the screen protector itself, so that it sits between the protector and the screen.  You then pull the instructions panel to the right, which peels off the backing to the protector, so that there is minimal dust exposure between the protector and the screen.What this means is that you DON'T peel off the adhesive-side panel and then align the protector with the screen, as you would with other (cheaper) screen protectors.  It also means that you have to make sure that both the screen and the application panel is dust-free when you perform the application.I guess my confusion was that the screen protector is symmetrical, and it wasn't clear to me which side was the adhesive side and which side was the side that faces you (the top side).Like I said before, it's hard to explain the processes without actually doing it or watching it, so watch the instruction video.

It radiates a striking visual appeal in high resolution display, featuring character and environmental graphics whose quality exceeds the original Ninja Gaiden Sigma.&#xA0; Combining both melee and long-range battles against enemies, the game requires skillful and strategic playing to successfully journey through the missions","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"A Solid Title With Some Shortcomings","reviewText":"I've been a fan of Ninja Gaiden games for about as long as I've been playing video games. Even back on my NES, Ninja Gaiden was known for it's quality as much as it's difficulty. When Ninja Gaiden made the jump to the Xbox with Ninja Gaiden and then Ninja Gaiden Black I was only even more impressed with Tecmo's work with the series. Ninja Gaiden Sigma on the PS3 presented a remake of the Xbox original that improved not only the graphical quality but also the framerate and the introduction of side-missions to further the story.It's with some disappointment then that I write this review of Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2. It's not that Sigma 2 is a bad game. But it's certainly not great either. The truth lies somewhere in the middle.So I'll start with what I like first. Tecmo has done a fine job getting the framerate stable. This was an issue that plagued certain parts of the X360 version. I'm happy to say that I didn't once notice any slowdown in the framerate. The controls on the DS3/SIXAXIS feel like they are mapped perfectly and intuitively. At no point did I miss my X360 controller while playing Sigma 2.The inclusion of side-missions is somewhat neat if only for the fact that you're able to glean tidbits of the behind the scenes storyline that weren't present in the X360 version. During the side-missions you'll assume control of either Ayane, Momiji or Rachel and battle through a shortened level fighting a boss at the end. The levels fit in the overall storyline and don't feel tacked-on. However, because the levels are spread out throughout the game it can break the flow. Each female character controls slightly differently and has a different move set than Ryu which can cause some problems if you're relatively new to the game. One particularly nasty boss fight takes place at the end of Momiji's level and has you squaring off against 2 bosses at the same time. It can be brutal if you're a newcomer to the series.On the topic of difficulty, Sigma 2 has definitely been toned down from previous Ninja Gaiden games and even from Ninja Gaiden 2 on the X360. The 'Normal' difficulty setting known as \"Path of the Warrior\" in Sigma 2 is comparable to the 'Easy' difficulty \"Path of the Acolyte\" on the X360 version of the game. That's not to say that there isn't challenge in Sigma 2. Path of the Mentor and the even more difficult Path of the Master Ninja will test the limits of anyone's gaming prowess. One big difference that makes Sigma 2 immediately more accessible to newcomers is the regenerating health bar. When you take damage in Sigma 2 it comes in 2 forms - immediate damage which drains your blue health bar but regenerates once nearby enemies are dispatched. The more permanent red damage shortens your energy bar and thus how much blue energy you can recover. Red damage can only be recovered either through using restorative items or via a save point. Either way, the regeneration helps to alleviate the brutal difficulty the series is known for. Items are also easily obtained by shopping at Muramasa's, an item vendor located throughout the game.Sigma 2 does have limited online multiplayer in the form of challenge rooms that you and a friend can tackle together. These are similar to the challenges found in Ninja Gaiden Black, only with a friend. The challenges range from pretty mild stuff all the way to the uber-impossible that likely very few players will best. Either way it's a very fun and welcome addition to the Ninja Gaiden series.Now to the issues that I have with the game. I suppose my first disappointment would be the most apparent - the graphics. To call them ugly would be inaccurate, however, the graphics are by no means great. Sigma 2 is definitely showing it's age. The environments are can be described as barren and lacking detail. One entire segment of the game takes place in New York and a section in Times Square. Tecmo definitely dropped the ball in this drab, barren level. Times Square consists of a few poorly designed neon signs and some broken down cars. Very disappointing. Toward the end of the game the graphics do improve at least when it comes to details. But Sigma 2 won't go down in the history books as a graphical powerhouse. With the latest slew of PS3 exclusives pushing the graphics on consoles to new highs it's difficult to look past Sigma 2's average graphics.Another disappointment is the in-game camera. Though a faulty camera is nothing new to the series, somehow the camera in Sigma 2 manages to be even more cumbersome than previous Ninja Gaiden games. I found myself frequently finding the camera out of place or slow to adjust. It's frustrating enough when it's just you fighting with the camera for a better view of the environment. But it's much worse when you're in the middle of a major fight and the camera doesn't pick up on enemies. The game does at least feature a button to recenter the camera on Ryu - expect to use it constantly.The story has never been a focus of the series and it's no surprise to find a rather flaky and sometimes cheesy storyline present here. Personally I find the story in Sigma 2 significantly less compelling than that present in the original Ninja Gaiden Black/Sigma. The story in Sigma 2 basically revolves around the Black Spider Ninja clan teaming with Greater Fiends to try and revive the Archfiend - a sort of king of fiends. Like I said, the story isn't the focus but it's still disappointing that such little emphasis is placed on developing the plot.Also the first time you load Sigma 2 you'll be treated to a rather lengthy install as the game installs about 3gb of game data on your PS3s HDD. While I normally don't have an issue with game installs I do take issue with Sigma 2's install. The main issue is that the game frequently stops to load or is very slow when transitioning from one game element to another. Particularly when you come across fallen ninja and read the in-game journals that these departed ninja have left. I suppose it wouldn't be so annoying but for the fact that the game installs 3gb of data and still has frequent pauses whilst data is loaded.Ninja Gaiden Sigma remains in my eyes the ultimate ninja game on the PS3. Sigma 2 is a decent game itself that is showing it's age and shortcomings but still worth playing. Hopefully Tecmo will see fit to design a new Ninja Gaiden game with the PS3's strengths specifically in mind.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2009"}

They added some nice features like Assassin's being called in to help you out (though when you really need it it doesn't always allow you to do so.)The game is very entertaining but the biggest knock I would have on it is that there is not a lot of game play to it. Collecting treasures and flags does not make a good game, it just gives you something to do to make it seem like it is better than what it is. I would rather see a really good storyline come 2 years in waiting than a crappy one (Not so much with this game but Revelations was terrible!)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2011"}

It was all over the place. Popping this in my N64 when I took it home I spent literally 2 hours just exploring Kokiri Village just cause it was so fun. But then I realized &quot;oh yeah there's more to this, isn't there?&quot; And that's when the fun started.Graphics: Although you can probably debate this, this has one of the best graphics you'll find on the system. Lot of areas just drop that &quot;wow factor&quot;, like when you first enter Zora's Domain or the game's many cutscenes.Sound: Although there's no voice, except for Navi's annoying &quot;Hey!&quot; and an occasional &quot;Hello&quot; from her or Link's grunts, it's got some awesome music. One thing I love is the short ocarina songs you play, such as Song of Storms, Zelda's Lullaby and Song of Time, plus general area music. Although the overworld music isn't like what it was on Link to the Past, it's still great.Story: The story starts off with Link having a bad dream about a mysterious man and woman. Then Link is summoned to the Great Deku Tree where he fills Link in on his quest and it goes from there. Even though it can be a quite simple story, it's just a huge epic story that kept me interested.Gameplay: The infamous Z-Targeting system that's spawned several developers to use it in their own games. The recent Star Fox Adventures uses this. Your C-Buttons are for your weapons. B is your sword and A is your action button(Talk, Jump, Climb,etc.). You'll know this system by heart cause Navi tells you how many times about it within the first hour. Camera is excellent and the Z targeting helps.Even though you might be able to find this, I suggest you pick it up. Dust off your N64 and dive into what is one of the 90's most critically acclaimed and commercial masterpieces ever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2002"}

Terrorists operate openly, killing thousands; drugs, disease, and pollution kill even more. The world's economics are close to collapse, and the gap between the insanely wealthy and the desperately poor has grown to the size of the Grand Canyon. Worst of all, an ages-old conspiracy bent on world domination has decided that the time is right to emerge from the shadows and take control. No one believes the conspiracy exists--no one but you.In this thrilling role-playing adventure, you play the part of J.C. Denton, a powerful, nanotechnologically augmented antiterrorist agent. It's up to you to stop the conspirators from achieving their goals. But this world is full of lies and betrayal, a world where nothing is as it seems and entire nations can seemingly be turned against you at the push of a button. To succeed, you must travel the globe in a quest for knowledge, develop your character's nanotech augmentations and strengths as you see fit, build a network of allies to assist you, and determine when stealth and strategy are more important than action. And each time you think you've got the mystery solved, the game figured out, there's another, deeper mystery to be unraveled.

You also need to choose how you will be playing the game because you upgrade your character according to your play style. If you are going to be a stealthy assassin then do it. If you want to go in call of duty style blowing up everything then have at it. It's not just those choices either.

You can even play the games on your own if you wish. Highly recommended!There are a lot of \"party\" style games out there that really can't be played by one player. If you're worried about that, don't. The game does exceedingly well of having computer-based characters join in on whatever you're doing. So if your spouse is sound asleep and you want to play, that's fine. Of course, if you do have friends or family to play along with, it's even better!There's a great collection of mini-games here, and they use your Miis which make them even more fun. You can solve puzzles. Try to knock them off of beams. Race across the sand. You try to pop balloons while going on a roller-coaster!The game is awesome about helping you decide which of the many games you want to play. Point to \"Bingo and you're told it'll take about 15 minutes. \"Globe Trot\" will take an hour. The mini-games typically finish in 2-3 minutes. You can plan out your playing exactly to match your schedule.There's even a \"suggestions\" mode where you tell the game how many people want to play, how long they have, and it lists out the games that might meet your needs!Sure, different games will appeal to different players, but that's the fun of the system. There are so many in here that some will be sure to appeal to everyone.

Such a product would prove to be the pinnacle of gaming for the next few years in my life.It was before being introduced to the Playstation 2 Game Console System when my family used the original Sony Playstation for all video gaming purposes (see my review of THAT particular console at http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ILTO03EWJSK2/ref=cm_cr_pr_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN;=B000K6TOK6&nodeID;=&tag;=&linkCode;=#wasThisHelpful).When I first saw this monster of a game console, I thought it looked like a large book. But let me assure you--this will almost undoubtedly give you more entertainment than all the books in your library.Whereas the Playstation 1 has only 32-bit graphics, the Playstation 2 has 128-bit graphics and HD support--although few PS2 games took advantage of this feature. To add to this fact, the Playstation 2 can play any and all Playstation 1 games. With this fact feature, you can play games like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon along with PS2 games like Gran Turismo 3 and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City all on the same console.The Playstation 2's best gimmick may have been the reason why it sold so well: the ability to play CDs and DVDs. That's right--the Playstation 2 has the ability to play any disc-based movies (or so was the case back when it came out).Sega fans will be disappointed to know that the Playstation 2 is the very reason why Sega no longer makes hardware. Thanks to the Sony Playstation 2, the Sega Dreamcast didn't make enough sells and--as a result--caused Sega to leave the hardware market.Overall, the Playstation 2 Game Console is an amazing system.

You buy Halo, Dead or Alive 3, and maybe a few of your favorites (Tony Hawk, 007, Madden, etc...)  Well, to make a complete set of awsome games for XBOX, their's one more you need to pick up.  It's called: Jet Set Radio Future!Here's why you pick this game.  Is this what your loking for?  You want a fun game, with good graphics, and huge worlds to explore. You want a game with good replay value, fun multiplayer, and dozens of new things to try out.  You've found your game!Here's the basic story, and the point of the game.  The year (like you've probably heard a hundred times by now) is 2024.  An evil police dude is trying to take over the free will of Japan.  Gangs like the GG's (your gang) are ticked at this, because these police are threatining to destroy their home, culture, and their basic life.  They can't let this happen!  That's where you come in.  You, your gang, and your rocket powered skates must stop Rokaku's (the bad dude's) evil plan.  But that's not all; no, there's a lot more.You must also compete with rival gangs out to claim your territory (through races and challenges), recruite new members to the GG's (up to 25), run from and defeat cops, and write your symbolic graffite (even create your own).  This is your world, and you must stop Rakaku, with many surprises along the way.This game has a lot more than just the one player story (though just that by itslef is an awsome game), but it also has one of the best multiplayers you'll find any where.  Compete against up to 4 players in either of 4 games (graffite, race, catch the ball, and others.).  You can play these games (my favorite is a 3 lap race) in up to 8 locations, trying to beat out your friends in a close race.The last thing I'll go into that makes this game so great (though I could go into dozens more) is the graphics.  It may not look like much on the cover, but the graphics in this game are simply put: INCREDIBLE.  Dozens of cars, obstaces (trash, boxes, billboards), and people that interact with you make this game so wonderful.  Huge worlds are clear from anywhere if you can see all the way across, creativity is fantastic.  The grinds are so much fun.  And last but not least; just when you think you've found everything in the game, you find another whole level that may lead to another.  Some places even have 5 or 6 stories (if you can grind all the way up their).So as I hope you can see, this is a must buy.  Immense worlds, interactive people, great graphics, and fun gameplay make this game a must buy.  You'll spend hours unlocking new characters, levels, and just exploring the ones you already have.  Look for this game anywhere, and if you see it (it's a best seller) buy it!  It's worth your money. Gotta go, I have to play some more JSRF!  Don't miss out on all the fun!  Get this game NOW!!!!!!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2002"}
{"product_name":"B000FPM3HS","reviewerName":"Michael J. Covino","summary":"Sad, but Beautiful","reviewText":"After the two major Survival Horror giants (Silent Hill and Resident Evil) have failed to meet my every expectation, a few obscure titles emerge to reassure that hope is not all lost. Rule of Rose is a refreshing reminder that there is indeed a shed of creativity left in the video game world.The poor, unlucky girl, Jennifer, is all alone. After her parents were killed she was sent by bus to an orphanage, but to her it was just a strange house overrun by cruel kids and a mean headmaster that blames her for the behaviors of the other children. The poor, unlucky girls' only crime was befriending a filthy stray dog whom she named Brown. This forbidden friendship is just the start of a story too cruel--too beautiful--to go untold.You do not play actual events in this game. You play instead the subconscious mind of Jennifer, who I believe is no longer residing at the orphanage, but lives there in her mind, for there was a promise she made to an old friend that she utterly failed to keep, and it is up to you, the player, to show Jennifer how to accept her childhood mistakes and perhaps urge her to move on with life.The environment in the game is a huge multistory airship, for that is the place where the orphanage children would visit when they would play make-believe games together. This was so real. I can remember when I was a kid going into my backyard pretending that I was a warrior running along steep canyon slopes or a soldier in the middle of a jungle war with dinosaurs. Within this make-believe world the orphanage children created The Red Crayon Aristocrat Society, and although the world was nonexistent, the rules they created for it were quite real.I cannot possibly say anymore without ruining everything, but what this game lacks in actual gameplay, it makes up for it wonderful story-telling. I agree with one reviewer that this plot is reminiscent of Lord of the Flies, where kids try governing themselves without any adult supervision, kicking both rationale and morale out the door since it's nothing but a burden to learn anyway. Remember? Those things were taught.This brings me to the controversy that revolved around this game. What they do to each other and to animals are monstrous, and all too believable.This is not a true Survival Horror game. There is very little fighting. You will be mostly dodging the monsters you encounter and you'll be spending the majority of your time searching for items and people that only your dog can sniff out. I can see why this annoyed some people and I myself found it tedious.The exploration of the airship is grand and it consumes just about every chapter in the game. There was this one strange chapter where you explore the home of Mr. Gregory, a man who lives not far from the orphanage, but that's it. You feel like you're playing this game just to see what will happen next, to be honest. The only other thing aside from the story that was great about this game was the music.Violins. They could not have picked a more suitable instrument for this sad, sad story. And it must be a great story if this many people were willing to plod their way through the game to experience it.Casual gamers, beware. Only dedicated fans of the genre can appreciate this little gem. I think I enjoyed Rule of Rose more than Silent Hill: Homecoming, which should demonstrate just how dire the need for something new to come along.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0002BJQDY","description":"Guild Warstakes the best elements of today's massively multiplayer online games and combines them with a new mission-based design that eliminates the tedium of those games. You can meet new friends in towns or outposts, form a party, and then go tackle a quest together. Your party always has its own unique copy of the quest map, so camping, kill-stealing, and long lines to complete quests are all things of the past. Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder.You don't have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don't have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you've previously unlocked. You'll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn't allow bad decisions to ruin a character. And you'll never meet new players only to discover that you can't play with them or compete against them because their characters are on a different server than yours; in Guild Wars, all characters live in one seamless world.Built for CompetitionAfter learning the game and building up your first character, you may choose to test your skills in head-to-head competition or guild warfare. The game is designed to reward player skill and teamwork, not time spent playing, so you won't need to spend hundreds of hours leveling up your character to compete.The game includes integrated support for guilds, with guild banners and halls, chat rooms and forums. Guilds can challenge other guilds to battle, compete for control of key parts of the world, and be ranked on a worldwide ladder.Unique Streaming TechnologyArenaNet's unique streaming technology forever eliminates the concept of patching a game. You don't have to wait a month for the next big patch to experience new content. Instead, the game constantly and intelligently streams new content to your computer in the background while you play. The world can change continually. This allows us to build a much more dynamic game world than any that has existed before.","reviewerName":"K.

The difference here is that this new model is quite a bit smaller than  its older brother, and quite a bit cuter, too.The system is made up of a 32-bit, 34-MHz RISC processor with 16 Mbits of main  memory, 8 Mbits of graphics memory, 24-channel stereo sound, double-speed CD-ROM  drive, and one Dual Shock analog controller. That's not a lot of power, compared  to a next-generation system like theSega  Dreamcast; but, when you factor in its very low price and the enormous  library of games that are available (more than 1,000 that are spread across  every genre imaginable), one can see easily why it's as good a deal as ever.

Even after all these years on market, it never gets old.Now, the X1 controller is, without a doubt, a new standard in the xbox's line-up of controllers.  I have bought this one from gamestop and it's in my home, ready to be played with the xbox one, so this review is a summary of using the controller from all of the events that I have attended (xbox one tours, microsoft store xbox one events, e3, gamescom, etc.) so I have had a fairly lengthy time using the controller.  The ergonomics are simply brilliant as the controller fits snugly in your hand and it is a bit smaller and tighter so all the buttons are more easily reachable.One of the best things about the new controller is the impulse triggers feature.  Oh, man.  These things are just great.  They said that they integrated a whole bunch of tiny rumble parts so that when you shoot a weapon, drive a car, run in a game, etc.- whatever you do in a game will match the action to the rumble feedback for more realism.  I tried this out with forza and man, this is a world of difference.  This feature alone would warrant this controller 5 stars, but the improved grip on the thumbsticks, the more fluid trigger-to-button layout, and the removal of the battery pack bulge on the back add even more value to this controller.Now, the last thing I have to mention.  The D-pad has been finally fixed.  It now rests in a depressed setting at the same location as the x360 controller, but now the D-pad is designed to work flawlessly with fighting games and other games that rely more on the D-pad.  I tried this out with killer instinct at one of the events and it worked wonders.  Huge, huge improvement over the xbox 360 D-pad (which was just awkward).Overall, the Xbox One controller is brilliant, already piling more improvements and features on top of an already awesome xbox 360 controller.The improved D-pad, innovative impulse-triggers feedback mechanism, insanely comfortable grip and ergonomics, and other tiny little things make the Xbox One controller a great new addition to the Xbox family of controllers.Oh, and that sweet looking Xbox logo at the top looks slick as ever.Hopefully, my impressions/review helped any of you guys and gals out.Peace and game on.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2013"}

Gameplay is broken down into missions,  each with objectives that must be unerringly completed before  progressing to the next mission. This is not your typical kill-anything-that-moves  game: putting a bullet in the wrong person, not keeping the  right one alive, or perforating a seemingly unimportant inanimate object  can often result in mission failure.WhilePerfect Dark's solo missions play out much like those inGoldenEye 007, the game's fantastic multiplayer options are  another matter entirely. Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy.

After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall.

Overall in the show, this game was one of my favorites. I love Id software, and hopefully, they will make Doom 3 an awesome game. So far, they are fully on track! In an early preview build, the game featured terrific sound, great gameplay that was similar to that of UT 2003, another awesome game, but most of all, the game had a mind-blowing graphical engine, which demonstrated unbelievable graphical power never before shown in a PC game. The game stepped away from the original two games in terms of style. Doom 3 will still be an FPS, but instead of side scrolling 2D gaming, it is an amazing shooter more along the lines of Unreal or Star trek Elite Force. In fact, the game played almost exactly like these two games mentioned here. Doom 3 is still very far away from being released, and there weren't too many details, but I think that we all could be in for a treat when 2004 rolls around!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2003"}

This is the best game I've played this generation.  It's gripping and consuming in a way that modern day games just aren't anymore.  It's a demanding game...you have to give yourself to it in order to be successful.  But if you do this, you'll be pulled into an adventure unlike one you've ever experienced.I have to briefly address the game's infamous reputation for difficulty.  Yes, it's a challenging game.  But it's not excruciatingly difficult.  Not even close.  All you have to do is be careful, take your time, and most of all, be patient.  If you are not patient, don't even consider buying Demon's Souls.  Patience and persistence is rewarded with feelings of accomplishment that you simply cannot get anywhere else in today's gaming environment.This is a gorgeous game.  Not gorgeous in the lush way a game like Uncharted is, but gorgeous in how much attention is paid to detail, mood and atmosphere.  The game's levels are masterpieces of ambience and feeling.  The level titled \"The Valley of Defilement\" will make you feel dirty and diseased, and the level titled \"The Shrine of Storms\" is bursting with the ominous sensation of a destructive storm on the horizon.  This game's genre is dark fantasy, and this is a dark (both literally and in mood) game.  In certain areas you sometimes won't even see your enemies until they are a few feet in front of you, and because every enemy in the game is capable of killing you easily if you aren't careful, it creates a strong tension that rarely lets go.  The detailed animations of enemy bodies getting tossed around and environments being destroyed are some of the finest I've ever seen.  In its own unique way, the game is beautiful.Demon's Souls boasts some of the finest controls I've ever played.  You have complete control over your character and controls are responsive, easy to learn, and challenging to master.  This is especially necessary if you are going to use a character that specializes in melee combat.  I would recommend taking this route the first time through the game, because as bold as this sounds, I truly believe it....Demon's Souls has the best melee combat I've ever encountered in a video game.  Squaring off against a tough enemy in the middle of a level has the same feeling as facing a boss in any other game.  You can't hack and slash through Demon's Souls.  It's just not possible.  The enemies are too smart and they will kill you instantly.  You must take every battle seriously.  If you get killed by an enemy, it's never the game's fault.  It's yours.  You are given every tool at your disposal to take down any enemy.  It's just up to you to do it.I can't review this game without mentioning the fantastic multiplayer function.  The multiplayer is there for one reason only...to enhance the single player experience.  It's innovative and brilliant.  In its many forms, the multiplayer element added SO much to my playthrough that I can't even verbalize its effect.  There are rumors that the Demon's Souls servers will be shutting down sometime in 2011.  I sincerely hope that this doesn't happen, but if it does, I highly recommend that everyone interested in playing this game does so logged into the PSN while the servers are still up.I really don't have anything bad to say about this game.  Apart from a couple camera issues in one of the levels, very occasional framerate issues and a targeting system that could use just a small tweak, the game is pretty much flawless on every level.  I can't remember the last time I could honestly say that about a game.Lastly, I realize that this isn't a game for everyone.  If you are anywhere near a casual gamer, don't buy this.  Buy this if you have the time and the will to dedicate yourself to it.  A lot people who play Demon's Souls give up before even beating the very first level (probably the most challenging part of the game, IMO).  But for those who make it through, you will be treated to a rich, challenging, satisfying and extremely addicting gem of a game that you will never forget.  This is one of those special games for the ages.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2010"}

Of course, had I read \"Arcade\", my disappointment would be a bit less, but still present.You see, in the late 80's, Capcom released on the NES one of the most fun games I remember playing, \"Bionic Commando\". And when I read the back of this collection, I thought that I would indeed be (re)playing one of my favorites, However, all of the games present here are the \"arcade\" classics (hence the name), and \"Bionic Commando\" in the arcade, well, was a really boring and really hard game. And well, that makes for a svcky experience.That being said, this collection has some nice games. I was pleased to see \"Legendary Wings\", just as hard as ever. \"1942\" and \"1943\" were always a couple of my favorites, and seeing \"Trojan\" again made me giddy with delight. Of course, there are disappointments as well. \"Street Fighter II\", which should be the cornerstone of the game, is horribly done. (Load times?!?! The PS2 can't handle \"SF2\"?!?!), and some of the games were pretty crappy even in their day (\"Exed Exes\" has to be one of the worst games ever - and that grating music only serves to make it worse!!).Another disappointment is the horrible layout of the game. The menu is basically written on a piece of notebook paper, and the bonuses for each game left me cold.Still, with the \"Ghosts and Goblins\" collection, and a pure port of \"Final Fight\" (it's the first time I remember seeing it), there is much to like here.

What to buy the choice is yours.","reviewText":"I wanted to write this review from the standpoint of comparing the PlayStation 3 to the Xbox 360. now I own both systems but I play the PS3 more (mostly because I'm a quadriplegic and I can't really use the Xbox 360 controller) if you want to see me playing with my face search AskACapper on YouTube.PROs of the xBox3601. Xbox live is just better: while the PlayStation network is free while the basic version anyway. And allow you to do things that Xbox live won't for free the Xbox live network is just better. Simply for the fact that you can send voice messages, you can follow people who are your friends into games (great for if you want to follow a booster in modern warfare 2 and keep on hunting). The only drawback is that it will cost you $40-$60 a year (depending on where you buy your card).2. Most of the game industry and big time YouTube commentators use Xbox 360: now this is a huge factor if you want to play with the big boys. If you follow Machinima respawn and have directors on there you want a game with most of the time they're playing on Xbox 360. This to me is a large reason to get the Xbox 360 over the PS3.3. It can be a media center for free: now this is not something that I know or have done but I do believe and please correct me if I'm wrong but the Xbox 360 can stream media from your Windows PC with no extra software required (whereas with the Mac you need to buy $20-$30 software).4.The Xbox 360 slim as built in WiFi: before this slim was for sale you need to spend $70-$90 to get WiFi for the Xbox 360 and that would have been a pro for the PS3 as it has always had WiFi built in. But now with the slim with its lower price and built in WiFi this becomes a pro of the Xbox 360.  PLUS the WiFi is the N standard were as the PS3 only comes with G.  N standard gives better speed and range.5. MODz: When it comes to modding I believe Xbox has done more options available and a much larger community. From just being able to modd your controller to full on system modification the Xbox is way easier to get into (now remember mobbing your Xbox could get you booted from Xbox live and a permanent ban hammer!)PROs Of the PlayStation 31. user upgradable hard drive: this to me is one of the biggest pros of the PS3 adding your own hard drive. So you can buy the 80 GB version or the 160 GB version and by a 500 GB plus our drive off the Internet for less than $100 and pop it in your PlayStation and you're good to go, so easy it should be illegal!2. Included Blu-ray player that you can upgrade the firmware on: When I got my PlayStation many of the blue Ray players on the market wouldn't allow you to flash the firmware so as they revised the Blu-Ray standard those players became obsolete. And my thinking is that if you spend $100 plus on a Blu-Ray player why not drop another $150 plus and get a full-fledged PlayStation that can be upgraded.3. Free PlayStation network: now it is true that the PlayStation network is free the basic network at least. Then they have the PlayStation plus network that cost 50+ a year. Now with the basic free networking of the PlayStation network unlike Xbox live you can't have a buddy list and play with your friends. I like the fact that I don't have to spend $50 a year to play with my buddies.4. It can be a media server with simple software you can buy online: I have a Mac and use media link software (Google media link) it cost 20 bucks and now I can stream/copy movies and music and pictures from my Mac to my PlayStation 3 it's very cool.5. Offers folding@home: now this is a huge selling point but I think it's cool! Folding@home is a distributed computing project by Stanford University that deals with protein folding and uses your PlayStation to help the scientists work on understanding how these work. So when you're not using your PlayStation for gaming you can turn on folding in the life with PlayStation application and you'll contribute to helping science! (My PS3 has contributed almost 2000 work units at six hours a pop it's been working hard)So these are my five bullet points of proz for both systems. My preference is PS3 but that's because I can hold the controller best and still play with my face. And my father and brother and many friends play PS3 and don't have an Xbox. Now if I could get a PS3 shaped Xbox controller I would spend more time playing Xbox so that I can play with the many YouTube commentators that I know and love.That is my 69 I hope you have enjoyed reading this if you haven't you must be illiterate. check out my YouTube videos and please support the \"custom button remapping petition\" that will help disabled gamers and non-disabled gamers alike.I am Chuck the Capper And I approve this message LOL!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2010"}

The hard-drive is built inside the actual Xbox this time instead of being an attachment like it was in the previous model. This version though comes with a built-in Wi-Fi and saves you the money of having to buy a Wi-Fi attachment to connect online.The controller has changed a little, but nothing significant enough to write about.This is a great buy for anybody looking to replace their old Xbox or somebody looking to finally make the dive into the Xbox world.

If you have not heard of this game, than you obviously live under a rock (deep under) All the video game critics and players alike have already named this &#34;2013`s Game of The Year&#34; and best game ever made, with very good reason, It is an A-List game and it is that damn good. The graphics is the best i have ever seen on the PS3, the level of detail is absolutely amazing (no attention to detail has been missed, not one. The characters expressions are so realistic you won`t believe it and the acting is so real and good (spoken words match the mouth movements perfectly) you can`t help but take whats being said as totally real and feel it just like in real life. I won`t giveaway any spoilers, just a brief rundown, the US has fallen into chaos because of a virus (a post-pandemic world, my great fear for the real world) and you can only do your best to survive by any means necessary (i do mean any). The story is based around a very weathered adult Joel and teenage Ellie. The relationship once they meet, grows over time and becomes like father and daughter (there is a very good reason why Joel grows to love and protect Ellie, she is no slouch at protecting herself) she reminds Joel of someone he once new) you don`t control Ellie, only Joel. The story plays out like a movie and trust me you can`t help but feel like you are starring in it (the immersion of the game is so real, you won`t want to stop playing, i cried, (yes, a big old man like me) cheered, got terribly angry, i laughed, scared like crazy (the virus mutated some humans into these things, i won`t say what they are, but scary as h_ ll and if not careful, you `ll die) sometime i don`t know who is scarier or who is worst the mutated things or other humans trying to survive. You must be willing to do things you would never do, unless you were in this situation, some are extremely brutal and heartless. The game is so real and good, you can`t help having multilevel emotions, but the one good and pure thing is the relationship between Joel and Ellie and it makes it all worth going thru and you will want to help them survive and see the ending of this extremely good and intense game or do i mean movie. I never really played too many action games (simulations and strategy are my true love) and the reason is, because i am not very good at playing them, however the developers (Naughty Dog) really put their life and blood into this game (OMG!!!) If you are not good at action games, just put the difficulty on easy and no it does not take anything from this game, just allows a novice to truly enjoy a wonderful and beautifully made A-List quality game, please trust me on this, please. Naughty Dog, has more than set the bar for any future video games by any developer/publisher in the future and Naughty Dog, has also proven that they are the premiere, top shelf, A-List game developer and publisher of 2013. They are the absolute best right now and i look forward hopefully to The Last of Us 2 on PS4, my fingers are crossed. I also look forward to any future games they may develop. You owe it to yourself to play this game. I do recommend this game, it is truly worth the money for your entertainment. Not for children. Thank You","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2013"}

Roman","summary":"A gaming icon returns in a big way.","reviewText":"Despite the games being huge when they first came out, I never played a full Tomb Raider game. I played a demo for TR2, and a demo for the first one that was on the Dreamcast, and that was it. The games never seemed that fun to me, and it felt like the only reason the games were as popular as they were was because of the main character's appearance. Something happened though when I saw footage from the 2013 reboot of the franchise. Everything I saw looked incredible. Lara Croft had a regular body type! The story sounded interesting! Gameplay looked fun and realistic! How was this a Tomb Raider game?? Last year I had a lot of other games that I was busy playing, and I ended the year by picking up TR for a stupidly low price. Very rarely do I stick to playing one game when I buy it. Usually I'll go off and finish up something in another game, be it trophies or trying to get an extra item or something. With Tomb Raider, I stuck with it from beginning to end. I don't just give out 5 star ratings for games, and I'm not anti-mainstream, but most of the major titles don't catch my interest. I'm very happy to say that Tomb Raider is a 5 star game, and one that I look forward to completing 100%.As usual, you play the role of Lara Croft, a young adventurer who gets shipwrecked on the island of Yamatai with several other people. This is no tropical paradise- the locales carry automatic guns and machetes, dangerous animals are on the prowl, and the terrain is just plain hazardous. The main plot focuses on an ancient Japanese queen, Himiko, who led the Yamatai empire and was able to control the weather with mysterious powers. One of the other survivors, Sam, happens to be a descendant of Himiko, and early in the game, she's taken away by a man named Matthias, who claimed to be a teacher that was also stranded on the island. Things go from bad to even worse when Lara begins to explore the island while looking for her friends, and discovers the truth about Himiko and what Matthias is after.From what I've heard, Tomb Raider plays out a lot like an Uncharted game. Unfortunately, I've never played any of those! But now I want to, given how incredible this game is. I haven't had this much fun playing a full fledged AAA title in a long time. Usually I don't have much time to play games during the work week, but this is one of those games that made me put aside a little extra time now and then just to keep going along. The story had my interest from the beginning, and I was curious to see what was going to happen next. Not only is the story good- the game is fun as heck. Lara only gets 4 main weapons- the bow, an assault rifle, a shotgun and a pistol, and each one is nice to have. As you progress, you'll find salvage parts to upgrade your weapons, although you'll also need to find specific weapon parts in boxes and on corpses to upgrade them to their full power. It's not very often that I run around the entire map looking for more parts to upgrade something, and yet that's exactly what I did with Tomb Raider because I -did- want to see everything that each weapon had to offer.Lara gains experience from killing enemies and animals, as well as finding treasures and documents scattered on the island and in hidden tombs. It's kinda funny that raiding tombs, the main point of the franchise, is optional here. It rewards you with a lot of experience though, and each one, while not difficult, gives you a break from the action with solving a quick puzzle. Killing an enemy with a headshot nets more experience, and you can really stack up the exp points by blowing up a red barrel when a group happens to be standing by it (this doesn't happen much, unlike most action games). Hunting animals starts out by being necessary to Lara's survival, as she needs food during a plot point. Once you kill your first deer, it becomes kind of addicting to chase after other animals and take them out. I liked that killing animals or enemies with the bow lets you pull your arrows out of the body to put them back in your inventory.  I also appreciated that the bow is a strong weapon, as it should be- too often in games, the bow is an underpowered weapon, when in fact, it's one of the best, strongest weapons ever made.It took me about an hour before I really got the hang of things, getting used to the mechanics of the game, like QTE sequences and realizing that I was controlling Lara during certain parts, like when she's sliding down waterfall. Tomb Raider caught me by surprise when I learned that you actually get to control what Lara does 99% of the time. I figured this out near the very end of the game, when I thought to myself, \"I'm surprised the game doesn't just do this part for you\".All of the animations, voice acting, music and visuals are outstanding. There were many times where I wished there was a way to view the world in first person mode, just to see details better. And you gotta love how Lara keeps her wounds as the game goes on. The poor girl gets messed up big time early on, and it just gets worse from there. When she sees her reflection for the first time, that's really when what she's been through sinks in.I can't say you'll like this game if you love the older Tomb Raiders. As I mentioned earlier, I've never played any of them, or any of the Uncharted games. Maybe that's part of why I loved TR so much- it was something genuinely now for me. I've always wanted to go on an adventure somewhere and explore the land freely. Maybe it's time for me to go back a little and try out the Uncharted games, and maybe even get the Tomb Raider Trilogy to see how those games fare. Now that the price has dropped on TR big time, you don't have any excuses to not play it. Had I bought this for the original retail price when it came out, I wouldn't have been disappointed. 5 stars all around- an instant classic.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2014"}

It's been four long years since we were treated to a proper RC game (A Crack In Time), and the wait has been nearly unbearable for Lombax fans and lovers of backpack robots. But rest assured, Into the Nexus is a blast to play, using everything that makes this series so wonderful: the humor, the storytelling, the art direction, the platforming, the wacky weapons, the groovy gadgets, and the super tight gameplay.The only thing that makes me sad about Into the Nexus is it's short length (but this is compensated by it being half price, of course). Also, this game has incredible replay value (like almost all RC games), in going back to maximize your weapon loadout, seeking skill points, and harvesting trophies. I would LOVE for Insomniac to make more RC games of this length, if it meant we were able to receive them on a more regular basis. How great would it be if we were treated to an annual Ratchet adventure every fall, just like in the days of PS2? Insomniac, if you're listening... please, please, more games like this!

Wii, like all the previous releases in theSuper Mario Bros.franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiis held sideways, allowing for easy, classic inputs using the D-pad to direct playable characters, the 1 button to jump and 2 button to spit out projectiles like snowballs and fireballs. In addition, players can access powerups with their choice of either the push of a button, or by shaking the Wii remote, again demonstrating the perfect merging of classic gameplay and modern game design which isNew Super Mario Bros.

The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"Hey look, it's the DS version with Yoshi and some new costumes.","reviewText":"I didn't think very highly of New Super Mario Bros for DS. It wasn't a bad game, but after years and years of waiting for a new classic platformer with the plumber that started it all, it sure as heck wasn't memorable. Levels weren't challenging, 'hidden' coins were always easily obtainable with platforms or ledges that looked like they didn't belong where they were, and the game just felt rushed. But many people didn't mind- they were too distracted with 'omg old skool mario!!!11' syndrome to notice that it had nothing on the NES classics, even the Doki Doki Panic sprite swap Super Mario Bros 2. What got me the most was that the power up items in New Super Mario Bros weren't very creative. You had a mini mushroom that made Mario tiny, and a rarely useful giant mushroom that'd let him smash his way through the level for a few seconds. 'hate to say it, but this Wii version isn't any better than the DS one.Once again, Princess Peach is kidnapped by Bowser and his kids, the Koopalings, during a birthday party. As they take her, some of the presents open up, revealing new power ups that Mario can use. As usual, it's up to Mario to rescue her. You'll run, jump, shoot fireballs and...oh heck, you should all know the drill by now. Even younger gamers who didn't get to grow up with the old Mario games get the gist. New Super Mario Bros Wii keeps the tradition going with similar level design to the stages in Mario 3 and even Super Mario World. Yoshi returns as well, and up to 4 people can play at the same time, though you're better off not doing that unless you're just up for mindless fun. While there are a few new items, enemies and obstacles, there isn't a whole lot that feels new in this game, and that's my first big problem. The transition from each big Mario game was huge. The first game introduced us to the world of Mario, the second game was a rip-off of a lesser known Japanese game but still vastly different, Mario 3 started the world map trend and even let you store power ups for later use, and Super Mario World just plain made everything bigger and better. Here, everything's very basic and feels like a step down from the sequels. The new level obstacles weren't challenging at all, time was plentiful in every single level, 1 ups were given out they're going out of style, and it feels like this was made for someone who never played a game before.Next, the new items. You have an ice flower, penguin suit and flying hat. The ice flower and penguin suit essentially have the same use- freezing enemies, who you can jump on for an extra boost, use as platforms when they float in water, or just pick up and throw at other enemies. But the penguin suit lets Mario slide super fast and swim better, similar to the frog suit from Mario 3. However, there aren't many times when the penguin suit is useful apart from freezing enemies. There aren't many water levels in the game and the slide attack isn't practical except in a select few stages where you have long platforms that make up most of the level. The flying hat is an ok idea, but pales in comparison to the raccoon leaf and super cape. To make Mario fly, you have to shake the Wii controller. Nope, you can't simply press a button- you have to shake. While Mario isn't restricted to flying just after running a short distance, you have to land before being able to fly again with the hat. Odd huh? What bothered me about flying in New Super Mario Bros is that where there were tons of bonus goodies in the sky in Mario 3 and Super Mario World, there's not much to explore in the skies here. Like I said, Yoshi's back, and I don't know why. He's only in a few stages, and doesn't bring anything to the game this time around. What's worse is that you can't keep him after beating a level- once you clear the stage with Yoshi, he's gone. Why???? My last main problem is the lack of challenge from the bosses. It's the same as it was in the old games: you jump on them 3 times, or shoot 'em with enough fireballs, and they're out. Only Baby Bowser and the last boss have a slight twist, but even then, I got them both on the first try since their attack patterns were so slow. How is it that Baby Bowser in Yoshi's Island still gives me a little trouble now and then?Multiplayer...ugh, the less said, the better. Many people abandon this after a few levels, and it's easy to see why. Players will constantly bump into eachother, knocking one another off ledges, into enemies or just to mess with them. It's fun to play this just to give your friends a hard time, but if you want to seriously beat levels with one or more people, that's probably where the only challenge in this game lies.The game's graphics are good for what they are- an upgrade from the DS version. Some of the character models like Bowser look really good, and I wish we'd get this quality (or better) more often on the Wii. I never experienced any slowdown either, even when a lot of things were going on on-screen. Unfortunately, the music isn't memorable, and they stuck with the DS tunes from what I could tell. Aside from the bland track that plays in the first stage, I can't remember any other tracks, not even the ghost house or castle stages, which you'd think would have some effort put into. It really bugged me that they didn't give the characters any real lines either, instead sticking with Mario's now standard grunts ('ha-hah!' and 'oomph!'). Come on Nintendo, step it up for god's sake! Either put in some real dialogue or don't have any.While all I do here is go off about how much I don't like the game, that's just coming from someone who grew up with the old Mario games as they came out over the years. For a younger gamer who hasn't gotten to play any of them, this will probably be a good, fun title, but I highly recommend the Mario All-Stars collection over this. It's cheaper and gives you far more replay. Wait until the price on this one finally drops before buying. If you want a good platformer on the Wii, go with Donkey Kong Country Returns.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2011"}

I have played the game for about a week trying my best to somehow like it or get to a point where it picks up but it just doesn't and bores the hell out of me. All we have is a never-ending grey, washed-out and utterly destroyed land-scape that begans to get depressing after a while. Plus the bunkers, interiors etc all look the same too and I dont know its just me but the enemies are repetitious too like I just killed a raider and within seconds I am attacked by another raider who just looked like a cut & paste version of the one that I just killed 10 seconds ago. The game combat system didn't impress me either. You have VATS which is matrix-equeish bullet-time pause version of the combat or you can slug it out like an ordinary fps. VATS though impressive in its visual effects and fun to use for the first few times but gets old real fast after using it for the 20th time or so plus the AP dependency and 50% damage reduction tapers down even the fun factor of it too. The real-time fps combat is neither fun nor much better either. Because of the terrian targeting enemies becomes a hassle and scarcity of the ammo in the game also goes polar opposite of the official gameplay videos which shows people firing weapons with almost limitless arsenal.Anyhoo me and bethesda dont seem to get along when it comes to games. The main-story is poorly developed and just doesn't grab you like some other rpg's do. Also the side quests are not fun either and just becomes a repetitious chore so you can become strong enough as imagine being asked to fight impossibly super-strong mutants at lvl 2 if you adhere to the main questline. I know some people love this game fo its open-endedness, however, the game should also equally accomdate players who rather want to follow the main story-line and shouldn't have to get side-tracked with exploration or side quests to succeed in this game. I had the same impression of Oblivion too but atleast that game had gorgeous scenery to look and admire at while this game doesnt even have that.Well money down the drain but hey atleast I wont be making the same mistake with purchasing Fallout:New Vegas","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2010"}

I purchased the 3DS the day it launched and, other than limiting time with the 3D functionality to prevent migraine's, have been exceptionally satisfied with it. As an \"older\" gamer with middle age eyes anything that I can get which makes it easier to read the screens and see is all to the better far as I am concerned. So this model really satisfies.While the 3DS and the 3DS XL have some differences I'm writing this review as someone who really enjoyed the DsiXL model - and that will be my focus.To get the 3DS vs. 3DSXL comparison out of the way first -- the larger model has better battery life, way larger screens, and a more pleasing feel. It is easier to hold, in spite of its weight, and fits easier in the hand. The sweet spot for 3D is easier to figure out and larger due to the size upgrade. It loads quicker which was a nice surprise. I also enjoy the buttons for home, start, and select being actual true buttons vs. a plastic casing - in the back of my mind I worried at the longevity of the plastic component on that piece. The capability to tilt the screen in 3 positions is also nice. I don't have an opinion on the lack of two circle pad buttons - I play mostly RPG and puzzle and these don't factor heavily into my type of gaming. The buttons themselves seem the same as the 3DS as does the D pad. The shifitng of the lights away from the top screen is very welcomed - although I have the ability to focus and tune out it is nice when I can concentrate efforts elsewhere. Much like the upgrade from Dsi to DsiXL I feel this one is worth it - but not everyone needs all the new features. I was able to pass my 3DS to my daughter who was more than happy to take it.Now in terms of the 3DSXL and the DsiXL - the upgrade is positively worth it especially *if you want to play 3DS games*. IMHO if you only want to play regular DS games and will not use the 3D part at all - then the bottom screen is not going to give you anything more than you already have. There are other factors like the feel of the unit and the circle pad, the Street Pass options, etc that might sway you. But for strictly game playing where there is no 3D and you are primarily using bottom screen I don't know that I'd recommend the 3DS expressly.When I got my 3DS I did not get rid of my DsiXL - I still held onto it because of its larger footprint and screens - preferring that for at home play most of the time. There were a couple of things I hoped they'd improve with the 3DSXL over the DsiXL but, on at least one count, that upgrade didn't happen. As most know the DsiXL had some issues with pixelation and graphics including blurry areas and stretching that, while not remotely unplayable, certainly affected the user experience on that platform. I've just run the 3DSXL through several games and this has not changed with the new model. Here it is really the bottom screen that we are looking at - and there is nearly no difference to me between the two far as I can tell. In fact, in the case ofAnimal Crossing: Wild WorldandThe World Ends With Youthe graphics look slightly worse on the 3DSXL than they do on the DsiXL. It is neither glaring nor immediately obvious and not huge - but there is no improvement in that area. Now the upper screen is a whole different story - the graphics up top are phenomenal and beautiful and markedly improved over the DsiXL. I find the sound better on the new 3DSXL over the DsiXL slightly - the bass levels through headphones are richer giving a more immersive experience. The big area for me where I noticed a lot of improvement is in the feel of the unit while being held. It is much more comfortable than the DsiXL. My hands fit around it better and the curves are smoother leaving me happier for longer playing periods. It also seems lighter and perhaps balanced differently - not sure but I like it.While this may not apply to all I was able to transfer my 3DS data over in about 20 minutes. I spent a lot of time collecting StreetPass stuff so this was critical to me. Nintendo made this super easy - and I am thankful! So if you are worried about losing data you can transfer it all over and it works wonderfully!As for other features like larger SD card and the regular stylus I'm good with that - neither of those is make it break it for me. I am not sure yet how the circle pad is going to affect my play - I did not use it too much with my 3DS - preferring the control of the D pad over the circle functionality - but again that may be based on what type of games I enjoy. Overall I am happy with the unit - but I tend to be a fairly early adapter of handheld gaming technology. I think the benefits of the 3DSXL over the 3DS are actually pretty compelling and marked. Similarily the 3DSXL over the DsiXL - with the bottom screen caveat - is also an improvement. Game on!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2012"}

I started to get the hang of it I guess. Anyways, the games hard, plan to die a lot, if your like me and your not good at doing puzzles fast.  That said its still fun to figure it out, and if it still to hard there's always YouTube.  That said the game worth it if your looking for something new and different.  can't say I've played any games like this, especially a story like it.  It's mature and actually dealing with issues that people of the 20+ range go through.But the story bits are long sometimes, which i kind of liked, its like metal gear solid, but sometimes you just want to solve puzzles.  On the second play through this was more of a problem.I must say this game has the best online experience I've ever had.  In the game you answer question, when you answer a question, your answer is compared to other players.  that and a leader boards that's it.  I personally don't like multiplayer games getting killed by 10 year olds in call of duty makes me sad.But there is a 2 player option, you can play challenge modes, against or with a friend.  It's not online, the friend must actually be in the room with you, but this for me was great.My only issue with the game really is your are constantly making choices but they never really effect the story outside of the actual end, so sometimes, though your saying no to one girl the game still says yes until that last ten minutes of the game when it suddenly say 'no, no, no.\" to the girl you been trying to dump from the start.Anyways, I'll end this review here, the games great, replay value in puzzle solving is high.  And if you like leader board stuff you got your hands full this games been in japan for a while now and I'm about 10 minutes behind the worst players on the board that go up to 1000.  The story has a so so replay value, like metal gear, it interesting when your looking for it, i think it depends on how often you play it.  It is really well done.PS sorry if there are any grammar, or weird word order stuff writing this when very tired, but can't sleep.  kind of ironic really.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2011"}

The graphics rock, the music is good, the characters are all very unique and memorable, especially Auron (one of the coolest of all time).Plus the gameplay is one of the funnest in the Final Fantasy series.The fact that you can actually 'control' the summoned monsters was awesome beyond belief. Seeing Anima attack for 50k damage on a regular attack is something to see...However, in my opinion, there are a few things which knocked a star off this games rating.First off theres Wakka and Kimahri. Kimahri spoke very little almost to a point of being a mute. Add in the fact that his character is a 'jack of all trades' and 'master of none' and you will find yourself using him very rarely. He is pretty much filler gameplay wise and story wise.Then theres Wakka... oh boy where to start.His voice acting sounds ridiculous as a Jamaican surfer or something. Not to mention that he is possibly the strongest character in the game and his weapon is a VOLLEYBALL.I found myself keeping him in the back ranks against everything except flying enemies (which he specializes against).Now quite possibly the worst part of the game... the sidequests.The sidequests dont even start until youre about 95% through the game and finally acquire the airship. Than the torture begins.Just thinking about the final chocobo race, the butterfly catching, and dodging 200 lightning bolts makes me cringe. And catching 10 of every monster in the game for the battle arena? Ouch!Though it kind of evens out because the items you get through these terribly difficult and frustrating mini games are very powerful.All in all this game is a truly awesome experience. It took me about 55 hours to beat the game with about 80% of the sidequests finished. And every minute was a joy... except for some of those sidequests.But to put it simply, if own a PS2 and enjoy role playing games than you cannot be without this game. Its easily one of the classics for both the Playstation and the Final Fantasy series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2006"}

Anyway, I ended up with a PS2 and decided to get my own copy and start over. The graphics were 5 star as was the storyline. The design was poor. It was over balanced in so far as the number of battles. You could barely move without getting into another tussle. You start to walk up and talk to someone or get ready to open a chest and another battle. After about 49 Hrs. of this, I finally gave it up and took the thing to the used game store. My nephew, who lives to do battle, said it was way too much for him and it slowed down to a crawl. I ended up with 48:50 in the game and I was in the main corridor of the Al Bhed place. I couldn't move forward because of one battle after another. By this time the game had quit being fun and enjoyable. That was almost 49 Hrs. invested for nothing (it went to the used game store). Again, had they balanced out the game between moving the story along and the occasional battle/boss battle, it would have been enjoyable. Bottom line is that this game is heavily loaded with constant battles with hardly any down time in between. Great Concept, poor execution. Charlie S.

This game does just about everything right, improving on the previous games and keeping the parts that make the game so incredibly enjoyable.First, the storyline. This isn't just a hack-and-slash game - you really do start to get to know the various characters, each with their own personalities and personality quirks. None of the characters are perfect - Tidus is a little petulant, Wakka a bit closeminded. But as time goes on, they learn, grow, get from a disparate bunch of individuals to a really well integrated group.The addition of voice dialogue is rather neat, although it does get a little strange in some scenes. In general it does add to the sense that this is a live movie - especially during the GORGEOUS cut-scenes. As an anime fan, this is the sort of stuff I used to go to art movie houses to watch!Where in the last game (FFIX) they required you to play card games to move through the game, this time the game of choice isn't required. Blitzball is like water soccer, and the scenes of it are truly amazing. You can play if you want to get one of the characters better weapons, but if it's not your style, you can ignore it as well. The choice is yours!The world is really well put together, with the various culture and their art styles and architectures. It's great fun moving from deserts to mountains to water worlds. The game moves smoothly, letting you learn as you go. It's pretty unidirectional so you don't get wildly lost while you're learning. Near the end, you gain the ability to go whereever you want, and explore at your leisure.You easily stay entertained for weeks and weeks (if not for months) because there are so many side quests and mini-games that you can play right before the final battle. Just put off the end battle as long as you want, building up your characters and the world in which they live. Then, when you're ready, blast the enemy and relish the ending!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00006GSO0","description":"The Simshas much in common withTony Hawk's Pro Skater: There's a great emphasis trial and error, it encourages personalized solutions to problems, and overall success comes down to both balance and timing. Also, like the Tony Hawk games,The Simsis a very addictive game.Players micromanage the lives of a family of virtual people and influence the outcome of their lives, be it success or something akin to a nervous breakdown. The bestselling PC version of the game has, in recent years, been upgraded with elements like parties, pets, and vacations, but this iteration is closer to the basic formula.You start the game living with Mom in a one-story suburban house. You are immediately presented with certain life tasks, such as fixing the TV and making lunch, which are aligned with the skills you'll need for the game's main challenge--keeping your sims in balance on eight conflicting categories. For example, eating will have an impact on your sim's hunger rating, but it will also impact his bladder rating. You'll have to make sure that he keeps himself and the house clean, that he sleeps to restore his energy, and that he also has time to keep himself entertained. The free will option lets your sims coast a bit, and you can also save time by stacking tasks together. Time passes at the rate of about one minute per second in the game, but you can fast-forward sim time when you need to, such as when they're sleeping.The controls are justifiably complex, but adjusting to them is not difficult. You see your sims from an overhead perspective that you can both rotate and zoom. You direct their actions by moving a line cursor to where you want them to go or to what object or person with which you want them to interact.The game is surprisingly funny. Neglect your sims and they'll shout and wave their arms to get your attention. Allow one's energy to get too low and he or she will likely collapse and sleep right where they were standing. When that happens, Mom is likely to serve them dinner on the floor.Gamers may find that it takes a while to get the hang ofThe Sims' style and control scheme. Stick with it and you may find real time fast-forwarding by.--Porter B.

He lives with his mother, has little money and no skills. He is neat; his mother is a slob. She leaves garbage on the floor. The television is smoking and she incessantly demands that he learn to fix it. Of course, just walking up to the television and tinkering with it is conducive to session of electric shock therapy. Paul will need to skill up, earn points by studying cooking and mechanics.Then he will have to find a job in order to make himself self-sufficient enough to move out of the house.The Sims does deviate from the PC version of the game in several areas. For starters, the game begins  after creating your Sim  with a dream sequence where your character receives a romantic kiss and a naked foray into a hot tube. Don't worry, parents, in typical Sims fashion, even though your Sim is naked, you don't see anything. But it is in the middle of this dream sequence that your Sim receives a rude awakening. The mansion sequence is a portend of what could happen if your Sim is successful in life.When you are in the learning phase of the game, your \"mom\" will jabber in Sim talk, but a pop-up screen will also give you clues as to what you need to be doing. Don't study cooking and your first effort on the stove may result in a fire. You must accomplish certain tasks in order to prove that you are ready to move out of your mother's house and try to make it on your own.Bonus items will also be made available as you accomplish tasks. Fixing the television will unlock a vanity mirror, which as any PC Sims player knows, is used to practice speech and increase charm.The game also features the building modes and the same interface features  buying, speeding up time, as well as the range of personal indicators to measure hygiene, fun, and energy among others  that the PC version has.Another one of the newer features in the game is the multiplayer mode. You can go head-to-head in a competition, and if successful, you can unlock the \"Play The Sims\" mode, in which two players can have created Sims share a home.The control elements of this game were wonderfully ported from the PC to the PS2. PC gamers may take a few moments to get acquainted with where everything is, but once the concepts are in place, it could almost be said that this platform  while lacking the various expansions of The Sims PC series  is easier to play (certainly easier to save) than it's older cousin.Because there is no mouse to move and issue commands to your Sim, a beam of light and circle, falling from the heavens, is used to initiate commands.Graphically the game is color and almost identical to the PC version. The playing area may be a little more finite, but the environmental elements are very well done, and the world is quite colorful.The game's sound is almost incidental to the play. The Sims jabber in their own peculiar language and the music is almost akin to the tunes heard in an elevator.The Sims, for the PS2, serves and an introduction on the PlayStation 2 to the concepts of the PC game franchise while dropping in some new ideas to give the program some fresh aspects. This is a game in which you micromanage a created character in a cyber realm that, to some extent, mirrors the real world. It takes time to play and develop a character, and those who have never played The Sims may find their opinions of the program defaulting to one of two settings  either you will really like the game, or you won't like it at all.Sims addicts can take comfort in the fact that now your PC hard drive does not have to be eaten alive with saved games.This game is rated Teen for comic mischief, mature sexual themes and mild violence.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2003"}

I was obsessed with trying to beat all the levels, find all the bonus barrels, and beat all the lost world levels...and donkey kong country 3 is no exception.  Its hard to pick a favorite of the 3, but i think it would be this one.  You play as dixie kong and the very strong toddler kiddie kong, bc donkey and diddy have been kidnapped.  You start out swimming around a lake to find wrinklys save spot and the general store which you can buy special items from.  Also theres funky's place and now he has a motor boat for you, and as you find special items he can make you better forms of transportation, including a hovercraft and a jet ski.  Unlike the other games... you can now travel in a non linear pattern for the most part..sometimes you can choose which world you would like to complete first.  The levels are fun and challenging, and each one has 2 bonus levels and a hero coin to collect...which consists of a croc with armor and a shield which is the hero coin and you are given a barrel and have to find a way to make him guard the other way so you can throw the barrel and knock him out, thus collecting the hero coin, this is sometimes hard to do which adds to the fun.  There are bear coins to collect throughout the level, and sometimes you have to search all over the level as they may be well hidden.  You can spend the bear coins at the general store or and the mini game spot called swankys sideshow.  I remember this was the most fun part for me when i was a kid bc its like visiting a carnival and you play a little game where you have to throw balls at croc targets and you play against cranky.

{"product_name":"B000R1A0L6","description":"Godzilla Unleashed - Everyone's favorite monster returns in a completely redesigned and updated massively destructive brawler! Play Godzilla as never before with non-linear story paths and all new Toho monsters.","reviewerName":"Sibelius","summary":"Controls are in need of fine-tuning","reviewText":"Atari's release of 'Godzilla Unleashed,' for the Nintendo Wii is a title that would've been better served had it been held back for release an additional month in order to fine-tune and smooth out the controls.  At its core, this title is basically a fighting/wrestling action game - which is why the non-intuitive and oftentimes unresponsive Wii controls are unacceptable for this style of gameplay.  Thankfully, the game does start off with a much needed tutorial to guide players along in the somewhat complex control scheme but alas most will find themselves resorting to the good ol' button-mash method of gameplay to progress through the 20 or so levels.  Other disappointments include a very poor camera, vague level objectives as well as tired and uninspiring graphics throughout.  All is not lost though, the storyline actually held my interest to finish the single player campaign all the way through.  While the story itself is extremely cheesy with bad voice acting I suppose such a tone fits in very well as a homage to a series beloved for its kitsch factor.  All in all you're either gonna find this game acceptable or not.  Perhaps a rental beforehand would be most prudent.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2008"}
