And that's not necessarily a bad thing.  I was hoping it was something as new and fresh as Red Dead Redemption--which I think was a superior effort to this.  But that's a different game.The draw here is the story, the fact that you play a good guy, the new facial tech, crime scene investigations, and interrogations.  That's the rub, and why you'd buy this game instead of GTA IV.  I have to say, for these reasons, I enjoy this more than I did GTA IV--which I didn't even finish.But make no mistake, the \"other parts\" of this game--driving, fighting, shooting, and running--all feel just like GTA IV.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, it just is what it is.After just having finished Dead Space 2, this also stuck out with it's \"old school\" loading screens.  Every little scene and cut scene has them--even when you're reporting that you just shot a guy on a side \"street crime\" mission.  It's a minor thing, but I noticed it, so noted.  Probably unfair to compare to Dead Space 2--one of the slickest implementations to date.Also, I'm a terrible detective.

Warrior Within may not be as good, but is still a great game.If I could, I would give this game a 4.75 stars. It is a great sequel to an incredible game. I would say this game is better, but the story is not as good as the first one. It is still good, but it takes longer for the story to develop.The graphics in Warrior Within are breath taking. Really, they are so much better then Sands of Time its incredible. The Cut scenes are some of the best to appear in video games. The facial animation in game still sucks but is better then the first.The sound is easily the low point. Some of the one-liners are bad and very few will like the heavy rock during the game, although I actually liked it.One of my main problems with the sands of time was the combat. Needless to say, it is MUCH better is WW. This is the only sword fighting game where you can actually dual weild. You can perform combos with the enviroments help. It is just so much better and is actually fun this time around.Overall, if you liked the Sands of Time, you will like Warrior Within.Concept- Bring back the Prince, but make him more mature and pissed off.Presintation- 9.0- The box art is awesom and the menues are good as well.Graphics- 9.4- So much better then the first, though facial animation is still bad in game.Sound- 7.5- Easily the low point of the game. Some one liners suck and few like the rock music. (as I sad before) Though the battle sounds are good.Playability- 9.3- Still has the wonky camera, but combat is easier.Entertainment- 9.4- Great sequel, though not Game of the Year material like the first.Replay value- 8.5- You will want to go through the story again and there are xbox live features that extend the life of this title.(Xbox live features are NOT multiplayer features)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000B5MV6A","description":"The GBA SP is as small as a PDA and more portable than the original GBA.   Take your portable gaming to the next dimension with this futuristic new game system!    Color -  Pearl Blue","reviewerName":"Jason the rational Sony fan \"Dark Overlord of...","summary":"It's fantastic! A must for retro gamers...","reviewText":"This is one of my favorite Nintendo handheld systems. I own multiple handheld systems including all three variations of the Gameboy Advance and I feel that I can offer a balanced perspective of the SP system's strengths and weaknesses.First of all, I am reviewing the Pearl Blue SP (model #101). While the model #001 SP systems are also great, the 101 systems are the best ones to own because they have the nice backlit screens. As far as I know, the 101 model only came in 3 colors, Pearl Blue, Metallic Pink and Graphite. If you're going to buy a Gameboy Advance SP, make sure it is a model #101. It may cost a few extra dollars but they are well worth it compared to the original models.The screen is nice and bright. It's not quite as sharp as the Gameboy Micro's screen but there is nothing to worry about. I have no problems reading game text and the graphics look wonderful on the SP. Handhelds usually do not have great speakers and that is the case here. You can easily hear voices and music so it's not bad by any means but it just isn't as good as listening through your ear phones. Unfortunately, this system does not have a headphone jack but I believe there are some third party headphone adapters out there. Let me be clear, the SP doesn't sound bad at all... it merely sounds okay.There is only one other gripe I have with this system. The shoulder buttons are significantly smaller than they are on the original GBA or the GBA Micro. That may or may not be a deal breaker for you but I have big hands and like the comfort of the Micro's larger shoulder buttons.However, the SP 101 systems have a very important feature that is lacking in the Micro line. They can play the original Gameboy games as well as the Gameboy Color library and of course, the Gameboy Advance titles - all on a beautiful, backlit screen! You can get Gameboy and Gameboy Color games for around a dollar each if you're savvy so you can build up a decent game collection in no time. This is truly the best system for retro gamers who want to play Nintendo's handheld titles.I'd give the SP a five star rating except for the slightly lower quality screen (compared to the Micro), the lack of a headphone jack and the small shoulder buttons. It's a great system. I just happen to like the Micro better for GBA games but the SP rules for the older titles.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00005BJ9G","description":"Konami's Simon Belmont started hunting vampires back in 1987, and he hasn't quit yet. Now he's chasing them across the Game Boy Advance inCastlevania: Circle of the Moon. He'll use his trusty whip, as well as a few magical items, to combat Dracula and more than just a few foul minions. The game takes advantage of the GBA's rich color palette to create detailed, moody environments and intricate spell effects.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Castlevania: Circle of the Moon","reviewText":"How do you spend a good time with your GBA?  By picking up Konami's \"Castlevania: Circle of the Moon\".  This is by far the best GBA game you can buy and with good reason.  The launch title for the GBA is ranked among one of the best sellers on the GBA.It isn't hard to see why this is a loved game.  From the moment you pop this into your GBA you'll be swept off your feet by its AMAZING sound and incredible gameplay that goes unmatched by any other game out there!The game begins when three vampire hunters corner Dracula.  A master, his son and an apprentice.  The master becomes imprisoned by Dracula and drops The son and apprentice into the depths of the castle below.  Now, playing as the apprentice, Nathan Graves, you must explore the castle and find a way to get inside Dracula's chamber and stop the rite from happening!Most noticeable about Castlevania: Circle of the Moon is its music.  Anyone who's played this game can tell you that Circle of the Moon sounds INCREDIBLE!  There is no GBA game that sounds this good out there.  Some of the music is actually Orchastral and for the GBA that's amazing.The second most noticeable thing about Circle of the Moon is the gameplay.  Circle of the Moon incorporates an RPG style like gameplay.  You run around with a whip that you use to attack enemies.  For each enemy you kill you get experience points.  When you get enough you level up and your HP and MP increases.But the gold of Castlevania: Circle of the Moon is in the DSS (Duel Set-up System).  This is perhaps the most innovative game idea presented in a title like this.  There are twenty DSS cards in the game.  Those for elements, and those for attributes.  Finding all twenty isn't an easy task since the enemies drop them at random.  But incorporating this system into the game is what makes it fun.  You select one element and one attribute and see what happens.  The DSS presents about 100 combinations and some are very worthwhile to see.The other part of the gameplay that presents itself well is the exploration.  The castle you explore is huge and well constructed.  As you defeat more bosses and acquire more abilities you can explore even more of the castle.  Much like the Metroid games, you'll know when you can proceed and when you can't.  If you come to an area you can't get to its obviously because you do not have the correct ability.Castlevania doesn't have bad graphics.  For a GBA launch title the overall presentation is good but unless you have a GBA SP its a little dark.  On a normal GBA it was so dark sometimes that I'd take damage and didn't know what was hitting me.  The animation is also on the shorthand side.  But that shouldn't suggest that Circle of the Moon doesn't present itself rather well.The game is also a good challenge.  It is not an easy game to get through, and newcomers to the series will have some trouble.  But a good challenge is a good thing.  The game is not too easy but it really isn't all that hard either.  The meat of the challenge comes from the bosses and in any game that's where the challenge should come from.Perhaps the best part about Castlevania Circle of the Moon is the replay value.  Most games lack this but Circle of the Moon makes it worthwhile by providing new modes.  Each time you complete the game you unlock new modes.  Magician Mode, Fighter Mode and Thief Mode. Each mode has its own strenghs and weaknesses.  For example, in Magician Mode you start off with all the cards and a massive amount of MP but your attack, defense and HP are severely limited.  In Fighter Mode you have incredible attack, defense and HP but you don't get any DSS cards.  In thief mode you have incredible luck!  This makes playing through the game a second, third or fourth time a completely different experience than before.Castlevania: Circle of the Moon is perhaps the best GBA game out there.  With superb sound and gameplay, this is easily a treat for any gamer and Castlevania fan.  It stacks up perfectly to Symphony of the Night and more over, should be the Castlevania that all future titles on the GBA should be compared to.  An awesome effort by Konami.The Good+Great gameplay+DSS System is the best+Good challenge+Visually striking+INCREDIBLE SOUNDTRACK. Among the best the GBA has to offer+Of good lentgh+Lots of exploration to do+Good storyline+Lots of replayThe Bad-The graphics are dark on a normal GBAThat's actually the only con that sticks out.  Enjoy, as this is as good as GBA games get.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2004"}

{"product_name":"B000O5FUKQ","description":"Prepare to experience an evolution in the first person shooter. Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"Joseph Izzo","summary":"Hard not to throw the controller across the room!","reviewText":"Turok sucks! Period. The save points are horrendous. The graphics are not up to par for next gen. The enemies are faster than oyu and never miss when they shoot at you. When you get hit, the screen goes blurry and by the time you get your bearings, you're dead. The weapons are outright lame. It takes so many shots to take down enemy soldiers. If you like FPSers like COD4, Resistance, and Bad Company, you will hate this game. Everythin g that makes those games great is utterly absent from Turok. What a waste.

The character Mario was originally in Nintendo's Donkey Kong who later got a name as he appeared with his brother in 1983's \"Mario Brothers\".In 1985 when Nintendo was launched to the USA and around the world, Mario became a superstar and a new game classic series was born! In this game you get to play Mario or Luigi in 2-player or one player mode. Your goal is to be in 8 levels that are challenging yet fun as you have to battle various Mushroom-like evil critters called Goompas to all the way to killer turtles called Koopas to rescue Princess Peach (a.k.a. Toadstool) from the evil dragon Boswer.In each level you get to discover many things like hidden coin blocks to even stairways to the clouds to get coins to get one-ups. This was an unconventional kind of game back in 1985 as it became the biggest platformer game of that decade and broke new ground. You can jump on enemies to squash them (Well except Spikey creatures or Pirahna Plants). It's a big change from either Donkey Kong or Mario Brothers as Super Mario Brothers became a beloved classic for years to come.I remembered when i got my Nintendo in 1989 on my 7th birthday i was excited that it had this and got it's follow-up Super Mario Brothers 2 as well. They made me happy and satisifed i became a gamer after playing my brother's Atari, the graphics are simple pixilated but still hold up well and still worth replaying even in today's standards compared to Mario titles of now.Play it man and see where it all started on the franchise.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000NJH6YG","reviewerName":"Nightshift worshiper","summary":"It's all about the gameplay~","reviewText":"Do not listen to the reviews that are saying this is a bad game! I have played Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Divinity 2, Fallout: new vegas, Two worlds 2, and Risen, and this game is right up there with all of them! Personally: I think this game is better then Oblivion, or Skyrim. No...it hasn't got the kind of flashy, smooth graphics like Skyrim has, but I will tell you what it does have that Skyrim doesn't: Two worlds is actually fun, without being repetitive. An example: I played Skyrim for a long time; I had maxed out my levels, had all enchanted dragon bone armor, a house with an almost endless supply of alchemic agents, and all that was completely useless to beat the game! Why does everyone think Skyrim is so fun? All you do over and over again is kill crypt zombies and rusty robots pretty much. Let's go spend 2 hours in another catacomb or Dwarven ruin(sarcasm). It's so repetitive and BORING!The graphics in Two worlds might not be near Skyrim's, but this game has alot more to offer in the variety of different creatures to encounter, and yes...there is dragons. Different types of dragons. There is also Ogres, Hell knights, Hell lords, Hell warriors, Stone dragons, Flesh golems, Wyverns, Zombies, ghouls, Skelitons(different types), Bandits, goblins, and many other creatures to encounter. Some of them are really hard to kill, and take awhile also, so you will actually have to think up some kind of strategy to take these badboys on, being that alot of them can kill you with one ferocious claw. Different locations sport different creatures, and definitely don't go walking into a graveyard without some health potions! The weapon's are very cool, and I often would find a powerful weapon, and be counting the levels until I could use it. Covering land is alot more hard to do than Skyrim, because there is way more things trying to kill you, way more often. You really never know what you're going to encounter next, a pack of wolves, a pack of reapers(raptor looking creatures), or a whole encampment of steel golems(seriously).I thought I would play the game until I couldn't level up anymore, but that never happened. I don't know when the levels stop, but it doesn't stop at 200. The map is huge and takes quite awhile to traverse one end to the other, and before you can level up an individual skill...you have to find Someone to teach it to you which can be rather difficult in this huge world. The graphics are not that bad if you don't compare it to Skyrim. The magic is also more original than Skyrim. Magic shields, fire from the sky, fire walls, Poison hands that reach up from the ground and hold the enemy there whilst draining their life, Summoning giant demons. Don't judge this game until your at least 10 hours in, then I dare you to try not to like it. You won't be able to.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2013"}

The way the podcasts and previews talked about it, it sounded like it was gonna be a good action strong title. Couldn't be further from the truth. I played about 6 hours in to this game and just got to that point where I couldn't wait for it to be over, then realized, why play it if I'm not having fun?  First off, the so called upgrades and unlocks are extremely underwhelming. Nothing special, nothing we haven't seen a thousand times done in the exact same way. Really dated feel to em.  The entire game is done with the same 3 or so fighting animations and never gets any more exciting.  The camera jiggles around when moving and the amount of invisible walls in this game is outrageous.  You'll constantly find areas that you want to explore but can't because there's an invisible wall in your way.  You can't even shoot through them.  I played mostly with the arrow happy girl because playing with the guy was even more boring.  There's even more things I could describe that makes this the most boring game I've played in years but frankly, I'm getting bored just thinking about it.

Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular.

Raillard","summary":"Best Star Wars Game","reviewText":"It actually took me a while to warm up to this game.  Not being an RPG nut, I didn't like the combat model at first, wanting a more hack 'n slash style.  It did grow on me, however, as did the game as a whole.  It is in many ways better than the last couple movies!Strengths: Awesome story; the acting is better than Episode I and II by far; some really cool looking worlds; deep combat model (does take some getting used to); characters feel varied and different.  The main characters have more depth than Anakin and Padme!  The light/dark paths are a cool idea, and the various solutions to problems a welcome twist.  Also good animations and sound.Weaknesses: Too linear.  I was spoiled by Morrowind's immense size and sense of &quot;go anywhere&quot; freedom.  The worlds of KOTOR aren't as big, and there's no fun/point in just exploring like in Morrowind.  Pretty much all NPC's point you towards the main quest.  Also, I didn't feel that the light/dark affiliation made THAT much of a difference.  It stinks that you can't keep playing when you beat the game, because only at the end are you really able to see any improvement/change, and then the game ends.  The graphics are good, but the face models are weak and repetitive.  Also, the game may scare off rookies with its complex D&amp;D rules (+3 modifiers, saving rolls, etc), although it's possible to just ignore them.  Also, there are too many similar weapons; the 895 different kinds of blasters don't really seem to make much of a difference in actual combat.Overall, this is an addictive game; I wish there was more to do than the main quest (there are a few dozen side quests, but once you leave a world you may not be able to come back), because I wanted to keep fine-tuning my character.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2003"}

Formerly praised Jedi masters, Revan and Malak were heroes of the Mandalorian wars, but came across a dark force power called the Star Forge that could have devastating consequences on the Republic. The Republic takes one final attempt to defeat Darth Revan and Malak. Revan's ship is boarded by Jedi and Malak attempts to take control by destroying the ship and becoming the new Sith Lord. Your party tries to chase down Malak and learn the location of the Star Forge through various locations including Telos, Dantooine, Tatooine, Manaan, Kashyyyk, Korriban, space ships, etc.Gameplay: RPG type game. You start out not knowing who you are. You are on a ship being attacked and you must escape.  You can choose your character class in the beginning and it helps decide what you can do better than others, like hack computers, securities, droids, handle blasters, blades or later on- a light saber. You train in the force while chasing down a Sith Lord, though you do not learn the force until you get off the first planet. Lots of different environments, from ships to planets. Numerous side quests and as usual to star wars, you can choose to follow the light or dark side or even stay in the middle. Your force powers will cost you less depending on where your character is aligned and what force powers you are using (IE, if you are using a dark side power, it will be less taxing on you if your character is aligned to the dark side and vice versa). You select new force powers and attributes each time you level up based on experience earned. You get lots of companions that help you along the way. Some are Jedi, some are droids, and some are soldiers or other people. You can upgrade your light saber with crystals that change them color or make them more powerful. You can dual wield weapons, or use a dual light saber like Darth Maul had in Episode 1. Your party consists of two companions and yourself. During combat, you can take control of the other characters and use their special abilities.Replay: Medium. You might want to play through as both a Jedi light side or a Sith dark side and make decisions accordingly. The ending is very different for both. Each companion you have will ask you to do something for them.Conclusion: Hands down, one of the best star wars games on a console. If you missed this game, I would highly recommend you pick it up. It will play on the Xbox 360.UPDATE:I've read a lot of negative reviews about this game, so let me try and help out further. No you don't start off with Jedi powers or a light saber. Once you get off the first planet, you get to train in the force and start acquiring force powers and the ability to upgrade all your light sabers. As for fighting, yes it is controlled automatically but you can choose what special ability or force power to use at any moment. Once you get further in the game, you actually have to pay a lot of attention to fighting. You will constantly be selecting force powers to use to heal yourself, your party, or special attack force powers. If you sit there and watch, you will die often. You need to be involved in every fight. As I mentioned earlier, it is an expansive environment. If you like only hack and slash games, then stick to Obi-wan- this game is not for you. Any RPG fan will be satisfied with game and will know what value it has. The story is immense and draws you in. You will want to find out more about the characters in your party. Each of them have a favor they ask of you as a side quest, like finding a parent, trying to set a friend free who is on trial, etc. And HK-47 is one of the best characters in the game. His droid humor is hilarious and he refers to humans as over grown meat bags. The game takes a long time and it's well worth it to explore and do side quests.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2011"}

I enjoyed the game on both N64 & Playstation. And just recently, I found out that they had made this classic game on the Nintendo Gamecube. So it was a no brainer as a serious video game junkie, that it's a instant pick up! Paid $30.00 for a great conditioned used copy. Popped it into the Gamecube and found it to be overall pretty cool! RE2 is in my top 10 Gamecube games for sure. It's a exact adaptation of the previous systems version, to this system. Graphic-wise it's the same. And of course the story,ect...too! I will say I though I am not liking the feel of the game on the Gamecube controller. It felt/feels more fluent and natural on both Playstation & N64's controllers. With that said, it's still a fun experience on this console aswell. If you have played this before on other systems & have a Gamecube. You'll likely agree this is a worthy pick up! And if you have yet to play RE2 & have a Gamecube,Playstation, it's definitely still a great game. I rated this game a 4 on how fun it is. And a 4 on the overall rating. The reason mainly being the feel of gameplay on the Gamecube controller. It's not real bad gameplay-wise on Gamecube. It's just kinda a little weird, when you've played it a lot on other controllers.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0047THYWC","description":"","reviewerName":"genocidal_maniac","summary":"At least it's better than Dragon Age 1","reviewText":"I feel like this is the first game Bioware has made in a long time that is a proper sequel to the KOTOR games. It is an all-around improvement over the original dragon age game. Everything is substantially better.To start off, combat is faster. Also, classes have been tweaked. So a longsword makes these big sweeping AOE swipes. A rogue will slice up an enemy in no time. Mages have epic crowd control spells which gathers them all in one place and then blasts them.The rogue in particular has been improved. Instead of having to run to from the front to the side to the back of the enemy, the rogue gets a backstab skill that teleports her immediately to the enemy's back. Yes, this is better. It is more fun, more chaotic.At the same time, it is more interesting than God of War style games because you can pause the game at any time and tell your characters what to do. You can also customize their responses with AI priority trees. So it is a lot like a customizable God of War. The first game in contrast was very slow in its combat. And while it is realistic for sword swings to be slow, it is highly unrealistic for that sword swing to take off like 1/10 of the enemy's HP. So the first game basically was slow and ineffective. This game is fast and effective. So it's more fun.the story is better. It is smaller and more personal, since you're saving your family. There are more human moments like dealing with a wastrel uncle and losing a family member. The main plot tries to draw ambiguity basically between totalitarian order and chaotic freedom. There is also a highly \"meeting of cultures\" between an islamic culture and a christian culture. It is very interesting for that.Character models are much better. Elves look elvish and not like blunted teenagers. Humans look real.  the Dwarves are more charismatic.A lot of people dislike the art and they are right on point here. The art feels incomplete. Many dungeons are reused. I myself didn't really notice the reusing of dungeons so that didn't bother me so much, but it is a fact. Beyond the recycling of art, the standard Bioware problems remain. There's a lot of talking while saying nothing. You don't have real choice in how the game ends up. You instead get to choose the bookends of what happens at the end of the quest. A lot of the game world itself is quite sterile and without inspiration.but the characters are on a whole more charismatic than the first game. The combat is better and a lot more fun. The story is more interesting. This is a better game than Dragon Age 1.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2012"}

If so, the answer is Parasite Eve. The story is about an NYPD cop named Aya Brea, whose life gets turned upside down during a visit to a theater. She goes to see an opera with her boyfriend, and all seems to be going well, the singer; Melissa; has a beautiful voice and everything is running perfectly until people start to self-combust (catch fire by themselves). Only Aya miraculously survives and Eve has mysteriously disappeared, so you must go find her, and as a dutiful police officer, arrest her. Then wierd things start happening in the dressing room area. A rat suddenly appears, and then it begins squealing uncontrollably as it begins to mutate into a grotesque abomination (Remember the scene in The Thing when the dog changed into the alien? Yeah, it was that disgusting.) Then it turns out Melissa is a horrible monster called Eve, who can spawn creatures called Neo-Mitochondria. As the game explains it, this particular parasite makes the mitochondria in the cells gain more energy than the cell itself causing the body to get really hot and make it catch on fire by itself or turn into a gel substance. There is a more detailed explanation in the game, but I gave you the shorter version. Then you begin to have strange visions from your past that you'd long forgotten for good reasons. This is only the beginning of the game, you face even more dangerous and freakier creatures later. This game is ultimately a quest to destroy Eve, save the world, wipe out the Neo-Mitochondria creatures, and discover the secrets of your past. This game has incredible CG-animated cutscenes that are very impressive, even to this day. The in-game graphics of the environments are incredible as well, but the character models look ugly in real-time. The gameplay is a mix of turn-based and real-time combat, what I mean is, on this game you wait your turn to attack but you can move around. Unfortunately, this can also hamper the experience in some ways because the enemies move around too, and sometimes the space you're enclosed in is too small for you to really avoid being hit. Luckily, this rarely dampers the experience because this game is absolutely incredible with its creepy Resident Evil-style creatures and atmosphere, phenomenal CG-animation, cool gameplay, storyline, cool bosses, and challenging gameplay. If you like RPGs and you like Resident Evil this game is a must-have because it's so awesome. I love this game, and there's no reason any RPG fan should hate it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2008"}

I don't recall the exact circumstances on why I picked it up, but I'm willing to bet that seeing 'Squaresoft' on the jewel case had more than a little to do with it.With The 3rd Birthday's U.S. launch fast approaching, I put the first Parasite Eve back on my list, having not played it since a short time after I bought it, and even then not having finished the game. Thanks to a YouTube user's help, I started playing the game again, from the start, and finished it one very late night a few days later.Parasite Eve is our first experience with New York copy Aya Brea, who over the course of 6 days battles against forces unleashed upon New York, before they expand to the entire world. Overall a pretty solid story, although bits of the quasi-science are laughable. An initial play will take from 9 to 13 hours, although seasoned hands can finish the game in around 7 hours. (I completed the game in around 11 hours and 45 minutes, doing everything that I could in my first play through.) Once the game has been completed an EX game is unlocked, which allows you to replay the game, keeping some amount of your character's goods, and possibly unlock an additional ending. As noted above I actually finished the game late one night (early one morning), since I felt compelled to see the game to the end.The game is an action RPG, involving leveling of your character and her weapons/equipment, with battle portions allowing you to move around while your action gauge fills. So, a sort of cross between Secret of Mana and Final Fantasy VII. Overall, I personally found it to be rather enjoyable, once I got into the hang of how the battles play out. The camera is stuck in place, much like the first Resident Evil games, but generally has little effect on battles. (You will have to watch for chests.)Thankfully the game does not feature tank controls (which I can't stand), and was part of that group of PlayStation games that allowed analog controls (but at the price of being able to use the d-pad). I played the game on my 80 gig PlayStation 3, and experienced no issues, outside of one of my controllers seemingly having the analog stick stuck 'up' at times. (Swapping out another controller resolved the issue.)It's obvious what generation the game is from because of the CG, and the normal graphics are flat, but despite that the game has held up extremely well. Of course, that may be because I found the battle system so enjoyable, and because the graphic quality fits with the darker atmosphere of the game.The game does have a Mature rating, but what I assume gave it the rating is a character model later in the game that could be compared to Shiva's model in the Final Fantasy series. There's some talk about sexual themes as well, but nothing that a teenager doesn't know about from school. (The EX game's ending may feature content that pushed this game into the M rating.)Overall, this is an amazing game, and I look forward to doing an EX game run very soon, and perhaps even moving on to Parasite Eve 2. 5 of 5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"Nishi","summary":"Fun first time through, gets way too tedius later","reviewText":"After picking up the annual pass last year, I was looking forward to playing this game. I haven't played the previous Diablo games and the only game I have played in this genre are the untold legends psp games (Guardian FTW) so I will just be basing this review on the game itself and not comparing it to the previous games.Story:The game takes place 20 years after the events of Diablo 2 an evil is back at it again. I really liked the story, and the cut-scenes were amazing to watch (especially act 1's end scene). You get a CGI cut-scene at the end of each act bringing you into the next. Throughout the course of each act you are given a drawn cut-scenes explaining what's happening so far with the hero you picked voicing it over.My favorite part of the story though is being able to talk to all the important NPC's. The main characters have new topics to talk about each act, and even get new things to mention based on the quests you're on and what events have taken place. You can also talk to the Blacksmith and Jewel crafter; they even have dialog options before you obtained them when you play new game+.Gameplay:This is where the game is both really cool, but really annoying at the same time. The combat itself is really fun, and all the runes are mostly different from one another that make leveling quite fun. Basically you earn skills as you level, and the skills can be modified with runes (1 at a time for each skill) so your barbarian whirlwind could be on fire, or shoot smaller tornadoes from yourself. With elective mode you can put any skill on 1-4 numbers and left/right clicking.With that said, you start being forced into a few builds in order to survive in inferno difficulty. To me this goes against the tons of variations you can choose from (Yes this is the hardest difficulty, but it was still something promised before the game came out). The skills can be reset at any time during the game, which really removes the reason to even level the same class again if you don't care about Achievements.Also it seems that act 2+ in Inferno is one big gear check. Normally I wouldn't mind this, especially in game like this where gear is king, but they have stated that the existence of the Auction House factored in the op rate of items (Since people would use the auction house to buy better gear, instead of farming it). That worried me a bit after hearing that since the Real Money Auction House is coming out soon, and if they are getting $1.00 per sold equipment and 15% on commodities, and if you transfer to paypal its 15% on top of everything else. Makes me wonder if that was the main reason the Auction House was factored in.Another big issue that is a no-no for me is always on DRM. That means you need to log into the game to play, and no offline mode to play by yourself. So if the server goes down for maintenance, too many people logging on at once, or even server lag is all a factor in the game you purchased. Also for something that requires you to be connected the whole time, you would thing matchmaking for public games would be better, but it's not. Most of the time you are put into a game with just one other person and there is no kick option for people who want to grief you. I'm surprised they couldn't have it send you into games with more people since they are able to code LFR and LFD in WoW, or they could just have a game list for people to join.Now onto exploration, it was advertised to have randomized maps, but this is only partially true. The map itself stays the same every time and only events are randomized (Like a cellar door open on time leading to a dungeon, which could be closed the next map reset). This makes playing through the acts multiple times tedious after a while, especially if you want multiple hero's in Inferno.Soundtrack:The soundtrack is pretty cool and adds to the feel of epicness that you can slay tons of enemies to. The main theme is really epic and by far my favorite. You can tell they took their time with the soundtrack to make sure it was up to par with mainstream games. The soundtrack changes based on the theme of each act you visit.The sound effects of the weapons and attacks are really polished. From the Monks Daibo spinning to the barbarians leap sound great and don't seem they are just stock attack sounds. The voice acting in this game is ok, not the best in the world, but it works. The jeweler acting though is pretty awesome and is the most memorable for me.Graphics:I think they did a really good job with the graphics. I like the look of each hero and their abilities, and with the different runes for the skills the looks change and most look diverse from one another. Each act has its own look, from the graveyard to the desert. They are really well designed visually and the first time through them is pretty awesome.Verdict:The game itself is pretty fun the first few times through (Cool story, great soundtrack and nice graphics), but it does get tedious after a while without a real randomization to the maps and not just events. Throw in the fact the game has to be connected all the time to the servers could lead to many annoying moments with server overload or lag, I recommend saving your 60 dollars until they iron out all these issues.~ Written: 06-12Positive:* Really cool cut-scenes* Most important NPC's have dialog options* Really good soundtrack* Sound effects really polished* Locations and skills look great* Combat is a lot of fun in the earlier difficultiesNegative:* Not the best voice acting except the jeweler.* Forced into certain builds to even survive in Inferno* Inferno is on big gear check, with drop rate being factored into the existence of the AH* Real Money Auction House will have high fee's* Online only DRM, so no offline solo play.* Matchmaking really only puts you in a game with one other person* No game list to join, all randomized.* Map isn't randomized, only events","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2012"}

This is as close as you can get to driving without actually being in a car.  The 11 inch leather wrapped wheel is great and feels of high quality.  It's not the same as what you will find in a Ferrari, but it sure feels better than plastic.  The pedals are adjustable to allow for more precise control of the throttle, break and shifting.  Trust me, adjusting those pedals till it feels right is very important when 1/10th of a second is all it takes to lose a race.I never used a G25 but I can compare it to the Logitech Drving Force GT wheel made awhile back.  This G27 blows that wheel out of the water.  There is no comparison.  After playing with the G27, the Driving Force GT just doesn't cut it no more.The games I played with the G27 on the PS3 are Formula 1 and Gran Turismo Prologue.  With F1, as with real F1 cars, I only used the paddle shifters.  The force feedback on this thing is quite impressive.  When you turn and mess up and the wheels lock, you will feel it.In GT Prologue, I played it with the stick shift.  Using the stick shift and driving a slow car around the circuits made it felt like I was really driving a car.  I didn't notice the force feedback as much and will compare the feel of the wheel when GT 5 actually comes out.  I prefer paddle shift because it is faster and my dream car is a Ferrari Enzo, which only comes with F1 Paddle Shifts.Like with most reviewers here, I do agree the cords got excessive.  I understand everything being hardwired is better because it allows for more precise control and you won't get any interference as you could with wireless.  This is important when 1/10th of a second each lap can lose a race.  My solution was to just buy a $1 cord tube from Ikea and stuff all the cords inside the tube.  With that, you just have one fat tube from the wheel to the ps3, with the electrical cable partially hanging out and into the outlet.Even if you decide not to use the stick shift, you will still have to connect that to the wheel in order to select and start a game on the PS3.  It's a lot of cords, but once you get the set up right, its a minor nuisance.I am going to order a Playseats Evolution Gaming Seat with the gear shift holder mount so I can attach this wheel and use it like how it was meant to be used and suggest those interested in this wheel invest in one as well.  At least some sort of mounting solution to make playing with the wheel easier.If you are serious about racing games, you need the Logitech G27.  Keep in mind, this wheel is only compatible with a PC or PS3.  It will NOT work with the Xbox 360.See you at the track.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2009"}

Titles like Halo and Half Life have made FPS players drool. Is there possibly room for another great FPS?The answer to my question is yes, and that game is Far Cry. Far Cry was, untill Half Life 2 came out, the best single player FPS yet. The story was something Michael Chriton might write. Its keeps you involved so you want to see what happenes next.One thing to the games credit, its beautiful. It has the best foliage and grass effects in any game to date. The textures could have been better, but not much better. This easily ranks in the top 3 best looking games.The gameplay is very fun. It has vehicle segments which are great. You can drive and shoot at the same time. (There is one great part where you fly in a hang glider)It is also non-linear. The world is open, every island is explorable. That is what makes the game what it is.I dont have many gripes about this game, but if I were to try to find some, here they are. One, the voive actor who did Jack is horrible. Overall, the voive actors are all good except for Jack. Two, the game is hard. REALLY hard, even on easy. Far Cry easilly has some of the best AI I have ever witnessed.Overall, if you like FPS, get Far Cry, if you dont, get it anyway and you will like FPS.Concept-Make a quality FPS is a market saturated with them.Presintation-9.5- Tons of options, cool menues and lots of scalability options.Graphics- 9.8- Beautiful, absolutly beautiful. It has the longest draw distances to ever be in a video game. You can see for miles. Also, the water effect is the best ive ever seen.Sound- 8.8- The low point of the title. The Music iss good, along with the ingame sounds. But the voive actor for Jack is almost as bad as Kirsten Dunst in the spider-Man 2 game.Playability- 9.6- A hard game, but easy to execute. vehicles are kinda a pain sometimes.Gameplay- 9.2- Non-linear, vehicles, intense action, whats not to like? Almost everything is executed perfectly.Entertainment- 9.4- Great fun, go pick this one up if you havent already.Replay Value- 9.0- The single player campaign is 15 hours, and you will want to play it again.

{"product_name":"B000TI836G","description":"","reviewerName":"Gearhead Mania","summary":"Not quite as good as CoD MW2","reviewText":"I had been waiting for this game for several months, and have observed a lot of the hype about \"Tier 1\" this and \"Tier 1\" that. I even learned that the military banned this game from being sold at on-post exchanges because one could play as the opposing forces and engage US forces in multiplayer mode. Beyond the hype, the game was OK. I could see a lot of features being mirrored from Call of Duty Modern Warfare. There aren't a lot of revolutionary ideas in Medal of Honor, and there is a very limited selection of weapons. The only weapons you can pick up are the standard AK/RPK/Dragunov fare from fallen enemy combatants, and the weapons you start with are all period-correct (M4 carbine / SPR / EBR, with Trijicon ACOG TA01, etc...) so you won't find a FN SCAR with a TA31 somewhere in the single-player mode.The framerate gets choppy at times, and there are some issues with drawing the enemy soldiers correctly in some portions of the game. I've also found that my hits don't always register, or that it can take 5-6 shots from the SPR to take down enemies.With the Ear Force X41 and Dolby 7.1, I could pinpoint locations of the enemy soldiers based on their sounds (speech or gun fire) so they did a great job with the audio.Overall, it isn't quite as good as CoD MW2 but I still felt it was a fun game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Wunderwaffen","summary":"Unless you have XP or Xbox 1, do NOT get this game!","reviewText":"WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!

{"product_name":"B00000I1BR","description":"Let me go on record and say that I was never a fan of the original Crash Bandicoot. Even though Crash was disarmingly cute and fuzzy, and even though the game's graphics were just about as good as they got in those days, the frustrating design of the game made playing it such a painful experience that I still have flashbacks when I see small marsupials on the Discovery Channel. But just one short year after his debut, Crash is back in a sequel that is so far superior to the original that I'm willing to forget the mistakes of the past.The new storyline is simple: A very gullible Crash is corralled into collecting crystals for the evil Dr. Cortex and gems for the terrible N. Brio. There are 25 levels in all; each level contains an easy-to-find crystal and hard-to-earn gems. Instead of being forced to approach the game in a strictly linear fashion, you progress through a series of five warp rooms. Each warp room contains five levels, which you are free to tackle in any order. After you have found the crystals in each level, you can progress to the next warp room. This system of warp rooms is a great innovation; it's clear how to progress in the game, and yet you have the option of moving to a different level if you're hopelessly frustrated with one area. Best of all, you can save your game in the warp room at any time (a big improvement over the original game's horrific save system).A lot of variety is packed inside this game. You'll navigate through simple run-and-jump areas, try to outrun a very mad polar bear, work your way through sewer systems, and even fly around with a jet pack. Within each level, the basic gameplay is similar to the original Crash: Running, jumping, and spinning are still the order of the day. Even though most levels are set in a semi-3D environment, Crash Bandicoot 2 is a platform game, plain and simple. The graphics are in a league of their own among PlayStation games, and the music couldn't be better. Unlike the original, Crash 2 is rarely frustrating enough to make you want to throw your controller at the TV. In fact, some expert gamers might find Crash to be a little on the easy side.There are only two real problems with Crash Bandicoot 2. First, the semi-3D setup is sometimes hard to navigate, and you'll find yourself missing jumps because you're unable to judge distances properly. Secondly, the game is just plain cheap at times; in some areas you must sacrifice many lives until you memorize a level's layout.In any event, these problems are balanced out by the game's excellent gameplay and intelligent design. Crash Bandicoot 2 is a topnotch platform game. If you're a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to check this title out. -- John Broady--Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

{"product_name":"B00002SVFQ","description":"F-Zerodelivers the excellent play control you've come to expect in a game from Mr. Miyamoto and his team at Nintendo. You can bank with the R Button and tip down your nose while making jumps. You'll need all the control you can get, too, as you roar through the twists and turns ofF-Zero's 15 deviously difficult courses. There are four hover cars to choose from, each with its own strong points and weak points. Most beginners find the durability and handling of the Fire Stingray easiest to use (despite poor acceleration), but veteran players will often choose the more-balanced Blue Falcon.Strategy plays a big part in this speedfest. In this one-player racing game you will need to find shortcuts, elude hazards and snag power-ups if you want to beat your savvy competition. Keep an eye out for sand, land mines, magnets and other trouble spots, but always be ready to get a boost from a speed or jump plate. You'll earn one Super Turbo per lap, and part of the strategy is knowing when to use it.When originally released in 1991,F-Zero's graphics were light years ahead of most of the competition. It still impresses mightily, thanks to innovative use of Mode 7 scrolling that immerses you in the adrenalin-pumping action.Sonically,F-Zerois one of the best SNES titles. Driving techno music and top-notch sound effects, including the hum of your car's turbines unwinding, relentlessly propel the action. The aggressive artificial intelligence of your rivals never allows you to ease up.","reviewerName":"J.

It is beautiful.It is very fast for 16 bit and the levels are all classic.I don't understand how people can say things like \"this game isn't very fast\" or \"the vehicles run as slow as a turtle\" because I think this game is so fast that sometimes it's very hard to control your vehicle in some courses like Death Wind and Fire Field.These people may not know that you get an extra boost of power that you can use after the 1st lap.The music too is classic Super NES at it's best.For as old as this game is it still looks and sounds great and for me the gameplay remains as fun and as fresh as it was in 1991.This game is different than the other F Zero games that came after it in that when you get ahead of the other racers or get first place you get a 1 up which makes it fun.The challenge is when to know to boost and get ahead of the other racers.Overall I say if you liked the other F Zero games you should check this one out since it was the one that started it all.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2003"}

I use the clock display which I find the most useful when I'm gaming. It's better than grabbing my watch (which I'm not usually wearing) or looking at my phone. I have found absolutely no use for the LCD screen otherwise and the only reason I bought it was because I needed to replace my broken keyboard and Logitech.com had a dented box deal (50% off, free shipping). I use Fraps for FPS display, since it can record and take screenshots as well.This keyboard is pretty much similar to the one I replaced, a G11, except that mine is the 2nd edition with less macro keys and orange lighting. I don't particularly like the orange, but of course, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I much prefer the blue.I'm not a big RTS or RPG player either and can't seem to find a good use for the macro keys. I've set them up to control Skype, but that's about it. If you play either of these genre's you may find more use for them, but I don't use a lot of macro keys.Now that I've gotten the bad stuff out of the way, the keyboard is actually pretty good. I like illuminated keys, they are great for gaming at night when I'd prefer to have the lights off. I also like the media and volume controls, something I require from any keyboard I usually buy. My headset pretty much has all these controls but it's nice to have them on a keyboard as well, in case the headset didn't. The LCD screen also shows that track you are playing and the current volume when ever you adjust it, which is one other nice thing about the screen.There is a slider on this keyboard that switches \"gaming mode\" on a off. All this does is disable the Windows key so if you accidentally hit it whilst in a game, it doesn't minimize the game. You may think this is useless at first, until the day you actually hit the Windows key by accident ;) The backlit keys can also be turned off too, though I prefer to leave it on.Overall, this keyboard would be a great buy if you can find a good deal on it. I got mine for about [...] with free shipping, which I feel it totally worth it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00006GSO1","description":"James Bond... Solid Snake... Ethan Hunt... Based on their recent games, all these so-called superspies could stand to take a few lessons from newcomer Sam Fisher. His name isn't important; the important thing is that his game,Splinter Cell, comes from Tom Clancy's game studio and offers up the kind of sophistication and control you'd expect from the studio that brought gamersRainbow Six. It's all about the details. When Sam enters a dark area, he's got two options, thermal and night vision. Thermal lets him see the body heat of an enemy soldier, even through walls and doors. Shoot through cover with a high-powered weapon, and you can watch as the heat fades from the body. Not dark yet? Shoot out the lights. Need a distraction? Pick up and toss a tin can. Come up to a door too thick to pass thermal readings? Sneak up to it, slip a fiber-optic lead under the door frame, and peek at what's beyond. When you're ready, open the door--just a little bit at a time. WhileSplinter Celllacks a famous hero in the lead role, it does sport the famous technical military thriller author Tom Clancy in the title. And you can see the evidence of his expertise in every facet of the game.

It's a good way to work your brain as well as make the time go faster on commutes, while waiting at the doctor's office, or exercising on the treadmill.The idea is simple. The goal is to string together tiles to form words of 3 letters or more. The longer the word, the bigger the score. A free Flash version is available on PopCap's website, but the DS version has many more features, like an Arcade Mode, Library, and 2 Players Mode. You only need 1 copy of the game to play against a friend. In the Library, you can keep track of your stats like how many words you created, secret word books, and room backgrounds you've unlocked. All together, there are 20 secret books to unlock, with 12 words each. It's very hard to get all the words, and there's no reward of any kind for completing each book, besides bonus points. You don't get any special animation, fun pictures, or unlockable secret options. Zilch.One thing I don't like is that you have to hold the DS sideways, like a book. Very few games do this (most notably,Ninja Gaiden Dragon SwordandBrain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!) and there's really no reason for it. The gameboard could simply have been arranged horizontally to allow ambidextrous play. I find it less comfortable to hold the DS upright, and it also prevents lefties from playing.Another big design flaw is the harsh penalty system. Burning tiles will start falling with increasing frequency if you make 3 letter words. The chance of being penalized rises with each level, and by 10+, I'm getting penalized almost with 100% probability. If you don't clear them right away, they'll start burning down your column of tiles. When they reach the bottom, it's game over. It is not explained in the manual that the game penalizes you for short words. At lower levels, this is infrequent, but at higher levels (9+), this becomes a huge turn-off, as almost every 3-letter word causes a fire tile to appear, making this game unfit for younger kids with limited vocabularies. Sometimes 4-5 letter words cause fire tiles. Then it degenerates into a frustrating game of clearing the penalty letters first instead of leisurely clearing letters to make words at your own pace.To make things worse, the letters are not weighted, so you're just as likely to get a tough letter like J, V, Qu, X, Y, or Z as you are to get a commonly used and easier to combine letter like R, S, T, L, N, E. For example, I got 3 burning V's in a row in one game. When you clear a column of letters, if you are going to be penalized, the red tile will always appear at the bottom of the new stack of falling letters. If you are stuck, you can scramble the board an unlimited number of times, but this penalizes you by also dropping burning tiles. By level 10, I'm getting 4 burning tiles with each scramble. At higher levels, I got 6 or 7 burning tiles. If you need to scramble the board, that means you are stuck with bad letters that you can't combine. But scrambling causes you to be put in an even worse situation. A scramble is seldom ever helpful. It doesn't simply rearrange all the existing letters on the board. It shuffles all the tiles randomly into new letters. Secondly, it is counted as a turn, so any burning letters already on the board will burn down 1 block after the scramble. I find this sadistic and not fun at all. Players should not be punished for playing. A better system would have been to give you a finite number of scrambles (like 3), which you can use at any time without penalty, then let you earn more as you hit score milestones (say, every 20,000 points).Unlike the online version, there's no way to tell how much the letters are worth. The web version has dots under the letters to indicate their worth (1 to 3 dots). The DS version only shows you the points after you create a word.Lastly is the strange dictionary where words like \"Luo (an African tribe), haka (traditional Maori dance), loa (Haitian voodoo spirits), lek and som (unit of money in Albania and Kyrgyzstan, respectively) are accepted, but words like \"India\", \"Rome\", \"dork\", and \"dong\" (Vietnamese currency unit) and not. \"Moo\" (cow sound) is accepted, but \"poof\" and \"Saturn\" are not. With certain words, a definition pops up, but I am at a loss to explain how these words were chosen. Usually, these are very obscure 3-4 letter words, like \"qua\", international monetary units, or little-known animals, and names of esoteric native peoples. \"Vat\" is defined as a tax (value added tax) instead of the more common meaning of \"container\" (like \"a vat of chocolate\"). No definition is given for longer words.Verdict: it's fun for a little while, but gameplay gets very repetitive. The overly-punishing penalty system really drags down my rating, and makes this game too difficult for younger players. At higher levels, it's no longer very much fun due to the frequency of the fire tiles and lack of a rich reward system. The music is also monotonous and somewhat irritating. It's very low-fi sounding and one of the percussion instruments just sounds like static. Overall, it's fun for maybe 30 minutes at a time only.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2009"}
{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"That old familiar (yet still epic) feeling","reviewText":"Remarkable as it is, Naughty Dog has not had a single game that one would call \"terrible\". While some are considered more worthwhile then others, their track record is pretty impressive. With the release of Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, the team developed a beautiful and fun if a tad derivative game that helped encourage the more \"cinematic\" approach to game design. Then enters Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. Practically a seminal milestone in gaming, beating the game and running into somebody who hadn't played it yet prompted a \"oh man, you've gotta play it!\" reaction. Stunning graphics with believable motion capture, excellent voice acting with some truly stellar set-pieces, I'd almost go and say Uncharted 2 nary has a single fault in its narrative (other than blue cat people but I digress). Which makes walking into the 3rd game, Drake's Deception, kind of a tricky situation I'm sure not only for fans but for the team. Will they try to outdo everything the 2nd game did? Can you really outperform \"perfection\"? Well Uncharted 3 is kind of in the middle: it does nearly everything the 2nd game did but better and yet can still leave one with a feeling of deja vu, albeit an impressive deja vu.2 years after the events of Among Thieves, the game opens with Drake and Sully attempting to solve a riddle from one of Sir Francis Drake's voyages, a voyage believed to end with the city of Ubar, the Iram of the Pillars or the \"Atlantis of the Sands\". Drake globetrots from the London underground to a chateau in France to the Arabian desert as he searches for this mystical city, all the while friends around them are questioning why is it that he always pursues reckless endeavors for treasure and doesn't see how it affects his friends and loved ones.The leap from the first game to the second was pretty extraordinary and not just on a graphical front. The seamless transitions of cinematics, gameplay and even events that would've likely been quicktime events or non-interactive was something to behold. That leap to this game isn't as grand a leap since now we pretty much know what Naughty Dog is capable of and while what you're seeing won't have the \"oh my god, how did they even DO this?\" reactions, it's still mighty impressive stuff. A ship capsizing, a burning chateau and a plane getting ripped apart...with you in it are set-pieces that really make Uncharted 3 one of the more visceral and entertaining blockbuster rides of 2011. Although one could think the team just put these moments in there knowing people would look for them so they build excuses in the story to have them, you can't deny these are magnificent parts of the game.However, for a game highly dependent on a scripted and precise order of events, it's very disheartening when you end up dying because you didn't turn a corner fast enough or missed a jump or didn't know what way to go during a chase sequence. It makes for an odd dichotomy since to further the \"it's like a movie\" feel of an Uncharted game, one must rarely die to preserve its flow and yet without prior knowledge of what exactly needs to be done, it can make for a very start/stop kind of structure. Also oddly out of place is that unlike the near flawless pacing of Among Thieves, it's very bizarre to say some parts in Drake's Deception just flat out..., well they kind of suck. A Syrian fortress and a slow beginning as well as certain story elements that are never addressed or properly resolved made me think the game was rewritten a couple of times and certain parts got lost in the shuffle. That still doesn't mean the game doesn't have incredible highs (see preceding paragraph) but the lows are strangely VERY low. Also, the amount of punishment Drake takes is kind of ridiculous. How can a guy go this long without cracking a rib, breaking his fingers or his legs. I mean seriously, dude's like X-Men's Colossus. Hell, even the going-on 60 Sully can keep up with the youthful Drake.But still, if there's one thing you can't knock the team for is presentation and this game is a stunner. Other than one wonky wall texture, everything in the game from the mo-cap to the environments and of course the set-pieces, Uncharted 3 practically bleeds production values. Voice acting as usual is strong and characters are appropriately endearing or love-to-hate-them (but why do Elena and Chloe look worse than before? must be the eyes). The environments are also incredibly gorgeous, whether they're being destroyed or not, and some I'm sure were incredibly difficult to pull off despite the look of the scene.If there's one thing that Uncharted 3 occasionally but not always handles is in the combat which can be strangely frustrating at times. Some of them just drag for too long and even though stealth is encouraged, being caught doesn't mean about 10 or so guys, it becomes a long protracted and tedious firefight as enemies spawn with snipers, grenade launchers and RPG's leading to many out-of-the-blue deaths. And this is a common issue among their forums but the aiming feels...off which was quite noticeable when I actually replayed Among Thieves before I got this to re-accustom myself to Uncharted's gameplay. This also can lead to the \"start/stop\" structure I mentioned before where I can really imagine specific sequences annoying gamers on higher difficulties knowing what a trial they were even on Normal.Brought back from Uncharted 2 is the online modes, the co-op and the multiplayer. In the co-op, it breaks down into 3 groups: Arena, which plays out similarly to Horde mode with the twist being that every wave will have a specific objective such as kills only count when standing in an area or \"Gold Rush\" which is straight up Capture the Flag. There's co-op adventure which has you and 2 players (with strangely downgraded graphics on the character models) going through a little mini-story that's about half hour long or so. Then there's the new mode, Co-Op Hunter which has 2 teams of 2 competing to capture treasure with the villain side gaining some computer AI buddies for assistance. Since all money/XP accumulated goes towards your online profile, you can jump into co-op or the actual online to better your character's unlocks.And the actual multiplayer of Uncharted is indeed kind of a blast. The same basic rules apply: 5 versus 5, jump and climb anywhere you want while you attempt to capture treasures or just straight TDM, free for all, hardcore (no weapon mods or medal kickbacks). Some new elements are introduced such as medal kickbacks which function but don't become acquired the same way as killstreaks. Choosing one kickback, once a certain amount of medals are obtained, pressing Up on the d-pad activates a certain ability such as instantly spawning an RPG in-hand, running faster for a brief time as well as many others. Boosters (or essentially perks) return while weapon mods are added so you can customize a gun to have faster reload, bigger clip or a \"call out\" which highlights enemy names when they're being aimed at so other players can know where they are. Also a new element is what are called \"power plays\" so say the losing team is losing by...a LOT, a power play is brought in to hopefully give that team a chance to catch up.One thing to note is that the game does have an online pass which does NOT include a trial mode to test out the multiplayer so if you're renting the game and you want to test the online and see whether you'd rather buy this then the other big online games out, you're SOL. Buy it brand new or pay 10 more bucks.Remarkable and highly impressive with the occasional blemishes, Uncharted 3 is indeed a great game. The thrills are more impressive albeit familiar but unfortunately this game came after an even better one and while this game I'd recommend someone play without hesitation, it's not the flawless roller-coaster ride as its predecessor.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0053BCMAC","description":"","reviewerName":"Drewz","summary":"A very well polished adventure","reviewText":"Is this a Paper Mario game? Yes.Is this Paper Mario? No.I didn't let what some folks were saying deter me from picking this up. In case you haven't heard, in Paper Mario: Sticker Star, Mario no longer receives exp from enemies he defeats, and thus he no longer levels up (although his maximum HP can be raised by finding hearts within the game). What people don't seem to realize, is that Nintendo didn't just simply remove features from their newest Paper Mario game but they replaced them too.In case you couldn't tell from the title, this game has to do with Stickers. Stickers are the source of Mario's power in this game. A sticker can be many things. You'll find jump shoes, fire flowers, POW blocks, mushrooms, and many other staples from Mario games. Each one does something different when used in battle. Once a sticker is used, it disappears for good. But don't worry, stickers can be found over and over again by revisiting areas. The really good ones can be purchased from shops using coins won from battles and found in the various levels of the game. Mario himself may not level up, but he can sometimes find \"shiny\" versions of stickers. These versions are stronger than their un-shiny counterparts. For instance, a \"shiny fire flower\" will do more damage than a \"fire flower.\"Stickers aren't just for battle either. Sometimes Mario can interact with his environment by grabbing/placing stickers. If a door is on a building crooked, Mario can pull it off and place it on correctly/ If a bad guy steals a bridge, it's up to Mario to get it back before he can cross. There are plenty of small surprises too if you really keep your eyes open :)The game has an over-world map. I was pleasantly surprised to see the game treat the different areas as though they were levels in a Mario world. You'll visit 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, etc. It helps the game feel like a traditional Mario game while it remains an RPG at its core. Areas are extremely colorful and alive and are explored in the usual Paper Mario fashion. The 3D effect only enhances the experience. It's also neat that so much in the game is one huge play on being paper.Music is catchy. I recently played Mario 3D Land, which also has really good music. I just wish Nintendo would give The New Super Mario Bros. series this kind of attention.You can have three save files per game card. I was personally very glad to see this as my girlfriend quickly expressed her interest in the game. Rather than being forced to spend another $40 on a separate copy, she can just use her very own save file right on the same game card.So far, my only gripe with the game is that the A button is both \"jump\" and \"examine.\" I don't understand why on a system with so many buttons, Nintendo felt the need to make one button have multiple functions. While it might not happen often, it's annoying when you want Mario to jump, but he instead interacts with something close to him.If you're an open minded person, I am confident you will enjoy this game. If you hate change, however, then you'd probably better take your $40 elsewhere.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2012"}

It takes place in the same universe as the comic books, during the time when Rick Grimes is still in the coma at the beginning of the series' timeline, but despite having a new cast (with a few cameos from familiar faces in the comic series and TV show) it's nothing short of amazing. Telltale puts together a group of believable characters you genuinely care for and get emotionally attached to. You play as Lee Everett, a convicted killer who's going to prison when the outbreak happens. Along the way you meet a little girl named Clementine who doesn't know where her parents are so you promise to look after her until she meets up with them again. The meat of the story is that the game adapts to decisions you make - do you side with one person or the other in a very heated debate? Help one person or the other in the meatlocker (you'll never forget that scene after playing it, period.) At one point, you have four food items but ten hungry people, including yourself. Do you feed the others and let yourself go hungry, or do you hang on to one item for yourself? Most of the big decisions have to be done quickly - the timer's counting down. Inaction will either cause you to fail the game and reload the checkpoint, or everybody will be upset at your indecision. As it resembles the point and click adventure games of yesteryear, it is a bit of a slower pace, (this IS a Telltale game, after all) but given how that slower pace allows for a much deeper connection with the characters and a very solid story line, is that really a bad thing? Didn't think so.There are a few rough spots, however. There will be times when the hotspot you need to hit while being attacked by a walker (or human in some cases) is difficult to determine, causing instant death. Some of the cutscenes will have a touch of slowdown, and so far, neither \"Next time on The Walking Dead\" preview trailers have had content that actually showed up in the game. You get the general idea of what to expect, but there's not a single line of dialogue that matches what you see in the preview and what is actually shown in the game, and in the case of the preview for episode 3, even though you eventually get to the building that says \"Survivors Inside\" the preview has you believing that there are new people in there, fighting walkers. Instead it's abandoned in the actual episode. Now, again, you'll still get a good idea of what to expect; the previews still paint a broad stroke of what you'll find in the next episode, but there are plenty of differences in the details. Finally, one key decision you make in Episode 1, while impacting Episode 2 is basically moot in Episode 3 due to a twist in the first half of said episode. That's not to say it's a bad scene - it's one Ep.3's finest in fact, but you might feel a little cheated especially if you did like me and had two separate save files where you made different decisions.So if you like an emotionally stirring, well told story with great voice acting that oozes with replayability (since surely you want to see how the other decisions play out, right? Right?) there are PLENTY of worse choices out there. Buy this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2012"}

Though it may be a little cutesy for some gamers, I thought it added to even more enjoyment.  I mean, Animal Crossing takes place in a town where you are surrounded by dogs, cats, kangaroos, frogs, racoons, and all other types.  Of course the game will be cutesy when furry animals are involved.To start, you get to choose &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot;, naturally, as who you will be.  You choose your name, and the name of the town you will be leaving in.  When the train drops you off in the town, you are given a home of your choice, and from there on you pay off your loan and decorate your home.  When you pay off one loan, your house gets more additions.  It gets larger, with an added story and basement.  You can even paint your roof any color you want.You can gain items by doing favors for the animals, or purchasing them at &quot;Nook's Store&quot;Ways of making money can be by catching fish, bugs, shaking trees, or selling fruit.Unlike the Sims, your have a 24 hour clock in which different things happen on different days and times.

I refuse to pay the same price as in store when I can get it that day. So any way onto the review this game has held my attention for the last week, That is saying something because I have a stack of favorites I play for a few hours then return to in a week.The story is both interesting and engaging, the graphics are amazing, and the mechanics keep you involved. It is essentially a perfect game while remaining modern in both culture and ideals. The idea that a group of super human's evolve into society and the government rounds them up out of fear while demonizing them. seems both immoral and probably reality if it ever really happened.Then you have the star of the show, who is a rebel looking for his calling which gets completely tossed into the entire story by mistake. but is fitting that his own brother is a sheriff, who follows the law to a queue but some how see's his brother has met his calling and is supportive in his own way.It really brings you into the story and keeps you involved and entertained in a pretty vast for most part open world. where this really shines is, it reminds me a lot of the open scenery of GTA where you have a ton of side missions but where this picks up is where GTA falls flat.The open world of Second Son lets you roam and terrorize but gives you a option &#34;Karma&#34; you have the choice for Good or Bad Karma both have their advantages  and which one you pick determines how you will advance your power. and what weapons you will get with your powers. It also dictates how the world around you will perceive you. will you get the support of the people ? and create a riot to tip the odds in your favor ? or will you rule by fear and not have the backing of the people ?In the end it is up to you, the side missions consist of running down the enemy patrols taking over their bases and mobile command centers. while your main objective is to find other conduits ( super humans ) and steal their powers to advance yourself and eventually take on the head of the D.U.P ( enemy ) if you play your cards right, you can gain a team of conduits to create your own force to reckon with against the enemy.It is a truly engaging game and story, that has a little bit of everything.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2014"}

It is harder than both series, except DMC3, on normal difficulty and in my opinion, overly cheap.  That said, once the Ninja Dog difficulty has been unlocked, the game really opens up to a more nuanced button masher, much more like DMC1, probably my favorite game of the genre.  The intracacy of the combos are there but you aren't punished if that isn't your skill level.  And don't take the easier difficulty to be a cake walk either, there still is a sense of accomplishment in defeating some of the bosses.Unlocking Ninja Dog mode is not as evident as it might seem.  Simply agree to quit when it asks you if you want to give up the way of the ninja.  (This is different than just choosing not to continue).  For a few hours I kept saying no but was really starting to get annoyed with this game, (20 minutes repeatedly playing the same level does that for me).  Now I can harldly put the game down.Additionally, many reviewers have already noted that the cutscenes are not PS3 quality, not a huge flaw but noticable.  Still, the in-engine graphics are awesome.

A lot of the things said about ME3 in the year leading up to it's release never bore fruit, I kept up on the development and comments that Bioware made about the game because I was excited to play the last part of the trilogy. The statements that all your choices from the first two games will have an impact on the ending proved to be false, letting the Aracni queen live would play a big part in the ending nope, and the list goes on. Also the fact getting side missions which were so much fun in the first two games are nothing more than overhearing someone talking and you do a fetch and grab.Want to explore various places like you could in the first two games? You only get 2 in ME3 the Normandy and the Citadel, that is it. Part of the fun of the first two games was exploring around planets you land on, different merchants,even mini games like were added in ME2,nope not here,also pre-scripted dialogue when talking to crew mates,they used a stock photo shop online picture for Tali's face reveal,crew members that were so important in ME2 that you did loyalty missions for and had romances with were just given cameos.It's pretty obvious that due to the leak and less development time the game content was cut, to get the game out as soon as possible, there were two really good missions that it was obvious time was spent on, the Genophage and Quarian missions but everything else suffered.And yes the DLC made the ending somewhat better, but that original ending was nothing more than they ran out of time and needed to get the game out the door, choices you made in the game made no difference,choices from the other games didn't matter (even though Bioware swore they would).Basically it comes down this game needed more development time, it was as I said before plainly rushed maybe due to EA needing a recoup on their investment as quickly as possible, who knows. I just hope after Dragon Age 2 and now ME3 this isn't going to lead to Bioware dropping quality on their games due to not having the time to make a good choices matter game anymore.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2012"}

However, the level design and visual aesthetic and general tone of the game is where this game really shines.The 2D graphics are sharp, crisp, and lush!  Levels are slick and whimsical.  The game is quite funny to boot.Negatives for the Vita only lay in the fact that this seems to be an exact replica of the home console version.  This is a bittersweet issue - this seems to be an exact port but because of that the sprites are very small of the handheld's screen.  The game compensates for this by allowing zooming with a pinch action on the Vita screen.  This, however, reduces visibility of what is going around Rayman.Despite this, the game is perfectly playable.

I am an ex-player of World of Warcraft some years ago I left the PC games and I bought an XBOX console, since it had always missed WoW, finally I have something good role that entertain me, is that there is no point of comparison with the version for PC since each platform must be their adaptation, but on this XBOX version should mention that they have adapted it very well. System of levels of characters, &#34;blacksmiths&#34; and &#34;Jewelers&#34; updates and different drops from enemies in the world depending on the difficulty which you play make Diablo 3 to provide much entertainment on time. The choice of followers (Archer, magician or paladin) is the ultimate that I have seen, through this you can play only with your summons and your follower without problems. History is the most captivating game, is a splendid history, you can go talking with many NPC's, you can distract you a bit of the main story and dedicate yourself to do some personal things, vanquished once road monsters not reappear unless you leave the game, is a very good thing because depending on what you seek can choose to continue killing or simply continue rapidly. Other important data that mention is that at a party either with your summons, followers or other real players whenever you collect balloons of life these heal all (prevents individual) either you must choose whom healthy because spells are for everyone. Anyway, I have so many good things to say regarding the game could continue writing for hours. I don't have any critical refusal to do, just wait to take out the expansion &#34;Reaper of Souls&#34; also for platforms such as XBOX and PS.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2014"}

COD4 is the best online Multiplayer game bar none.","reviewText":"This is a review about the multiplayer. After all this is why most of us bought this game. After having been a part of the Beta Test on the 360 I can tell you that this is without a doubt the best multiplayer experience I've ever had on any console be it 360, PC or PS3. It's fantastic folks and it's the reason multiplayer was invented so we could get games like this.First the basics. This is a military shooter. But where this stands apart from all the shooters out on the market right now is that it's one of the first to take the battlefield into the Middle East and modern day hence it's name. This is something a lot of us have longed for. No longer are we fighting Nazis we are now fighting Terrorists. And the game is better for it. Not that I did not enjoy the WWII epics that have come down the pike but this is without a doubt a refreshing change of pace and really amps up the magnitude of intensity and really puts a refreshing spin on the series.The graphics. You will be hard pressed to find a better looking FPS right now except per say Bioshock. But we are talking about realism and a military shooter here and this is where Call Of Duty 4 really just explodes with eye candy. You will feel like you are in the locations you are fighting. This is the best looking game I've seen period when it comes to realism. Infinity Ward did a bang up job and your jaw will be on the floor.The single player mission is no walk in the park either. Play it on Veteran. While this is a great aspect to the game it's short lived and that's OK. Think of the single player experience as your basic training for the multiplayer. It's worth playing through and the story is really tight.The bottom line is that multi console owners can rejoice because there is a game across the board that shines on any of the systems you own and this is without a doubt one of the best games for the dollar. Don't even fret about picking this up if you are into FPS as this is one of the best ones to date and has raised the bar on what a good military FPS is all about.Enjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2007"}

They still find a way to bring some fresh and new thing to the series.  Myself i found New Super Mario Bros.  to be very good and while there were a couple points in the game that i wasnt really fond of.  It in no way detracts from the overall fun of the game.  With a lot of the old staple enemies back for another round, Bowser (obviousl), his son (little annoying thing), goombas and various other enemies that most SMB fans will know from sight.  What i like about this one in particular is how each of the worlds are different and this requires you to alter your game play.  Like on the ice world you can't go flying through the stages and expect to make it through in one piece.  While on the stage with the volcano erupting around you and rocks flying in the air destroying any and everything.  You have to move quickly while avoiding or dispatching the enemies that are there as well.  Which isnt hard in of itself but these enemies are bombs so if they get lit by the crashing rocks.  They ignite and will run your way to bomb the mess outta you and take you out depending on whether you pay attention to them of course.Also each of the different worlds has various areas that you need to have a certain number of stars to access.  Like one where you can get extra items and another where you can get a mad number of extra lives (my favorite).  You pay the star toll (5) and get access to it.  You go in and there you have six blocks that get scrambled around.  Each one of the blocks has either an extra life, a times 3 which gives you three, a times 2 which doubles your extra lives that you can get and the one you want to avoid.  The bowser block that stops your run right there...you still get what you collected before hitting that block.  But if you didnt get anything then its over and the area disappears from the map.  Luckily you can save before going in there (for those that dont like the outcome) and can reset.  I don't myself but its up to you.There are eight worlds to explore throughout the game.  You don't have to access all the worlds in order to finish the game.  There were a couple worlds that i didnt even go to.  It's pretty much up to as far as what you want to go through or not.  I would advise going through them all if only to gain more lives (but not necessary).  Also you can always go back into the worlds that you've already beaten and play them through again however many times you want to.  Also a good way to build up your extra life total as well.  You are also able to start at the mid point of a level once you make it halfway through a level as evidenced by a mushroom flag that pops up on your screen while your playing.  So even if you die you dont have to redo all that you just accomplished.I found myself remembering back to when i first started playing Mario Bros. back in the day.  It's still that good and can't help but hope for so much more in the future whether it be on the DS, Wii or whatever other system they decide to release it on.  Because from the ending i saw it leaves things wide open for a sequel.Love it and hope for a lot more SMB in the future.  Excellent purchase for the price and its a game that you can allow your children to play as well.  There's a bit of rough stuff in the game but nothing that should keep a kid from being able to play this game.  Not that its just for kids cause that's not the case...just saying.  New Super Mario Bros. is kid friendly.  So enjoy, remember when and have a blast SMB will take you there and back again...over and over!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2007"}

This game is almost like an action movie the whole entire time, this game can actually beat a lot of hollywood movies coming out these days.The game itself is very well done, pretty much everything about this game is incredible. The graphics are the best I've ever seen, the water effects especially are so realisetic that it seems unreal. The gameplay is very well done, it is somewhat similar to Gears of Wars duck n cover gunplay but this is actually a little less smoother than Gears in my opinion. The platforming in this game is three timeas as better as Tomb raider, it is more challenging, better paced and more fun. The voice acting is very very well done, I never heard of any of these people but they seem professional, It is very natural and the humor is funny as well.Now that there is a lot of good there are some things that I didn't like, one is that the game is pretty short, you could literally beat the game in less than 7 hours but I doubt it because you reall want to watch the cutscenes because it is interesting and intuitive. I also which there was some type of multiplayer, I could easily imagine multiplayer for this game, the developers could have thought of this the first second they knew it would become a shooter. The last thing is that there isn't much replay value to this game after you beat it, there are treasues to collect but you don't unlock anything from getting them so whats the point.OTHER THAN THAT THIS GAME IS A MUST BUY FOR ALL PS3 OWNERS TRUST ME YOU WON'T GET DISSAPOINTED.Graphics - 10/10Gameplay - 9/10Sound - 10/10Story - 10/10Longevity - 7/10Overall - 9/10 MUST BUY!!!!!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2007"}

{"product_name":"B001TOQ8JS","reviewerName":"Rorke Haining","summary":"Fantastic content, sub-par gameplay","reviewText":"I'm a middle-aged male, a huge fan of the Beatles, and also a huge fan of video games.  However, I have never been particularly interested in rhythm or music games -- I mostly prefer puzzle games, strategy, platform, adventure, RPG, that kind of thing.When I heard that Harmonix would be releasing a Beatles version of Rock Band, and that the existing musical instruments (peripherals) would be compatible with it, I bit the bullet and got a full set of Rock Band 2.  Though RB will never be one of my favorite games, I could definitely understand the appeal and did find myself enjoying it a great deal.You can see where this is going.  My expectations for The Beatles:  Rock Band were through the roof.  And in many ways, the game delivers.  I'm particularly impressed with the content.  The songs are very well done and a complete blast to play and sing.  (In fact, I'm tempted to buy a mic stand so I can \"voxtar\" -- play guitar and sing at the same time.)  The associated music videos are superb and stylistically similar to past Beatles videos.  (In particular, the videos look a lot like the movie Yellow Submarine.)  The library is definitely on the small side (~45 songs) so you won't be able to find all your favorite Beatles hits yet, but I don't hold that against the game; the content that is available is extremely well done, and I expected to pay a lot more for downloadable content as it becomes available.  (And, yes, I'll definitely be doing that.)Another excellent aspect is the welcome addition of harmonies.  Multiple microphones can be used to sing multiple harmonizing parts, each with their own lyrics if the song calls for them.  This is a lot of fun, but might have been more challenging had the game insisted that one mic be used for one voice track.  As it is, if you're off on one voice track, the game might judge you against a neighboring harmony instead.  The upshot is that, for better or worse, you can sound horrible and still score well.  :^)However, the gameplay of this title is simply lacking.  There's nothing to *do*, especially if you're used to and enjoy the campaign aspects of Rock Band.  You don't make characters and customize hairstyles, clothes, etc.  In fact, you don't even choose to play as one of the real Beatles -- there's no concept of selecting a character at all.  You don't hire a manager.  You don't travel the globe to open up new venues (at least not in the same interesting way as Rock Band).  You don't rack up money, fame, or fans.  There's barely anything to unlock, and the things you do unlock (e.g. historical photos) aren't used in the game at all.  There's nothing to do over and above simply playing the songs.  The gameplay is so flat as to be almost monotonous.  I expected so much more.  How about having an adventure campaign system where you interact with famous and semi-famous people from the Beatles era?  How about travelling to India to study under a guru?  Or at least winning fans and having the fan level affect the videos as you play a song, with more screaming, teary-eyed women the more famous you get?Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase, and love playing and singing the songs.  It's also a great game in a party setting with fellow Beatles fans.  But if you're not a huge fan of the Beatles and are looking at this from a single-player gaming perspective, try other rhythm/music games instead.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2009"}

Roman","summary":"LittleBigProblems.","reviewText":"I wanted to like this game. It was sold out everywhere for the longest time, to the point where I was almost buying into the hype that this was -the- title to have for the ps3. The demo was really cool, but I could only play that over and over so many times. When I finally got the game, everything rocked. I was having fun, enjoyed dressing up Sackboy in the vast variety of costumes, and getting to play with other people online in story and user-created levels was a smooth experience.All of that fun lasted about 2 hours.The tagline for LittleBigPlanet is 'Fun shall overcome', and I was hoping that it'd live up to that phrase. It certainly has all the production values in it to be a great game, and you can tell the developers put tons of time and effort into everything. I really can't say I've played any other game with this much attention to level design and trying to make things different with gameplay. Unfortunately, they didn't seem to put enough time into control. And I know a lot of other people are in the same boat as me, but tend to overlook that and just go on about the positives without bringing up the key negatives.The story's simple, though there really isn't one. You control Sackboy, playing through LittleBigPlanet, a land where everyone's imagination collects and runs wild. You guide him through various levels, usually with the key being to make it from the beginng to end, though some levels have different tasks and objectives. One level might have you reunite a baby animal with its mother, while another has you driving around to get a new, better car. Gameplay is mostly platforming with a few new twists. There are three different layers you can run on (background, foreground and middleground), so if something's in your way on one layer, you can just jump to a different one and bypass it. There are prize and point bubbles found in each level that up your score or give you new stickers and objects you can use to decorate the levels with, and new costumes as well.Again, this game has everything that I'd love to play. But the big problems for me, were the controls for Sackboy. First, I feel this should've used the d-pad and not the analog stick. Since it plays like a 2D platformer, using the analog stick felt weird to me. Instead, the d-pad is used to change Sackboy's facial expressions. It's a cute addition but they didn't have to do that- it could've been assigned to another option on the menu. Sackboy really got on my nerves though, when it came to jumping. When you jump, Sackboy suddenly turns floaty, and you control yourself in the air before you come down. It feels like you're in space half the time. I never felt like I was getting better at playing the game because of how the physics work. It didn't help that you only have 4 'lives' per section in a level (there are mini-checkpoints scattered through each stage) and once you lose them all, you have to start over from the beginning. There also isn't much to the levels themselves. While I said the objectives have some variety, progressing through levels usually comes down to 'drag this to this spot' and 'hold onto this and swing over here'. Something I also would've liked was for you to be able to change how Sackboy plays. You can already dress him up how you want, why not make the different outfits or their pieces make him do different things? Being able to jump higher would've been a huge help. I know they were probably trying to make the gameplay as simple as possible, like an old school platformer, but old school platformers had precise jumping for the most part.What the game really comes down to is the level creation. You can create damn near anything you want to. Whenever I go online, there's always a dozen or so levels that floor me. One I've seen was based on South Park, and had all the main characters as people you can talk to in order to find out what to do next, and they looked -just- like their animated counterparts. If you're the kind of person who likes customization features in games, LittleBigPlanet is for you. You can spend hours upon hours just creating 1/4 of a level. And get this- there's a steady flow of new objects that you can buy online. The most recent one was based on Pirates of the Caribbean.Visually, LittleBigPlanet looks very good. It doesn't push the ps3 to its limits by any means, but a lot of the levels are just plain beautiful, and I love the art direction. The calavera/Dia de los Muertos wedding levels really stood out the most and I applaud those who worked on them. There wasn't any slowdown I experienced while playing the main game, but it happens sometimes while playing online due to loading and other players popping in and out. The music for the game is equally good with as much variety as the Jet Set Radio games. Some levels have peaceful, happy music while others have rockin' tracks or Latin dance. Sadly, my copy was the censored version, where one level (Swingin' Safari) has just the music and all the lyrics removed from the song (Tapha Niang by Toumani Diabat&eacute;) because two verses were quotes from the Qur'an. Rather than just taking out those two lyrics, ALL the lyrics were taken out from the song. If you haven't heard it yet, check it out- it's a very good song.There are a lot of better platformers out there, and it hurts me to say that about a game this cute and well-made. But I was having fun infrequently, and most levels were more irritating than they were challenging. Had the physics for even just jumping been improved, this would at least be a 4 star game. But again, if you like games that you can customize the bejesus out of, look no further than LittleBigPlanet.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2010"}

I've had a ton of fun on Mario Kart Wii and its always interesting for me to go back in the past a little bit to see how the games have progressed.First off, Super Circuit is fun.  It's a perfect portable game. The tracks are not so long as to take up too much time, yet they are long enough to not feel too cheap and tacked on for the sake of putting a Mario Kart game out.  There is a nice selection of tracks to start the game off that each require it's own type of skill to master.  Sure, as always, there is a track or two that sometimes feels unnecessarily frustrating, but the fun you have on the other tracks more than make up for it.  Once you get the hang of sliding around corners, using the jump button to control those turns and coming out of them with a nice little boost to shoot you ahead of your opponents, you'll be having all kinds of great fun.There are a few different modes to choose from.  You can of course go for the classic Grand Prix mode with 50, 100, or 150ccs and test your mettle against your computer foes (I hate Peach). There is the Time Trial mode in which you can learn to master the tracks with no fear of being rear ended with a dreaded red turtle shell at the finish line, and then there is the Quick Run, in which you can simply load up any track you want and race against the CPU without worrying about doing an entire Cup.  Unfortunately, you need another person with a Gameboy Advance and a connector cable to play Multiplayer and since I don't have that option, I can't comment on it.  All I know is that I've heard that it is better if the other person were to have their own Super Circuit cart as well.  You can play with only one game and a connector cable if you wish, but it will limit your character selection.Super Circuit also harkens the return of the coins from Super Mario Kart, which means that the outcome of the race will rely on skill as much as it does luck.  Whereas the newest incarnations of the Mario Kart franchise usually require an big chunk of luck (you tend to get punished for being good), you will have to collect as many coins as you can to help your speed and to keep you from spinning out each time you get hit, which will happen when you run out of coins.  Collecting coins also brings up another cool thing about the game; if you collect 100 coins in each cup after getting gold in it, it will unlock that cup from the original Super Mario Kart.  So, when all is said and done, you have the potential for unlocking another five cups for a grand total of 40 tracks to race.  Not too shabby for a portable racing game.Honestly, I found this game to be more fun than I expected.  It's absolutely perfect for what it's intended for.  When you are out and about and have your Gameboy Advance (or DS or 3DS) with you, it's great for playing bite sized chunks at a time.  It takes very little time to compete in a cup and be done with it if that is what you wish.  On the other hand, there are enough tracks and it is enough fun that you could sit in your living room or on a road trip and play it for hours.  I recommend this game heartily for those that are fans of the Kart.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2012"}

As you know, this is a portable game.  This is the only game that is too dark to play, in many cases.  As most hand held games are required to play, in many different \"dark\" and \"light\" conditions, if the game is too dark, it is impossible to play.  One major reason for this, is the type of game it its.  A \"fast\" racer.  If the brightness drops on a platformer or golf game, for a second or two, no big deal.  But when you're in the middle of a tunnel, and the light is not quite right, than, bam, you hit the siderails and you're dead in the water.  This game is not quite a sim, but even an arcade game needs a 'breather' and you don't get it, knowing your darkness problems.Playing this game, brings back memories of the original GBA, with no backlight.  Remember that?  Yeah, it sucked.  Fortunately, this game system has a backlight, but its not quite enough.  I will say this:  I really love this game!

{"product_name":"B002BSA1MQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Sam F.","summary":"A Fun Game with Caveats","reviewText":"Let me preface this review by saying I have never played or seen the original Crysis, so I entered this game mostly with a blank slate, my expectations informed only by the rave reviews this game had garnered thus far. I have completed the campaign and played a handful of hours of multiplayer, and the following is my opinion based on this experience.Graphics: 10/10 - Everyone knew this game would have incredible graphics, as indicated by the visual prowess of its predecessor and the demos made by the cutting edge engine powering Crysis 2. On this front, the game does not disappoint. The image of an increasingly destroyed New York City are made all the more stunning by the realistic graphics of both landscape, people, and more difficult elements like fire and water. In my opinion, the visuals are definitely the best selling point for this game.Story: 5/10 - I have read a lot of reviews so far that say this game has a great story, and having beaten the campaign, watched all the cut-scenes, and read all the background, I can safely plead confusion. This game does not have a bad story so much as little story. There are definitely the seeds of a gripping tale present in this game, but the player is given almost no background information as to what is happening to the world around him. I will not give away the plot here, as no one likes a spoiler. However, it is not hard to do this, as there is honestly not much to give away. The best analogy I can draw is that, throughout the game, I felt something like Anakin Skywalker is Star Wars Episode I; critical to the developing story, but having little say in the unfolding events. I felt tossed and ordered about by those who knew more than I did, and although I did eventually fly into and destroy that weird donut-shaped ship above Naboo, it was largely by accident, and the gravity of the events going on around me were largely above my understanding. The little story that is present is very intriguing, and I could only wish they had explored it more.Gameplay: 6/10 - There are several aspects of the gameplay that are well-exectuted. The nanosuit's various abilities - armor, stealth, speed, strength - allow for many approaches to each combat scenario. I personally largely preferred the stealth tactics, but watched my roommate barrel into situations with full armor with often-equal success. The suit's visor allows for analysis of each tactical situation before one enters it, and the suit upgrades lets one further customize how to approach the game. The weapons and attachments available, although not the most comprehensive among first person shooters, are certainly not restrictive. Combat is pretty intense, but unfortunately there isn't much variance in the enemies and situations one is presented. Another notable problem with the gameplay is the A.I., which is less than intelligent at many times. This goes for all classes of enemies and friends, which on several occasions would end up standing still or moving in place for indeterminate periods of time, seemingly oblivious to the gunfire going on around them. Even shooting such an enemy in the torso would often not snap them out of their confusion. Friendly soldiers are unhelpful at best, especially when attempting to defend them from a coming assault.Multiplayer: 6/10 - It is very difficult for me to describe what I find unappealing about the Crysis 2 multiplayer, as it is largely a personal feeling issue. All of the same game elements found in the single player exist in the multiplayer, sans the artificial stupidity. The class customization is pretty good, although generally inferior to Call of Duty in my opinion. I would have to say that the qualitative feel of this multiplayer just isn't polished. Combat does not feel as realistic or involved as those found in the Halo and Modern Warfare series. I find it very difficult to tell by feel whether a set number of shots will kill a person, especially with the variable of armor thrown in the mix.Overall - 6/10 - Lest the reader feel I am being overly critical, I still feel this game is rather enjoyable, and worthy of 3 stars out of 5. However, I just want to temper what I feel may be overenthusiastic reviews by fans with a more reserved opinion.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2011"}

Army of Two has an appealing idea: the Aggro system.The game is designed to be played with a human partner co-op, as the title suggests. The Aggro meter is basically an aggression meter. Whoever has the most Aggro (is doing the most damage, firing off the most rounds, etc.) will draw the enemy fire. This means you can coordinate attacks with your friend; one draws the fire while the other can sneak around and take everybody out. The Aggro system sounds like a good idea, and it is...the problem is that everything surrounding the Aggro style of play is flawed.The gameplay itself is frustrating. Your accuracy while on the move is terrible...meanwhile enemies have no problems with their accuracy from even greater distances than you. Accuracy while stationary and aiming is fine, it's just that standing still for long isn't a very healthy option. To add to this, the third-person camera often doesn't do well when you are crouching behind cover or in close quarters areas, especially when you are trying to swivel around to see if anyone is attacking you from behind.Then we have the story and characters. Salem and Rios (the two main characters) are brainless brawny idiots. Their wisecracking would be more appropriate amongst pre-teens at a skate park than two soldiers on a battlefield. And much of the story, set in the Middle East, is not handled well at all. Salem and Rios poke fun and gripe about the Army, but it is all off base and inaccurate if we are supposing this is the real-world Army their comments are targeting (which it is). There are no civilians encountered in the game...it is populated entirely by bad-guy terrorists that perpetuate certain stereotypes and preconceptions that often made me wince. There is no feel of a real world in a game that is trying to address a real-world issue.I tried playing this game with my roommate and then my brother. Both times I couldn't get past all the problems I had with the game. My brother is a much bigger fan of shooters than I, and even he lost interest. This game will be enjoyed mostly by the most hardcore shooter fans who want to check out the Aggro system...beyond that there is not a whole lot of value.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2010"}

The trio is focused on getting to the goal as fast as they can.Team Shadow is for advanced players, made up of Rouge, Omega, and Shadow, who has been brought back to life after the ARK incident in Sonic Adventure 2. They are focused on destroying lots of enemies.Team Rose is for those who are new to the Sonic franchise. Amy, Cream and Big have a shorter way to the goal than other teams.Team Chaotix reuinites the long-lost heroes from Knuckles Chaotix (Except Mighty the Armadillo. I guess they couldn't find a good formation for him).They have unique treasure hunt missions, such as \"Collect 10 hermit crabs\" or \"Collect 200 rings,\" with each level having a new challenge.Another good thing about this game is that you can collect Chaos Emeralds from special stages, as done in some of the classic Sonic games.

You need to use it 5 times in order to defeat him.We also purchased Ed, Edd, & Eddy's Mis-Ed-ventures because it was similar to Sonic Heroes, because of the 3-characters-on-one-team rule. However, in Ed, Edd, & Edddy's Mis-Ed-ventures, the characters have different moves. Also, we found it more challenging because enemies keep attacking us.

Any attempt to follow up with a sequel would be an uphill battle.  In a way, Eidos succeeded.  Invisible War is slick sci-fi action RPG.  The graphics are a tremendous update from the original, and the levels and characters offer greater interaction.  The weapons are even more customizable, allowing you to turn a pistol into a silent glass-shattering tranq gun, or refit your Uzi to spew explosive shrapnel and use half the ammo.However, while some aspects of the gameplay have been enhanced, others have diminished.  Most notable is the storyline.  While Deus Ex put forth a clear struggle of establishment vs. freedom fighters vs. secret society, Invisible War basically has you choose sides between 4 power-hungry factions, with oddly similar ideologies.  There is no \"for the good of the people\" or \"preserve the world\" faction - in the end, you will be helping to put a single person or group of people in charge of the world.However, if you go into this game looking for just an enjoyable romp, and not something to top the original, you will be in for a treat.

Thiel \"John P. Thiel\"","summary":"Pure \"Edutainment\": Fun and Educational for my non English speaking wife from Japan.","reviewText":"This is probably one of the more unique reviews of a game, but I feel it's really valuable.My wife (who is from Japan) doesn't speak more than a wee bit of English--mostly greetings and standard replies to standard questions--and as I found playing video games an excellent way to improve my Japanese when I lived in Japan, I thought my wife might benefit from an all-English game that she found fun as well rather than something targeting ESL learners.  This game has certainly fit the bill.The games I played in Japanese were mostly action games: Metal Gear, Tomb Raider, Ace Combat, Tenchu Shinobi Gaisen, et cetera.  I would read the instruction manual and some bit of the story, but that was about it--nothing I couldn't have just figured out without actually understanding the language.  This game presents a lot more in the way of language learning opportunities as part of the playing aspect rather than merely understanding the instructions, and yet it has the benefit for non-native speakers of not having a lot of dialogue--as many kids games do these days--which can really discourage someone who doesn't easily understand it.  In my wife's case, too much dialogue causes her to rely too heavily on me translating pages and pages of text that don't really have anything to do with actually playing the game--such as is the case in her all time favorite game, Animal Crossing, which we had to order the Japanese language version of eventually.For example, at some points in the game they have the player find various objects hidden in a picture, which are listed on the lower screen.  My wife loves this.  She pronounces the words to ask me what such-and-such is so she can find it, and when I'm not home she simply looks them up in the dictionary.  Though the game doesn't have the benefit of vocalizing the correct pronunciation of a word, she found some sites on the internet that do when I'm not there--and she can choose to hear the words pronounced by a woman's voice as well.The hidden objects are nicely varied too, so you don't have the standard words that anyone, in any country, with a middle school education knows in English--such as dog, cat, apple, pen, teacher, and other tedious repeats.  The objects are good, general, common objects that anyone would be familiar with regardless of country, and yet not elementary--such as \"spool of thread.\"BOTTOM LINE: My wife would not play a game if it wasn't fun (seriously, she wouldn't pick it up again if was simply educational but not actually enjoyable), and she enjoys this game not only because of the actual game play itself, but the learning aspect it represents as well.  This is a good mental exercise for native English speakers and an excellent vocabulary builder for those who aren't, or for kids who could always stand to learn more words.While I'm sure it wasn't the game designers intent to be educational, the game gets an A+ for providing an excellent learning opportunity.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2008"}

It has very nice graphics, good squad combat, good level design, and runs well if you have an upper-midrange system like mine.  And-oh yes-it's much like Medal of Honor.If you've played Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, then you should have a good idea what Call of Duty is like.  I would say that overall, though, Call of Duty is better because it doesn't have those ludicrously difficult sniper levels in Medal of Honor.  Call of Duty lets you choose the difficulty level, and the easy setting IS easy as it should be.I'm impressed with the graphics and level design in Call of Duty.  The levels are laid out in such a way as to enhance combat and allow a bit of interesting exploration.  Moreover. The levels have a lot of detail, and yet the game runs smoothly even at the highest screen resolution.Well, it'll run smoothly if your system is at least as good as mine, and my computer is configured with a 3 GHz Pentium 4, 512 MB RAM, and a 128 MB ATI Radeon 9800 Pro graphics card.  If your system is not so well endowed, then don't give up.  You could easily set the graphics settings at lower levels to get smooth frame rates.So why not five stars?  My only beef with this game is that it's rather derivative of older games.  There's not a whole lot here that other shooters haven't offered before.  But that's not too bad because Call of Duty takes what came before it and refines it.To sum it up, Call of Duty is a very good game that deserves a try from any shooter fan.

The story is a psychedelic, convoluted psychological mystery that feels downright Lynchian. So why only 2 stars?First of all, this is one of the poorest software releases I have ever seen. Out of the box (er, download) it throws runtime errors. It doesn't work with Steamworks. And for reasons I don't understand, the much-vaunted soundtrack DOESN'T PLAY. Sure, Hotline Miami is an indy game, but lots of independent games... work.Combat is also a little flat. Every attack by you or enemies is an instant kill, which means EVERY fight comes down to twitch-pounding the attack key at just the right time, a fraction of a second before the nearest enemy does so. Every fight is the same, and after a short time combat becomes so wearying and dull that following the compelling story isn't a worthwhile incentive to keep playing.In a world that contains such budget-priced wonders as Terraria, Bastion, Minecraft, and any number of others, there is just no good reason to waste time on this admittedly interesting failure.UPDATEThe game has been patched and now works properly. I'm still not a fan, but I'll rate it up; it does what it should now.

He is equipped with an arsenal of powerful weapons such as dual blaster pistols, a flamethrower, missiles, and a distinctive jet pack.","reviewerName":"Mark Hills \"Nobody gets me, I'm the wind, baby!\"","summary":"Let's see what she can do...","reviewText":"... my first title I grabbed Bounty Hunter by Lucas Arts and because I didn't see Grand Tourismo 3 on another rack. As a dedicated PC Gamer, I got a PS2 largely because there are games I want, but just aren't available for the PC. I'm pretty happy with Bounty Hunter, which seems to be a cross between Tomb Raider and Jedi Knight. First and foremost, it is a well put together game with very high production values that we have come to expect for Lucas Arts. CGI cut scenes were made by Industrial Light and Magic and it stars Temuera Morrison, who played Jango Fett in Attack of the Clones and Clancy Brown, (the Kurgan in Highlander), as the evil Montross.Bounty Hunter also ties beautifully into the pre-history of Attack of the Clones, taking place ten years before the film and lends itself splendidly to filling in not only Fett's back story, but also that of Count Dooku. Basically Fett is working to crack a ring of smugglers and drug runners who are producing a highly addictive form of the death stick drug produced by a cult known as the Bando Gora, led by a former Jedi, Komari Vosa, who seems to have been at one point a pupil of Dooku. The wily count then hires both Jango and his rival, Montross, pitting them against one and other to see who can be the first to kill her. The winner will receive five-million Republic credits and a chance at immortality. Dooku, aka Tyranus, also plans to offer the winner a sizable sum if they will be cloned to create an army for the Republic.Unlike Boba Fett, who if you follow only the films, appeared to be nothing by a 2nd rate loser who was killed by a blind Han Solo, the Bounty Hunter game gives us tremendous insight into Jango, his history and his motivations. It takes the nutty Toydarian Rozatta to crack Jango's tougher than nails exterior and convinces him to live for something more than just hunting down people and the huge sums of money he earns from it. It is this that causes Jango to ask Tyranus for an unaltered clone- Boba Fett. Jango is a badass- he's a killer and very dangerous, but there is more to him than a simple cardboard cut out his son (if you ignore the EU) would become.Game play is pretty basic, lots of running around, jumping and shooting as Jango goes after his marks. I still haven't gotten the hang of the PS2 controls and guiding the characters as I'm more used to keyboards and mice, something I have a feeling many of the PS2 games like Bounty Hunter scream for. Jango can cling to ledges, punch and kick quite effectively, and collects a wonderful array of weapons and gear besides his standard Westar-34 blaster pistols. I suggest that once you get the back pack missiles you practice with them as much as you can, because they're hard to direct without, say, killing yourself. Collecting bounties is kinda cute- simply target people, see if they show up as having a price on their heads, zap them with your whip cord tangler then simply press the triangle button and you're done! Money is added to your running score and the more you collect the more pages of concept art you get access to. Using the flame thrower on people is quite funny as at first they run around waving their arms in the air while on fire, then they stop, drop and roll.Graphics are a mixed bag of low to medium resolution textures, but it's all very colorful, especially on Coruscant. Some of the in-game constructs, especially space craft, take a hit in the detail as the artists drop polys and more elaborate textures. However, they're still good enough to get the point across. I would have preferred this game to be on the PC in order to have better graphics and control, as well as in the first person rather than third, (I have played so many of these types of games that I get tired of looking at the backs of characters). What carries this game is its excellent story, occasional bouts of humor and thumb wrenching game play, that while frustrating at times, never stops being fun. As my first PS2 game, I'm pretty happy with it and I think you will be, too.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2002"}

Rhodes","summary":"Good but can't rekindle the magic of Secret of Mana","reviewText":"With the GBA receiving lots of SNES remakes, this one is actually a remake of a classic GB game, Final Fantasy Adventure.  This game shines brightly but a few minor things bring it down a notch at times.  While Swrrd of Mana is a great game to play, it can't capture the magic f what was \"Secret of Mana\" on the SNES.The graphics on Sword of Mana are visually striking!  Very colorful and vividly smooth make it feel like a nice Super Nintendo game.  However, a problem with the graphics is that we're sometimes faced with slow down, and sometimes even graphical glitches.  So while visually stunning, this part of the graphics can sometimes get annoying.Gameplay wise, this game is pretty fun overall.  Several different weapons to choose from that make the experience even better.  It isn't much different from Secret of Mana really.  The battle engine is the same real time based.  What stands out is the different sort of attacks you can pull off.  A slash, jab or bash, and so it's pretty fun.  The problem with it however is that you have a three combo attack that is sometimes hard to pull off.  Even expert players will sometimes find this hard  at times.  You've got enemies that even when the attack connects they take no damage.  A lot of the time the enemies will actually dodge your attacks.  After a while this becomes a little annoying.The other part about the gameplay, you control one of two characters out to stop the Dark Lord from destroying those in tune with the power of Mana.  As a member of the Mana tribe and a warrior you must stop the Dark Lord.  You can control one of the two characters at a time.  You can switch between the two from time to time and the game incorporates the AI for the character you're not using.  The problem with this is that unlike Secret of Mana you're AI characters do much stupider things.  Many a time the character being controlled by AI will cast spells like crazy or get themselves killed somehow.  They fight senseless and its a hassle to get them to move on in an area.  For what it's worth though you can use them to take a lot of the damage for you, and you can adjust their actions that they do much like in Secret of Mana.From time to time your weapons will level up, but battling is actually different from Secret of Mana in some ways.  While weapons level up just fine, Secret of Mana had a power gauge at the bottom that when it said 100% you struck the enemy for maximum damage. In this that gauge is gone.  Now you attack and kill enemies to fill up the guage at the bottom to increase the amount of damage done.  With this battling doesn't go quite as slowly as in Secret of Mana did at times.As far as music goes it's pretty bland at times.  Some points there are memorable tunes but a lot of the time they're a little bland.  The sound effects aren't anything special either since they don't sound in character with the action at times.For what it's worth Sword of Mana is actually a pretty good game. Visually striking and quite fun with a nice storyline, \"Sword of Mana\" is a pretty good game.  The graphics are a few steps above \"Secret of Mana\" but the gameplay isn't quite as good.  Still, I'd recomend this game to any RPGer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2003"}

The graphics, style and presentation are unmatched on any platform. The acting (in cutscenes)is the absolute best I've ever seen in any videogame. Characters are believable and surprisingly not over-the-top, like we normally expect in a videogame.At first I worried that it'd be a hack-slash-repeat affair, but the game changes the rules and settings perfectly in order to keep the gameplay exciting throughout the whole game. Another really cool feature is using SIXAXIS to control projectiles in flight. While it's possible to use the analog stick to do so, I highly recommend you take 5-10 minutes to learn to use motion control. Once you know how to do it, it's a lot of fun.So why not 5 stars? People already said it: too short. Normally I'd say it's a non-issue. (People seem to forget that Metal Gear Solid 3 can be completed in 5 hours, it was actually a requirement for one of the game's difficulty modes). But in case of Heavenly Sword, there's absolutely nothing else to do when the game is finished.

Squires \"theDrizzle\"","summary":"First impressions are exceeding my expectations","reviewText":"I realize that it's a little early to be reviewing such a complex gaming universe that is \"Fallout,\" so I'll just let you know what my first impressions are and how this compares to the last game so far. Hopefully I can help someone to make a decision to purchase or not purchase this game.First of all, if you didn't like Fallout 3, don't buy this game. It's essentially the same game in a different place. That's not to say that it doesn't have a long list of improvements and it's own innovations, but they certainly kept the same formula from Fallout 3, so if you hated that, you're probably not going to enjoy this.Let's talk about the improvements over the last game:1) Graphics are improved; still not great compared to some of the other games out there, but considering the massive interactive environment given to you, they're pretty impressive. And they do seem to be substantially better than the last game (glitches are prevalent though...hopefully a patch will alleviate that issue soon. I haven't had any glitches freeze the game or ruin anything for me yet, so they're minor in my opinion).2) Weapon systems are improved in my opinion. I like the new aiming system and weapons. I think that they captured something closer to COD than before, and that aint a bad thing.3) Character interaction and dialogue are great. They really went all out in this one. I couldn't stop laughing at some of the voice work, and it's amazing how many people have a ton of information. You'll find some old man hidden in a discrete building who happens to know the meaning of all existence....I'm exaggerating of course, but there is some crazy information out there for you to find that you wouldn't expect.4) Environment interaction is really great. If you see it, you can probably destroy it or kill it. I like the idea that you can destroy anyone who stands in your way or just plain \"pisses you off.\" That's not to say that there won't be serious consequences for you actions, but if you want to do it, you can.Some other notes:I think that the difficulty level is surprisingly hard. I don't remember having much of a challenge with the last game, but now I'm playing on \"medium\" and getting killed quite a bit. I guess you could say I'm a newb; of course I did play the last game a lot and I play other FPS and RPG games, but I'm finding it pretty hard. Then again, I chose to invest my upgrades in science and intellect, so if you have a character designed as a \"warrior\" you may have an easier time early on.Save often! The auto save feature will screw you again and again. The game doesn't seem to save in the right places; it either saves too early before you die or it saves right when you're in a bad situation. I walked into a house and decided to steal a pack of smokes and beat an old man to death....I guess I was having a bad day. Anyways, the towns fold weren't having it, and I got my ass handed to me by some rangers. Of course, the auto save was right when they started shooting at me, so there was nothing I could do except go back to my last save.All in all, so far this game seems to have the same winning formula that I loved about Fallout 3, with a long list of small and large improvements.If you enjoyed FO3, you'll want to pick this up as soon as you can","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2010"}

My only gripe for the game is the use of QTEs which can be frustrating as well as sequences where you have to avoid obstacles you can barely see with minimal control (such as being carried by a current).  Those events/sequences can be annoying but don't detract much from the overall experience.

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"sporkdude \"sporkdude\"","summary":"A First Class Shooter, but is it Worth the Hype?","reviewText":"Before this game, the Resident Evil series never appealed to me.  Static camera angles and clunky controls dominated the early games, and those horrible movies sure didn't endear me to this brand.  So Capcom decided to do something about it.  They did the only thing that could bring Resident Evil back to the forefront of video games, they created a darn good game.Now the hype makes it seems like the game that can save the Gamecube and redefine gaming forever.  Uhh, I don't think so.  Not to say that this isn't a great game, but if you're looking for one of those  game changing experiences that rarely occurs, like a Grand Theft Auto 3, ICO, or GoldenEye on the N64, it's not going to happen.  While this is not a revolutionary game, it's the height of evolutionary gaming.  It's probably one of the finest games of the current generation of consoles.  The possible game of the year hype is definitely warranted.So, this game is a third person over the shoulder survivor horror action game.  This pretty much means that the camera angle is set over the shoulder of the main character, and you fight diseased villagers or monsters in a terrifying environment.In terms of the looks, it's one of the finest games out there.  I highly advice an S-video output on your gamecube.  However, the screen shots that I often see make this game look a little too good, so if you base your expectations on those screen shots like I did, be prepared to be initially disappointed.  The outdoor missions in the beginning will look pixelated and unrefined.  Once you hit the castle though, the background graphics are amazing.  The atmosphere is dark, and haunting, but the graphics are amazingly smooth.  The background is not it though.  The main character, the enemies, and the girl  you escort around are extremely detailed and the finest I have ever seen.  In addition, there are a few cinematics, but they don't overwhelm you or ruin the flow of the game.  They integrate well and don't detract from the game.This also brings up sound.  This is some of the best use of sound ever.  The music builds up tension and at certain points makes you very anxious.  The sound is crucial to gameplay, as you need to listen for villagers yelling at each other and listen to the girl you're escorting when she screams for help.  The music is ambient, and the sound effects add to the tension and are also useful to the gameplay.Speaking of gameplay; it's excellent.  This is more of an action game than a survival horror game, which is good.  Unlike the Silent Hill games, this will not bore you to death.  You face a lot of enemies and with limited ammo - that is ninety percent of this game - killing enemies.  This is not like a first person shooter where one shot kills a whole bunch of people though.  You'll have to be creative and think when killing the enemies.  If an enemy is carrying dynamite, you can shoot him down after he lights the fuse in order for the dynamite to explode and kill anyone around him.  You'll shoot people in the legs in order to slow them down so you don't get overwhelmed.  You'll shoot weapons out of enemies hands or in mid air.  You'll learn to use the certain weapons when absolutely necessary, and you can upgrade or buy new weapons when needed.Another aspect of the gameplay is the fact that for about one third of the game, you'll escort a girl.  I know what you're thinking - an escort mission - no!  Well, this is by far the best non playable character AI's ever.  She does not jump in front of you when shooting, she doesn't needlessly run into enemies and die, you can heal her, and she tell you when she needs help.  This is the finest escort mission around.Finally, this game is really balanced and fair.  By exploring every nook and cranny and saving ammo, the latter missions are not annoying like many other games out there.  It's pretty well balanced, fun to play, and you were never lost and rarely stuck.Of course, this game is not all rosy.  First off, the most apparent thing is that you cannot move your legs and shoot at the same time.  You are stationary when shooting.  It's very similar to Metroid Prime, which I couldn't get into.  I realize that it's sort of a way to maximize graphics by limiting movement, but it's very weird for someone who plays first person shooters on consoles.  Fortunately, by the second chapter, I was used to, but it still never felt right.Secondly, this game is more about ammo saving than fighting.  While good in some aspects, I was often left wondering if I was wasting of saving ammo, which made me the first half of the game less fun than it should have been.Thirdly, this game is long and tough.  Many times you'll enter a room just to see twenty people running at you.  You will say \"You've got to be kidding me\" to yourself a lot.  It's about six chapters, but it took me over 30 hours to complete.Fourthly, the stationary shooting, the pixelated outdoor missions, limited ammo, and weak weapons in the beginning made it pretty difficult, boring and frustrating in the beginning.  I almost gave up on it.  Fortunately I continued to see how good the game was.Finally, there were some minor irritations.  Some bosses were hard and I had to look at guides to figure out how to beat them.  Also, you cannot save any time you want.  While there are many checkpoints, I often killed all the enemies in a room and walked a long way back to a savepoint because there was a significant chance I would die from the next group of enemies.  It greatly ruined the flow in the beginning of the game.  Also, close action fighting which involved knives, kicks and supplexes were implemented in a weird way that was vastly unintuitive and caused me to lose a lot of health.  It's also worth noting that many cutscenes require you to press buttons rapidly or quickly, which is just lame.  Lastly, while the game was intense, it wasn't that scary.The one major thing this game was missing was some type of Cooperative mission.  This is a game that would be flat out amazing in co-op.So the question is, is it worth buying.  Yes?  Is it worth buying a gamecube for?  Maybe.  The gamecube version will most likely look better than the PS2 version, but probably not that much.  The main problem is that you'll have to wait a long time for the PS2 version to come out.  So, if you've got the money and want to play it right now, then buy Gamecube with Resident Evil.Pros:Great atmosphereSmart AIDetailed EnemiesBest use of soundAddictiveBalancedIntegrated cinematics.Lot of tension.Cons:Limited AmmoNo movement while shootingYou will die a lotCan't save any time you wantKnifing, kicking and supplexing is not intuitiveBosses are a bit toughA little too longNot really scaryNeed to tap buttons during cutscenesNo co-op, multiplayer.Length: 30 hoursDifficulty Level: MediumFrustration Level: Medium","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000M17AVO","description":"Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc Remote","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Great Start but Missing Some Features","reviewText":"Most PS3 owners enjoy not only the gaming abilities of their system, but also the built in Blu-Ray DVD player. The Sony remote control accessory lets you play those movies with great ease.The remote combines the regular buttons of our other DVD players with the funky look of the PS3. You have a red, green, blue and yellow button - labelled with their color names! You also get a circle, X, square and triangle to do a few things like brinigng up the options and back choices.The main buttons - play, stop, forward, back - are laid out reasonably nicely at the bottom of the remote with large buttons. There are small buttons up on top for the number keys, and a very tiny eject button.Missing completely is a power button!! You have to hit the PS button in the center and go through the regular PS3 menus to get the power to turn off. In fact, while I was writing this review, I accidentally hit a button on the remote and the PS3 turned on. We were watching regular TV, so now I have to wait until our show is over, switch over to the PS3 and use the buttons to turn the system back off again. That doesn't make much sense at all to me.Also, on our Oppo DVD remote, the buttons glow which makes it REALLY nice to use in the dark or dim light that most people watch movies in. This unit is completely black with black buttons. This makes it pretty much useless in low light conditions until you memorize all of the button locations. You would think by now that remote control makers would have their buttons backlit or at least glow-in-the-dark to handle this.The unit takes two AA batteries which makes it a bit heavy, but certainly within the normal range of remotes.It's easy enough to sync up the remote with the PS3. It's bluetooth powered, so you go into the PS3 menu and use the options there to indicate you have a new remote. Note that the base level PS3 will not handle this - you have to have a connection to the internet from your PS3 and run an update routine. If you don't have an internet connection for your PS3, you have to create an update CD on your PC to do this update.Well recommended - but it really could be much better to be great.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2007"}

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Cherrin Kim","summary":"Eh.","reviewText":"I liked the game at first.

I can't say how many times I've tried, 10, 20 times?Yes, I suck at them. Yes, it's my fault. But let me warn you, it's not my fault that the game isn't very sensitive to my stops.

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Ray-Review","summary":"Where it all Began.............","reviewText":"This is where it all began, since Kingdom Hearts 2 came out verybody that hasen't played the original is wandering how all of this developed.

But then I got it for my brothers birthday and Since I found out there were Final Fantasy Characters in It I gave this RPG a try. And I found to love it. The main thing that attract my attention was the Theme Song in the beginning of the game \"Simple & Clean\" by Utada Hikaru, and then basically went off from there. Although I disliked the Disney levels Like the Alice in Wonderland and The little Mermaid, I enjoyed the story. I like the balance between light and dark moments in the game and to think the voice actor for Sora (the main character) is Haley Joal Osment. But I really Enjoyed the game, I finish the whole thing at Level 100, defeating the hardest boss in the game Sepheroth (from Final Fantasy VII), obtained the strongest weapons in the game-Ultima Weapon(Keyblade)Save the Queen(Magic Staff) & Save the King(Shield) and also unlocking the secret(alternate) ending which reveals Kngdom Hearts 2 which just came out a couple of days ago.

{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

{"product_name":"B000FRS9II","reviewerName":"Barry Robinson","summary":"Gears - The 360's First Killer App","reviewText":"I recieved Gears of War for Christmas and have to say that it's visuals are absolutely second to none and are the first thing your likely to notice about this title. We're talking visuals quite a few steps ahead of the pack, and the animations that they support are superb, everything from the characters to the explosions, to the game's oh so destructable world. I havent completely finished the game but felt compelled to throw in my two cents now to maybe influence holiday buying decisions for you late shoppers out there, people who maybe received say 60 dollers as a gift and is wondering how to spend it. Well, quite frankly, you couldnt spend it on a better game. Gears of War does for the 360 what The Legend of Zelda did for the N64, or what Halo did for the original Xbox. It will become one of those games that defines the system, or at least for a long, long while. Apart from the outstanding visuals (either in high-def or not) gamers will be pleased to find one heck of a sound design. The sounds of the Locust crying out as your chainsaw rips through them is one of the most satasfying things i've heard in recent gaming. The musical score is also to be highly noted, it is beautiful in a creepy kinda way and i hear it in my head between playing stints. The game controls really tight for the most part. Using a \"one button does all\" approach, the A button will become your best friend...yes even moreso than the right trigger. It allows you to take cover, barrle roll, all sorts of things, depending on the context. Basically it is your protection from becoming a thousand tiny pieces in a pool of blood. Which takes me to my next point. This earns its M rating with some pretty graphic violence. It's not quite as heavy as Dead Rising, but its certainly bloodier than any of the Halo games. The language  on the other hand actually isnt as heavy as i thought it would be. No f bombs thus far, and no gd's. But like I said, the game earns its M rating nevertheless, thanks to its heavy gore. Production values are high in Gears and you certainly feel the effort that went into its creation. It earns the distinction in my book as quite possibly the most polished game I've ever played. I am yet to find a glitch, or even a cheap gimick. All in all, I'd say Gears of War is a fantastic game, slightly overrated, but a fantastic game. People looking to buy just one xbox 360 game need to look no further. I recieved Call of Duty 3 too and although thats a pretty good game, this is dominating my 360.

While this version has been re-written specially for consoles, it does keep most of the original gameplay. If you haven't done this already, download the demo and see for yourselves what this is all about.- The game has 5 difficulty settings. For those of you that had trouble beating the demo - worry not. The easiest setting is extremely easy - unlike it was in the demo.- All 16 civilizations are available right from the start. You can select any of them and play through skirmish missions, Game of the Week or a set of modified skirmishes. This last one has around 10-15 'missions' where the Skirmish rules have been changed. For example - on one map there are more and tougher barbarians, on other there is no diplomacy, etc. Game of the Week is being updated every Sunday and will allow you to play against the AI, in same exact conditions as all other XBox Live players. Then - you will be able to see your rank versus other players in the world.- The version of the game that I bought includes a free 'wonders' code, to be used for downloading extra wonders. Did not try it yet, so do not know yet what is included.- Graphics are excellent - a bit cartoonish, but perfect for the gameplay. There doesn't seem to be any noticeable improvement over the graphics from the demo, so what you see in the demo is what you will get.- The Manual is excellent. Gives a lot of detail and covers all the info you need. If you play on Easiest setting, the game will also act like a Tutorial, which is helpful, if you have never played this before.The bad:- You have no control over skirmishes. Basically, all maps are randomly generated - which is great, because you never get to play the same map. However - if you want to select map size, number of players, individual difficulty for AI players - this is not possible.- I was hoping the game will have a Campaign, that you can play with your favorite Civilization. There is none. This being the case - not sure how long will it take for the fun to wear out.- There is a lot of slowdown when the camera has to pan on longer distances. Not sure why - the Xbox 360 demo did not have these issues. It's not unplayable, but it gets annoying after a while.- There isn't enough diversity between the civilizations. Each civilization has some special units, but there isn't enough of them. Most of the time, you will play with same units.Overall: if you are new to this or unsure - try the demo. Otherwise - give this game a try. Despite some minor annoyances, it's definitely worth it!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2008"}

{"product_name":"B005DVAB1Y","description":"","reviewerName":"pennywyze","summary":"Decent NG title, good game otherwise.","reviewText":"I really held off buying this game, but after trying out the Demo on Xbox Live, I was determined to try it. Here's my review.Graphics-The graphics look good, but there's a catch. In the past NG titles I played through, there was never an issue with texture pop-in or muddy textures. However, I noticed that a lot in this game; especially if you turn the brightness up. At it's default setting, it looks really good. The graphical bugs really started showing up after about the 4th or 5th level. Especially in the jungle level which could be downright brutal looking at times.I'm sure NG fans remember how good Ninja Gaiden and NG black looked, then, NG2 followed right in it's footsteps delivering excellent graphics.With that said, NG3 does offer it's graphical perks and the effects are quite flashy. There's a ton of blood in this game; but no decapitations or limb hacking. Most will complain about it, and I admit that I missed the decapitations, but for the most part, I was content with the new direction.Another issue I had with the graphics was the framerate and resolution clarity. No matter what resolution I chose, the game still had that muddy look at times while past NG had a much more crisp image with clarity.I'd compare the graphics to Microsoft's Ninja Blade; but I'd give the edge to Ninja Blade without doubt.Sound-At first, the character groans seemed cool. That is...until you hear them a million times. The bad guys death groans sound identical and it does get annoying at times. The music wasn't exactly my cup of tea and to be honest, none of the tunes are memorable in my opinion. You get the same fight music every time you fight which is reminiscent of Devil May Cry, the voice acting on the other hand is pretty good. I wasn't exactly crazy about Ryu's voice. He'd sound much better with a more &#34;gruff&#34; sound than his generic voice pattern.Meh.Gameplay-Not really a fan of it. In the past NG games, there was much more to do than simply fight wave after wave of enemy. Heck, there may be more variety in Dynasty Warriors games than this.I really didn't like the fact that it had such limited platforming sequences, lack of exploration or hidden goodies, you can't level up your weapon (instead, you're given a new weapon ever so often), and despite the fact that the demo featured 3 weapons, you only get ONE MELEE WEAPON (SWORD), a bow or some shurikens. If you check DLC, you can &#34;buy&#34; a pack of weapons...really? That was easily the worst aspect about this game.I did enjoy some of the boss battles such as the copter fight, but then there were some really dumb boss fights. For example, you'll fight a big T-Rex, that has the most predictable pattern of attacking. No matter how you amp the difficulty, this dinosaur is about as stupid as a boss can be. It will chase you and bash it's own head then fall down leaving itself open to being attacked. It can also bite you or swing it's tail, but it's primary attack would be the same charge over and over. This was such a dull boss fight that I wouldn't dare play it again.There's no Muramasa shop. In fact, after every battle, you're instantly healed based on how good you do during fights. You also have one magic attack and after it's initiated, you can either kill enemies in one blow whilst being healed.In all honesty, this game isn't even worthy of the Ninja Gaiden title. It took gamers the longest to master the original Ninja Gaiden and the first boss who was your master was really difficult to defeat in the first Ninja Gaiden. Not only were the bosses in NG1 extremely hard, but the enemies were nightmares. Did Tecmo/Team Ninja forget about the &#34;black ninjas&#34; which required so much skill to defeat?Instead, what you get is a game with the Ninja Gaiden license that lacks everything that was fun about the previous games.I'll admit that it can be a fun game at times, but after fighting wave after wave of enemies, lack of weapons or upgrades, a forgettable story, and a glitchy multiplayer, this is the worst of the series. It reminds me of Devil May Cry 2 only not as good. If you can get it cheap, buy it for achievements and some action. However, if you're looking for a NG experience, stick to Ninja Gaiden Black or NG2.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001AWDFUY","description":"007 Quantum of Solace PS3","reviewerName":"ITBeast \"ITBeast\"","summary":"The PS3 Game Companion for Casino Royal and Quantum of Solace","reviewText":"I picked up this game for the PS3 at a competitors for $9.00 used, I originally purchased this game thru Amazon almost 4 years ago for the PC (Unfortunately not for $9.00). Being I am a big Bond fan and I did like the game for the PC I wanted to see what the differences were between the 2 platforms and of course what trophies I could earn thru the Sony Trophy System.Anyways, the game as you may already suspect is for the most part is your Classic FPS (First Person Shooter) using a modified version of the Call Of Duty 4 engine (Now commonly referred to as the Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare) with the occasional cut scenes. The Best way I can explain the games story is basically all the deleted scenes that had been cut out from both Casino Royale (2006 Version) and Quantum of Solace Movies (I highly recommend seeing both movies before playing this game) and are reworked/adapted into a FPS Controlled Game. It Starts out at the end of Casino Royale (2006 Version) just before the Credits starts rolling into Quantum of Solace right after the car chase at the beginning of Quantum of Solace. You then keep playing through Quantum up to when Bond crashes the twin engine plane near the caves in Bolivia. While in those caves with Camille (The Bond Girl for Quantum) the Game switches into a flashback mode and brings you back to the part in Casino Royale where Bond in chasing the Bomber through half of the Island in the Bahamahas to all thee way thru When Vespa was drowned in the elevator in the sinking house in Italy. You then finish out the Rest of the Game in Quantum of Solace Destroying Dominic Green's Desert Fortress back in Boliva.You start out and always have the P99 Walther hand Gun and will pick a different variety of weaponry throughout the game. The Graphics are outstanding and the Game Play was very challenging to work through. I thought the game did a good job in giving you that \"Bond experience\" and realism that makes the Daniel Craig \"Bond\" so accelerating. I only played this game in single player mode and not the multilayer.The Pros:- Great Use of the COD4 Game Engine, Made the game easier to play if you had previously played Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warefare (The Controls were very similar right down to throwing the Flashbang).- Great Job on the Likeness, voice acting, and storyline between the game and the 2 movies it was based on (Casino Royal - 2006 Version and Quantum Of Solace).- Nice choice of weapons, you can have up to 3 but only 2 are optional, the 3rd being the P99 Walther which you keep at all times. All the weapons are based on actual hardware but given names for previous bond movie titles.The Cons:- The only real con in this game (and this is the same problem in the PC Version) is the \"Take Down\" option. In order for Bond to take down an \"Enemy\" in Hand to Hand combat is to press \"R3\" and the screen will randomly tell you what corresponding right-hand button to press next. You only have a second or two to respond before the AI will counter mercilessly. There are 2 parts in the game were you will be required to do this, other than that it's optional.- The only other real criticism of the game I had was the ending of it sort of left you hanging there like there should have been more.Differences between the PS3 and PC Version - Honestly, In the Game itself it is almost identical to the PC Version from the gameplay thru the cut-scenes. The only real differences is it was easier to move Bond with the PS3 Dual-shock controller than the keyboard and mouse along with having the Trophy system (as previously mentioned).Overall, I had a great time playing this game and will probably do so again. While the Reviews on the game bordered just below positive at 67% for the PS3 and PC (Positive is 70% or higher), This game was a solid hit for Activision selling almost 4 million units across all platforms (PS3, PC, XBOX360 and so forth). I would recommend this game for those that enjoy Daniel Craig's \"James Bond\" and want to experience the thrill of the new Reboot Movies, especially now when you can pickup a copy for about 9 bucks used.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2012"}
{"product_name":"B004EVWYYG","description":"","reviewerName":"New Boy","summary":"After playing Platinum, I'm disappointed","reviewText":"I love the Pokemon games, and I have gotten at least one game for every generation.Pokemon Black and White does a lot of cool things, but also gets rid of a few. For instance, we finally get moving Pokemon, but your Pokemon is really pixelated, which just doesn't look nice. And the screen moves a bit when a Pokemon attacks to seem more action-like, but it is unnecessary. Many people say these Pokemon are horrible - I didn't like a few of them at first too but as you travel with them and win battles you'll get attached, just like in any Pokemon game. It also does serve their purpose well; all trainers start on the same level, so no one has an advantage over any one else really, since no one knows much about these new ones (sadly, I trained one of my Pokemon a lot only to realize he evolves through a trade).In terms of difficulty, the game tries to help you out by giving you just the Pokemon you need for the first few gyms, but this is a minor issue since you don't HAVE to take them. The gym battles aren't that difficult, but one thing I DID find is that the random grass battle Pokemon have higher levels. Sometimes they even sent me back to the Pokemon center! After you beat the Elite Four the game gets way harder, and you probably will have to grind.The story seems to try to do something for older players, but it seems almost an insult to one's intelligence and is completely useless. You have Team Plasma who is wants to release Pokemon from human control - but the trainers in the game are mostly too dumb to see WHY they would want to. (What? Pokemon NEED people in order to reach their true potential). But I guess this is a minor complaint since this is a different world and ethics are different - making Pokemon fight each other in the Pokemon world is not the same as having animals fight each other in the real world (though its interesting to see how the creators bring up the issue just to keep brushing it aside).Heartgold and Soulsilver were awesome because your Pokemon could follow you around (which is just cute) and because it had the Battle Frontier, and also the Pokeathlon. This game does away with all 3 of those, which I just lame. Instead you get the Battle Subway (no more variety), musicals (whats the point?), and \"better\" visuals. You get more 3d looking cities, but they don't really add anything to the game. And what's with the obsession with bridges? Couldn't they have spent their time adding more things to the game instead of bridges?The music too is not as good as in HeartGold and SoulSilver - tunes are not as memorable. But perhaps this is because I had heard them as kid and they will not have the same effect now.The thing with these newer Pokemon games (Diamond, Pearl, Black, White) is that they're not as engaging as previous generations. Up until Emerald I had been stuck to Pokemon games, and those games will always have a place in my heart and I would replay them over and over if I could. Black and White do not make me want to start all over again to re-experience them. I don't really know if it's because I'm older now or if the games just keep getting less good. If you think you can, just wait for Pokemon (Gray?), as it'll probably have more features than this one - which is what they ALWAYS do with a new generation of Pokemon games.EDIT***********I initially gave this a higher score but I just bought Platinum so I could replay the story line without the slowness of battles in Diamond. I have to say, that game is a ton better than this one. The music is very well-done - its got a beauty to it that I find lacking in this game, save for a few tracks. There is much, much more to do. In B/W, you can no longer grow your berries (you have to get them in the Dream World), you can't go underground and dig for fossils and stones, you can't make your own secret base, and you can't participate in Pokemon Contests. If you're new to Pokemon, get Platinum instead. I played Diamond for 347 hours, and I only played Black for around 80. And seeing how Platinum is an improved version of Diamond and Pearl, I suggest you try that one instead.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2011"}

It's almost a joke how many times you have to shoot some of these guys! Now, I like SOME of the weapons you can use, while others downright SUCK! The worst weapon (besides most of them) is the Sniper Rifle....10 minutes just to aim! WHOOPIE! By the time you have aimed properly, the guy's out of view!  Next is the Rocket Launcher....I mean, when you got a Rocket Launcher on your shoulder, one would assume you are ready to kick some bad-guy [...], one would also assume that you could take out MULTIPLE baddies with the pull of the  rocket-launcher trigger... Right? WROOOOOOOONG!Case in point: Even when using some of the biggest & baddest of weapons in this game, you still have to hit some of these guys multiple times (or head-on), not to mention the rocket launcher doesn't even launch rockets in a straight FREAKIN' line!!!!

I understand the fact that these guys are wearing some super space armor and such, but come on.......A ROCKET SHOULD KILL ALL BAD GUYS WITHIN A 20 FT RADIUS! AT THE VERY LEAST A 10 FOOT RADIUS!!!!!!Personally, I get WAY more enjoyment out of playing Quake II, Vietnam, or Shell Shocked, than I get out of playing this game.

For example, you will be asked to grab a toast as it leaps out of a toaster.  Or to punch out a boss who's rather slow.  Or to avoid certain obstacles.  Except for the boss games, which have no time limit, the microgames last between 2 and 5 seconds.  There are different game sets, each with a different theme, for example, one set features &quot;classic Nintendo&quot; characters.  To clear a set, you need to beat about 15 games with no more than a couple misses.Overall the games are fun, but too simplistic for adults such as myself.  Some of the games are kinda difficult to figure out, but after a couple tries you'll have no problem at all.  One mildly frustrating part is if you fail a level, you'll have to go through most of the same games you'd cleared before again.  The graphics is really simplistic, but you may be amused by the cute cut-scenes.  (Unfortunately, you can't skip the cut-scenes, so if you are in a hurry to get to the next level, you are out of luck.)Sound-wise, this is again quite simplistic.  While the background music is not annoying, some of the sound effects are.All in all, this is a fun game to kill time with while you wait for your dentist or day in court.

Sega had not only used the game to show off the tremendous possibilities of the then-new hardware, but they had reinvigorated the platform-style arcade adventure genre with massive, intricate levels, gleefully distracting minigames, and even a new kind of virtual pet, called a Chao, that could be combined with other pets, traded with friends, and even exchanged over the Internet.Sonic Adventure 2ups the ante of its predecessor with all-new puzzles and levels, and even faster action reminiscent of the early Genesis-era games. Knuckles and Tails are back, as are the Chao pets (who can now talk!).","reviewerName":"Kevin T. Rodriguez \"The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","summary":"Sonic Felt Like Leaving The Dreamcast With A BANG!!!","reviewText":"And I'm glad he did!  Lets face it people, it will never be the same playing a Sonic game on a non-Sega counsel!  I know this game is coming to Gamecube...but seeing him on a Nintendo counsel (Who used to be Sega's biggest rival) is a bit strange!  But if the true blue was going away, he was going away with a bang!  And the result is &quot;Sonic Adventure 2!&quot;  The first Sonic game for Dreamcast was a great game, but many people felt that most of the time they were just holding up on the analog most of the time!  This is no longer a problem.  Now you will have to turn...a lot!That's right, no more running straight!  Now it's time to actually make a few sharp turns in the game!  Not to mention Sonic now has new moves which allowes him to grind, climb, follow rings in mid-air, flip, and snowboard!  Sonic's new moves are great and stylish!  Not only that, but Sonic's new rival Shadow has most of those moves (And some of his own) to add new challenges!  The game is about rivals so you can choose weather or not to save the world or conquer it (It says so on the back of the box)!There are problems though so don't think this is perfect!  For one thing Tails (For some idiotic reason or another) spends his whole game in a robot shooting bullets instead of flying and stuff!  I don't know WHAT he's doing THAT for...but it doesn't work for me!!!  Next is the whole Knuckles/Rouge thing.  These guys can glide, run fast, climb, punch and kick, and Sonic Team can't seem to give them anything better to do then search for pieces of the Master Emeralds!?!  And these levels are slow, boring, and a bit on the tedious side!Graphically speaking this game runs at a smooth 60 fps without a hint of slowdown!  And at the speed this game goes at that's increadable!  I don't think the PS2 could handle that speed (Although Gamecube might)!  The english voices are still flawed and acted weakly, but now you have the choice to switch to the japanesse voices so I recomend you do so!  The music is good, but for old times sake where the heck is some of the classic Sonic music?  The Choa mini-game is fun and cute...but long!I recomend you make sure you have time to take care of this stuff!  What else am I missing...oh yeah the bosses rock!  This is easily the best Sonic game yet!  Although Sonic will now be on other game systems I'm glad that his last appearance on a Sega system turned out like this!  Not that I have anything against &quot;Sonic Shuffle,&quot; but that game would have been a weak exit for Sonic!  If you own Dreamcast get this game!  You won't be sorry!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2001"}

I really wanted to give this a 5 star review.  The first couple of missions are great.  Breathtaking visuals when riding in the drop ship over the city.  And the ISA skyscraper is amazing.  Whoever designed that skyscraper should be given whatever top prize they pass out in Architecture.But the flaws of this game is the same as the Killzone 2 game.  It's the pacing; the uneven and overlong chapters that pop up at different points.  Chapter 5 starts out with a super long opening scene where you get to wait in line.  Then you wander past some stuff then after a super fast QTE you get another cut scene.  Parts of the chapter 5 are pretty average in a good way for a FPS.  Generic yes, but somewhat okay.  But then there is a lot of wandering around just waiting for some wretched dialogue in over long cut scenes.Chapter 6: Prison escape is where the pacing really goes from being a drag to outright tedious before exhaustion sets in.  Parts of the level are great; some of it's pretty good.  but it's such a super long level.  And if you don't complete the entire level you have to restart back at the beginning of the level - and not restart at a specific chapter (something Killzone 3 allowed a player to do.)Either way I'm never playing chapter 6 again.  Maybe i could sit down for a bit longer, put my thoughts together in a more coherent sense to clearly state why i felt those levels dragged.  The lighting, tension and graphics are all amazing.  Sure, it's almost hilarious that the Killzone heroes are the shortest little men ever in a FPS.  Maybe that's half the problem.  Short men have that Napolean complex.  For the first time ever i've had to see the world from a short man's perspective.  It's gotta be rather aggravating to them to always have to stand on their tippy toes to see over the guard rails.  When i forget to do it in this game I wind up shooting the living almighty out of the guardrail and miss the Helghast.The story is still really good in this game.  I think Killzone 3 is the pinnacle of the entire series.  I liked that they moved from the full blast war into the cold-war set in space setting.  But again, the dialogue is atrocious.  I can't even fault the bland monotone voice acting cause even Patrick Stewart couldn't bring those lines to life.Also I preferred the guns in Killzone 3; I need all the help i can get when I'm playing these FPS's.  But the challenge is very doable in Killzone: Shadow Fall.  But I woulda liked to see some crazy whacked out gun like that gravity gun in Half Life 2.  The joy of shooting some space nazi into the abyss with a gravity gun-oh the thought!And again the graphics.  This is a new gen game in re: to the graphics.  No doubt about it.  As for how it stacks up to Call of Duty Ghost or Battlefield 4 i have no idea.  Didn't play either and unlike consoles i won't write reviews on games i haven't played.And multi-player?  I haven't touched it at all.  No need for me to get into any multi=player game with my terrible shooting skills and frustrate perfectly nice people trying to enjoy their afternoons.  Sometimes in these games when the baddies jump out in front of me I get all sorts of spastic and shoot my gun every which way.  I'd be charged with treason if i ever served in a war due to shooting up my fellow countrymen in friendly fire incidents.  I kinda treat the trigger like it's a panic button.  So i leave the whole multi=player experience to others.As for my recommendation to others to buy I'd say if you want the best looking graphics on the PS4 for the here and now it's probably this one.  But if you don't plan on getting this til mid January you may as well hold off for Infamous Son: PS4.  But when this comes down to $30 or $20 then you can do worse.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2013"}

With a fully-diverse world complete with po-po, various gangs and affiliations; each with their own specific type of car that they drive, angry pedestrians, mobs, thiefs, innocent people, various cars ranging from nice sports cars to crappy Volkswagen esque vehicles, to mack trucks, to pick up trucks, delivery vans, buses, tanks, taxis, speed and police boats...whatever... you name it.You can virtually go anywhere in the humongous city and either complete missions or wreak havoc on pedestrians.  Both objectives are equally fun.  You can get a kick out of standing a top a roof or parking garage and sniping the innocent pedestrians below, killing and fighting various gang members and watching their buddies come help them out, start a fight with a random pedestrian who says something you don't particularly like when you walk by, defy the cops etc. etc.  Steal a taxi and earn money dropping off different people at different locations.  Steal a Police car and run down other criminals who choose to disobey the law, steal an ambulance and pick up hurt people and take them to the hospital.  You can even do fire truck missions.They even have a nice little trick stunt bonus systems which awards money for the crazy stuff you do with your car.  And don't forget you can steal any car you want.  So that means you can stand on the highway, stop a car, pull the driver out the car and drive away without any problems.  Or if you see a nice car in the parking lot you can just hop in and take it.  Some cars have alarms on them and it goes off when you try to steal it.  Ride by the police with the alarm going and they will effectively chase you.  You can pick up hookers off the street to serve you up for a price of course and when they are done you can get your money back by putting them six feet under.  Not to mention side missions like rampage, where you kill as many as possible.  They have one where you control toy cars that explode when you press a button.  There is just so much to do!It is especially fun to see how many stars you can get.  You can get up to six total stars.  And as your stars increase, the amount of police presence and awareness increases. Get three stars and the police presence is heavy complete with a helicopter tracking your every move.  Of course you can rid yourself of the helicopter by sending a couple rockets its way from your rocket launcher but that only increases your stars. Get more than three stars and the FBI comes after you.  Get a full six stars and the army brings out the tank looking for you.  If you have a hot car you can take it to the shop and have them install a new engine and get a new paint job and the cops won't recognize you!The regular missions for each `cell' of the criminal organization have logical and necessary tasks for you to complete for them.  Doing so effectively and efficiently will earn you money to buy weapons.  The choice of weapons is good ranging from uzis, 9mm, shotguns, and sniper rifles to grenades, rocket launchers, machine guns and explosives.  You can wire a car with a bomb and dismiss of someone you don't like.  Crush Cars to destroy evidence, break people out of jail, perform hits, heck you can even do a drive-by with an uzi!  It is especially tight when you turn to Game FM on the radio station, steal a Yardie Lobo ( which comes complete with a fully active hydraulic system ) gangsta lean through your enemy gangs hood and do a drive-by on the gang members!  This kind of experience is just so fun.  And when you kill local gang members each time you roll through their streets they will try to steal your car, beat you up, or shoot you.Top this off with nine different radio stations that cater to all tastes, excellent replay value, cars that would handle like real cars, easy playability and controls, excellent graphics for this type of game, great voice acting and you have got one of the greatest games ever.  I can't express my approval of this game.  The easiest five star rating ever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2002"}

While civ 5 is different from 3 and 4, its still fun to play. I'm enjoying plotting my next war with someone.  The diplomacy kind of sucks though because you do one wrong thing and they stay mad at you through the whole game and wont sign an agreement with you.  I accidentally attacked a city that didn't belong to anyone and i'm getting denounced right away.  I said screw it and just started being a warhawk.  I really like the battles over the other ones.  For example, i take my frigate and attack a barbarian camp and it just annihilates it in one shot.  Or my horseman and they just slaughter everyone.  I kind of miss stacking units though.  Its kind of a pain to have to move a unit out of the way to get another unit in.  The new thing i like though is having generals which improves your attacks by a lot.  I like having my generals on each continent that i have taken and i just leave that area of responisbility to them when needed.  Its kind of cool though your general starts off on a horse and then when you reach the industrial age, it turns him in a jeep.  It would have been nice if they would give generals diplomatic powers since there is no spies in the game. That would have been a cool feature. They only thing you can use the general is being a leader of a unit.  Overall they could have made this game way better than what it is but its still fun to play. The game is now patched up good so it doesn't crash anymore and they are suppose to release another patch soon which offers a hotseat option.  I just hope the next civ game has more to offer and bring back some of stuff in previous game.  But until the next game, i'll be playing this one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2011"}

I like the hard matte casing and the thing is built like a brick. I have read the complaints about the heat and since it's a \"new console\" I spent the extra 40 bucks for the contract with Best Buy. Problems with setting up the wireless connection where the console gets a 100% signal from the NETGEAR unit I have 15ft away, but it can't come up with an IP address and continues to time out. Probably more of an issue with me. Wired connection and browser are fine.One major problem is the controller. Besides being too small and made for the hands of a 10 yr old, the fact that you can't add AAA batteries is a mess. To play Killzone 2 I had to plug in the wire and sit in a dining room chair 3 ft from a 46\" TV. In the future while I'm playing when the controller goes dead I'll again have to repeat the above scenario if I want to keep the action going. As it stands, not set up for the serious gamer.

{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"R. Reining \"Old School Zinger\"","summary":"Excellent despite the ending","reviewText":"This review contains no spoilers.By now, most people who have played Mass Effect 3 have come to have a problem with ending of the game, and not without reason. However, I think to be fair, the first 50 hours of gameplay can't be ruined by the last 15 minutes or so. It does feel like a misstep though. While playing, there are a lot of inside jokes and references to things from the past two games, and quite a bit of time is devoted to really fleshing out your past crew members and some of the important choices you have made in the past two iterations.I say \"some\" of the choices, because when certain choices are addressed in the game, it felt to me like BioWare tried really hard to whittle down the possible cut scenes, while also trying to provide the backstory to those choices for people who have not played Mass Effect 1 or 2. If you have played Dragon Age you will know what I mean. Like where no matter which dialog option you choose, you will get the same response from whoever you re talking to, because it is worded in a vague way where it makes sense regardless of what you say, and the only difference is whether what you chose to say affects your standing with that character in a positive or negative way. However, because we should be able to feel like our choices have mattered, those generic expository reactions from your allies feels really out of place. For instance, I chose to save the Rachni Queen in Mass Effect 1. Then, when it gets brought up in game 3, Shepard asks \"The Rachni...aren't they extinct?\" And all the while I am thinking \"Come on, Shepard, don't you remember effing saving them in game 1, why are you asking such a stupid question?\" It breaks down my suspension of disbelief where I should be engaging with the story, and if I had a complaint, that would be the biggest one. There are a few instances of things like that, and while I completely understand why BioWare did it that way, I think they could have done it better. If someone is going to pick up game 3 without playing the first two, they should have to read codex entries to catch up, and give the devoted fans a unique gaming experience instead of a generic one-size-fits-all cinematic that falls flat. While you can definitely argue its merits in terms of story and gameplay, Alpha Protocol did an excellent job of creating a unique experience every time you played it. In fact, I don't think I could do two identical playthroughs of it if I actively tried. And that is because all of your choices do matter. I think one of the problems with Mass Effect 3 isn't that your choices don't matter at all, it's that they don't matter very much. It's a bit too late to go back and fix it now though, unless they re-did the entire game. That is wishful thinking on the part of fans of the series. I think we are going to just have to try to make peace with what we have.So I guess I should also talk a bit about the ending (without spoilers). It seems to be quite convoluted, to me. And what it really feels like is that there was about 30 minutes of cut-scenes that were removed from the ending, and I'm not sure why. I think that is the second reason what people really feel like their choices don't matter that much, because we're not really shown anything that can bring closure and tie the game off nicely. And a minor annoyance to me was that the continuity of your squad members sometimes gets all screwed up. Like you choose your squad at the end, and then after you complete the game you see a cut-scene and both of the ones I chose were in it, and I was just like, weren't they with me down on the planet?However, to be fair the game, it does a lot of things right, and because of that, I don't think it's fair to dismiss the game or give it one or two stars just because the ending was weak. As with Fable 3, I enjoyed the vast majority of the game, until the ending, but just because the end of both games left me wanting more, I can't call the games bad and disregard all of the things they did well. And Mass Effect 3 did a LOT of things well, even for its shortcomings.The tone is set right away, and it is very effective. Clint Mansell scored the game, and it is gorgeous. Very dark but with moments of raw emotion. The opening of the game will be nothing new to those who played the demo, since it is essentially the same thing only with more dialog options and a longer cut-scene. As with the end of Mass Effect 2, game 3 does a superb job of setting up that this is really it, and things are looking very bleak.Your past crew members are all revisited, and are all given a generous amount of time so that we understand them better and care about them more. All of the instances are pretty effective, and I even found myself caring about what Jacob had been up to, even though I still find him to be very flat and uninteresting. But besides that, there are a few cut-scenes devoted entirely to having emotionally engaging moments with your crew. I think BioWare didn't have to do that, and I'm a bit surprised they did. But I also think the game is fantastic because of it. That is why you are fighting this seemingly hopeless war, to protect that kind of camaraderie.  A few new minor characters are even introduced, and they are all quite good.The gameplay is very smooth, and the action, while I still felt there was an excess of it, is streamlined. I had a few problems with my character either moving into or coming out of cover when I didn't want them to, but other that that, I didn't experience any problems. I think this is also the most difficult Mass Effect game to date. I played on Insanity the first time through, and I died quite a few times. There were segments of game 2 that I thought were difficult, but mostly those were boss battles. In this game there were numerous times where I felt overwhelmed just by normal fights. And maybe that's why I felt like there was too much action (You don't need to have constant action to have an engaging story, BioWare!), because most of it was difficult.The graphics are an upgrade from the second, and it looks really good. Everything seems darker and more defined now, but because the story is also pretty dark, I think it helped reinforce the tone. Graphics should never take center stage though, so that's all I'll say about them is that they look nice.References to the past two games are numerous and to me, having played both of them multiple times, were very welcome. BioWare even breaks down the third wall a couple of times and pokes fun at themselves. And it's really good to see that a developer can look at choices they made in the past and see how it might not have worked like they wanted it to, but also not get all defensive about it, and don't mind a little self-deprecating teasing.I have not played as female Shepard yet, so I can't speak to her voice acting, but I actually didn't mind male Shepard's voice acting this time through. It's never been bad, per se, just flat and boring. This time I didn't notice much of that, which is good, because it's one of those things that can constantly be disengaging you from a game, if you're spending the time rolling your eyes at how lines are delivered (or written, sometimes).As unfulfilled as some people may feel at the ending, I don't think the rest of the hard work on this game can be discounted fairly. Tens of thousands of man hours went into making this game, and most of the work was superb. While I am part of the group that feels like the ending should have been different or had different choices, I can't give this game a low rating just because that 1% of the game was weak. It is an important 1%, no question, but we really can't always have what we want. And in terms of enjoyment ratio, I genuinely loved about 90% of the game. And while I feel that is entirely the right of anyone else to give the game a low rating because of the ending, I choose to focus on the overwhelming reasons the game is incredible in spite of the ending.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"Johnny","summary":"GREAT ADDITION!!!","reviewText":"first off.I want to let you know that Im not a BIG halo fan.  I played the crap outta the first one, skipped the second one, played even more of the 3rd one as well as ODST and reach.  I USED to be a big halo fan but it seems to me as time went on I started to be more into COD franchise.  COD 4, MW2, and BLOPS.  Last year I bought battlefield and have played that solidly for a year.Ok so now you know my gaming history for the past years.  Lets talk about halo 4.  I had a big decision this year.  I went and bought premium of battlefield ($50-which if youre thinking about picking it up, just buy the 'premium edition' and you get everything included for $60)  Anyway my budget allowed me to get one more game for this year, and it boiled down to halo 4 or blops 2.  As some of you could guess by now, halo 4 was my choice.  And I am very happy with my decision.I knew BLOPS would disappoint me, especially coming from a such a big fan of bf3- (seems like you really cant be both a cod fan and bf3 fan-but some of you will probably disagree)  the gameplay is different.  I like to have dedicated servers, tactics, brand new engine and class based in a FPS, and that is what the game delivers for me.  So from that perspective, I picked up Halo 4 because I wanted something different.  Since it came out I havent been able to play any other game.  I absolutely love it.It comes with 2 discs.  1 for campaign and the other for MP.  The second disc only has the maps for MP so you will have to have the space to DL the maps to your harddrive (~8gig), once they are downloaded you will only use the 1st disc (I love this set up, no longer are the days of constant switching of discs regardless of campaigning or MP)Halo 4 has more of a mature feeling about it than previous halo games.  I was a little nervous to know that a 3rd party developer would be making the series from this point forward and when I first heard about the next trilogy in the making I was a little skeptic..could they resurrect of a 'dying fps'?  Well the answer is yes!I am a little short on time so I will just break it down quickly.  The graphics on this game is absolutely amazing, it steams from halo 3 engine but 343i was able to tweak it to a way that it looks and feels great, the lighting, shadows, etc look flawlessly on my 60in plasma.  The controls are super smooth and the gameplay is particularly enjoyable.  It seems to me that 343i have gone thru and redone all the sounds for the weapons and most have a 'throater' pop when the weapon is shot.  Very Nice.I am a competitive XBL player and I have enjoyed both campaign and MP greatly!  The cut scenes in campaign are so gorgeous its hard to believe that it isnt a movie shot with real people, I cant explain it but you have got to check it out.  MP is very competitive.  It has leaps and bounds over previous halo MP.  You now can sprint using any perk.  Some say its a futuristic COD..I say its still halo with a hint of COD (like adding a lime to your coke, its still a coke with a twist).  if someone quits mid game that spot can be replaced to keep the game going fair.  I cant wait for more maps to be released.  Im a big 4v4 slayer fan and it seems I play the similar maps a great amount.  More diversity would be greatly appreciated.  But that to me is far from a deal breaker, those objective gametypes are a nice addition and some of them are new to halo! You now have load outs which can be purchased by in game points that you receive everytime you level up, you can apply these points to gun unlocks, perks, special abilities, armor (purely cosmetic differences), grenades, etc!if youre somewhat techy like me you would like to know that this game runs at 720p (thank you for being around forever xbox) and 30 fps-which the naked eye doesnt see anything more than that anyway..and when explosions happen in the game I havent seen any rendering or chopping issues.  Altho split screen I did experience some lag, not sure if it were the split of the screen or the connection of that game.  Also you can play any gametype up to 4 players on the same console for MP (not sure of campaign...havent tried)  This is nice considering Reach it depended on what gametype you chose to determine how many players can play on the same console (2-4).  MP connection is a p2p, i wished it had dedicated servers but only experience one game of split screen lag, (in the dozens of games that I have played so far)Hope this review steers you in the right direction.  I try to stay as unbiased as possible, but I feel that this game is the biggest bang for your buck and will keep you interested for a long while.  I have to say that 343i has more heart than any other developer that Ive seen...maybe bc this is their first game?  I hope they stay humble.5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2012"}

ESRB Rated E10 for gamers aged 10 and up.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Uneven but still a joy","reviewText":"Final Fantasy XII, the franchise's last installment on the Playstation 2, was sort of hit-and-miss as it had a completely immersive world, a better battle system and graphics but with it went at times a meandering and confusing storyline, characters you couldn't empathasize with a la Celes or Rydia and a rather forgettable soundtrack. Its sequel, Revenant Wings is similarily flawed but its not as disappointing and while there's several gameplay aspects and features that aren't as impressive or well-done, it's still quite a joy to play and should appeal to fans of its epic big brother.Story: Taking place after the events of the first game, Vaan and his companion Penelo are sky pirates who stumble across an old airship that takes them to the floating land of Lemures populated by the aegyl, humes (humans) with wings on their back. But such a wondrous and highly talked about land of legend means others want to exploit and so Vaan, Penelo as well as new friends and old buddies try to stop those who wish to use Lemures treasures for their own.Graphics: The graphics might invoke more a combination of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance and the Mana series rather than the first game which is fine and all since the game's quite colorful but then again, characters look more younger despite it being a sequel and there's on occasion some slowdown but when you have just as impressive FMV's as the remake of III, all those nitpicks kind of get thrown out the window.Sound/Music: The first soundtrack without series mainstay Nobuo Uematsu, XII's soundtrack was epic and grandiose in its arrangements but rather forgettable in its melodies which made Uematsu's music such a pleasure since not only was it well composed, but it was hummable at the same time. Revanent Wings is pretty much the same soundtrack as XII's but sometimes it's more welcome here. No voice acting to speak of.Gameplay: The battle system was refreshing in XII since gone were the random battles and its place was a MMORPG-inspired system with attacks requiring a certain amount of time before they're activated. The battle system in the DS game is similar but it's mission-based a la Tactics and characters roam the field fighting, healing and other such stuff. Aiding in your quest are espers, enemies that you \"summon\" into battle to help you fight the legions of baddies in a given level. Taking over an enemy's summon gate allows you to touch the gate and call even more espers which range from melee, ranged, and flying. It's a fun little system and while you can use different esper groups to battle different foes, it's best to just make everyone unleash on the enemy at once.Which comes to one of my two nitpicks: the field can get crowded with not only your members (up to 9 main characters but 5 in a field) and a certain limit of espers not to mention the large amounts of baddies that can populate the field, it's hard to pick a certain member of your team to cure your fighters or to get a party member out of the way lest they get knocked out. The other is the way you level up: what made the original funner at levelling up was that you could go around the level and just stomp enemy after enemy without having to leave the screen, get the fanfare and your spoils etc but now that's back and it makes exp gaining slightly tedious since you have to keep replaying Melees to get your characters up in levels. Not to mention the game's difficulty is unbalanced at times with a fine cruising pace then all of a sudden the enemies seemed to level up faster than I do or I just got overwhelmed.While the story is a bit more simplistic than XII's political-intrigue filled narrative and the gameplay is unbalanced, fans of the series would be good to give Revenant Wings a go.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2008"}

Players will achieve soaring levels of power, explore Northrend (the vast icy continent of the Lich King), and battle high-level heroes to determine the ultimate fate of Azeroth. As you face the dangers of the frigid, harsh north, prepare to master the dark necromantic powers of the Death Night -- World of Warcraft's first Hero class. No longer servants of the Lich King, the Death Knights begin their new calling as experienced, formidable adversaries. Each is heavily armed, armored, and in possession of a deadly arsenal of forbidden magic.If you have a World of Warcraft account with a character of at least level 55, you will be able to create a new level-55 Death Knight of any race (if on a PvP realm, the Death Knight must be the same faction as your existing character). And upon entering the new world, your Death Knight will begin to quest to level 80, gaining potent new abilities and talents along the way. This expansion allows for only one Death Knight per realm, per account.New Environments in Northrend AwaitJourney through the remote, diverse lands of Northrend and explore Dragonblight, Grizzly Hills, Borean Tundra, and Howling Fjord. Named for bones of perished dragons and majestic shrines to the fallen creatures, Dragonblight is an arctic wasteland surrounded by dense forests.Not everything is frozen in Northrend. The lush mountains of Grizzly Hills are the ancestral home to the furbolgs, who have grown accustomed to relative peace. Although their tranquility is being challenged by trappers, goblins, and ice trolls, Grizzly Hills remains a vast and dangerous wilderness.The southwestern tip of Northrend is home to the sprawling Borean Tundra. The Horde has established a dominant presence in this icy portion of the continent and has formed a bond with the tuskarr, a walrus-like race of nomadic fisherman. Magical energy is afoot in the region, and it has caused increased tension.High above the Great Sea at the southeastern tip of Northrend lies the Howling Fjord. Ancient mythology holds that a race of half-giant warriors, the vrykul, once inhabited the land, founding a prosperous civilization. They mysteriously vanished, leaving deserted villages and abandoned temples. In present times, the Alliance and the Horde have come to Howling Fjord to confront the Lich King. Strangely, this has prompted the return of the vrykul, who are attacking the Alliance and Horde settlements. Howling Fjord presents a difficult challenge on two fronts: withstanding the vrykul's onslaught and battling the evil Lich King.A Multitude of MonstersStrange and terrifying creatures inhabit the frozen continent of Northrend, such as Nerubian Viziniers, Plague Eruptors, Shoveltusks and Flesh Giants, to name just a few. Half-spider, half-humanoid, the viziniers utilize sorcery and high intelligence to emerge as the rulers of Nerubians' underground kingdom. The Plague Eruptors are walking corpses created by the Lich King's evil experiments to spread horror and chaos across the living world.Massive curved antlers make it easy to identify the Shoveltusks. These grumpy beasts are very dangerous, territorial, and best left alone. The Flesh Giants are nothing short of nightmarish abominations. Cobbled together from the pieces of giant body parts, the Flesh Giants employ tremendous strength to carry out the Lich King's wishes.The World of Warcraft: Wrath of King Lich expansion pack allows you to engage in epic siege warfare. The pack presents the first Hero class and allows you to transform your Death Knight's look with character customization that even include hairstyles and dances. You'll enjoy exploring the Northrend and all its environments and dungeons, filled with some of the deadliest creatures -- and greatest treasures -- on all of Azeroth.System RequirementsMinimumRecommendedOperating SystemPC: Microsoft Windows XP or Windows Vista (with latest Service Packs)Mac: Mac OS X 10.4.11 or newerCPUPC: Intel Pentium 4 1.3 GHz or AMD Athlong XP 1500+Mac: PowerPC G5 1.6 GHz or Intel Core Duo processorPC: Dual-core processor, such as Intel Pentium D or AmD Athlong 64 X2Mac: Intel 1.8 GHz processor or betterGraphics HardwarePC: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transfor and Lighting with 32 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon 7200 or NVIDIA GeForce2 class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transform and Lighting with 64 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon 9600 or NVIDIA GeForce Ti 4600 class card or betterPC: 3D Graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capabilities with 128 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA GeForce 7600 GT class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capability with 128 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA 7600 class card or better.MemoryPC: 512 MB (1 GB for Vista)Mac: 1 GBPC: 1 GB (2 GB for Vista)Mac: 2 GBHard Drive Space15 GB of free spaceAll Platform RequirementsKeyboard and mouse, required for controls.

The same old prospects of hours of monotonous farming for tier pieces, as from lvl 60, then lvl 70 and now lvl 80 was dragging the game down.  Epix farming, a few new bosses as the guild managed to progress a bit, then more and more and more of the same old stuff.

I enjoyed the storyline, I enjoyed the little side tasks, the bounty hunting. If one task felt repetative or boring, i went to something else. great story, surprisingly good voice acting. I like the open world setup -- in fact, it reminded me of World of Warcraft in that there was so much to do it was hard to stop playing most nights.The only downside is that the MP in Red Dead Redemption really tested my patience. I guess I'm just not a fan of the fact that in the Free Roam other players will just randomly shoot me if I'm just on my horse minding my own business or trying to do a gang hideout. I kind of liked the deathmatch-flavored games, but i didn't spend much time on the other game types.

When some creature escapes into space with Princess Peach, Mario gives chase, exploring bizarre planets all across the galaxy. Since he's in space, Mario can perform mind-bending jumps unlike anything he&#x2019;s done before. He'll also have a wealth of new moves that are all based around tilting, pointing and shaking the Wii Remote.","reviewerName":"Zachary Koenig \"K-Dawg\"","summary":"Rebounding From \"Sunshine\"","reviewText":"Being a dye-in-the-wool Nintendo fan, I have always enjoyed the new Mario titles that seem to be the stalwart of the franchise.  I spent way too many hours of my life playing the original Super Mario Bros. (plus sequels), as well as Super Mario World for the SNES.  Then, as with most people, Super Mario '64 absolutely blew me away with its 3-D graphic interface.  However, I was disappointed in the Gamecube effort Super Mario Sunshine, which just didn't seem to have the right \"Mario feel\" to it.  Super Mario Galaxy, however, brought me back into the Mario \"universe\" (excuse the pun) big time!The controls and premise of this game harkens back to the revolutionary Mario '64, in which players must collect stars (or, in this case, star creatures) in a variety of different ways.  The graphics are pristine, the cut scenes are fun, and the controls are easy to pick up and play.Though panned as being a \"kids game\", Mario Galaxy offers something for both the beginning and advanced gamers.  By collecting 70 of the 120 total stars (a task that is by no means impossible), Bowser can be defeated and effectively \"end\" the game.  However, more advanced games can shoot for the full 120 stars and see the \"true\" ending.Overall, this game is another success in the long line of the Mario franchise.  After mixed reviews for Mario Sunshine, Nintendo went back to the basics in this game and created a masterpiece.  I'm looking forward to the next installment (rumored to be a sequel to this game?!).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2008"}

Shatto","summary":"From the perspective of a returning Wrath player","reviewText":"I played WoW on and off from early October 2006 to the pre-Cataclysm patch 4.0.1 in October 2010. Over time, as the game changed, I would lose interest for awhile, take a break for anywhere from weeks to months, then come back and play again. Over this period of time, I played to 80 and did just about everything there was to do except dungeon Raids or Arena, neither of which interest me personally.I recently decided to give the new, supposedly improved, Cataclysm a try with the new \"free to 20\" trial Blizzard offers.The new questing and leveling system is ugly and pointless. They've basically taken all the old quests and spread them out among some new outposts dotted around the landscape. This is okay in areas where you previously had to run forever between quest and quest giver to do things (think the boring hikes you had to take between the banshee area and Crossroads in The Barrens), but mostly it just feels like you're bouncing from one place to another and it speeds up leveling so fast that you usually wind up vastly outpacing the enemies in the area such that fighting them is just an annoying bump in the road, not any sort of challenge. Worse, they've mostly eliminated the more challenging quests. Remember that quest in the Agamand homestead that Forsaken were given where you had to run into a crypt, carefully pull and kill the enemies, and then fight the elder Agamand's reanimated corpse for his remains? Gone. Now you stand around in a bedroom and wail on his helpless ghost after a brief chat with another Forsaken NPC. This extreme dumbing down of the game is apparently what Blizzard considers an \"improvement\".Another problem returning players will face is that a lot of the \"new\" quests are actually just old Wrath quests with new names and using low level enemies. I hope you enjoy running around freeing webbed victims - you know, that duplicate quest you get as one of your early jobs from either of the two starting points in Northrend? - because that's a \"new\" quest now in the starter areas.The worst part for me, however, is the horribly simplified way everything works. Gone are the clever hybrid builds as you now pick a single specialization that you're stuck with exclusively until you have 31 skill points in that tree. Which, since you only get 1 point every other level, means no hybrids until near the end of the game. Another annoying way they've stupified the game is by removing a lot of the little details. You get experience for nearly every action you perform. You no longer have to learn weapons skills. You can just stand around waiting for the dungeon queue to automatically hook you up for a dungeon. There's just nothing left to actually DO, it seems. You rarely, if ever, have to group up outside instances, your hand is held through nearly every possible action, and the game flies by so fast that there's really no point at which you ever become particularly interested in any single area because you're not there long enough to care about what's actually going on.The game has always been too geared toward \"grind\" for some players to enjoy, but Cataclysm just takes it over the edge in trying to correct that perception. They've so simplified the game that it seems you do little more than follow the little arrow on the minimap around, sell your loot now and then, and then logoff. I enjoy WoW, and I still want to play it, but I can't because the game I like doesn't exist anymore. If there were a pre-4.0 server, I'd be back in a heartbeat. But this? There's no way. As long as this b-team disaster represents what WoW has to offer, I can only say Blizzard has finally managed to completely kill my enthusiasm for the game.If I want a super-simple MMO to kill time with, I'll pick Pocket Legends. I can play it anywhere, I can play for a minute or two at a time, and it doesn't cost me anything. I liked WoW for its challenge and detail. And they've killed that.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2011"}

The site was difficult to navigate, but I finally received confirmation that a return authorization tag had been created for my item.  Luckily, I wrote down the return authorization number before navigating away from the page, while awaiting an email confirmation, as well as a copy of the shipping tag.  Days, weeks, months passed.  I checked on it a few times, and the RA tracking works on their site, but still no tag!  The entire process seems like it should be simple to complete, but my order is just stuck in limbo.As such, I have never played the game, and feel that a neutral 'three star' review is the only fair rating to issue at this time.

{"product_name":"B000O5DS32","description":"Prepare to experience an evolution in the first person shooter. Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"Shelia Leverett","summary":"Nothing groundbreaking but worth a shot.","reviewText":"Turok is somewhat your run of the mill shooter it features no real new things done by first person shooters.Yes, there are new features we are not accustomed to but its nothing you should go out of your way to pick up.I purchased the game when it was $35 which is a reasonable price for this game.Much beyond that range though is a little steep for this game.The graphics are above average but its nothing to hold your grasp for too long though.Outside of the bow and the knife the weapons just seem watered down, there really weak and have no real function other than to stave you off until you can get some more arrows or in tight enough to use the knife.The multiplayer is also a very weak point its nothing worth righting home about.Its real laggy and relies more on luck than that persons true skill.Overall this is a good title for $25-35 but much beyond that range is a little high.If you were a huge fan of the original like I am then you should definately check out Turok.Final scoregraphics 8.0sound 8.5story(non-existant) 6.5legnth 10 hours  8.0multiplayer  7.0overall 7.5","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2008"}

The rest of my family is musically talented, but that talent seemed to skip me.  I decided to give Rocksmith a try.Rocksmith starts out easy and gets progressively more difficult.  It adapts to your ability.  It starts out with the basics such as how to hold your guitar and pick.  A complete novice like me, can easily learn the simplest tasks with ease.  Rocksmith has a bunch of lessons that teach you the fundamentals.  I'm at the level where I am still struggling with learning how to use frets and cords.  The game slows everything down for me, so that I can master the fundamentals in my own time.The game can tell when you're playing correctly and when you're having trouble.  I have a tendency to get nervous when another person is watching me learn something, so the fact that this game is able to correct me without a real person watching me is a real plus.Another plus to Rocksmith is that you can start &#34;playing&#34; songs right away.  When you first start out with a song, you only need to play one note.  This allows even novices to start playing real songs from the beginning.  If you play those first notes well, the game will up the difficulty.Overall, I highly recommend Rocksmith for new guitar players.  It has been allowing me to learn guitar at my own pace, in a stress free environment.  I'm still learning and feel like Rocksmith is on the path to helping me learn to play guitar.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2013"}

Recht","summary":"Prepare to get lost in Cyrodill","reviewText":"I came into this series in time for Morrowind, and I got hooked. At first I couldn't get the hang of it, but I finally managed to figure it out and the end result was plenty of entertainment. The world--both in Morrowind and here in Oblivion--is huge, and there are hundreds of places to visit and explore. I especially liked the inclusion of random hamlets and houses in the wilderness. They add a touch of realism.And the world itself it beautiful. I'll be playing and be struck by the view or a particularly tranquil-looking meadow. There's nothing quite like cresting a hill in Oblivion, too. You come up over the rise and a valley is laid out in front of you--you can see all the way across a mountain range. No backdrop palettes here. If you see a mountain off in the distance, you can climb it.Even after you complete the main questline, you'll only have scratched the surface of the content. There are hundreds of odd jobs to be done in each of the towns, and they aren't the mindless cut-and-paste quests you get in other games. My favorite so far is one for the Dark Brotherhood where they lock you in a house with several other people, and you must assassinate them one at a time without the rest catching on and attacking you. Another fun one was tracking down a man who said he was a vampire hunter, only to learn he's little more than a thief and a murderer. Everything's heavy on story and cutscenes, which is good! You'll get sucked in. The atmosphere is quality.Each player will have things they like to do. Some like the combat aspect, others like making their own spells and practicing sorcery, and others like to search for rare plants to put into potions. Any pursuit will give you hours and hours of gameplay. The money problem in Morrowind has been fixed (it was notoriously easy in that game so quickly earn thousands upon thousands of gold, and be able to afford anything offered). You'll make more gold as you level up, but you won't find whole suits of ebony armor worth 100,000 gold lying around on each enemy like in Morrowind. Expensive, quality items are nice and rare, and you appreciate them more because of it.If you do build up a surplus of gold, you can always buy a house or two or five. There's one for sale in pretty much every town, and they range in price from 5,000 gold to 25,000 or so. The furnishings for these houses (many come unfurnished) are another 1,500 apiece. You really don't need to buy a house (as the game recommends repeatedly on the many loading screens), because you'll never have much use for it. The only thing in your houses that's useful is the bed, and it's almost always easier to just use an inn or fast travel to a campsite. Still, they are fun to have, and they're great later on when you need a place to store items you've saved up.Negatives? Just two little ones. After you play for a while, the game seems to slow down, which can prove to be a headache when you need to access the menus. Sometimes it locks up completely for a minute or so. And the loading screens--lordy, the screens!--sometimes there are multiple loading screens for the interior of a house. Castles will be divided into several loading zones. Passing from indoors to out or vice-versa requires a load. So does leaving or entering a town, sewer, cave, mine, shrine, ruin, cellar, attic, tower, or in some cases, room. This can become frustrating.Other than that, this game is virtually flawless. It can give you dozens of hours of playtime if you get into the guild quests and professions, and probably twice that if you decide you want to explore and find all the locations on the map.This is probably the best all-around lazy Sunday game on the 360 so far, the kind of thing you could spend an afternoon messing about with and feel like you did something semi-useful when you finally save and quit.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2008"}

When darkness descends, light becomes his only ally as he fights his way to daybreak.

Players must skillfully combine their use of light with more conventional weapons to stand a chance.Realistic, interactive environment: Set in the town of Bright Falls, the hyper-detailed environments of the Pacific Northwest play an important role, as even the change in daylight and weather will profoundly affect the characters and enemies in Alan Wake.

The world of Alan Wake is alive and real.Episodic narrative: The mission-based structure of Alan Wake creates an episodic narrative similar to a deeply structured dramatic television series, such as LOST, Twin Peaks and X-Files.

Voices don't sync with facial movements, and Alan has an almost perpetual sneer and grimace on his face, like he just stepped in dog doo, for about the first hour of the game. Landscapes are too overlapping, and while the stages are setup so that you can see almost clear to Kansas, when you're stumbling through the woods trying to find a hidden manuscript page that's tucked behind trees that all look the same, the setup becomes a tad annoying.Audio and environment do far better. Howling fog and shadow do wonders to help create a creepy atmosphere, and the main characters calm yet strained voice does add a fair amount of weight to the feel of the game. And there's nothing quite like a demonically possessed park ranger shrieking for you to stay on the path.Gameplay is a bit hit and miss. While the novelty of light based combat loses its charm rather quickly, you're never hurting for ammo, which has always been a good staple of survival horror. But the monsters here all apparently lettered in track, as its almost impossible to escape if you wish too. And what adventure game would be complete without a frustrating pointless finding sub mission. The novels of the book, which are nifty and help to flesh out the surreality of living through something you've written, is significantly hampered by the fact that you don't have any real way of finding them other than wandering around areas infested with monsters while holding a finite ammo supply. But the switch shoulder third person view with independent light direction is a vast improvement.Nits also abound. The readover from your pages isn't automatic, and reading while listening to dictation is a tad annoying. The TV and radio, both entertaining, can only be heard at about 8 inches, and you can't first person view the TV clips, which are very well done.In short, this is entertaining and fun, but the scariness and sheer aura are killed by the finding missions and a couple crucial failures in the looks department, but they only tarnish the shine on this piece. And while they may have rushed to gold, they have at least bowed to their own mistake by making at least the first portion of the DLC free. Also, the add ins for the ltd edition, namely the short story and the soundtrack, which actually has some good pieces, make it worth the few extra dollars.Seeing as how people apparently don't care for this review, could you please comment why if you do not find it useful.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

The shoulder buttons are very comfortable and easy to press within a split second, great for games that require fast reaction time.  The four face buttons are spaced perfectly, and the overall design of the controller fits the hand perfectly.  Sony hit the bulls-eye with the PSOne Dualshock controller, and they transferred this design over to the PS2.  The design was still so popular that Sony could not resist transferring it over again.  The added benefit of the dualshock controller on the PS3 is the added freedom of wireless.The controller is easy to adapt to for Sony console veterans, making the upgrade to the PlayStation 3 even less painless then it already is.  The PlayStation 3 sticks to Sony's winning formula, utilizing familiar buttons, and the same layout as controllers before it.  Players will easily recognize the mapping of the controllers, with trademark \"square\", \"triangle\", \"circle\" and \"x\" buttons that Sony fans have become accustomed to.  The PlayStation 3 also follows the tried and true method of the Xbox 360 controller by placing a \"home\" icon on the controller.  The \"home\" icon is located in the center of the controller, and upon pressing it the player will view the PlayStation 3 XMB.  The XMB is the main navigational source for the PS3, displaying the contents of the console's hard-drive and disc-drive.  Holding the button down for a longer period of time will allow either the controller or the console to be turned off remotely.The controller easily syncs with the console and has a great battery life as well.  The controller also comes packaged with a USB cable that you can use to charge the controller with in case of long gaming sessions where the battery may begin to run low.  The only drawback with this is the length of cable is not long enough to actually allow the gamer to sit at a decent distance from the console while charging the controller.  Replacing and upgrading the chord with one of a better length is a wise choice, and one that I highly recommend.The Dualshock 3 returns to the heavier weight that players are used to feeling from the controllers; ditching the lightweight design of the Six Axis.  This makes the controller \"feel\" better to hold, making it sturdier as well.  The major reason that I prefer this controller overall the other controllers that have been released is because of the directional pad.  The d-pad is perfect on the Sony controllers.  It allows for precision and accuracy in every genre of gaming.  I was disappointed when Sony launched the PS3 and its controller lacked rumble capability, however, with this new release the Dualshock design is back and better than ever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2009"}

It reminds me of the NES game. The first level is easy and the second, but the third is so hard. But in Mario as you all know, if you're the tiny Mario if you get hit once, boom, you are dead, have to start the level over again. Here's the lowdown:Graphics: 5/5 They have really improved the graphics of the old version alot. They aren't those blocky NES graphics, they are fine and colorful. That's what I like about the Mario Franchise.Sound: 5/5 The sound is fantastic in this game. You get to hear the classic theme and all Mario's phrases like \"Oh, Mama Mea\"Controls: 5/5 The controls are pretty simple. A is to jump and thats about it and the D-pad. Also you use R to speed up.Fun: 4/5 I always like the Mario franchise, but the game is literally too hard. One hit your are dead pretty much if you're not the racoon or Super Mario.

Like the original and also Mario 64 before it, Banjo Tooie is about exploring massive worlds, collecting objects, solving puzzles, and fighting bosses. Your goal this time around is to stop Gruntilda, who has returned from the dead in creepy skeletal form and looking to restore her body.Banjo Tooie does much to simplify, improve, and also expand on the conventions of its genre. Collectible items now come in bunches for easier grabbing, and labeled warp pads help you traverse the massive levels much faster. In a neat twist, all the worlds are now interconnected, so stuff you do in one world can affect the environment of another, and sometimes you need to transport items between worlds to solve a puzzle. Even the cliched environments have been mixed up a bit: instead of fire and ice worlds for example, you now get both environments in one.There is simply more of everything: more moves to master, more locations to explore, more mini games to play. Players will probably want to play Banjo-Kazooie first to get the hang of things, because Banjo-Tooie pretty much just piles things on top of it. The graphics are still pretty, and the dynamic soundtrack is memorable and catchy. This was Rareware at its top form.There's only a few unfortunate nitpicks: the framerate can get pretty choppy at times, especially in the lava world where a boss rains volcanic rocks on your head until you defeat him. The biggest disappointment though is the absence of \"stop n' swop\", rumoured to allow the swapping of secret items between the two games. Rareware has never commented on its removal, and instead dropped similiar items into the game with lame rewards. Finally, as great as Banjo-Tooie is, Banjo-Kazooie feels slightly more inspired and mysterious in its own way. Maybe it's just the general notion that a sequel, however great, can never equal the original?If you loved Mario 64 and similiar platform games, Banjo Tooie is definitely one to play. It's kiddy exterior hides clever puzzles and dialogue, and both it and Banjo-Kazooie are the pinnacle of N64 fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2005"}

In this first-person shooter, you play Jericho Cross, an outlaw who accidentally releases Lazarus, a demon vampire. Not like the Twilight ones who twinkles ridiculously under the sun and who are pro-abstinent in their blood appetite, but a real savage monster who drinks Jericho's blood and turns him into a half-vampire half-human creature. With the help of Cassidy Sharp, a great shooter who has a great voice acting from Jennifer Hale from Mass Effect 1 and 2 (female Shepard) and Spiderman the Animated Series from the nineties (Felicia Hardy/Black Cat), you try to race against time and enlist in the Darkwatch squad to try to defeat the demon your character released upon the world.I adored the idea High Moon Studios and Capcom had of using Morricone's The Good, the bad and the Ugly as its main theme. It adds a lot of epic grandeur to the game. The rest of its original soundtrack is also great fun to listen to. As for the modeling and the animation, they are well done. The cut scenes are great, except for one sex scene where your hero is clothed while the girl he sleeps with is totally naked. Although I loved the game, sincerely, I think that if you want to show such a thing as sex in a game, why not show them, or suggest through subtle erotic shots, that they are both naked. It makes the scene more believable and sincere and not too macho in its presentation.As for the voice acting, it is just perfect. Everyone is doing a great job.A great game to replay again and again.

This doesn't mean Halo is a horrible game or anything, but Microsoft has Halo and now Sony can brag with it's Killzone.Before going into the technical aspects of the game, I think it's key to discuss the controls and story. The controls, regardless of the endless complaints, are just fine. Anyone complaining about 'stiff controls' should know they could just go into their settings and up their sensitivity for the Y and X axis of their analog sticks. I increased it a tad and it's just fine to me. The turning is a little slower than games such as Call of Duty or Unreal Tournament, but it really adds a bit to the game. You're walking around in armor, you're not going to be able to turn around in a flash. I really hope they don't 'fix' what isn't broken.The story is just like any other shooter game. It's not that good, but it gets the job done. In other words: it's story is that of a typical shooter. Without ruining anything, there's rescue/extract missions, protect an area missions, and the usual 'kill everything in this area' missions. But really, expecting some ground-breaking story from a shooter is saying that you've never played a shooter. Most of these stories are the same. It's just how they handle the gameplay.The game really shines in a few key areas: graphics, audio, and gameplay. Starting with the graphics aspect, one of the first things you'll notice is how amazing this game looks and how smooth it runs. The only slow downs you'll encounter is from the loading times in between sections of a level (similar to that of Gears of War or any Halo game). These are only for a split second and have nothing really to do with graphics. This game not only looks good in it's textures and character models, but it has some of the best animations. For instance, shooting an enemy may drop him in what seems like an unscripted death sequence, but sometimes these guys will lay there \"dead\" and rise back up and start beating you from behind. This is a bit of the gameplay, I know, but the way they fall down and even get back up just looks really good. Another thing you'll notice is the extreme detail to wind, smoke, fog, dust, and lighting. A good example is watching fans shutter lights through them in some of the levels. Probably the only thing ugly about this game is the flamethrower's flame. It's fun to use, but a little bit dull as a flame in a gorgeous game like this.The audio is really top notch. The developers must have worked a good amount of time perfecting 7.1 audio. Even on a 5.1 system, this game will sound like no-other. Twirling around while enemies flank your backside is seemless. This is one of the few games that my receiver picks up as DTS supported audio. The music is good an doesn't really drown out the action. Excuse me for using Halo as an example again, but the music plays out like the Halo series. You don't really even notice it's there until a huge even is showing up or when you begin fighting a boss. I personally hate music in some games, especially a shooter. But the music in this game is placed perfectly.As for gameplay, it uses something familiar to us all: the cover system. Games without a cover system today seem a little left behind, unless there's a clean or something to make up for it. This game's cover system is a little unique, as it's similar to Gears of War or Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas, yet it manages to keep you in first person while diving into a wall. There's no camera moving into third person while leaning. I really liked this, as popping up to shoot really felt like I was in the action. Everything else is pretty similar to most of other games. There's a few new things, but mostly it's all similar to the popular shooters today. One thing to note is this game isn't limited to just a few guns. There's plenty of weapons to shoot foes with, such as shotguns, sniper rifles (which has a motion sensor function that actually works), rifles, and electric guns.Multi player is currently up and down. While the gameplay itself is an amazing experience with 32 players per match, and plenty of players playing the game, the stat system is currently lacking a bit. Hopefully this will be padded out as it's annoying that bot killers have good stats, but again, this wil probably be fixed according to the developers of Killzone 2. There's a good amount of maps to keep you coming back for more, and enough good game modes to keep you here. Hopefully, more DLC (free) will head our way and pave the way for more shooters to keep their content free for their fans.If you're planning on getting any game this spring, Killzone 2 should be it. This should help sell plenty of PS3's before the end of the year.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2009"}

Mendoza","summary":"Welcome to Helghan","reviewText":"I love playing this game. I don't know what it is about Killzone that I just keep coming back everyday to keep playing, but I'll try to pinpoint it.First, the graphics are the best we've seen on the PS3 so far. The level of detail on the environment, the soldiers, on everything is a must-see.Variety of weapons. You have your standard rifle, shotgun, pistol, sniper rifle, rocket launcher, grenade launcher, knife, flamethrower, a gun that shoots lightning (the name escapes me at the moment), and by far my favorite weapon: the bolt gun. Think of it as a nail gun with really big nails.Competent AI. The Helghast will seek cover, try to sneak behind you, or just try to make you into ground meat with their weapons. Now, my FPS experience is somewhat limited to one or two other games, so maybe there's a game that has better AI out there.But the best part is Warzone, the online element of the game. The game does a decent job of pitting you against players of similar rank, so the skirmishes stay fair. The ranking system is not for everyone, with points and medals awarded for kills and such, but I found no issues with it. I like that as your rank increases you gain different abilities like reviving fallen players, setting up gun turrets, or being able to disguise yourself as one of the enemy.Ok, so I guess I was able to pinpoint what I like about the game. There is no reason why you shouldn't get Killzone 2. Well, unless you don't have a PS3. Or you don't like FPS games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2009"}

{"product_name":"B007VFHGZ4","description":"","reviewerName":"Kristin","summary":"Amazing Game, Fun, Engaging and Very Worth the Money and Time.  Very Satisfying!","reviewText":"Good1. Amazing graphics.  Easily some of the best I've ever seen in a video game of this type.  Faces, bodies, environment, all of it is extremely well done and the atmosphere has a grittiness that you can almost feel.  The graphics are so good in fact that I actually thought the screenshots were just concept art.  No, that's what the gameplay actually looks like.  It's really amazing.  One expects for cutscenes and box art to look much better than the game play itself.  What one doesn't expect is for the cutscenes and box art to be an accurate representation of what the gameplay actually looks like and that's basically what this game does.2. The cutscenes are blended seamlessly into the action.  So you don't find yourself cutting away to see a scene and then cutting back to game play, you do your thing, the scene blends in smoothly and then blends back go gameplay.  This is one of the first games I've ever seen do that and its a pleasant change from being jarred from the action into a mini movie all the time.3. The save points are done generally very well so even if you mess something up, you aren't kicked back too far to try again.4. Voice work, sound etc are all very well done.5. The game is extremely immersive and addictive.  You can get into it very quickly and once you do, its hard to put it down.6. The story really grabs you.  It has a very similar appeal as the TV series &#34;Lost&#34; and there are a lot of mysteries and questions and as you go forward, some mysteries get solved and other questions and mysteries pop up in their place.  At times I felt as if I was almost on some parallel version of &#34;Lost&#34; and since I liked that show, it works for me.7. Really nice character development.  You learn a lot about the characters as you go including Lara Croft who clearly is not some superhuman sex hero as in the movies and previous games.  She's just a smart, tough girl who has to suck it up and find her strength in order to survive.  They do a great job of showing her inner conflicts and struggles with overcoming challenges as she progresses.8. There are times when theres an urgency and you really have to move fast and its very exciting.  There's other times when you can just take your time, look around, solve puzzles and take in the atmosphere.  So its a good mix that works well.9. The game has a good sense of humor when appropriate.  It definitely has its funny moments.10.I like how information is often revealed simply by listening to the conversations that the enemy guys are having.  It makes things a lot more realistic.  I also enjoyed how its not just hack and slash everything.  Sometimes you need to be stealthy, sometimes you have to be a little patient and wait for the enemy to turn his back and other times you can find better ways to kill them like going to a higher vantage point.11. Puzzles, especially for optional tombs but also other areas are challenging enough that you have to stop and really think about things, but not so ridiculously hard that you wouldn't enjoy them.  It hits the perfect sweet spot of fun challenge without too much frustration.12. You go through a varied environment.  From snowy mountains to swamps, shipwrecked beaches to forests and caverns.  The environment changes up a lot from area to area so you don't get bored by seeing the same thing all the time.Bad1. A lot of cutscenes.  I have this complaint about a lot of games to be fair, but still, it seemed that I spent a lot of time watching the action rather than playing it.2. While I love the idea of seamless cutscenes, my complaint with it is that there were times when I wasn't quite sure when the cutscene began or ended and I was suppose to take over and start playing again.  That made things a little awkward at times.So as you see, almost all good, a couple little issues but nothing major.  Overall an incredible game that I enjoyed immensely and I'm usually pretty harsh and critical of games too.I hope that when they go to do the next one, they remember all the things that made this one great and really put in the effort to continue to create a quality experience.  Considering I paid around $10 for it from Amazon when it went on sale, that made it an even greater value.As for purchasing this, definitely go for it, it's well worth it, lots of game play, I put in about 31 hours on it and that was to do almost everything.  Great game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2013"}

Use the 1 and 2 buttons along with the cross pad to throw hooks and jabs or to dodge.","reviewerName":"N. C. Hill \"Nchill\"","summary":"Yeah this is Punch Out alright.","reviewText":"I remember playing Punch Out and Mike Tyson's Punch Out back in the day.  As a kid i ate these games up.  It was more a timing and puzzle game than a boxing game really.  Super Punch Out was more of the same with better graphics but still captured my heart again.  Since  then i've played all those old games on various emulators over the years and haven't forgotten how much i enjoyed them.  Punch Out on the wii is exactly that, its just Punch Out again.  Im surprised it took them so long to remake this classic, if you want to make some cash, why not revitalize a beloved game.I know i'll probably get some nasty comments on this review, but i have say im not really as impressed with this version i wanted to be.  There are a few new chars and many of the classics have returned.  The motion control and balance board are pretty lousy for this game, but thankfully the classic controls are as solid as ever.  Im not saying anything negative about Punch Out itself but it just seems like they repackaged a classic with some snazzy graphics and bam here is Punch Out again.  I just felt like after all these years they could have spiced it up a little with something.That being said, i really do enjoy this Punch Out and it seems to get better as you play further into it.  The first few fights pit you against good ole Glass Joe and Von Kaiser, both very easy to beat, even King Hippo wasn't much of a problem.  Old Don used to be so easy to defeat but this time he surprised me. It took me awhile to get used to his fighting pattern, but after awhile he is easy to overcome.  Each fighter is like this though, each with a different pattern you have to learn.  Thankfully even the classic fighters don't fight exactly like they did in previous versions, so don't think you will complete this game undefeated the first time around.  The multiplayer mode is a disappointment, i was hoping you could play as some of your favorite fighters but oh well, im sure this won't be the last Punch Out...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0044SA734","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"A fun, colorful, combat-centric RPG that is flawed by a low level cap","reviewText":"Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning has everything you'd want, and to some degree, expect, in a modern Western role playing game (WRPG). There is a huge world to explore that is bursting with secrets. There is lots of lore to learn and enjoy. There are quests to undertake everywhere, factions to join, and an epic evil to overcome. And most importantly, there is tons of loot. Reckoning's main distinguishing feature is its combat, which is heavily influenced by modern action games. And by making this distinction the main focus of the game, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning succeeds in differentiating itself from the pack, as well as creating a very enjoyable game that should appeal to both fans of RPGs, and particularly, to those new to the genre.Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning's greatest accomplishment is the incredible job it does at letting you craft a combat style that perfectly suits the way you like to play. Skill trees are broken into three categories: Might (swords & brute force), Sorcery (magic attacks & buffs) and Finesse (stealth, speed and powerful ranged attacks). Once you play the game a bit and get a hang of how combat works (the game does an excellent job of letting you try out all three styles fairly early on), you can start to put skill points into any of the three trees, as well as any combination of them. Do you like to absorb attacks from enemies and perform stealthy assassinations? A Might/Finesse blend is perfect. Do you want to unleash fire and brimstone from the skies on all your enemies while having your armor constantly recharge your mana? Put all your points into Sorcery. In my playthrough I enjoyed swinging longswords and hammers, yet enjoyed the ranged fire and ice magic attacks, so I went with a 60/40 Sorcery/Might build. The game does a marvelous job, probably more so than any other WRPG I've played, of letting you build the fighter you want to build, and letting you see it pan out in action.  The combat is fast, exciting, and intuitive. And best of all, it only gets better the more you level up.Aside from the excellent combat system, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning fares pretty well in most other areas as well. The world is huge and colorful. The art design is a highlight, as most of the locations are very intriguing and unique from other RPGs, making it a treat for the eyes. The game's story is also fascinating, flipping the typical use of \"destiny\" in RPGs on its head, and is supported by some really cool lore that is there for those who want to learn about the game's universe. Unfortunately, one area where the game falters is in the actual presentation of the story. While the voice acting is superb, it is unfortunately overshadowed by some incredibly emotionless dialogue scenes, with expressionless faces and wooden animations. Why the developers also chose to crop half the screen during these dialogue scenes is beyond me, but it only hinders what is actually a very interesting game world. But Kingdoms of Amalur's biggest stumbling block is its low level cap.The game offers a plethora of side quests in addition to your main quest, and if you are the sort of completionist gamer that wants to undertake everything the game has to offer, be prepared to hit the game's level cap not far beyond the 50% mark. If you want to reach the level cap as you approach the end of the game, you'll have to skip a significant amount of the game's side quests, which is a shame. Although many of them are insubstantial, such as the typical \"find me ten of _____\" fetch quests, lots of them are actually very good, as they lead you to locations in the world that you may not have discovered otherwise, and often have well-written narratives to go along with them. I ended up skipping lots of side quests when I found myself leveling up way too fast, and good thing I did, as I hit level 40 just before reaching the final boss. This is a real shame, and a fundamental flaw in the game. And sadly, since the game's developers have been shut down, it's unlikely we'll ever see a level cap increase brought to the game.Overall, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a very good RPG that is well worth checking out for its fantastic, customizable combat system, its huge & colorful world, and lots of things to do. Be wary of the game's low level cap, though, especially if you are the type of gamer who is wary of playing an RPG without the incentive of constantly leveling up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2013"}

{"product_name":"B007A7UJ4S","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"Classic JRPG perfection - the Dragon Quest VIII of the PS3 generation","reviewText":"Back in 2006, on the classic Playstation 2 video game console, developer Level 5 stepped into the storied Dragon Quest franchise and delivered what many believe to be the best entry in the series. Dragon Quest VIII was a step forward while still retaining the classic feel of the early Dragon Quest games. Its huge, seamless world was stunning to behold, with its beautiful, cel-shaded environments, epic landscapes, and brilliant colors. In a time when JRPG's like Final Fantasy XII and Persona 3 were trying things that the genre had never seen before, Dragon Quest VIII was content in being a classically-flavored JRPG, enveloping everything that made the genre great while still very much utilizing the power of the Playstation 2 and feeling completely modern the entire time.Seven years later, Level 5 has done something very similar with Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch. In an era of more progressive JRPG's like Xenoblade Chronicles, The Last Story, and the Final Fantasy XIII games, Ni No Kuni is content to be a classic-flavored game, and it is all the better for it.Level 5 has already proven themselves to be one of the absolute best in the business, and this time they team up with another one of Japan's great art houses, Studio Ghibli, one of the most celebrated film studios in the world. Known for their fantastical animated features that are unparalleled by any other film studio on Earth, Studio Ghibli lends their vision of a game world that is one of the most stunning, beautiful fantasy worlds to ever grace the medium of video games. The Ghibli touch is everywhere, from the touching story of the protagonist boy Oliver and his quest to save his mother, to the different kingdoms of the world, each based on an animal theme, to the soaring music score by Joe Hisaishi, who composed the music for Ghibli's most celebrated films. You literally step into a virtual Studio Ghibli world, and thankfully, this is a collaboration that is even more than the sum of its parts. Level 5 has created a game with top-notch mechanics and gameplay that embrace everything that makes JRPG's great while adding new touches that ensure Ni No Kuni still feels completely modern.The combat in Ni No Kuni is a fusion of two tried and true combat systems: the Tales games and Pokemon. Like the Tales series (Tales of the Abyss, Tales of Vesperia, etc.), you will command your party in real time on the battlefield, positioning them strategically and dodging attacks until your attack gauge charges up. And like Pokemon, you will use creatures from the world, called familiars, to do most of the fighting for you. Most of the time, you will capture familiars in the wild, and you can either allow them to join your party, where they will level up along with you, or you can keep them in a stable to have on standby in case you want to experiment with them in the future. Choosing your familiars wisely and determining who they are best matched with is key to succeeding in the game, and adds a very enjoyable, addictive meta game to the main proceedings. The game world is filled with vast areas to explore and secrets to discover. Thankfully, the old JRPG mechanic of random encounters takes an evolutionary leap forward here, with all enemies visible on the overworld map, and who will flee from you once you level up beyond them, making exploration much more fun. There is a lot to do in the game, with many side quests and bounty hunts to pick up in towns that will provide much needed experience, and help you conquer the main campaign, which will take upwards of 40 hours if played straight through. Ni No Kuni is a very mechanically-sound game with easy to use systems that are easy to learn, yet challenging to master.More so than any other JRPG I've played this generation, Ni No Kuni's story was absolutely enthralling. Containing not one of the cliches that many in the gaming community believe plague JRPG's, Ni No Kuni tells a heartwarming story of a boy, Oliver, who lives in Anytown USA. After a tragic event involving his mother, Oliver is whisked away into another world by his rag doll-turned-fairy, Drippy, where he embarks on an adventure of epic proportions to save her. The story is one worthy of not just the Studio Ghibli name, but worthy of the great JRPG's that have come before it. The cast of characters are fantastically written, voice-acted to perfection, and have complex personalities that shine throughout the adventure. The story manages to remain mostly light-hearted despite a few ventures into darker territory, and remains poignant throughout. This is a long, epic game that tells a story as effectively as games that are a quarter of its length, and that really is quite a feat.Ni No Kuni is unforgettable. The game comfortably sits alongside Xenoblade Chronicles as the best JRPG of the seventh generation of consoles, and is sure to please both JRPG fans new and old. Fans of Studio Ghibli should NOT miss this, as never before have we been able to actually step into one of their films and exist in it. For that alone, Ni No Kuni is a breakthrough. No matter how you put it, the meeting of Level 5 and Studio Ghibli has proven to be a match made in heaven. Easily one of 2013's best games, and one of the best exclusives on the PS3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2013"}

The two main reasons were I wanted more storage for the new update which allows you to burn games on your hard drive. This intern allows the xbox to be much more cooler and quieter. There is no need for the disk to be spinning now thats it stored on the hard drive. Also no issues about scratching your disks especially when the xbox is standing vertically. Im really glad I upgraded. So far I have 6 games stored on the hard drive and still have space for atleast 3 more. Each game takes up about 7 GB max. The other reason I upgraded was to use the hdmi port on my new 1080p hdtv. I can really see and hear the difference from using the component cables. Hdmi is worth it on a 1080p tv. Edit: After owning this console for a few shorts months. I started having problems with it where it would just freeze. I called microsoft tech support and they got me to do some troubleshooting. Nothing helped. They finally said they would replace the console. Once I recieved the replacement I saw that it was a refurbished unit. THis replacement refurbished unit they sent me also started to give me problems. It would bring up a disk read error. After using 4 consoles, 3 wireless controllers and two wired headsets all not working right I had just about enough of dealing with microsoft and their xboxs. I really loved my xbox, the games and playing on xbox live with my friends. I didnt mind spending all the money I had on a console, wireless adapter (other consoles have included for free), xbox live service (other consoles didnt charge for this service), etc. It was the fact that every piece of equipment microsoft made for their xbox's seemed to be unreliable and faulty. I finally decided to sell my xbox. I am now waiting for microsoft to pull up their socks and make a decent product they call an xbox or maybe Ill just pickup a PS3 if Gears of War would be availble on their console. Microsoft I hope will eventually learn from their many mistakes and finally just make stuff that works when I pay a lot of money for the product. If not microsoft will just be out of business over time. Only the best and strongest survive in this day and age.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2008"}

There are promising elements of this game, and some really strong points, but I failed to find any lasting appeal.  With some more work, this could be a great game.My fun factor is a subjective experience, but my rating for this game has been carefully calculated using a patent-pending system called \"Elements of the Game\".  Every game starts with 5 stars.  Good one, huh?GRAPHICS (-1 star): It could have been worse--maybe.  The environments look okay, but the characters and enemies are rough.  It's hard not to cringe when seeing some of the graphic hiccups and eyesores.  There are some great scenes in the natural world, but it's not enough to make them game appealing.  Cutscenes are especially painful.  The graphics remind of the original Dungeon Siege for the PC--and that was a long time ago.MUSIC (+/-0 stars): The music is of the appropriate genre, but it doesn't feel right for some reason.  It doesn't draw you into the world.  Maybe it wasn't made to suit the game or just didn't play at the right times.  I can't say it took away from the game, though.SOUND (-1 star): some of the sound effects were just ugly.  The weapon attacks didn't sound right, and I swear I heard a blunt smashing sound when I hit with a sword.  Some of the animal and enemy sounds were odd and out of place.  The overall sound design was poor.STORY (-1 star): the opening sequence was horrible.  Visually it was nice, but I didn't understand a darn thing that was going on.  Something about a boat, castaways, and a weird wizard-guy with a red eye who tried to blast a sea monster and failed--and then disappeared, leaving the boat to be destroyed.  So I wake up on a beach with no idea what's going on or why I was even on the boat to begin with.  Okey-dokey!  Yeah, I gave up on it after running into some random guy who told me there was a crazy order of monks that would kill me if I went a certain direction--why?  No idea.CONTROLS (-1 star): the controls were clunky, unresponsive, and disorienting.  The camera did little to help, as it seemed to move with a mind of its own.  The combat controls were terrible!  The worst I've seen in a 3rd person game in my long playing career.  Most of the time I was just blocking and trying to figure out how to line up my attacks.  The inventory and player management system was poorly organized and confusing; why was it mapped to the D-pad?  No idea.  There was no way to tell which D-pad direction brought up which inventory system, except by trial and error.DESIGN (+1 star): there was plenty to do in this game; that was the only thing entertaining and worth playing it for.  You could find all manner of different weapons, armor, and items.  You could cook food, make weapons, brew potions, and more.  These intriguing survival-sim elements were great, but they failed to make the rest of the game worthwhile.  There seemed to be a lot of potential in the game, but it failed to put it together.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2011"}

Even on the easiest setting I die in about 30 seconds.  It's actually taking a lot of fun out of playing the game and I'm about ready to ditch this game for something more fun.

Accessing downloadable extra content and features with your Wii Points Card is as easy as entering the unique code onto your Wii onscreen menu. This impressive points system grantsyou access to bonus material in some of the greatest games from Nintendo, Sega Genesis and more. The Wii Points Card is the tip of the iceberg.Worth a whopping 2,000 points, the Wii Points Card offers you plenty of opportunities to get the bonus content you want without incurring a lot of additional costs. Each card contains a scratch-off patchconcealing your code to prevent unlawful use or duplication. Redeeming your Wii Points only requires a few simple steps, so you can get gaming in a snap.Features:* Enter your Wii Points card code at the Wii onscreen menu to download content and extra features* Access some of the greatest games for the Nintendo, Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, Sega Genesis and TurboGrafx-16 consoles* Scratch-off patch conceals code for protection* Worth a total of 2,000 usable Wii Points* Points are quick and easy to redeem","reviewerName":"bixodoido","summary":"A great way to buy classic games","reviewText":"First things first: the Wii Points Card allows you to purchase classic video games from the NES, Super NES, Nintendo 64, Sega Genesis, and Turbo Grafix 16 consoles and download them onto your Wii console.  Nintendo has many great old games available already and is adding more regularly (generally about once a week).Basic information:  100 Wii Points roughly equals 1 dollar.  You should never pay more for a Wii Points card because you can buy the points directly from Nintendo at a rate of 100 to the dollar.  On the flip side if you can get these cards cheaper (and sometimes you can buy them at a bit of a discount) you get a great deal.What's available:  There are new games being released all the time.  I have a wishlist a mile long for these games, but some of my favorites include Zelda, the original Castlevania, Ninja Gaiden, Donkey Kong Country, Golden Axe, Super Mario Brothers and Super Mario World, and Mario 64.  Again--almost every week there's something new.  A current list is available on Nintendo's website.Game Cost:  The cost for classic games varies a little but is fairly uniform.  NES games start at 500 points (at this time there is only one game that I'm aware of for the NES that costs more).  Most Super NES, Genesis, and TG 16 games cost around 800 points, and N64 games run about 1000.  Considering a nostalgia trip used to sometimes cost as much as the original game (the original Zelda used to run about $50, and that's if you had an old Nintendo to run it on) these games are a great deal.Why buy the card?: I purchase most of my points directly from Nintendo without using these cards.  So what purpose do they serve?  Simple--they're great for gifts.  I love that these come in 2000 point increments--it means my friends and family have a cheap gift idea for me and can give me something I'll really enjoy rather than trying to pick out a game for me themselves.  And of course if you've got a gift card or discount for your favorite retailer you can pick them up cheaper.  It's a great alternative to just buying the points on your Wii.Overall this is a great way to get your hands on some classic games.  You may prefer to buy them directly on the Wii (as I do), but keep this option in mind when special occasions roll around and people are asking what to get you!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2007"}

Even worse, the Xbox mics would only work on Xbox.This, on the other hand, has universal functionality: it works on my Xbox and my computer.  This means I can stow away all of my headsets and just use this one.Even better, this product works amazingly.  While using it on Xbox, I heard so much more.  The bass, the subtle sounds which I never heard before, and, even more interestingly, the balance of the sounds (which direction in the game that it was coming from).  And listening to music on my computer was even more intense.  I am excited to turn on more music.I didn't have much use for the voice adjuster, the controller is a tad intimidating at first, and it does have to be charged, but this is a product I am glad to have received.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00007KQC5","description":"This is the next terrifying chapter in theResident Evilseries. You will join Jill Valentine in her attempt to escape a nightmarish city in ruins. You must help her flee from hordes of flesh-eating zombies, hideous mutants, and a relentless new nemesis. You&#146;ll soon discover you must rely on cunning and brute force to stay alive. The game features challenging enemies that come back to life at any time, and a plot that reveals more details of Umbrella Corporation's devious activities.","reviewerName":"Scottypiper \"Scottypiper\"","summary":"Still a great game even years later","reviewText":"For starters, I have played and still own every major Resident Evil game in the series including 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and Code Veronica, all of them being on the GameCube except RE5. One of the best video game series of all times.Story: The story actually starts out 24 hours before the events of RE2, but the 2nd half of the game takes place after RE2. You are Jill Valentine from Resident Evil. Umbrella has unleashed a mutant creature named Nemesis whose sole purpose is to kill S.T.A.R.S. members whom umbrella believes will reveal their secret lab experiments to the public. Being pursued relentlessly by Nemesis, you try and escape the city after learning that the government is going to nuke the city in an attempt to stop the T-virus from spreading. You are helped in the game by multiple people but the only other playable character is Carlos Oliveira, surviving members of the Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (UBCS).Gameplay: Survivor Horror, Single-player. The gameplay elements are not much different from Resident Evil. You fight mutant zombies and creatures, while solving puzzles to advance the plot and reach your goal. You have the same type of weapons from the RE series such as hand guns, shotguns, grenade launchers, knives, with the addition of percentage based ammo weapon like the Assault rifle, and other new weapons like the Mine thrower and Rail Gun. You can also create ammo based on what type of gun powder you find and you can customize weapons from parts you find throughout the game. This is the first RE game that enabled the 180 degree quick turn-around and a dodge move. Puzzles are average with a slight improvement from RE2. While the main character can only be Jill in this game, you still can get alternate endings based on certain decision points in the game. You can also get extras like in previous RE games based on what score you get and you can unlock certain Epilogue files with each successful playthrough.Conclusion: While the controls, graphics, and sound are bit outdated, this is just a direct port of the original game. Voice acting is better than RE2, but still could use an upgrade. Gameplay is not very long, being around 3-4 hours. If you are looking to complete your collection of the RE series, this game is a must. Hopefully it will get remade in the years to come along with RE2 but who knows. It is still worth owning if you still have a GameCube or it will play on the Wii with a GameCube controller and memory card. I still rate this game as 9 out of 10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2011"}

In the beginning I wasn't even interested and thought it was going to be bad but almost every major video game blog has given it great reviews, not to mention the reviews here at Amazon are mostly positive. Still I wasn't going to buy it and I didn't buy it, I got it free with a PS Vita bundle on black friday and I'm so glad I did because I was going to miss out of a great and fun game. The minute I started playing the tutorial I got hooked. Both because the graphics are just amazing on the Vita and the gameplay is just FUN! Now I want to buy it for my Ps3 to play with my Wife and friends. I highly recommend this game if you like fighting games. The characters and moves are amazing! Sony did an amazing job!

It's all a 2-D side-scrolling adventure with a few 3-D twists. At first, I was disappointed with the game, it was not what I had expected. However, I ended up seeing the bright spots of this game. And don't go away because of what I said about the 2-D thing, if 3-D is what you wanted. It's challenging, fun, and colorful. The difference between Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic is the new &#34;homing attack&#34; as well as the Mario-style jump.  The game has potential, and is very fun to sit down and relax with popcorn and this game. The game's stages were challenging, colorful, and wonderfully designed. This game catches my eyes with eye-popping design in the stage; they took time into making it. I thought it also is something you'd like if you liked the Sega Genesis games or the SNES/GBA Mario. If you're not so sure about Sonic Generations, take what I said into full consideration.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2014"}

Sands of Time is much like Tomb Raider (which is much like Indiana Jones) with added time control gimmick. 3rd person, jump from platform to platform, pillar to pillar, etc etc...A couple of these functions are also employed in Ubi's Splinter Cell (hanging on ledges)...PROS- wall running is cool (even though probably influenced from the Matrix).- good to have a middle-eastern themed title in the mix.- graphics are fine.NEUTRAL- storyCONS- combat is button mashing, arcade-like, not much fun for many of us.- primary combat attack is a button, not the right trigger (like every single other game in existence). Counter-intuitive.- camera (view) is DEPLORABLE. Often uncontrollable and goes wherever the hell it wants to.- bad guy is a rip-off of Aladdin's bad guy, even with a long face, beard and cobra-headed staff...only thing missing is Gilbert Gottfried's annoying parrot.- too much like Tomb Raider. Gameplay, climbing, jumping, locations, etc. Combat in tomb raider is also fairly bad with its goofy infinite ammo auto-targeting stuff.- time control is just a gimmick in place of a much better function (SAVE ANYWHERE).- jumping around is often risky and hard to control (just like in Tomb Raider). Often it jumps where you don't want to, often to your death.I don't totally get why everyone thinks this game is the bee's knees. The camera view, combat button-mashing and often-hard-to-control jumping make it more annoying than pleasant to play.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000HCQK0A","reviewerName":"ShoppingGeek","summary":"Really fun for an old game.","reviewText":"I just (2009) got Crackdown and Saint's Row, having already enjoyed all the current open-world/sandbox shooters. Though these two are about the same age, Crackdown has held up MUCH better and is MUCH more enjoyable.I've read reviews saying Crackdown is too easy and others saying it is too hard. In terms of completing missions/quests, it does seem harder thanBioShock(my all-time favorite shooter),Fallout 3(my 2nd all-time favorite), andMass Effect, but easier thanGrand Theft Auto IV(with which it has virtually nothing in common). It is nowhere near as hard as non-sandbox shooters such as Halo 3 or even Eat Lead. Climbing buildings and jumping between them to get the \"agility orbs\" is a lot of fun and nowhere near as difficult as in the latestPrince of Persia.I gave this 5 stars for fun and 3 stars overall because although it is plenty of fun to play, it does not compare to the previously mentioned more recent games when it comes to graphics (good but not great), variety, nor richness of environment and gameplay, but if you have already played the other games to death, Crackdown is a fun, cheap game to play while waiting for Bioshock 2 or Fallout 4 or GTA5 or whatever the next big sandbox game turns out to be.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000HCQK0A","reviewerName":"takethekman","summary":"Mindless, Enjoyable Fun","reviewText":"First, I love the look of this game; The psuedo-animation graphics work well for this cartoonish, highly over-the-top sandbox mish-mash. This reminded me of 4 games: Mercenaries, GTA, Total Overdose(there is even one part where a song from TO is playing from a club while you take out the bad guys...)and a little The Hulk: Ultimate Destruction. While it takes awhile for the fun to really kick in(like after you have maxed out your skills a little bit...), there is no denying the simple entertainment factor here. The chaos you can cause is at times nothing short of amazing; the firefights can be intense, and many of the scenarios do require some thought and tactical planning in order to resolve them. It's tough, but just tough enough. There are some nice weapons, vehicles, and enemy variation; There are some minor control issues, but for the most part operates quite smoothly; There are def. some map and objecvtive issues, as they are not always as clear as they should be...But soon you'll forget all about those minor issues as you plug along, blowing the **** out of stuff, killing scores of bad guys, and most importantly, actually having FUN. Nothing too original here in concept, but the presentation and overall enjoyable gameplay make 'Crackdown' something worth playing!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2007"}

It has a great and lenghty story. Set in the future with the world in bad shape, There is poverty, famine, with martial law in almost all cities and a plague called grey death has broken out. You play J.C.Denton, who works in the unatco, an anti terrorist agency along with his brother paul and a few missions later you will find out what the agency really is. Besides a great story the script changes the way you play the game, Like in one mission you will be called to save a girl hostage, If you save her you will be rewarded, If you failed the game will continue it does not say \"Mission Failure - Restart Level\" ect like in other games. Deus Ex's level design is fantastic, You can go anywhere and do anything you want. All the objectives have more than three paths to complete. The graphics are not very good and the charecter animations are very ugly, but they are more than enough for the fantastic single player gameplay. I played Deus Ex on the Direct3D video mode and the game runs very smooth, The first version may be optimised only for 3dfx glide, but the latest version has a very good Direct3D support. I played it on Direct3D 800x600x32 with all detail set to high and without any trouble and the load times are very good. The bad things are the save games take large disk space and the AI is bad, Besides that it is the best game ever made and deserves the game of the year award.

Codes cant be used internationally.. must have US PSN account","reviewText":"I was unfair on my first review here. ALL of my problems were simply due to Playstation Network customer service and billing procedures. The game codes were not hacked but regardless of regional codes, you have to have a PSN account registered in the SAME COUNTRY as the game was purchased even if they are the same format. This is also true for buying prepaid PSN credits by gift cards. The store only recognizes promotional codes issued within that country. I find this very frustrating for EX-Patriots such as myself living abroad. I created a new American account and lost all my saved game data but the codes now work. Billing won't accept my credit card or address but I can buy prepaid cards from best buy and have the codes instantly emailed to me. All of this could have been resolved were the playstation customer service personnel knowledgeable. Both Origin gaming and Amazon were unable to help me establish this. It wasn't untill I tried to add funds to my account using a best buy prepaid card that I realized what the problem was.**As for the game itself, (This is coming from a MW3 player)Graphics are amazing, Flying vehicles are difficult to learn but fun once you figure them out. Maps are massive and make it difficult sometime to identify enemies and track them down. It also seems starting off that weapons don't really do enough damage. It seems unreasonable to have to shot another player 7 times with a sniper rifle to kill them.. The user interface could use some tweaking as you cant easily leave multiplayer mode between battles. The interface for making adjustments to youre charachter kits and weapons are also tricky to figure out at first and they could use better tooltips. Its not nearly as fast paced and action packed as MW3 but is a great game in it's own respect.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2012"}

Worth the extra money. The demonic USB drive alone is worth it, this thing looks awesome! Here's all the goodies that came inside:Demonic USB drive including Diablo II and its expansionAn artbook (with lots of spoilers in it)A behind-the-scenes DVDA Diablo III soundtrack3 Diablo III guest passes, 1 WoW guest pass, and Diablo II codes for your Battle.net accountDiablo IIISo... all of this stuff is amazing. Enough said. On to the review!One word: Impressed. The wait for Diablo 3 has been very, very long with information being doled out slowly, but after playing it for a few hours, totally worth the wait. Let's break it down:The Story: Picking up some 20 years after the events of Dialo 2 the world of Sanctuary is more fleshed out than ever before. The NPCs, the interactions, the quests, the general feel of the world. You can tell that years have goen into the careful construction of the world. The purpose and direction are understood but that doesn't mean that you know what's going to happen. Stopping to write this review is hard, but, when I heard of all the 1 star reviews going up due to some temporary login issues I thought I'd hop on.Graphics: I'm playing on a top of the line iMac I bought last year and the game looks absolutely gorgeous. The graphics are incredibly crisp. Everything is very detailed and just seems to pop off the screen. It's been 12 years since the last Diablo installment and it shows. The game still has the LOOK of Diablo but it just looks so amazing. It's engrossing, to put it simply.Sound: Everything sounds great. I use simulated surround headphone and everything is exactly where it is supposed to be. The music is dark and ominous, the sounds of battle are sharp and exciting, and the happy noise of picking up some loot is always welcome.Overall, this is not just a game, it's an experience. Absolutely incredible and totally worth the wait. You've waited twelve years for this, so, what's a few hours more if you're having some issues. Once you're in, you'll forget all about the problems you've been having.Yes, I'm a Blizzard fanboy. I can't deny that in any way, haha. Still, if they disappointed me I'd be the first to point it out as well.They haven't.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2012"}

Trophy has built a time machine to collect the gems and crystals dropped by Dr. Neo Cortex. Joining this dastardly group is Dr. Cortex's boss Uka Uka, a freaky floating mask that is out to crush Crash. It is up to Crash and his sister, Coco, to conquer this threatening threesome and grab the goodies.Warpedoffers 25 levels of challenging solo action. If you have a dual shock controller, this game takes full advantage of its vibration feature, which is especially fun when a dinosaur is chasing Crash. The music is appropriate to the action and the controls are easy to use. But it's the graphics that make this a stand-alone title. A team of artists worked on this game to design seamless movement that is more like an interactive cartoon than a game.Novice gamers will enjoy this title for its ease of movement and challenging gameplay. Hardcore gamers will appreciate its hidden secrets and shortcuts.

The first Crash Bandicoot and Wrath of Cortex for the PS1. I played a demo for Warped on my Spyro the dragon game and wanted it ever since. I bought it on Amazon and its safe for me to say that...THIS IS THE CRASH I KNOW AND LOVE!^_^For those who don't know Crash Bandicoot first came out in the 90's as a standard, straight-forward platformer. You're a mutated Bandicoot named Crash who escapes from the evil mad scientist Dr.Neo Cortex and must go back to save your girlfriend. In Warped Dr. Cortex now works for Uka Uka (The brother of Aku Aku) an evil mask that wants to destroy crash and take over the world. He instructs Cortex to go through time and collect Crystals and Gems that hold extreme power. Crash has to literally race through time and jump, spin, and dance his way through time to retrieve them before Cortex gets ahold of them.This game is just as fun as the first one. It brought me back to a time where video games concentrated more on gameplay and content rather than graphics which games today seem to concentrate almost too much on. The controls are spot on. You can build momentum for jumps, move in any direction, and really I never had problems with the controls even in the first Crash. One thing I REALLY love about this one is that I don't feel bad when I die! This game has some really interesting death scenes rather you're forcibly kissed by a frog that changes into a prince, eaten by lions, thrown into the screen by a two-headed fat person, or so on. When I finish the game I plan on seeing how many ways I can die:) Some worlds replicate each other but are harder and take more and more skill to get through. The boss battles are really diverse and take strategy, timing, and skill to get rid of. I must confess I found the first boss and 2 worlds extremely easy. Its not until the 3 that the game just goes \"F*** this! I'm gonna make your time a living hell\"! Its still way easy so far compared to the first game though which really did what I said above. I also noticed something that first caught my attention in Wrath of Cortex. The game seems extremely open when it comes to lives. Seriously I'm not even half way through the game and all ready up to 50 almost. I guess I'm that good at playing. Im definately buying the second one.I admit I'm disappointed at the way the turn the series have made. I wish they kept it as a patformer and just added maybe some adventure elelments to it like they did Twinsanity (even though its glitchy as hell). Naughty Dog where did you go? Crash Bandicoot Warped is just what I expected it to be. Its funny, addicting, challenging and overall just shows graphics don't make the game, but its content and gameplay.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00004SVS3","description":"Mega man 2 nes cartridge","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"a classic indeed","reviewText":"Younger Mega Man fans won't know just how popular and fun this game was back in the day, and how the years have gone by and the game is STILL a lot of fun.So many positive things can be said about Mega Man 2. The fantastic theme music, which is still the best music in a Mega Man game to date. Every single tune in this game is amazingly creative and memorable. If you don't think so you're crazy.Another thing that fascinates me is how people can never decide which of the first three Mega Man games is the best one. The first one I have never played, but they say it's extremely challenging, and because it only features 6 bosses, I don't think it's possible for me to prefer that one over Mega Man 2.Then we have Mega Man 3, which video game fans like to compete with Mega Man 2 to find out just which game delivers the ultimate Mega Man experience. Many people will try to say 3 is the best NES Mega Man game, while many others will say the clear winner is the 2nd one. Which one do I prefer? I have played 3, and while that one was also a fun, addicting action game, I think this one tops it. It doesn't smear it, it just beats it. The level design and the weapons Mega Man can equip just excite me more in this game. The creative juices were really flowing here.Mega Man 2, despite Capcom probably not completely sure if the Mega Man name will take off or not, marks where everything fell into place for the series and it feels SO MUCH like a classic because everything about this game feels so right. Mega Man 3 feels more like \"just another Mega Man game\" (though a great one- it just doesn't have that special feel, though of course many would disagree).Mega Man 4 is also a good game to own, and by the time Mega Man 5 was released it felt like players were thinking to themselves \"ok Capcom, that's enough!\". But really, all 5 of those NES Mega Man games are probably worth owning. I also have never played the 6th installment. People don't seem to like that one so you may want to avoid it. From the small amount of pictures I have seen of the game, it does look different from the previous 5. Though graphics aren't everything, so who knows if I'd like it or not.I really don't have any complaints with Mega Man 2. It's a lot of fun playing this game 15 years after I first rented and eventually bought. I can't remember where I bought it. Probably a yard sale. Back in the day you could buy NES games used at yard sales, garage sales and whatnot for extremely cheap prices. Just think, there was a point where I probably would have only had to pay a dollar for the first Mega Man game. Wow, it's definitely not like that today.I'm still angry that the video store in my town always had the Mega Man 1 cardboard box on the shelf, and when I took the box up to the man behind the counter so I could rent the game, I was always disappointed to find that the game was never available because someone never returned it, and to this day I never got to play it.Mega Man 2 offers a nice challenge, but unlike many NES games it's actually possible to beat this game with some practice. That's how a challenging game should be- hard at first, and the more you play the better you get. With practice you WILL beat this game, because there's really no place in any of the levels that can be called frustrating. Just a nice small challenge all the way through.This game has it all, folks. Great level design, fantastic music, weapons and bosses that make you want to keep coming back to it again and again. There's really nothing bad that can be said about it. It's Mega Man at his most Mega Man-y. As cheesy as that sounds, it's true!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2005"}

The epic story line will reveal secrets about Riddick's past and cast light upon his future. Features the voice and likeness of Vin Diesel.","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Great Fun, Violent, but Short","reviewText":"The Chronicles of Riddick : Escape From Butcher Bay lets fans of Pitch Black and The Chronicles Of Riddick expand the storyline. This takes place before those two movies - and you're fighting your way out of prison.First, let's point out the MATURE rating and that this involves very nasty prison fighting. Parents who are buying this for young teens who enjoy the relatively mild movies might be in for a shock. Please keep in mind that the game was made and is rated for a mature audience. They did that for a reason.Now, if you're a mature game player who doesn't mind blood and violence, you're in for a treat. Vin Diesel may not be a hallowed Shakespearian actor, but he does have his great moments, and his acting and voice work on this game are dead on. His nuances and movements translate extremely well into the gameplay. You really do feel like you're taking part in a \"new movie\". I find this much more satisfying than to replay scenes in an existing movie, when you know what is going to happen. By making this a prequel, you actually care about what is happening and wonder what's going to go on next. The plot does get you intrigued.The gameplay is what you'd probably expect from an \"escape from prison\" type of a game - sneaking around, killing off enemies, solving puzzles to get past this door or that obstacle.  Riddick can of course see in the dark, which gives some fun new twists on the usual progress of the game. The graphics are really quite nice, so your peering and sneaking don't involve trying to figure out which pixel is supposed to represent a light switch.On the downside, they didn't develop out a long, complex storyline here. You can probably finish the game in a weekend if you spend the time playing it. With all the games out there for the same price that you can play for months and months, it seems a bit odd that a modern gamemaker would put out a game that is this short. Once they have the \"hard work\" done - designing the interface, designing the models for the characters - then creating new levels and dialogue is really very easy. If they'd spent another month or so on fleshing out the game, it would have been superb.Maybe next time?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2007"}

As these survivors' allies mysteriously fall victim to dementia, it becomes clear that protecting a young girl granting them a bizarre immunity may be their only hope for survival in a struggle that could have implications for all of humanity.GameplayAlthough designed to preserve the feel of the action of the original game, gameplay inExtractionis also quite unique. First, the player perspective has been changed from third, to first-person, placing all the action right in front of you. Also,Extractionis a 'rail shooter,' meaning a shooter game where most of the action engaged in and paths followed are programmed into the mission play, instead of the freeform wandering ability built into the considerably larger Next-Gen and PCDead Spacerelease. The combination of these two changes funnels the players focus onto the combat options available in the game. In dealing with the danger of the alien Necromorphs swarming the game space,Dead Space Extractionutilizes the precision of the Wii Remote in variety of ways. Weapons like the Plasma Cutter can dispatch these enemies from a distance by taking advantage of the remote's pointing targeting ability, while a quick wave can activate weapons like the Ripper, a guidable spinning saw blade. The Wii Remote is also handy for picking up items and hurling them at enemies using the power of Kinesis.Other gameplay changes include new play modes. The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn't become too easy. In addition,Extractionalso features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed. Taken together all these changes add up to more action, more fun and moreDead Spacefor players on the Wii.Key Game FeaturesAn All-New Prequel Exclusively for the WiiFollow the lives of several different Aegis VII colony members as they carve a bloody path to survival.Meet a new cast of characters, destroy fearsome new enemies, and wield brutal new weapons.Real TerrorStunning graphics, panic-inducing audio, and a frenetic first-person perspective thrust you headlong into the terror.Play through an engrossing, interactive horror movie experience that raises the bar for storytelling in video games.Intuitive ControlsStrategically dismember your enemies with pinpoint control using the Wii Remote.Wield a powerful arsenal of abilities and weapons to freeze enemies, manipulate gravity with telekinesis, solve puzzles, and fight off attacks from every direction in zero gravity.Co-Op GameplayTeam up with a friend to fight off the invasion on the USG Ishimura with jump-in cooperative play.Combine efforts on engineering puzzles or determine specific roles to create a unique experience with each play session.","reviewerName":"Nightmare","summary":"Better than House of the Dead Overkill","reviewText":"Dead Space: Extraction (DS:E) is simply amazing for a Wii rail shooter.  Great graphics, good sounds/music, flawless controls, good voice acting, interesting storyline, and cool weapons.  House of the Dead Overkill is a good game in its own right, but DS:E takes the genre to a new level.Story ?/10: I haven't beaten this game yet, and I never played the original Dead Space (since I don't own the 360 or PS3).  However, the story so far is pretty interesting and the voice acting has impressed me.  I don't really want to spoil any of the story, especially not the first mission, so that's all I'm going to say here.Graphics 9/10: DS:E gets a 9/10 for a Wii game.  Obviously it won't compare to the 360/PS3, but compared to most Wii games it doesn't get much better than this.  Lots of crisp colors, detailed character models, and a variety of enviornments make this game very visually appealing.Controls 9/10: The controls are just as functional as they were in Overkill.  It doesn't get any better than point and shoot gameplay for rail shooters, and both games execute this flawlessly.  DS:E assigns up to weapons to the control stick on the Nunchuk (since you don't control your own movements), and the A button uses telekinesis to pick up items.  Twisting the remote sideways initiates alt-fire mode for all weapons.  So far I am more than happy with the controls and haven't noticed any problems.Gameplay 10/10: For a rail shooter it's hard to find this much quality in one place.  You have story mode that includes dialogue and story sequences and allows you to upgrade weapons, unlock extras, etc.  There are logs to discover that reveal extra information about the story so you really have to keep your eyes alert.  The real fun occurs after you unlock challenge mode for each story mission.  Here you play for pure entertainment.  Enemies appear constantly (as opposed to story mode where the action is broken up with dialogue and plot sequences) and you shoot until the end of the level.  Your earn a score based on your performance, and if it was too easy you can increase the difficulty level.  Oh, and since a second player can jump in mid-game to join your killing spree things can get really exciting.  Multiplayer in such a quality rail shooter is just awesome!Overall, I give this game 9/10.  It's not absolutely perfect, but for a rail shooter it's pretty darn close.  The controls are seamless, the weapon variety is impressive, and the presentation is beautiful.  If you liked Overkill and you like sci-fi, then you will love Dead Space: Extraction.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2010"}

Well here it is Halo 3. More over hyped then Kennedy's assassination. I also wanna make this clear: I'm NOT a Halo fan boy! A lot of these reviews here are bogus because every fan boy just blurts \"ZOMG!!1231!!!32! b3ST game tehh eVEr!!!!!\" just because it's Halo.Well let's start with the story. That's the most important thing here and yes it's delivers and answers all your questions. I won't tell you because I don't want this review canned so just play the game. The ending though is disappointing. Not as disappointing as Halo 2 but it just wasn't good enough. There are a lot of twists and surprises. The story doesn't really pick up until about half way though so just be patient. The graphics are awesome. I don't care if you think it's Halo 2 HD they are REALLY good. Full HDR lighting and high-resolution textures with bump mapping. The audio is great and everything you love about Halo is here. There is all the old stuff here plus a lot of new stuff. Tons actually. First are two best features...Forge and Theater.While theater lets you record 16 seconds of you playing it doesn't work like you think. You choose your map and you press go and it records and your done. You can save screenshots and upload which is still cool, and Forge is well...a map editor. There are also new weapons such as the gravity hammer, a Spiker which is like the Needler but spikes instead, there are new vehicles new everything.I mainly hated most was the friendly AI. It's so retarded its nuts! While someone's driving and your shooting you have to constantly do both at the same time. There will be two Wraiths on your ass and you're trying to get a bead while your stupid friendly is trying to drive up a mountain side. It gets so irritating sometimes.What I mostly liked about Halo 3 is the campaign is more varied. Not one place is repeated twice. The gameplay is always mixed up as well between, indoor, outdoor, and vehicular combat. The indoor combat sucks though because it's too cramped and it's easy to get killed. The outdoor battles are what's awesome. The places are HUGE with giant Scarabs you have to kill while tons of people are fighting around you. That's basically it really. It has a great achievement system and it isn't extremely difficult to unlock them all. Everyone's playing Halo 3 so I won't tell you to play it.The Good: It's another Halo, Top notch production values, lots of new modes among other things to keep the series fresh, multiplayer is better than ever, story delivers","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0002MPT6Q","reviewerName":"Strategos \"The Guardian of Time\"","summary":"Of course you realize THIS means war","reviewText":"There was a time when all (or did it just seem like all?) real-time-strategy games featured hours of tedious resource-gathering followed by minutes (or seconds!) of intense battle. With the creation of the ground-breaking Ground Control and Shogun:Total War!, all that changed. While Ground Control was arguably completely tactical (no wimpy construction of troops for you!), the Total War series also included a sweet strategic game of city, troop, and resource management ala Axis and Allies (the board game), or Civilization (the turn-based strategy game). Still, the key to the brilliance of the series is making do with what you have. Sure, ANYONE can win when they outnumber the enemy 10 to 1, but what do you do when they outnumber YOU 10 to 1?! And what what happens when their units are all calvary and your all infantry, or all spearmen and yours horsemen? Sometimes real tactical brilliance is shown in how well you handle failure...The creators of the Total War! Series have often emphasized that each of the games is different and stands on it's own. Some of the gameplay adjustments could be to make the game more balanced, but I get the distinct impression that many of them simply added historical accuracy. For instance, peasants in medieval Europe and feudal Japan spooked somewhat easily, but Roman troops are just a little harder to scare. Though the Romans had strength and efficiency in spades, they also had political rivalry on a massive scale and a vast demanding populace to appease. In other words, running an Empire is NOT like running a clan or a small country in a world divided. In particular, I find the aspect of the senate to be a huge boost to the strategic depth of this game. That and the allies who may or may not be on your side when it matters most. When it comes to both rivals and allies, it is often the wise course of action to go along with their schemes when they work to your advantage, and betray them when they have outgrown their usefulness...Much has been said already about the scale of the battles in this game, with thousands of troops clashing on vast vistas. While I wont' argue against the sheer awe inspired by such sights, the part of the battles which most amazed me was not the size. First of all, units have unique personality, and I have seen them chat before battle, taunt the enemy, shift back and forth while looking around, and rattle their spears and shields as they give the war-cry pre-battle. Truly inspiring (to say nothing of the speech your generals give!). The second thing I love about he battles is the sound. Sure, hearing your men sound the charge is great, but it goes WAY beyond that. You can hear the excitement (or fear!) in your war dogs, catch clues as to the condition of your troops by the sounds they make in the middle of battle, and of course you will never forget the sound of calvary galloping straight into infantry as your enemy is sent flying (the sight is pretty hard to forget too). For me though, the ultimate aural moment came when Gothic Axe-Women charged my troops (their unforgettable skin-crawl inducing war-scream scared the heck out of me!).On a side note, I should also mention that the music of this game is uniformly awesome, with mournful song played through your failures (heaven forbid), and stirring battle hyms plying through your triumphs (YES!). The last aspect of the battles I love is the camera. You can zoom right up to your cavalry as they charge, see your archers fire a sea of flaming arrows from their viewpoint, or focus on their foes and see them panic as the arrows hit their mark. The incredible cinematic nature of the battles is beyond description. You have to see it for yourself. It's like an old-fashioned historical epic that YOU CONTROL. Awesome.Rome may not have been built in a day, but the learning curve is greatly lessened by two of the best advisers ever seen in a game (part of my brain keeps thinking Victoria and I should discuss the future of empire over dinner:).Just give this game a try, and soon you'll find yourself hopelessly addicted to the world of Rome:Total War (just don't throw away the map until you have a degree in ancient geography), entranced by it's combination of rich gameplay, plentiful game modes (multiplayer, campaign, single historical battles and such), immersed in its sound, and reveling in the joy of crushing your enemies. If you love tactical strategy you must buy this game immediately. Either that or face the wrath of the senate....","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2005"}
{"product_name":"B002NIP6X8","reviewerName":"A. Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"A disappointing finale to one of gaming's most famous franchises","reviewText":"2077. Fifteen years ago, after multiple lengthy, bloody wars, the GDI and the Brotherhood of Nod have formed an alliance to bring the spread of Tiberium under control. The plan was successful and the 'Tiberium Control Network' has made Tiberium a cheap source of energy. However, a Nod splinter group led by the enigmatic Gideon has turned against Kane and is trying to spark a fresh war. This is not helped by the emergence of GDI splinter groups convinced that Kane will betray them. A new commander is recruited to lead GDI's fight against the Nod splinter cell, even as Kane's sixty-year plan reaches fruition...Tiberium Twilight is the fourth and concluding game in the Command and Conquer 'core' franchise, the Tiberium Saga. Released in 2010, fifteen years after the original Command and Conquer, it had to tie up a lot of outstanding plot points and conclude the storyline whilst also being a solid and enjoyable game in its own right. It would be fair to say it was not a great success on either front.On the story side of things, Tiberium Twilight's designers decided that, rather than bring a sense of closure to things, they would come up with an enigmatic and strange ending which would leave the player free to interpret what happened. Suffice to say, given this is a fairly schlock action SF story with some very cheesy acting, not Twin Peaks, this was not the right decision. To have the story end in this way after a decade and a half felt half-arsed and, even worse, potentially sequel-baiting: despite some sense of resolution, a C&C5; is eminently possible. The storyline is also cliched and formulaic, even by this series's standards, with the acting being cheesier than normal, apparently due to people trying to take it all seriously (apart from Joseph D. Kucan, who as normal hits the right note of entertaining camp as Kane).In gameplay terms, Tiberium Twilight is a bit of a disaster. The previous game in the franchise, 2007's Command and Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars, was unexpectedly great. It was a successful distillation of the game's traditional format and concepts combined with more modern RTS developments to create a compelling game experience. It wasn't the best RTS of all time or anything, but it was very solid. C&C4;, on the other hand, appears to have been designed by people who have never played a C&C; game before. Base-building is out. Instead, at the start of every mission you deploy a 'crawler', essentially a mobile construction yard. All of your units are built from the crawler, which can deploy and redeploy at will. This, in itself, is not a huge problem as it does introduce some fresh tactical options and considerations to the game. However, what is a problem is that there are three types of crawler, and you can only use one at a time. An offensive crawler builds tanks, walkers and heavy combat units. A defensive one builds missile and gun turrets, as well as infantry. A support crawler deploys aircraft and superweapons.In practice what this means is that you can't build men and tanks at the same time, and if you want to build turrets to defend your crawler, you can't if you also want an offensive army. If you want to mix-and-match units, you have to literally blow up your existing crawler and deploy a second one (and you can only do this a few times per mission). This is a deeply stupid decision, as it prevents you from building a mixed army and forces you to jump through ludicrous hoops to do anything on the battlefield, a problem not experienced by any of the previous eight games in the overall franchise and their numerous expansions.However, as stupid as it is, it ends up not mattering very much. It takes a couple of missions to hit on a very straightforward winning formula: build an offensive crawler, deploy some Hunter tanks and Titan walkers with a couple of Engineers to repair them (maybe a couple of anti-air units in the last couple of missions as well), destroy the offensive crawler and replace it with a defensive one, and have it wander behind the main army, dropping turrets to help in firefights whilst your main army fights on. As long as you have 2-3 Engineers and a modicum of common sense, your army is pretty much invulnerable (and all three crawlers can build Engineers to replace any lost in battle). The removal of Tiberium harvesting (you can now simply build up to your unit limit with no hindrance) also removes a large amount of tactical planning from the game.There are moments when Tiberium Twilight (**) does come to life: the assault on GDI HQ and the final battle at the Scrin Tower are both entertaining, and show how a 'baseless' C&C; game might work a bit better. But for the most part the game is repetitive and formulaic, shackled to a cliched storyline and cursed with an unsatisfying ending (not to mention some ridiculous DRM). For one of strategy gaming's most venerable and famous franchises, this is not the ending it deserved.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2012"}

Especially so because I skipped the last two (All 4 One was really just for multiplayer even though you could technically play it alone, and I learned that Full Frontal Assault was so bad that I never bothered with it).Here we have the R&C; standards you expect - crazy weapons, lots of humor, and a lot of just plain fun.  The Nightmare Box is now my personal favorite for hilarious weapons - it's a tie with the Groovitron.  The jet pack is excellent and easy to use, and the gravity tethers are a great idea.  Sadly, they're a bit underused, and the back-in-true-form fun gameplay doesn't stack up because...I was shocked, I mean REALLY SHOCKED, at how short this game is.  You could only come up with three planets?  Really?  One is an arena and doesn't count.  When the final battle, which I was assuming was just a hard boss, was over, I couldn't believe my eyes.

Not quite. I've just played through the game and I can say that it's a fun, albeit short and linear game that throws every mob movie cliche at you.Set first in the 1940's and 1950's, you play as Vito Scalleta, a decorated war hero who returns to Empire City (a fictional take on New York) and decides the life of organized crime is for him. The story takes the predictable turns where the character starts small and works his way up the mob ladder, with a few bumps along the way. The story reminded me a lot of Goodfellas, though these mob movies all start to feel the same after a while. The characters are the colorful Italian stereotypes you would expect, but some of their dialogue is downright hilarious, riddled with Italian slang and plenty of four letter words to keep you amused. There are few surprised and even fewer dramatic twists, so don't go into this game expecting a deep story. But within the context of the game, the story works and keeps you entertained until the end. Gameplay follows the standard GTA formula; drive somewhere, do something/kill someone and then drive back. You make money from doing jobs for various bosses, which can be used to upgrade your cars and acquire new clothes. Some missions are harder than others, while some are timed and require you to be a good driver. The combat is broken down into melee and shooting, though the selection of guns is limited. Melee combat is rather on the simple side, with three buttons doing the work and a limited number of combos and finishing moves you can perform. The driving and combat controls are standard for sandbox action games, so those familiar with other titles can jump right in.The 40's and 50's look of the game is surprisingly effective, with period cars all over the place and licensed music from that era playing on the radio. Mixed with the music are news broadcasts which sound distinctly from their era. For example, you hear news broadcasts about the war overseas during the 40's portion of the game. Graphically, the city looks fantastic and is a joy to drive through, and while the character animation and facial capture animation is rough around the edges, this title is on part with other games of it's type. The missions also tend to be on the easy side, but I didn't find them to be boring thanks to the voice acting and some hilarious dialogue between the characters.The negative points of Mafia II are mainly due to some missed potential. I've always complained that GTA-style games have TOO MUCH to do, with an abundance of pointless side-objectives that drag the game out. But in Mafia II, there is a total dearth of anything to do outside of the missions. You can sell stolen cars, buy clothes, eat and drink in bars and restaurants and buy upgrades for your car. That's it - no side missions to speak of. With a city as big as Empire City, you'd think there would be more to do. The game also has it's fair share of glitches and bugs, ranging from small graphical hiccups to getting stuck and having to restart from my last checkpoint.It's easier to think of Mafia II as a story-driven action game instead of a sandbox title, since it offers little outside the short single-player campaign. Having said that, I had a lot of fun with this title and I think you will too, provided that you can move past the GTA IV comparisons and appreciate the game on it's own merits.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2010"}

Bakehorn","summary":"Brain teasing is still fun","reviewText":"So quickly after their last brain-based hit, Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!, Nintendo and NST have followed up with the colorful Big Brain Academy. The questions at hand are numerous: what's with all of these brain games? Is Big Brain as entertaining, addictive, and noticeably effective as Brain Age? Is it really worth another $20 to test the brain again?Big Brain Academy's focus drives away from simply the responsitivity and reactivity of the brain and also focuses on categories like memory, the ability to compute, analyze, and think quickly. There are numerous mini-games availible to test your brain's \"size,\" and the trick here is to come out with the biggest, fattest brain possible.The mini-games in Big Brain Academy are favorable when compared to those in Brain Age. They're a little trickier. For example, one of them called \"Coin-parison\" asks you to compare two different amounts of coin and select which of the two is more valuable. Of course, you're expected to select one of the two amounts in a matter of seconds, so the game asks a lot of your mind and forces you to think extremely quickly for optimal results. Another example is the game \"Flash Memory,\" where you're forced to very quickly memorize a sequence of numbers and symbols and then duplicate them with an on-screen calculator. I'd say that the learning curve is a little higher here than it was with Brain Age, but only slightly.I discovered that Big Brain Academy not only tests your brain, but also your eyesight. Games like \"Flash Memory\" and \"Shadow Shift,\" which forces you to identify a character based on its shadow, really test how well you can see what is going on on-screen and interpret it.Big Brain Academy, for the most part, is accurate. After practicing with several of the mini-games, I took my first Big Brain Test and came out with excellent analyzation and memorization skills, but I lacked in computing and thinking quickly. This is pretty accurate to my real-life self, as well as my grade of a B-, which was my high school average.Visually, Big Brain Academy is a prettier, more colorful, and more engaging game than Brain Age. There still isn't much animation, and there is nothing exciting going on on-screen, but it all beats the Times font and gray backgrounds of Brain Age. The music and sound effects are quirky and sound a lot less like something that you'd expect from a brain game.Big Brain Academy is a much better game than Brain Age.

From the first opening scene and to the ending 15 hours later - this is a game that starts on a very high note and never misses the beat. Uncharted 1 was a very good effort too and it's good that Naughty Dog didn't just create a quick sequel, but actually went back to understand what they did right and what they didn't. Story has been developed more, hand combat is actually useful and - as mentioned earlier - gameplay has been changed to fit a movie script more than a game.Do yourself a favor and buy this game!

We're talking RE2,RE4, FF7, God Of War, COD4, MGS2, San Andreas, Tetris type greatness.  Something to be remembered forever and for all times.I don't know how many superlatives I should use to describe this game but here are a few:  breathtaking, outstanding, masterpiece, classic, monumental, engaging and the list goes on and on.  The graphics are stunning with great locations.  The soundtrack is riveting and exciting perfectly building anticipation and keeping the player engaged.  The camera angles are excellent and rarely is there a time when the camera is a problem.  The controls are very fluid and easy to remember...the aiming and guns, the platforming aspect, the stealth are all executed flawlessly.  The voice acting is superb.  The story is a great one making the player actually care about the characters.  The pace of this game is unmatched with enough variety in the way to approach battles and a great way of keeping the battles fresh by changing objectives.  When the computer accompanies you with another character they do an excellent job of keeping up and actually help you in battle (even though you will do a majority of the killing).This game deserves all the praise it has gotten and will continue to get.  This is the definitive game for the Playstation 3 and sets the standard for all platforms.  This is also the GAME OF THE YEAR (and maybe the decade) and I don't see any game coming close to this.  This game is a must have.  The only thing left now is to complete the trilogy...one last globe trotting epic adventure for Drake.  See this game is so good I'm already anticipating the next one.10 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2009"}

Wii, like all the previous releases in theSuper Mario Bros.franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiis held sideways, allowing for easy, classic inputs using the D-pad to direct playable characters, the 1 button to jump and 2 button to spit out projectiles like snowballs and fireballs. In addition, players can access powerups with their choice of either the push of a button, or by shaking the Wii remote, again demonstrating the perfect merging of classic gameplay and modern game design which isNew Super Mario Bros.

In other genres, the name Mario is synonymous with multiplayer thrills, but in the official platforming games, Luigi, Toad and anyone else in the headlining plumber's crew are usually sidelined. But with New Super Mario Bros. Wii, Miyamoto decided that this year's big innovation would be four-player support, ushering in a fresh, chaotic, friendship-ending brand of fun to the beloved series.This is not to say that the game fails to offer a compelling solitary experience. While playing alone can't offer anything as thrilling as tossing your buddy into a swarm of enemies or using him as a go-go-Gadget personal helicopter, you'll still appreciate the impeccable level design and nostalgic enemy roster. But NSMBW is most successful when it forces players to figure out a means to proceed forward together, even as they constantly push each other off into bottomless pits. Intentional or otherwise.When The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures was released on the Gamecube, I recall enthusiastically bringing the game over to my friends' place for some good old fashioned Gannon hunting. We never made it quite that far - mainly because a less adept player kept us sequestered in the first dungeon long enough so that he could bomb us to death - but we progressed enough for me to appreciate that unique give-and-take dynamic. While even the most ruthless FPS co-op campaigns minimize internal conflict by setting one collective goal, Four Swords Adventures and now NSMBW don't really penalize you for being a jackass. And of course, then you need to take into account the countless accidental deaths too.And as far as sidescrollers go, this could only really work with Mario anyway. The main games have always been praised for their flawless controls, and NSMBW is no exception. I can't think of any other series that can allow for such pinpoint jumping while still allowing you to constantly be running. As much as I love LittleBigPlanet, poor Sackboy wouldn't last a minute in the Mushroom Kingdom.And that trademark precision is absolutely necessary, because in this installment, there's already a natural propensity for jumping on your buddy's head. I don't know if Luigi's hiding a tractor beam under his green hat, but I just couldn't avoid stomping him into oblivion at every given opportunity. And based on anecdotal conversations with friends and my fellow podcast mates, I'm not alone in this affliction. You need to be ready to laugh off frustrations here, because NSMBW can be maddening.But for old-school Mario junkies, they may be too distracted by all of the new level gimmicks. While most of the music and stage themes are drawn completely from the DS original - a disappointment in my book - you'll be using the Wii remote to control moving platforms, pendulums, spotlights and more. These moments are especially fun when you've got another buddy on enemy patrol. Plus, you've got some rare Yoshi sightings, new suits and even a few clever boss battles in your own personal clown copter. Sometimes you'd wish that these moments would be fleshed out a bit more, but there's a reason why gamers still talk about Kuribo's legendary footwear even though it's only ever been seen in one level.On the other hand, while I'm glad to see so many enemy cameos from previous games, the familiar faces sometimes take away a sense of identity. We haven't seen Monty Mole or Rocky Wrench in ages, so their returns are welcomed by this Nintedo geek. But why didn't Miyamoto's team extend invitations to new enemies? There are a few original designs here and there, but by the end of the game, you can count them on one hand.After Super Mario World debuted, Nintendo could have pushed a sequel out in just a year or two. But instead, Miyamoto waited until the system's twilight years to create Yoshi's Island, arguably the pinnacle of the genre and host of dozens of new enemies. While Yoshi's first big outing was only a Mario game in tacked-on subtitle only, it did seem to carry the torch for the 2D games until this most recent installment. NSMBW therefore has a lot to live up to in my mind, and while the level design and four-player stuff succeed, I think that koopa nostalgia will only get you so far.These issues might bug me as I write this, but whenever I pick up the controller, these gripes tend to vanish pretty quickly. Like Yoshi's Island's red coins and Super Mario World's 96 goals, there are dozens of \"Star Coins\" that I need to go back to collect. Even without these additional goals, the unbridled joy pressed to this disc would be enough to get me to replay a dozen times over - exactly as I did with the cartridge-based Super Mario Bros. games 20 years ago.--Reviewed by Justin Hemenway","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2009"}

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"Katie \"Dark Musashi\"","summary":"Fun, Innovative, Value Priced, and Recommended for Everyone!!","reviewText":"I camped outside of a store for 8 hours in 36 degree weather for this console, and it was so totally worth it. If you can get your hands on one, do it.Pros:- This system encourages everyone to play because it is fun and easy to pick up, even for non-gamers. The games are catchy and entertaining for everyone. If you are a parent (I'm not, I'm a college student) most of the games are appropriate for children. Nintendo games are generally much more kid-friendly if you're worried about ESRB ratings. This doesn't apply to all of them (I wouldn't recommend Red Steel for a 5-year-old), so just check the ratings. However, you will find that many of the games are rated E.- It comes with a game already, and it is a darn fun one. Wii Sports is worth playing for hours and hours and is a fun party game. It isn't just some throw-in to try to make the console look more appealing. You do need a nunchuck for Boxing, so if you want 2-player boxing you have to buy another nunchuck and controller. However, the rest of the Wii Sports games just use the wii-mote.- Each person can make a \"Mii\" on their console - A little character that you can make to look just like you! It appears that you can create unlimited Miis and mark one as the \"favorite\". You use your Mii in Wii Sports, and according to the directions your Mii may appear online and in other games as well. They are very detailed and fun to make.- There are great online functions, like being able to play games with others online, having a \"Mii Parade\", and even checking the weather!- You can store pictures on your Wii with an SD memory card.- The Wii has slots for gamecube games, 4 controllers, and 2 gamecube memory cards on a covered panel on the top of the console, so you can play gamecube games.- The games are priced at $50 on release, unlike the $60 Xbox 360 and PS3 games. The console is also value priced much lower than these other consoles and is in much better supply (although since it just came out, you will have trouble finding one initially).- The current games are great, and there is an awesome list of games coming out. Notable current ones include The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (also on Gamecube), Wii Sports, Trauma Center: Second Opinion, Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz, and Red Steel. There are also some sports and first-person shooter games for it, mostly interactive. Some notable games coming out later are Elebits (12/15/06), Wario Ware: Smooth Moves (1/15/07), Smash Bros. Brawl (spring 2007, but will probably be pushed way back), and Mario Galaxy.- The controllers are responsive and accurate, so you needn't worry about them spazzing out on you or not working properly. There are no wires to get in your way and you can place the sensor bar above or below your TV screen.- Nintendo values their customers, and if you have a problem with your console (which you probably won't because they only release quality merchandise, unlike Sony) they will send you a shipping label and fix it right away if it's within warranty. I have had experience with this and trust me, it is very good. I had my DS back with a new screen in 3 days last January; it was amazing. You also get an 90-day extension on your warranty just for registering your Wii online.Cons:- As far as extra controllers go, you have to buy each wii-mote and nunchuck extension separately. Right now the wii-mote costs $40 and the nunchuck (sold separately) is $20, and one of each comes with the console already, so if you want 4 full controllers total you have to pay an extra $180! However, you do not need the nunchuck for every game (you do need it for Wii Sports boxing, fyi), and the console does come with one. I sprung for the extra $40 and just bought another wii-mote without an extra nunchuck, and it's still good for a lot of multiplayer action.- The controllers take 2 AA batteries each, and are rumored not to last too long (maybe 20 or 30 hours at best). I haven't had mine long enough to verify this, but since all the controllers take batteries I would recommend buying a rechargeable battery unit.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2006"}
{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"Benjamin S. Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"A wow-A-Thon in every way. And that come from a guy that is not a fan of the FPS genre.","reviewText":"I've seen first person shooters come and go. I never was a huge fan of the genre and even greats such as \"Halo\" did not endear me to the overall premise of running around in lack luster areas to blast the hell out of other people wearing red or blue suits.Truthfully I had fallen from grace becoming a jaded shrew. I did not believe an FPS could instill in me one iota of genuine emotion or push the boundaries. Then came Bio shock.Have you ever been proven wrong and loved every bite of your humble pie? Well for me Bio Shock did just that. From the moment my plane crashed violently  into the ocean and I was sputtering as I swam to the tower that would take me to my fate in the under water city of rapture I was pretty much hooked.I could say Bio shock is great in that it let's you master and upgrade a plethora of powers that tweak your genetics. If you want to lift things with your mind and toss them at enemies or electrocute them in the water with bolts of lightning crackling from your finger tips you can! However the later \"plasmids\" as they are called are truly original. Ever thought you could send a swarm of bees after someone with a mere gesture? Ever wanted to have the ability to create realistic decoys that can confuse your adversaries as you make a stealthy get away? This is \"good stuff\" and its' obvious the team put a lot of thought into these concepts instead of having a \"bigger is always better\" mentality. Yes, you can upgrade your guns too and they do get meaner looking but for me the draw of the game play is using plasmids in interesting new ways. Unlike other shooters many things in your environment can be effected by your powers. You are forced to become accustomed to this because your plasmids are not just used for fighting enemies but also used for solving problems.Now that I got that out of the way \"plasmids\" by themselves would already make this game \"fun\" even if the story sucked and the environments were pretty bland. But I'll be damned if 2K did not go all out. Rapture is a place of grotesque beauty. Everyone has a \"I'll step on you to get ahead\" mentality and they are all addicted to Eve and Adam which fuel their own plasmid powers. These horrors of lost humanity are called \"Splicers\" and it is as much what they believe that makes them monsters as what they look like.Can you imagine living in an art deco city during the 1940's if everyone adhered to Ayn Rand's \"Selfishness is a virtue\" mentality and the greatest artistic and scientific minds forsook morality and ethics to push the envelop of conventionality? Chances are you would get Rapture.I suppose the things I like about the main villains is that as complex and as brilliant as they are you still have plenty of reasons to hate them. The designers are not trying to make you sympathetic to them or to even make you question what is truly right or wrong. They just want to chill your spine with the revelation that what the bad guys believe in is an impressive argument for the masses.Sadly there are a lot of wretched people out there who despise individuals who have disabilities and who hate charity. Capitalism and greed is a big part of the world's dynamic and Andrew Ryan's most impressive argument is every man deserves compensation for the sweat of his own labors without having to give it to the poor or the needy. For a split second that theory almost makes sense. But then when your gaze turns back to Rapture and you see everyone out for themselves slaughtering each other you're given your slap of reality to make you realize how flawed and evil Objectivism can truly be.This very struggle to maintain your own compassion is metaphorically played out through the little sisters and Big Daddies. The behemoth Big Daddies protect the little sisters as they routinely go around gathering Adam and eve from Corpses with a huge syringe. The Splicers are always trying to brutally kill these poor little girls to take their \"juice\" so to speak. By bringing down the big daddies you can brutally murder the little sisters too, however you can also save them by absorbing just enough Adam into you to turn them  back into normal children.For me it was a no brainer. I have a soft spot for children so of course I'm not going to slay them even in a video game. However YOU do not have to be a bleeding-heart softy. Slaughtering little sisters WILL give you more Adam right away to upgrade plasmids and buy you new ones but you will not get \"thank you\" gifts from the wee ones later on.Whether you are good or evil makes not much difference. Either way close to the end of the game you're a hulk of awesomeness that can blaze a trail through squashed splicer corpses.Everything from the music to the balanced difficulty and atmosphere in Bio Shock is spot on. The only part I found teeth gnashing hard was an escort mission in which you have to protect a little sister opening doors for you. In truth you can call another little sister after the first one dies but for someone like me who wants a perfect achievement and clean conscience I'm not cashing in until the first sweet little lass makes it safely to her transport tunnel.In closing that's what I'm getting at. I actually \"care\" for the little sisters. I truly want to see what is around the next corner and be surprised by the next revelation. For an FPS to give someone like me such a great time is a testament to its' quality.Pros+The people truly talk like they are from the 1940's and 1950's.+A great story line with many unexpected twists and turns. Right when you think its' all coming together it falls apart completely as you find out yet another master mind is pulling the strings behind the shadows.+Plasmids are fun to use and genetic enhancement is a fascinating aspect to put into a first person shooter.+The areas are truly fun to explore and every place in Rapture has its own haunting or revolting charm.+You genuinely feel sorry for the victims that got trapped in Rapture making you want to smite the villains that much more.+Perfect atmospheric music and every structure has an art deco motif faithful to the era it takes place in.Cons-The game is pretty big but it is still an FPS, not a role-playing game. If you are a fanatic you could likely finish it in a single sitting but that is only if you have time off work, your groceries are stocked, and you do not have to do anything else. Honestly though I'm far into the game I could not finish it my first night playing.-The story is linear fare but last time I checked most FPS games have a single driving goal so I did not even see being led around by the hand as a glaring flaw. You can still thoroughly explore each environment at your leisure even if you get the go ahead to take the transporter to the next floor.-That there need to be more FPS games handled with this same amount of love and care in the future so I do not have to endure anymore hyped up meat-head halo fan boys.

Little things like having your black market weapons/vehicle purchases disappear if you die or exit the game.  Having manual saves put you back at checkpoints.  And there are a couple of bugs on the PC game.  The one that really sucked was when you are sent to blow up an offshore oil rig.  If you attack it and destroy more than 15% but less than 85% and then die, you will not be able to finish the mission.  That's because when you start up again, the program doesn't register what you've already destroyed in your fist attempt when you blow it up again.  And you need to get to 85% to finish the level.  So if you blew up 30% of the targets in life 1, your maximum possible score in life 2 is 70%.  It took me a while to figure this out, and I wasn't the only one.  To fix this you have to completely exit the game, and then restart it and that will reset the damage meter.This game really could have used more dev time (although what game doesn't?).  Refining the game mechanics and eliminating the bugs would have made this a easily a 4 star game.Other thoughts: My favourite two mods were playing as Kane (the hot helicopter pilot) instead of the grizzled dude, which made the game easier on the eyes.

Of course the sand itself has to be interesting, and it is in Just Cause 2, but it feels like the game is always working against itself in ironic ways. The story is pretty much not there at all. You play as Scorpio who is sent to Panau to find an American guy, and yeah, that's about it. Even the voice acting is iffy, but you'll be tossing the story aside and enjoying the fun instead.The game is huge with lots of islands to explore, but my biggest gripe is getting there. You can call in vehicles from your black market buddy for a price, but shouldn't unlocked vehicles be free? If you destroy that vehicle and you're still 10 kilometers away from you destination you're pretty much screwed to driving around and that gets very boring. Don't ever drop a plane in a city street because if it gets stuck you're $30k is wasted since you can't back it up. Sure you can dual hook it to a large vehicle to correct it, but this is tedious and insanely stupid. The driving is pretty frustrating, and I would restart missions dozens of times just because I couldn't control the car well enough.You can also upgrade your vehicles with parts you find during missions as well as upgrading weapons. The whole transportation thing is kind of solved with an extraction option, but you must have discovered the area first. You can use your grappling hook to cover long distances on foot and pretty much use it for everything from tethering enemies to cars and dragging them around to pulling guys off bikes. You can tether to any surface and it's got a huge distance of about 100 meters. This is good for scaling buildings as well, but use your parachute to for awesome Hollywood type stunts.You can get out of a vehicle and ride on top or hang around and this is good when chasing people in cars or in the air. About to crash? Jump into another car, not another car around? Grapple to the next one. This can be great fun if you use your imagination, but that's the furthest the thrills get in JC2. The gun play is pretty weak and while they pack a punch there's no aiming system, and weapon selection is a bit confusing. You can toss grenades and there is a good variety of weapons, but it could have been better implemented.The missions aren't too exciting especially the side missions, and the only other type are races to earn money. You unlock different mission types by causing chaos, and you can also unlock weapons and vehicles as well. The main missions are what are the most exciting, but there's only seven of them, and the game relies too heavily on boring side missions. While this doesn't sound too terrible it's not, but after awhile say 4-8 hours into the game you really get tired of it.The game looks amazing with DX10, but the physics are a little glitchy. I also highly recommend using an Xbox 360 controller for Windows since the keyboard and mouse combo suck for this type of game, and are really frustrating. Yeah try controlling a car WSAD style and using X as the handbrake. I know you can re-configure the controls, but it feels the game was built for the controller. Cars are easier to control, and it just feels tighter this way. The game just feels a bit too generic and could have had a lot more character and depth, but what we have is way better than the first game, and a lot to build on in Just Cause 3.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Infact, I am big fan of racing games in general and have played many titles.  I have to tell you that this game is alot better than what I was hearing.  It's kind of like the old hot pursuit but with PS3 graphics.  I still like NFSHP2 on the GC and PS2 much better and I highly recommend you get one of those.  You think you are a good racer, try one of those. lol  My wife and I used to play both the GC and PS2 versions and ruled the roads when those games were new.  Since the PS3 came out, we got used to racing on that system with newer racing games.  Well recently, we went back and popped in the PS2 version again and it whipped our hinys.  That version is much harder than this new PS3 title and way more fun, but I got this new one as a Christmas present even though I had forgot to tell them to strike it from my wishlist.  I am glad they got it for me.  It's a lot of fun and so far the races have been pretty easy, but not too easy.  A few even presented somewhat of a challenge and it felt good when we got gold on them.  The graphics and sounds are really good.  The cars are nice and handle well.  Tracks are pretty cool too.  I am not much for being the cop and hate to start the cop races, but once you start them you really get into them while chasing the runners.  It feels cool when you finally bash a racer out and then on the to the racer up ahead. One by one until you have all of them nailed. =)  So even though I prefer being the chase-ee, it's pretty fun being the chaser too.  There is also a free drive mode as well which is an awesome mode to have when you just want to drive and chill a bit in your ride.  About the curves in the road at high speeds...those of you who are good at drifting will have no problem.  Try using nitrous and drifting at the same time...FUN!  Overall, not a bad game.

It was the reason that I bought a PC instead of an expensive console.  At the time, you couldn't get a better shooter on the PC.  Times change however, and so did Max Payne.  By in large, for the better.  The graphics are better.  Much smoother.  The first game had a real comic book feel to it.  Max Payne 2, while still having the storyboards, seems to be more like a movie.  I thought the gameplay had everything, and more, that the first Max Payne did.  More weapons, better graphics, more dark, and a long complicated storyline.  The relationship between Mona Sax, and Mr. Payne, ends up distracting from the game unfortunatly.  It makes for some cheesy cutscenes.  The voice acting, and dialog are painful at times.  It's ok for a game like this to have some vulgarities in it, but the half baked voice overs make them hard to listen to.

Here's my review:Graphics: 8/10:Beatiful. Visually stunning. Unless you have a pixel shaded supported video card compatible with morrowind in your PC, you ain't gonna see the special incredible water effects you see in MORROWIND on the XBOX. The reflections, the ripples in the water, the way it reacts to any NPC or PLAYER swimming or walking or running in it, the graphics are stunning. And the shadows are no better than they are on the PC otherwise. The texture resolution on the XBOX is a bit lower rather than it is on the PC, but that is because XBOX only has 64MB of shared between CPU and graphics board chipset 210mhz onboard DDR-SDRAM, and for the XBOX to render a huge detailed open-ended game like morrowind at a decent frame rate, lowering the texture resolution to fit properly into the XBOX's memory is required. I think the XBOX runs MORROWIND much faster than my PC does, even with my new ATI Radeon 9500 Pro. If you want a smooth frame rate in morrowind on the PC, you want a really fast processor. Overall graphics are great on the XBOX.Audio: 8/10:Same as the PC. Not different at all. Still great though!Game play: 10/10:Just as good as the PC. No different. It offers just as open ended game play as the PC offers. And has a movie scene when you start a new game to juice up the past :PStory line: 8/10:Of course, no different than the PC, but still great.AI: 9/10:No different than on the PC. AI has it's errors and glitches, but ain't anything special. Can be ...tough though. Overall good.Overall score: 9.2/10.Final word:MORROWIND was a great port on the XBOX. Hopefully the expansion packs for it can be ported onto it too :) I suggest this for big time RPG XBOX GAMERS, although they might question is this the right kinda RPG on XBOX.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2003"}

What I like best about this game is that its a smooth process from beginning to end.  As I'm playing the game its like watching a movie at the same time.  there will be cutsecenes every couple of minutes but that's what keeps the gameplay and story moving in a smooth process.  there are puzzle challanges in the game but they are simple,  if you need help the game will give you a hint and you can quickly continue playing the game.  there's a lot of climbing and jumping as well.  On hard the game took me about 9 hours to complete. those people that say you have to be behind cover to much is not true.  stay in one location or cover to long and the enemy will continue to throw grenades so you have to keep moving.  you can easily run and gun if you move quickly and evade and dodge.  At times that's exactly what you have to do if you want to survive.  At times you can either use stealth and eliminate enemies one by one without being noticed or just gun blaze.  If you watched the movie National Treasure by Nicolas Cage you'll like this game.  For those who complain there's not enough exploring there wrong.

Bound in Blood is a rather complex tale that once again raises the specter of revenge and cursed treasure, amongst a backdrop of the western frontier.Players are introduced to Ray and Thomas McCall, two brothers in the Confederate army that desert their posts to save their family home from Union soldiers. Seeing the destruction of their land and swearing that they'll rebuild their property one day, the McCalls head west to seek fortune and glory. However, going AWOL infuriates their former commander, who declares that he'll hunt them down to the ends of the earth for their abandonment of the Confederate cause. Fleeing both the Confederate troops on their heels and various lawmen from some of their illegal activities throughout the country, the McCalls eventually connect with the Mexican bandit leader Juan and his concubine Marisa, who has information regarding the treasure of Cortez. The McCalls will also have to deal with the Apache, whose connection with the gold could potentially threaten the entire West.It may sound convoluted, but the story is told rather well and all ties together in the end, providing a solid background for the events of the prior Call of Juarez game. Like the previous title, you'll play as either Ray or Thomas, and you'll have the option to choose which brother you'd like to play as for most of the game. As far as fighting is concerned, the two McCalls have completely different gunslinging styles. I'll say no more.The multiplayer of Bound in Blood is expanded from the original game, featuring thirteen character classes that you'll eventually be able to play as once you unlock eight of them by winning multiplayer matches. Each character class has a variety of weaponry, but also has different health and speed stats as they are deployed into battle. As you kill other players during a battle, you'll receive money during that match which can be spent to upgrade that character's stats.As a prequel, Bound in Blood does a good job of presenting the characters, their storylines and what eventually leads back into the franchise history. It also packs in a ton of fast action, loads of explosions and a heavy dose of duels against opponents that want to see you in the dirt.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2009"}

The bundle it comes it is not bad either, okay it's the exact same thing as you get with the regular Wii but they added Wii Sports Resort to the pack and you can't go wrong with that game.WHATS NEW?:The Wii innovates with its controls as you really make the move,best example would be Wii sports included with the Wii,it makes your gamer at home do some exercises while having some fun.Nintendo Wii can appeal to nearly anyone from the 3 year old kid to the seventy-eight years old grandmother.Its a unique system to say the least that is fun and original as well as full of options for example you can buy a classic controller if you don`t like the Wiimote.LIVE CHANNEL:The Live Channel allows you to buy classic games from the NES,SNES,N64 which adds to the console.Playing a classic like Super Mario 64 on a new console is great.You have to buy point cards to buy games but its worth the bucks you will spend,the library of games available continues to grow,playing the first Zelda again is fun,the points varies like a game can be 1000 points.GAMES:A few good games were launched and great ones keep coming.Zelda Twilight Princess proves to be the best selling game of the Wii so far,Rayman Raving Rabids and Wario Ware Smooth Moves are fun and original games making great use of the Wii controls. Super Mario Bros Wii, Mario Galaxy and others have proven to be fun games for the Wii. There are the now popular exercise games like Wii fit which gives you physical benefits.It is also to not that the Nintendo Wii comes with a game. Wii Sports is creative and fun and for a game that comes with a console it proves to be a winner,with games like Wii Boxing,Tennis,Golf,Baseball,Bowling that you never get tired of,its a great party game.I don`t like the fact that there nearly are not any mature games(17+)which the PS3 and 360 support,that's what is lacking to the Wii in terms of games but there are some such as the excellent Madworld.GRAPHICS:Cannot compare to the PS3 or XBOX 360 at all.The graphics are a little better than the Gamecube to be honest,that's a minus to the Wii.The graphics of the Wii are simple but cool,but if you're looking NEXT-GEN visuals this is not your buy. However the Wii is the console that gives you a truly unique experience because it's competitors while having good console don't offer anything revolutionary like the Wii does.OVERALL: The Wii is fun,innovative and easy to get used to.A must-buy for anyone,even if its a second console.Easily the choice for partys and multiplayer.Maybe the Wii is not a DVD,HD-DVD or Blue-Ray player,graphics but it is surely the console that is the most fun! Some may wish more was included with the black Wii but I think those who really want it will pay money for it. I don't think it's worth selling you original Wii just to get this one unless you really want this black Wii.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2010"}

This game, to me, is better than Madden 2013. I like some of the features other reviews described but after a few games I put it up for a month, then play it a few more times and repeat.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2012"}
