We were very excited when we saw the new Lego Indy.And after playing it for 2 hours we were completely frustrated with it!! In the temple of Dome with the airplane we were clueless!!! As to what needed to be done to move on. We kicked, punched and destroyed everything in the room but nothing happen we were stuck!!! I had to get online to find the answer.I think the designer rushed to get this game out, because many times I was stuck in out of camera areas that I had no idea how I got there. And many times I'd hit the tringle to change people and it would drop me out of the game instead, it has many flawess. Even people who give the game 5 stars say \"the game is frustrating!!\"I don't know if they were trying to appeal to adults by making it more challenging but it's more Annoying then challenging; trying to figure out what to do in each level you just want to throw the game in the garbage!!If it wasn't for it being a lego game I would have never bought it.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0050SVGU0","description":"Mario Party 9","reviewerName":"JASEFAT","summary":"Great Party Game!","reviewText":"There are a few things I love about this addition to the Mario Party series.1.) The graphics and animations are much smoother, both traversing the board and within each minigame, than that of Mario Party 8.  I credit some of this to the fact that the game now supports widescreen televisions (no more black borders).2.) All characters travel together, which makes faster gameplay.  The spaces on the board keep the action fresh, including stars actually located on the map.  This goes in tandem with each person assuming the role of \"captain\" on their turn.  There are events on each map in which the captain can seperate players or dole out items, which forces players to consider their moves a few turns in advance.3.) You can eliminate computer players and still play the same levels.  No condensed levels or objectives are available for computer or non-computer gameplay (as opposed to Mario Party 8).This game is fun in every capacity.  Fans of the game, or newcomers alike, will not be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2012"}

Bayonetta, developed by Platinum Games who worked on Viewtiful Joe and Okami, have basically made what people want to describe as the \"action genre evolved\", the new standards to which the next Devil May Cry or God of War have to live up to. While there's definately some moments that I can legitimately say no game has ever done for, there's other parts where I lament its inclusion or wish something was tweaked so it wasn't a certain way. Essentially the game, unless you're an action-game master, might be a tad too difficult for people with nimble reflexes, good understanding of the combat and some rare instances of almost needing clairvoyance to avoid the \"where'd that come from?\" deaths. For in Bayonetta you have one of the most fluid battle systems to be in a game, you also have trial-by-death moments, a tonally-off storyline and parts that don't give the game any favors. Least we'll get one hell of a sequel though. Possibly.Story: You play as Bayonetta, an Umbran Witch part of a clan that's more or less on the \"bad side\" which wars against the forces of Heaven, or the Lumen Sages. Having been re-awakened after 500 years of being sealed away with no memory, Bayonetta embarks on a quest to discover her past, her connection to a little girl named Cereza and artifacts known as the \"Eyes of the World\". The problem with the game as a whole as far as its story is concerned is that its hard to tell when the game is taking itself seriously and when it's poking fun so the game is either really serious with slapstick thrown in or satire/comedy with odd pathos moments mixed in. Not to mention for some people it might be hard to follow and outside of Bayonetta herself, the characters aren't incredibly likable but like Devil May Cry, story is just an aside to the action.Graphics: Graphically, the game isn't quite a \"holy ****!\"-esque stunner but the game is very-well animated with the character animations for moves, certain levels such as Paradiso levels looking flat-out gorgeous while enemy designs, especially bosses, are imposing, weird and screen filling. In fact there's one boss in the game that practically eclipses the final boss of Shadow of the Colossus and that guy was a tower. But then the game does do this weird stylistic thing where cutscenes play out more like animated comic strips with no lip-sync but just a character pose and lines of dialogue which jets around to another frame to present another look at the cutscene. It'll either be cool or just...weird.Sound/Music: Another oddball soundtrack which combines jazz and epic orchestral themes and part of it just doesn't work. While we're a long ways to the awful metal track that permeated through Devil May Cry, at times you'll hear a nicely done orchestral theme and then you run right smack into a jazzy theme and yes, even a J-pop song and unlike some games which usually one J-pop theme with the main type of music throughout, it goes back and forth so much and the music itself might not seem that memorable either. Voice acting also is somewhat stilted and while Bayonetta and the character Jeanne are nicely done, everyone else is kind of ridiculous and the mastermind behind the whole ordeal is so droll in his voice and thanks to a long cutscene, you might be in a snooze before you realize you gotta fight the dude.Gameplay: Bayonetta is similar to Devil May Cry's battle system where a certain command is used to start a move as opposed to say Ninja Gaiden or God of War which was a combination of X/Square and Y/Triangle but here, there's things like \"tap forward twice and Y\" or \"rotate left analog and B\" but what makes Bayonetta work as an action game is just how well it works and God of War 3 does have its work cut out for it because I'll be honest with you, I button mash God of War yet I learn Bayonetta/Devil May Cry systems. One especially useful tactic is Witch Time where if you press RT when you're about to get hit you activate a bullet time for a few seconds which allows you unfettered access to wail on enemies without fear of being attacked though strangely as you progress in the game certain enemies aren't even affected by Witch Time and you just dodge the move regularly. In addition, Bayonetta has guns and unlike DMC's candy shooting pistols, they're nicely useful here and with guns strapped to her feet and held in her hands, that's 4 guns to use on enemies and it's fun to \"breakdance\" and just spin around on the floor and shoot everything in sight. And you can also buy abilities that'll change you into different forms such as the Panther (a fast runner and quick getaway in battle), Crow (a flight-based attacker that flies for a bit) and Bat (click RT when you've just gotten damaged and you turn into a bat, negating that damage though I can never get the timing down). All in all, there's a huge arsenal of moves to use and with a loading screen acting as a training ground with move lists ready to be read and used, it's fairly easy to pick.That being said, Japanese game developers, especially when it comes to action games tend to be, well, a lot more better than the average player and at times it feels like that's how the game was made, a game for experts. Granted there is an easy and very easy mode but for most people, Normal tends to be the default and when you're getting your ass handed to you regularly in normal encounters, bosses that are very cool and inventive but some take way too long (final boss for sure) or quicktime events that come out of nowhere, it might frustrate a few new players and I've beaten Ninja Gaiden 2 on Mentor (well, Sigma 2 I should say, NG2's a mess) and even I was having problems though I suppose practice will make perfect. However, that doesn't excuse certain sections of the game that quite frankly don't work, the out-of-the-blue Quicktime events or the astronomically high prices of the accessories which practically encourage farming or replaying to the Nth degree. Some might enjoy it but I like it when I can afford everything reasonably, not replay a mission 12 times to afford one thing only to find out there's 10 things I gotta purchase.Bayonetta is certainly a better feeling action game all-around though certain issues I have with it will most likely be corrected if they ever do a sequel but as a first game, this thing is top-notch but to avoid mentioning certain problems it has I think would be a mistake but give it a try, it'll either be the best action game all year or one of the better ones that could've been the best.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2010"}

A game that is proudly an opus to style and flash, Bayonetta takes the gameplay model of Devil May Cry and makes it significantly more fun and enjoyable and provides a much more enjoyable main character to manipulate.To describe the story is to give it more meaning than the writers did. It is an absurd story with almost no semblance to actual logic. You are Bayonetta and you are seeking to kill angels. You have a sidekick who is an annoying Mafia-type that seems to have no business being involved as he seems to do nothing. The game does not appear to take it itself all that seriously and, thus, is willing to simply have fun with all of the silliness. As insane as you think much of the game is, you get the distinct feeling that the characters on-screen are even more aware that this whole affair is absurd.What Bayonetta lacks in storyline depth (which is not an inconsiderable amount, mind you) it more than makes up with an incredibly deep combat system that somehow takes about three buttons and produces dozens of attack combos. It is a game that is quite easy to do really cool looking attacks with, but that will take you a lot of time to become actually good at the combat system to be able to really dominate your foes. It constantly rewards you for trying new things and that is an absolute necessity in this type of game.This is a game well worth looking into and spending some hours with. I don't think it's worth $60 personally, but the eventual sequel likely will be. This out Devil May Cry's Devil May Cry. Simply the best character-driven action game on the market today --- well, unless you count that God of War remake on the PS3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2010"}

Now he's chasing them across the Game Boy Advance inCastlevania: Circle of the Moon. He'll use his trusty whip, as well as a few magical items, to combat Dracula and more than just a few foul minions. The game takes advantage of the GBA's rich color palette to create detailed, moody environments and intricate spell effects.","reviewerName":"Benjamin Denes","summary":"Must buy game for Advance","reviewText":"Finally, classic Castlevania has returned to a Nintendo system. The closest thing, sadly enough, that came close to a great N based 'Vania game was Belmonts Revenge for the original Gameboy. After that game a bunch of 3d games for the N64 that were pretty uncool. Now, though, Circle of the Moon proves to be not only a nice throwback to the classics, but step to the future as well.I have heard that Circle of the Moon is closest to Symphony of the Night in regards to gameplay. I've never played SotN, but I can say that Circle is much like Metroid was. You control whip-weilding Nathan (not a Belmont?) as he quests through Dracula's castle in search of his lost master, and to stop the evil of the dark vampire for good. Rather than linear level-by-level play, you search the open ended castle much like the world in Metroid, going where you want and stopping at conveniant save points. Of course, some paths will be blocked until certain items are found, thereby rewarding exploration.It's a great game. Konami has thrown in many new tricks with the use of the magic items (which gives you certain abilities) and the Card System, which offers new weapons and powers. Circle also has a rpg feel to it, thanks to armor-weapon powerups and character level upgrades. If you loved the old Simons Quest on the NES, this will be right up your alley. Unfortunately the graphics are far too dark to see much. It doesnt hamper gameplay, but I found myself having to squint far too much.An awesome game, and as a Castlevania fan, I am happy to say Drac's back!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2001"}
{"product_name":"B003P9FRGA","description":"","reviewerName":"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF \"Wolf\"","summary":"SECOND TIMES THE CHARM WITH RED FACTION!","reviewText":"I first brought this game from Amazon.com when it first came out thinking it would be like Red Faction Gorilla which I rather liked.  Of course Red Faction Armageddon is as we all know now frightfully linear so the sandbox feel of the first game is gone.  The graphics are not screaming wonders but neither are the graphics entirely lame.  The voice acting is so, so and at times extremely wooden.  However their ate high stakes moments where the voice acting really shines making me feel this situation is almost real.  When I first got Red Faction Armageddon I felt the game was extremely hard to play.  I was brand spanking new to video games and shooters.  I got swallowed up riding that barge down the molten lava whirlpool so many times I just put the game on the shelf and forgot about it.Lucky for me my little brother is a 6 foot 8 inch 320 pound brute who loves playing video games with me because; I like him are terrible at playing them.  Difference between us he wants to play the games I gave up on with us as a team.  He asked me to buy a second Red Faction Armageddon game so he could play along with me.  Well as expected we had fun I killed from a distance he killed up close and personal.  He acts a darn fool when playing in those video games which makes it fun.  However its now 3 years since I started playing video games mostly shooters so when I played the game recently I won more trophies and did not die nearly so muchI figured out how to beat the barge in the lava pool shooting challenge.  You engage the beam generator targets before they come into clear view.  Soon as a target is within your line of sight start shooting it.  Also do not worry about all the tech that is draped around a target they are just weapons sponges.  When shooting at things hanging from the ceiling shoot at the smallest and weakest connection points or articulations since they give away must faster when the game physics are done properly. Red Faction Armageddon has very good game physics.  This game is not for a beginner unless they have lightening fast reflexes. I eventually beat this game after lots of trying so of course I like it.The story line is nothing special and it is painfully linear complete with auto mission restart penalty boundraies for leaving a prescribed area.  The plot is fine but their are NO new twists on the same old story line we see in almost all sci fi shooters.  Bug like aliens that spawn like neutrons in an atomic reactor.  A weird cult that thinks the bug like aliens are the BOMB BIGGITY!  An oppressive Earth force bent on restoring ORDER put them all together and stir vigorously.  Like I said the story is nothing new.  The weapons are mostly fun BUT there are a few dud guns.  Red Faction Armageddon is a great game to play when you have a lot of time to kill since, I've seen time die a far more pained wasted and alas ignominious death than this game will offer.  Red Faction Armageddon failed to make the money for a third installment because; the previous version was one of the best sandbox games out there in its time.  The Red Faction Gorilla environment was almost completely destructible and it gave me a rush to see a building come down around me.  Falling through floors and all the driving was a hoot in the first game.There is little wrong with Red Faction Armageddon except that it broke with its sandbox faithful in ways that seem like betrayal and customers voted with their wallets by keeping them shut in too many cases.  The completely uninspired boat load of stupid looking one demensional aliens jumping here and there like jack-rabbits did not help the games cause.  Shooting at swarms of dumb jumping alien targets is a tired overused ploy commonly found in first generation arcade games one expects more from a PS3 game.  Truly good video games draw you in because your actiond have meaning.  Killing has a rationale beyond just beinh a mass exterminator of alien vermin.  Killing the same few alien types over and over again just got old fast.  The real problem with Red Faction Armageddon is that it after just a few minutes of repetitive game play it becomes painfully obvious that not too much thought went into the story.  Add the total linear lack of a sand box and what you have is a PS2 quality game using PS3 hardware.  Taken on its own rights Red Faction Armageddon is a awesome game if you are VERY FORGIVING.  If Red Faction Armageddon had not come after Red Faction Gorilla a most excellent sandbox game that was pretty mind blowing for its time, it might have done better.  In Red Faction Armageddon only the graphics improved almsot everything else got worse compared to Gorilla.  Still I did enjoy my visit to this games idea of a Martian Colony so while this was a boring game I had fun beating it!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2013"}

In the first Wario Ware game (Wario Ware: Mega Microgames), it was hard to beat all of the levels and unlock all of the unlockables. There was also much more variation in the microgames.This game, rather than being enhanced by the addition of the microphone (which is built in to the DS) and the touch screen, is limited by them. All of the microgames involve either the touch screen or the microphone. That means that the microphone level, for example, has you blowing into the microphone over and over, regardless of what the microgame is.The unlockables aren't nearly as good as they were in the first Wario Ware, either. It was really cool to be able to unlock the full version of Dr. Mario. It's not as cool unlocking a metronome, calculator and yo-yo.

However, is it just me or did I pick up the wrong Halo game to begin with? Despite all that I've heard that was glorifying the series, Halo 3 ODST was not the kind of game I'd thoroughly have fun with, simply because it won't let me do that.It seems that the Xbox 360 controller was made for first-person shooters, because it is perfectly aligned with the gunplay in this game. That said, I'm a pretty big fan of how the game controls. It is indeed satisfying to blow off a bunch of mutant aliens with various weapons that you can find and use for your own advantage. You can even swap guns with a corpse's, which is especially helpful if you don't have any ammo. Even so, you also have an effective elbow punch attack.As fun as it is to kill enemies, though, there's only so much of that fun to be had. When you're not fighting a pack of aliens, you're busy wandering around the lonely (yet scenic) environments, and don't be surprised if you end up getting lost. Even worse, most of the game's levels are filled to the brim with empty areas you walk around in, with the clumps of enemies being at certain places. There are some levels that are filled with alien fights, but each level following afterwards is the lonely and dark atmosphere I know I wasn't anticipating.I understand that the levels featuring the battles were flashbacks of the Rookie's missions, but I don't think that means the developers needed to make the dark and lonely levels where he's being nostalgic so BORING....With this in mind, the entire game can be summed up as &#34;You walk...and walk...and walk...Oh, and sometimes shoot, but that's probably not too important...&#34;Then there are the truly fun levels in the game, which sport unique gimmicks such as Warthog driving and Banshee piloting. They are not only remarkably refreshing levels in an otherwise monotonous experience, but the Banshee level has to be my favorite level in the game PERIOD. It is SO much fun to fly the aircraft, and you can even fire at enemies while piloting!Unfortunately, the game is only half-filled with fun, with the other half being total boredom.(Note: I know I haven't mentioned anything about the multiplayer features, but that's because I do not have Xbox Live Gold, and I do not plan on getting it anytime soon.

After one night of play I went out and bought it.  I don't know what the review peoples problem are, but this game is FUN!!!  I knew that the game has grinding involved to get items, but I don't mind grinding.  I still have fun playing WoW and grinding instances to get levels, so grinding is fine with me as long as there is some reward at the end.  Graphics are good and detailed, they are a little dated but that is due to the game being out for while already in Japan.  This game will not be a game for everyone, but if you like RPGs then get this game.  The combat system is not as bad as people say and I think level 5 did a great job with the combat system.  I haven't tried the online part and I'm confident I will like that aspect of the game.  I bought FF13 when it came out but it's collecting dust while I play WKC.  FF13 is too linear and no freedom in the beginning of the game (I have'nt played too far), don't know what Square-Enix was thinking.

{"product_name":"B00005BW7Q","reviewerName":"D. K. Malone","summary":"For the record, this is NOT a Xenogears prequel","reviewText":"Anyone playing Xenosaga with the hopes of it being directly related to Xenogears must be warned... it isn't.However, it IS the creation of the same force who created Xenogears, the husband and wife team of Tetsuya Takahashi (story, script) and Kaori Tanaka a.k.a. Clio Saga a.k.a. Soraya Saga (story, and SOME character design... not to be confused with Kunihiko Tanaka, who is the main character designer) It's VERY similar to Xenogears in many ways. They've taken the same backstory, themes, and ideas and laid an entirely new plot on top of it. Both deal with the discovery of the Zohar, humanity leaving earth (Lost Jerusalem) and seeking a new planet to call home (New Jerusalem) and a myriad of past events which are referred to by the characters in the story. However, the epic of which Xenogears was episode 5 centered around the creation and ultimate destruction of Deus, and Xenosaga doesn't even mention it. Anyone who's read the \"Xenogears Perfect Works\" book knows that Episode 1 of the Xenogears story was ENTIRELY ABOUT the creation of Deus. The remaining episodes were about different generations of humans which were created by Deus. If Deus doesn't even exist in Xenosaga, there's simply no way the two games are going to literally and directly connect.EDIT 1/6/2003: It recently occured to me that it would be interesting and cool if perhaps the entire Xenosaga series (6 chapters?) ended with the creation of Deus. I'm not predicting this, though.Nevertheless, Xenosaga is going to be instantly familiar and pleasing to Xenogears fans, it was definitely cut from the same cloth and shares a lot of common threads. \"Spiritual prequel\" might not be too inappropriate. Just don't expect to see Chu-Chu flirting with Fei when we get to Xenosaga Episode 5, 'cause it ain't gonna happen.Xenosaga is \"smaller\" than Xenogears. It's a shorter game, first of all. Xenogears took me over 80 hours to finish, while Xenosaga took me \"only\" over 50 hours. There are fewer locales to visit, with less variety (the entire story takes place in deep space, on spaceships and spacestations.) There are fewer playable characters. It doesn't have four entire chapters of backstory to be exposed through the course of the game, as Xenogears did. But while it can't quite measure up to the sheer epic scope of Xenogears, it's the beginning of a new story, a very complex and intriguing one. Xenosaga pushes the envelope of cinematic gaming. There are a couple of non-interactive sequences which are an 45 minutes to an entire hour long. If you're one of those staunch types who say things like \"I prefer to PLAY my games, not WATCH them\" then you should steer clear. There's a lot to watch in Xenosaga. But the story and characters are interesting and the scenes are well executed and presented, so personally I had no problem with it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","summary":"Despite Some Flaws, Remains Strong","reviewText":"Knights of the Old Republic has a strong pedigree- Star Wars combined with BioWare, one of the best RPG makers of all time. Considering the success of previous BioWare games (Neverwinter Nights, Baldur's Gate) it couldn't be that bad, and it largely isn't.Let's start with the good things:The graphics are amazing, and the areas all well done and extremely detailed. Some of these places have only been seen or mentioned in the expanded universe, but it's clear the developers did their homework when laying them out. Force effects, weapon graphics, and combat movements are all well done. You really feel like you're a participant in the Star Wars universe.Though the rules are based off the D20 system Star Wars game, they have been altered for real-time play. As with BioWare's other work, this conversion was generally well done, and the accompanying game interface is quite intuitive (if you're wondering, it's something similar to 'drive mode' in Neverwinter, with an added mouse cursor). Combat looks real time, even though it's turn-based under the hood.Characters and interaction are very well done- all dialogue is spoken, and the voice acting is superb. There's a ton of side quests to take on, and you have both light and dark-side choices when dealing with people and situations. This is the sort of flexibility many previous D20 computer games lacked. Your companions (up to two at a time from nine potential allies) interact realistically and all have their own stories. Some, such as that of the sadistic HK-47, are quite amusing.Added touches, such as mini-games Pazaak and Swoop racing, are generally good. Most of the puzzles you encounter are quite fun, and the game music is both original and well done (for the first time in a SW game?). You have a sense of freedom in that many of the quest objectives can be done in whatever order you see fit. Many items you find (including all lightsabers) are upgradeable with special parts. There's also a ton of items and equipment to find and use, much of which have unique avatar appearances.The story is killer. If you're wondering, I'm a hardcore Star Wars fan that has read most of the books and seen all the movies multiple times. I won't say more since I don't want to spoil it, but the story is better than both of the new movies and many of the books. Seriously.That said, there are some issues with the game:Though it has great graphics, the game doesn't run very smoothly. My system greatly exceeds the recommended requirements, and it's still choppy at 1024x768. This is especially the case in combat involving numerous enemies.In the adaptation from the pen and paper game, the developers decided to nerf ranged weapons big time. Even the most powerful upgradeable ranged weapons do less damage than relatively mundane melee arms. In fact, there's no good reason to gear your character(s) toward ranged weapons instead of melee. This is a bit weird in a setting as futuristic as Star Wars.Though you have some degree of freedom, it's not unlimited- you'll often be stopped by invisible walls when traveling in what looks to be perfectly passable terrain. Though most of the game areas look huge (e.g. the city of Manaan looks like a floating Los Angeles) you actually can't explore most of it. You're also barred from doing quest steps out of order by locked doors, force fields, and other such gimmicks.There's surprisingly few options in character generation and general character/party customization. You can only be a human, and choose from 3 classes- Soldier, Scoundrel, or Scout. The appearances are surprisingly limited for a BioWare game, and there's only one voice per gender. This doesn't matter much, since your main character rarely speaks- others do all the talking. Your main character is the only one that can multiclass, and in fact MUST do so- and it will be to one of the three Jedi classes- Guardian, Consular, or Sentinel.The game is very heavily combat oriented, and some of the puzzles are clearly just there to slow you down (thankfully, these are quite rare). There are some quests or choices obviously geared for the less combat-capable classes (i.e. scoundrels and consulars) but when it comes down to it, you really have to be able to dish it out. Fortunately, your allies can help you with this for most of the game if you aren't that type.There are very serious technical issues with the game. It crashes frequently and freezes even more often. I won't harp on this because it can be fixed in patches (of which there is already one out) but I know game doesn't even run with many system configurations. It's advisable you do some research on this or wait for patches before buying.When it comes down to it, Knights is one heck of an RPG. At this point it is the only Star Wars computer RPG other than the flawed Galaxies MMORPG, which makes it doubly appealing to fans of the series. Due to its excellent plot and believable game world, this is a sure-fire pick for any Star Wars fan.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2004"}

Urban \"U2fan4ever76\"","summary":"Riddick Is Great, Except For One Major Design Flaw","reviewText":"\"The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena\" was such an enjoyable game for me that it killed me that one significant flaw kept the game's fun level down. (I'll go into that below.) Aside from that, you get two games on one blu-ray disc. In fact, one of the opening screens upon booting up offers you a choice to play \"Escape From Butcher Bay\" or \"Assault on Dark Athena\", much like a movie DVD/Blu-ray menu, so the games are separate and are on the same disc. So you really get your money's worth, IF you haven't played \"Escape From Butcher Bay\" before, which I hadn't.\"Escape From Butcher Bay\" is an engrossing game that really (even being 5 years old) takes first person shooters into a different direction. You are able to interact with a whole cast of believable characters, many of which are better scripted and animated than ANY of the non-playable characters in \"Fallout 3.\" The next-gen gloss really makes everything shine--no pun intended. The character models are very detailed and the backgrounds and levels are very sharp. Another reviewer complained about the graphics and I have to say I am shocked by that. There are very few times the graphics are anything less that next-gen. \"Assault On Dark Athena\" is built on the same engine and has equally sharp graphics and an interesting cast of highly detailed characters.The stories for both are very much part of the Riddick universe and canon, with \"Escape From Butcher Bay\" being the one mentioned in the actual movies. I would say the story for \"Escape From Butcher Bay\" is superior to \"Assault on Dark Athena\", but not by much. Both are very detailed and your main quests (and side quests) add a lot of depth and time to the playing experience.I thought the controls were very good and the selection of weapons was particularly generous--though I preferred the Ulaks, as they were quite lethal for silent kills or melee combat. The other weapons were nicely detailed and animated and it was always cool to walk into a room, shoot out the lights, and turn the Riddick eyeshine on so I could see in the dark.The sound is great and many have mention the top notch voice acting. I have to agree, the voice acting was superb and it even has some musical cues from the movies.The enemy AI is rather good and relentless. It really forces you to use Riddick's stealth abilities (which include the awesome eyeshine, where he can see in the dark) to perform quick kills.Riddick, at times (in both games) can step into robot-like suits and then use them against the enemy. This is fun and adds variety. In \"Dark Athena\" he can even take over and control the zombie like soldiers, in certain areas.Now to the issues that keep this from being a solid 4-5 star game. Well, the checkpoint save system is the worst I have seen in a long time. Many times you will be down to one health block and you move ahead and it automatically saves you progress there. You die and you start back there with one health block. If you die enough, the game generously gives you another one and I have heard if you die enough, then another one. But this save system saps the fun out of the game by constant loading screens and then you finding out you have a large amount of enemies or big enemies to fight, BUT you only have one to two health blocks. It is very tiresome and adds a lot of deaths and restarts. Also, the map system in \"Escape\" (which is actually non-existent in \"Dark Athena\") doesn't help at all as it doesn't show your location or direction on the map! These two flaws seriously affect an otherwise awesome gaming experience and that is sad.There's some minor glitches I noticed like one of the cut scenes had dialogue spoken, but there was a serious delay to the characters lip-synching. Also, there was some slowdown and choppiness.Overall, it is a fun game despite the flaws and glitches. I had a great time, though cursing at the screen from time to time, and I think most will enjoy the game if they can overlook these problems.3/5 starsPros:*15+ hrs. of gameplay.*Great graphics for the character models and levels.*2 games for one price.*Well constructed levels, with multiple non-linear routes.*Controls are pretty solid.*Enemy AI is good.*Sound is good.*You get to play as Riddick with Vin Diesel voicing the character.Cons:*The worst checkpoint save system that results in many loading screens and many deaths due to reloading with few health blocks. (Should have had a nice hard drive install to speed up loading times or do away with them.)*Enemy AI can get too good in some areas and also, while the game developers want you to be sneaking around, many enemies carry flashlights on their guns which makes sneaking almost a gimmick.*Map in \"Butcher Bay\" is terrible and no map in \"Dark Athena.\"*A few glitches and slowdown.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2009"}

The reality factor played a huge part in keeping the tension up; This time around we have some of those elements, along with an odd mix of semi-sci-fi elements, as well as other genres that don't always quite mesh. One minute it is like Silent Hill, the next has textures and sites similar to Gears of War. Not that there's anything wrong w/that I guess. And this is a beautiful looking game; Some levels really stand out. I especially enjoyed the Bowling Alley and the hallucinations in the Hospital. But the lodge level had such great potential for creepy things, and all you did was defuse bombs and shoot swat guys like some Tom Clancy game. There was one surprise on that level that was cool, but otherwise..Also, the same went with the magician's lair...so much cool potential, but just a so-so boss fight similar to Bioshock. Gone, for the most part, is the feeling of dread in a sort of Manuhunt kind of way... Not to say there aren't some heart-pounding moments, however. And while the forensics are more evolved and enjoyable this time, I didn't find turning cranks to destroy orbs for 10 minutes really all that fun. Or in line with what I thought the Condemned series was about. I appreciate games trying new things, but I think some of the plot threads and locations were misfires.

Truth be told, I never played Diablo before, but I know a great video game when I've seen it. I downloaded it on the PSN network. Mind you, 8 gig took a couple hours to download, but was worth wait. If you're worried about space, then don't worry, just pick up the disc.  I actually had no intention of buying this game until I played the demo and I was amazed how easy it was to jump into. The controls feel perfect on the controller, which I believe that's why PC gamers are mad because the controller actually feels more intuitive than the PC mouse/keyboard controls. When you're within your control map modifying things with customization and going through your amazing loot, that's the only quirky thing you gotta get used to is navigation within your options screens, but you'll be smoothing it out in no time. Like many are mentioning, you don't have to be online like you do with the PC version. And on this version, leveling up feels great and the looting is so addicting. Speaking of online, you can play with friends online or offline! People can jump into your quest and you can extra experience points while playing online. Playing online the joy is that you don't have to be literally right by the other players, you can really work together working as a team and spreading out nicely if you want to.  I saw zero lag and the game played smooth both offline or online. You can also let 3 other playrs play you on the couch. Although the only flaw with this is that you all have to be on the same screen which is not as cool as playing online where there all no limitions. Diablo's 3 quests are an absolute blast. Huge new places to check out and I wanted to check out every inch of them.  I literally find myself looking in every little corner just to make sure I didn't miss that last gold coin or the weapon an enemy might have left behind. And it's so fun doing so! Diablo 3 is a pretty deep game, where you can customize nearly every aspect of the character you choose. You can upgrade your weapons, magic, buy a stash box and dress your charcter in some pretty neat attire.  Terrific atmosphere, great characters, terrific graphics, wonderful musical score  and a massive world to explore. Trust me, you'll never get bored with Diablo 3. Anyone who is giving this game 1 star probably has not played the game, or it's a PC gamer who can't get online because they have no internet. ;)  Diablo 3 will keep you occupied for sometime and honestly, I will be sad when it's all over. At least until the PS4 comes out. :) Peace to all everyone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2013"}

She loved it. it's easy to get into, all you do is spam X X X X X X or R2 especially if you are playing as the hunter(bow) and I was playing as the witch doctor so I had my spells going also. But yes she loved it and it was a great 1 week journey of playing this game(about 2 hours a day). I just had to keep reminding her to press other buttons for attacks because it's so easy to just do one attack and kill enemies.  Yes we did play on normal mode since we are the casual gamers.I recommend playing this game with a group of people because if you arent leveled up to a certain level for the boss fights you will easily die. so yeah this is a online must game if you want to get through with it in a week. Ummmmmm it wasnt really anything I didn't like about the game as the bosses was challenging but I didn't mind since the other part of the game consist of you beating waves of enemies for a hours until you get to the boss....Get this game if you want a game to play with your girlfiend, love games with great replay value, love a challenge with boss fights or love dungeon like games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2013"}

Can we have competion please?","reviewText":"I won't rant and rave about how we need the NFL to grant competition between companies again, but I will say that people need to stop buying this game and then complaining about how bad it sucks year in and year out. So, now that I've said that, onward with the review.Plain and simple, this game is fun. If you're a big football fan, and you need your video game version of a NFL fix, well, then you must buy this game.PROS:Running the ball is actually difficult in this game. You really have to work throughout the entire game before you are rewarded with that big run in the end.The weapon system is also a nice touch, and really adds to the depth of the game.Passing the ball and getting rid of it in time are also realistic for a change. You don't have 5 to 10 seconds to throw anymore. Depending on how good your O-line is on pass protection you'll have a good 2-3 seconds in the pocket before you need to make your mind up.I also really like the new control scheme. I really hated it at first, but after a few hours, I came to appreciate it. Your jukes, cuts, and bull dozing forward are all done with your right control stick. Your sprinting is done with the right trigger. Stiff arms are done with just the press of one button instead of trying to figure out at the last second which trigger to push.The preplay snap controls take a lot of learning, but once you get them down, you can shut the annoying menu off that so many people have grown to hate. They work great, too, and it's easy to tweek your defense before the snap. The only thing that makes the preplay snap controls a likely con as well, is that there is a HIGH learning curve for them.Oh, and all those wonderful features that come year in and year out. No more mini-camp though. :( (I haven't owned a copy of Madden since 05 ... well the PC version of 07, too, but does that really count?)CONS:Right away the menu system actually confused me. It took me a couple minutes to realize I had to press start to bring up the main menu, because I was staring at the vast hallway thing on the startup screen wondering \"where's the menu?\". So, I'm probably dumb. However, after that, I got used to how the menu system works, and I didn't really care after that. Still, though, a mild annoyance.The announcing, er radio announcing ... yeah it's that bad. I had to shut it off. My wife said she could do better announcing than that. Ooooh, BURN!The graphics .... \"GRAPHICS?!\" you say? Yeah, it's a con, and I'll tell you why. The players look TOO shiny. They don't get roughed up or messed up as the game goes on. They look the same they did coming out of the tunnel as they go back in it. Go through a game of All-Pro 2k8 and tell me what the players look like 1/4 of the way into it. Yeah, that's what I mean. The field looks great, but that's about it. The coaches are designed and move just badly. I've seen better animations done by Madden games in the past. What's with the step back here? Players on the side line are too generic for a next-gen console game. Once again, look at what APF2K8 has done with the side line ambiance, then look at Madden NFL 08. It's a pathetic comparison. There aren't too many player animations either, which 2K8 has also done better. My other little thing, is that there are less accessories on the players. No mouth pieces or tattoos. Other Madden games had this, so why did they remove that stuff? Seeing Larry Johnson run the football without his mouth piece on kind of erks me. Call me picky, but when you spend $400 on a next gen console, and another $60 (I rented this, so I only spent $5) you tend to get picky about the performance of your games.One game play thing that in my opinion has yet to be fixed with any Madden NFL game is how accurate the QBs are in this game. Yes, even Peyton Manning throws overthrows and underthrows in real life. So why does my second string quarterback with an overall rating of 75 throw passes dead on 100% of the time? Well, lets just say that I'm glad there's a way to modify the AI or I'd go crazy.Just a side note thing, but does anyone really care about User trophies and points? After the game is over, Marshal Faulk comes on and talks about how many more points I earned. I don't care! Can I just get back to playing football? What's with the silly rings on the side of the teams' names before each game? Can't I have a television style of commentary during the game instead of this hybrid EA/radio crap? I'll tell you what, EA. If you really don't want Madden in your game anymore, than go grab some competent announcers from, oh I don't know, ESPN! (since you kind of bought the license out for that for the next 15 years), and call your game EA Sports/ESPN NFL 09 for next year.Overall, this really is a good game. I haven't enjoyed any Madden football games since 05, but this one, 08, really is better. There are just a few minor annoyances that keep this game from being great. Is APF2k8 better? No, it's just different. That game has it's own annoying quirks as well. As far as Madden 08 goes, I think it just needs a little competition to push it over the envelope to make it a great game. Until then, here's Madden 08, which should provide you with a good solid year of fun.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2007"}

Needless to say, the wait for Fable 3 to hit the shelves was agonizing, but I am happy to say that the game has arrived with most of my expectations met despite a few disappointments. Set 50 years after the events of the last game, you play as a well-meaning prince wants to overthrow King Logan, his older brother, who has become mad and tyrannical with power. The meat of the game is performing various good deeds in order to gain followers who will join you in overthrowing the king in a coup d'&eacute;tat of sorts. Side quests, buying property, working menial jobs and getting married and starting a family all serve to flesh out the game and give the world striking personality. Below are the pros and cons of the game based on my having played 13 hours and beaten the game.Pros:- Graphics and Sound. It's been said countless times already, but Fable 3 is a gorgeous game in which the living, breathing world of Albion is the main draw. The scenery is vibrant and well detailed, as well as being varied enough to minimize monotony. The voice acting is also top notch, with a stellar cast including John Cleese, Stephen Fry, Simon Pegg and Ben Kingsley and they, along with the voices of the townspeople and peripheral characters, all do a stellar job at bringing their characters to life. As with the other Fable games, the score is fantastic and it effectively sets the mood for each part of the game.- Intuitive combat controls. Fable 3 feels more combat-heavy than it's predecessor and the controls have been streamlined to make combat more enjoyable. The three-button system (melee weapons, range weapons and magic) is very accessible, but the enemies this time around are a lot faster and smarter, so dodging and aiming will yield better results than simply button-mashing your way through.- Good inventory management system. I was skeptical about how I would like the revamped menu system, and by revamped I mean almost non-existent. The menus are totally gone, expunged from the game in favor of an interactive \"hub\" you can drop in and out of at any time. There is a main room with a world map, which is excellent for pin-pointing quests and fast traveling to certain areas, to a wardrobe, trophy and weapons room. At first I thought this would break up gameplay in a bad way, but after playing it I feel it works very well. The lack of menus is a big departure from the standard RPG formula, but it works for this game.- Varied quests. While most missions involve fetching items and killing characters, the setting and style of each mission is varied enough to prevent the game from getting repetitive. The people you meet in the town also give you missions in order to win their friendship, and these are rather fun despite being mostly garden-variety fetch quests.- The economy system is back and it allows you to buy and rent property, which is handy for earning money. You can also get married and start a family, though the game is more story-driven and the incentive to do this is less in this game than it was in part 2.Cons:- Bugs. Common for these types of games, the game world is full of bugs that range from minor blemishes to mission-stopping crashes. I am not concerned about things like texture pop-in, screen tearing or cosmetic imperfections, but I found the constant slowdown to be rather annoying. When walking into a new area, and sometimes before and after the \"Save\" icon appears, the graphics slow down and stutter briefly and it gets especially choppy during the really crowded fights. There are also instances where the camera zooms away from the action, the dog gets stuck and other oddities occur that disrupt the flow of the game.- Lack of emotional connection. Fable 2 was not a perfect game but it provided a strong emotional connection with the player, especially with the dog and the family you build. This time around, this connection feels flat. You don't spend much time building your dogs character, so he functions as little more than a treasure sniffer. Additionally, you have far less variety of responses and gestures that you can use on people, so there is little fun in forming attachments to others.- False flexibility. As an open-world game, you do have the freedom to explore and carve your own path, but the game feels more restrictive and linear than Fable 2. The story is rigid in what you have to do, and the \"moral choices\" have less impact. In each situation, you need to select a \"good\" or \"bad\" choice that will impact the attitudes of others around you. However, the choices are very black and white and you need to be good in order to gain followers, so I had no incentive to play as a bad guy. While the world in Fable 2 grew with you and your actions affected how the town looked and even how you looked, the decisions you make don't have nearly the same impact in part 3. This false sense of flexibility does drag the game down somewhat.- The ending. Others have mentioned that the ending is unsatisfying and I have to agree. Without giving anything specific away, the ending involves a moral choice that you need to make, and it provides the only real gray area in the game, since both choices involve some kind of unsatisfactory outcome. Think that good actions always lead to positive outcomes? Think again.I could go on for hours about Fable 3, all the good and bad points, but the game overall is a great action RPG with some forgivable imperfections. I loved Fable 2 and I can't help but compare these two games, so Fable 3 feels somewhat inferior due to it's lack of emotional impact and some bugs and glitches that give me pause. But I can forgive these as I enjoyed my time with this game, and I think this is a good choice for series fans and RPG fans in general.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2010"}
{"product_name":"B003QX4F7C","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Bean","summary":"Excellent! A must for Japanese/noir fans!","reviewText":"The Yakuza games appeal to a very particular audience. None of the them really push the boundries of graphics and the sandbox-ish worlds they present feel very contained when compared to GTA or Saints Row. What the Yakuza games DO excel at (sometimes more so than their american counterparts) is style, character developement and adreneline-fueled hand-to-hand combat. Yakuza 4 is easily (in my opinion) the best of the series and manages to polish it's gameplay up a bit while adding a few new elements to make it stand on it's own.The story of Yakuza 4 is soap-opera/crime-thriller that involves a mysterious woman named Lili whose connected to a series of deaths in Tokyo's Red Lights district. As with previous installments, this game is very cut-scene heavy with lots of (well-acted) dialogue which can test your patience. The cut-scenes are a lot more engaging (with a lot more action!), this time around though and I didn't feel quite as bored as I did in Yakuza 3. Just as long as cut-scenes are the blocks of text you have to click through to move that action forward. Again, it's much better paced than the previous games but still a bit annoying.The biggest difference between Yakuza 4 and it's predecessors is the main character (or characters). Series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu is now one of FOUR controllable characters and he's only playable towards the end. Being a series fan I was a bit disappointed with this change as I'd gotten pretty attatched to Kaz, but that opinion quickly changed when first protagonist Shun Akiyama is introduced. Not only is this loan-shark (along with the corrupt cop Tanimura and convict Taiga Saejima ) just as fun to play as Kaz, I was actually MORE vested in these new characters than our usual hero and didn't WANT to stop playing them. Luckly by the end of the game their stories come together and you can switch between them at will.The graphics and the Yakuza games have never been their strong suit. The cut-scenes obviously look fantastic as do the main character models but the in-game environments still look like early PS3/late-PS2 graphics. There's still a lot of animations and colors in buildings and other structures and there's always a varied amount of people walking around which add to the game's immersion.The gameplay, despite some slow-down is better than ever in Yakuza 4! As usual combat takes place in these enclosed arenas where you're forced to beat up a group of enemies. Each main character controls perfectly and responsively with each bone-crunching punch/kick/throw being felt. The hostess clubs are back (and even work into a main character's narrative) as is mahjong, gambling, karaoke, erotic massages etc. There is so much to do in this game world that really adds to the flavor of being in Japan and really makes Yakuza 4 so much fun to play.I could go on and on about the things I love about Yakuza 4. It isn't perfect and like the other Yakuza games is an aquired taste. However, if you loved the previous enstallments as much as I do or are looking for a great noir-thriller game with a japanese twist definitely give Yakuza 4 a shot!(a note: I realise this is the fourth game in the series but newbies shouldn't worry about starting from the first game. This story stands very well on it's own and only somewhat ties into the previous game)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2011"}

The graphics are unbelievable, and the battles are fun (without being overly challenging).  The airplane scene is absolutely fantastic- I had a grin on my face during that entire scene and it is certainly one of the most exciting moments in my personal video game history.  I'm a casual gamer and played at \"normal\" difficulty, and didn't have a tough time finishing the game.  So if you're just a casual gamer, don't be worried.  Take in all the beautiful scenery and music while playing as well.The only negative I would say is that it's not as good as Uncharted 2 (which critics and other reviewers have pointed out).  Personally I like the storyline of Uncharted 2 better, and wasn't as engrossed in this storyline.  If you're new to the series, I would play Uncharted 2 first.  But both are fantastic games.

Yea it's somewhat short, got it at midnight, and I'm done it already but I still put a good amount of time into it.Funny thing is my girlfriend was in the kitchen during one of the cutscenes. She says \"What happened? I thought you were playing a game.\" I told her this is the game. This just goes to show how close this series is to a Hollywood movie. The voice acting and story telling is just top notch; better than most movies nowadays.I think this game is very similar to Uncharted 2 in the sense that with the giant set pieces and the pacing of the game. Which is not a bad thing at all. There's a few levels or set pieces that just had me floored. I mean these graphics are gorgeous. The water and fire are the best I have seen in a game to date.But what really made my mind up about this game being better than Uncharted 2 is the story this time around. There's a certain level that shows Drakes childhood which I thought was brilliant, and would actually love a prequel game in the future. And also the actual story with the treasure hunt. There's a neat little twist at the end, not really a twist but I was pleasantly surprised with what was going on and the motives behind the villains. Don't want to say too much without spoilers but this game had me smiling and just wanting more.-The positives-The graphics are top-notch.The voice acting is top-notch.The story is beyond top-notch.-The negatives-Yes, the game is a little short, but totally worth it.The shooting mechanics can get annoying at times, but this is a very small gripe.If you have a PS3 and are into these kinds of games, go get this now!If you don't have a PS3, well go buy one and pick up all the Uncharted games. I said back in 2009 that Uncharted 2 was the best game I have ever played. Well now it just got replaced by Uncharted 3. These games are just simply amazing. Sorry if I'm being over enthusiastic.

{"product_name":"B003O6EATE","description":"","reviewerName":"David","summary":"I had to see it myself!","reviewText":"Let's just say that I wasn't even thinking about getting this. I was never interested in owning the PSP because I knew I wasn't going to get as good graphics as a console. I own the PS3 and my first game on that was FIFA 11, which I think it's so much fun and I love the fact that it's a game that you can always play. So after reading reviews upon reviews of how great the VITA was I finally convinced myself (and my wife) to get it. I LOVE IT!. I got FIFA as well and downloaded a bunch of demos plus Escape Plan, which is AMAZING!. If you have the money but this! You won't regret it!

Hayes","summary":"As Awesome As the Rasengan!","reviewText":"Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm is the first Naruto game for the PS3.  Personally, it has been because of this game that I have become hooked to Naruto and the Naruto Universe.  The game features some of the most graphically impressive fights Ive seen for the fighting genre and has renewed my interest in that genre.Plotwise, Ultimate Ninja Storm goes through about the first 135 episodes of the Naruto universe.  It would have been better if it could have gone through the entire Part 1 of Naruto (about 220 episodes) but being that the English dub version of it is finally reaching its end, it would have been impossible.The single player mode has modes ranging from fetch quests, treasure hunts, specialized fights with requirements (such as win the fight, while not going into awakening mode, and wining with one health bar or more remaining and perform 3 substitution jutsus).  There are also other modes such as race up the tree (an aspect of the show which is for chakra control), in this case it is a mode in which you just race up the tree exceptionally fast, you can use powerups that cause fireballs to come down the mountain on your opponents.  There is also another mode in which you face a giant boss fight (against a huge toad, Chief Toad from the show), and finally the other mode is that you get to jump from tree to tree in a forest.  There are powerups here that allow you to get through the forest faster.That is all that is to the single player experience.  It is a requirement to go through about 60% of this mode.  There are many more missions beyond that, but only the hardcore Naruto fan would go through it to get all the unlockables (character costumes, more jutsus, dioramas, music etc).The fighting is the main aspect of this game.  Unfortunately there is not any online multiplayer but there is offline multiplayer.  Fights consist of the traditional normal type set ups, except here most of the moves are just mapped to the X or square button for simplicity.  A guide of all of the moves is provided on the pause menu for all players, and with practice, virtually every move can be carried out.  There is a chakra bar in fights, which is just your meter for performing advanced level moves (such as Naruto's special skill, the Rasengan, a huge burst of chakra at an opponent).  It is also needed to be full, in order to do the special skills.  The special skills all take you to a different vantage point and screen in which you have to mash the sequence that appears on your side of the screen.  The opponent also receives a chance to mash buttons too and whoever can overtake more control of this bar will gain the advantage; if it is the opponent then they will sleazily dodge it with a log ala substitution jutsu style, or if it is the player, they will launch their killer attack, like the 3rd Hokage's forbidden jutsu, Reapers  Death Seal.  These are perhaps the best and graphically impressive moves and makes it worth it to play as every character.  One final aspect of battle, you can also use support players who you can employ to launch an attack and catch you when you are blasted away. Finally fighting can take place on a 3d field, in which you can fight on the normal ground as well as on the walls.Pretty much the main cast of our favorite genin are available to play with as well as their sensei's, the the legendary sannin are also available to play as.  Support characters are also available to play as and are released as DLC.The entire voice cast of the show has seemed to reprise their roles here with voiced scenes moves.  There is limited voice acting in the story mode, but then there are maybe about five FMVs, and these are all fully voiced.  Graphically, this game is shocking in how beautiful it is.  It is hard to describe the style pseudo 3D, 2.5D cel shading but it works.There isn't much more to crave for from this game except for a sequel.  I implore you, if you are or aren't a Naruto fan, then you must still get this game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2009"}

I wasn't exactly sure if Blizzard could update the game and still keep the same feel. I am happy to say that they have! The game play you know and love from the original is all there but the graphics have been brought into the 21rst century. Here is a quick run down of my experience so far:Graphics: I'm not running the most state-of-the-art computer, but the game runs great on the \"High\" settings. I'm running an Intel E7400 with 4 GB of RAM and Dual NVidia 9600 GT OC's in SLI. I had just a bit of stutter on \"Ultra\" settings, so I turned it down a bit.Sound: The audio is a mix of \"blast from the past\" and \"Wow! That is cool they added that!\" Old fans will immediately feel at home on the main menu, I guarantee. There are also nice touches through out the game such as selectable music tracks in some areas. And of course it wouldn't be Starcraft without the unit responses now would it?Control: I hope you remember your hotkeys from SC1 because you'll be needing them. The interface is pretty much cut and paste from SC1 but it has been updated for today's graphics. Camera control is very nice, but I haven't yet found a way to rotate the view and you are pretty limited to how far you can zoom out.Single-player Game play: There are some interesting new aspects to the single-player game. You get to research upgrades and purchase new types of units (warning: some of these units are NOT available in multi-player). You also get delivered the storyline in face-to-face chats with other characters as well as through the standard cutscenes. As for during mission game play, Blizzard has stayed true to form. Basically if you likes SC1 in single-player, you should love SC2's single-player mode.Multi-player Game play: Pure \"vanilla\" SC2 is very similar to online play with SC1. But you have the option to install custom game types as well. Think tower defense and DotA in Warcraft 3. I'm really looking forward to seeing what people come up with. While I love standard RTS action (which SC2 offers plenty of) a little change never hurts and promises to give the game a lot of longevity.Ok, now for the bad part. You knew there had to be a reason for 4 stars, right?1.) You have to log in to play, even in single-player. This really doesn't matter to me, but I know some people call it a \"deal breaker\".2.) No LAN play at all. Yes, you can still connect through their servers to your buddy sitting beside you. But LAN play isn't dead, Blizzard. Some of us like having the ultra-low latency of getting together face-to-face with our friends.All that said, I'm looking forward to a long, healthy relationship with StarCraft 2. So far, the wait has been worth it. I can't wait to see how the community evolves and what new mods are made available over the next few months.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2010"}

This is old school first person shooter at the core. There not much in the way of &#34;innovation&#34; or standard FPS features like regenerating health or the ability to just collect things by walking over it...but this is very much a welcome return. Make for a more intense gun fight. The graphics are some of the best I've seen for a next gen system and the story is hands down better than most recent FPS. Its also nice to see a FPS spend more time fleshing out a single player campaign as not everything needs to be multiplayer focused.

Castlevania with lasers.&quot;  Well, you CAN get a laser (or a photon cannon, more accurately,) but the vast majority of the game stays strictly to the series' roots, and offers a vast amount of innovation not only to 2D gameplay, but to the Castlevania storyline as a whole.  I'll write a few blurbs about each element.Story--gamers find themselves in the role of Soma Cruz, a young exchange student to Japan who finds himself and his friend, Mina, trapped within Castlevania, which itself is trapped in a solar eclipse.  I know it sounds far-fetched, to say the least, but trust me, it works.  If you can find the final ending of the game, you'll be treated to the greatest twist in the history of Castlevania games.Gameplay--very tight and solid.  The forward dash from Harmony of Dissonance is gone, but Soma gets along fine without it.  Soma has the ability to absorb an enemy's power and then use it himself; this opens up almost unlimited gameplay opportunities.  Don't worry, though, the system isn't that intimidating; the biggest problem I had with Symphony of the Night was that the inventory was too large and complex for me, a casual gamer.  Not so with Aria of Sorrow.  There's a large inventory, to be sure, but I've never had to scratch my head over it.Music--top-notch; the best music to come out on the Game Boy Advance.  There's a few Japanese sound bytes thrown in, too, which really helps the atmosphere of the game.Graphics--detailed and beautiful.  Not quite as impressive as Circle of the Moon, but at least you can SEE this game without direct over-head light (I don't have an SP, but I do have a Game Boy Player for my 'Cube.)In short, Aria of Sorrow is not only my favorite Castlevania game, it's also my favorite Game Boy title.

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world.

I rented LEGO Batman and beat it to 100%.  I'm very glad I didn't purchase it.This latest iteration of the LEGO series is absolutely dripping with glitches and bugs - some of them glaring.  I have had to restart levels because unlockables - called \"Power Bricks\" weren't appearing even after the camera zoomed to where it SHOULD appear.  Nothing happened!  I even had to restart the game because an achievement wouldn't unlock (the infamous \"Natural Habitat\" achievement.)  I replayed the level the same way I had played it a half-dozen times, and *plink* - got it.  A.I. characters got stuck behind an open door (are you serious?) or get stuck in a death loop - as soon as the character respawns, it's instantly killed again.  Very tedious, busy work.The animations prior to and after the various levels are hugely UNentertaining.  I've been a Batman fan for years, but never read the comics.  I had also never seen an Indiana Jones movie, but could still understand the general LEGO story even without the characters talking.  The Batman story simply didn't make sense.  I really had no idea what I was working towards, and after the first few \"episodes\" it simply became a chore.I will say that their creativity in some of the various unlockables really was quite amusing.  My favorite was a mini-game in the \"Villians\" episodes that had me driving little remote control trucks through a little road course, putting the trucks into areas of their respective colors.  It was so trivial, but it was a lot of fun!  They also got pretty creative with the benefits of certain characters (or \"suits\" for the Batman and Robin characters.)  One Batman suit lets you touch glowing-red-hot lego blocks.  One Robin character lets you walk underwater.)  These were new twists on an otherwise aging method of game-play.I learned after Star Wars Complete Saga - don't buy these games.

It is slick, has numerous games, and a lot of fun to use. I bought the DSi specifically to learn Chinese characters for Korean (Hanja) and Japanese (Kanji). I also own an iPhone. Here are my impressions:Cons:1)Nintendo softwares are still mostly cartridge based. As an iPhone user, this has become an annoying drawback since I need to carry and change cartridges everytime I want to change the software. With the iPhone, everything is downloaded and stored in the internal flash memory. Changing software takes two button clicks on the iPhone and I can carry as much software as its internal storage will allow.  The flash memory slot of DSi is mostly for photos and music. You can't store the purchased software into the DSi flashcards.2)The handwriting recognition is not great. It is merely decent. The stylus has been purposely blunted so the DSi screen will not scratch too much. Unfortunately, the blunted stylus is also more difficult to use in writing complex words (such as Chinese characters). When I am using Brainage 2, the handwriting recognition fails approximatley 5% of the time. For example, \"4\" is often misconstrued as \"21\".3)Online store is very basic and does not offer most of the \"full\" version of the games. I suspect Nintendo will go with the iPhone model and allow most of the software to be downloaded rather than forcing its users to carry numerous cartridges.Pros:1)DSi has a touchscreen which makes it a more flexible platform for games. The DSi is a surprisingly good educational tool. In Japan, it is used as much for educational purposes (math, writing, IQ improvement etc) as much for games.2)The battery life is fairly impressive. It lasts at least 2X longer than my iPhone for games.3)The camera works well and takes decent pictures.Overall, DSi is worth owning especially if you have a specific DSi title, as I did, in mind. The iPhone, however, is more than a worthy challenger to the DSi. Nintendo must move away from its cartridge based hardware which dates back to the 1980s and follow the iPhone's lead in internet download based software.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2009"}

However Professor Layton's games came highly recommended, so I figured I would at least give it a shot, if nothing else than for the story.There are currently three - soon to be four - Layton games.  Think of Layton as Sherlock Holmes with puzzles.  He experiences different places and events and there is a mystery that needs to be solved underneath.  He gathers information and clues by assisting patrons with puzzles that they cannot solve.  The premise is simple, the back story was quite excellent, and I would submit that if it were not for the deep story, this would be the most average of all games.In Curious Village, Layton is on the hunt for something referred to as the Golden Apple.  He has a treasure map leading him to a mysterious village.  Upon arrival, he is trapped and cannot leave the village, so he decides to go about solving the mystery of the village.  During the stay, there are a number of strange events that lead him to solving his first mystery - patrons that end up missing.I won't spoil the story for you.  But I found the story of Curious Village to be a solid 9 out of 10, hurt only by the presence of certain events that appeared to not be relevant to the story.  The character development was done well, and it wasn't difficult to keep up with the story as it unfolded.  Where the game broke down is the implementation of the puzzles.  The puzzles themselves weren't bad, but the problem is that they were infrequently relevant to the basic story or game.  A lot were just random puzzles thrown in there with no rhyme or reason as to why.I also want to emphasize that a lot of the puzzles were not really puzzles, but actually brain teasers.  Things where the way the question is worded is a trick to the real answer.  For example (not a real puzzle in the game): \"John has 26 apples.  He puts 12 of them in the fridge.  He eats one, throws away four, and gives one to his next door neighbor.  Not including the one he ate, how many does John have left?\"  Technically, the answer is 24...why?  Because the four he threw away are still in the trash in his house, so technically he still \"has\" them.  The 12 are still on the table in his house.  The only ones left are the one he ate, which we don't count, and the one that went next door...leaving 24.  Your first instinct is to say that the answer is 8, which would be wrong, or 20, which would also be wrong.  That's an oversimplified example of some of the wordplay that abounds in Curious Village.  Those were the most annoying.  It was never that the puzzles were hard, just annoying.Solving a certain number of puzzles or greater unlocks a lot of secret dealies such as all of the cutscenes (and there are quite a few of these, short though they be).  Beating the game unlocks a code that is used in the second game, which isProfessor Layton and the Diabolical Box.  Because of this last bit, you'll want to start with Curious Village first if you're trying to see if Layton will work for you and you like puzzles that must be solved.  The third game, of course, isProfessor Layton and the Unwound Future.Where Layton stands out is the quick pickup and puzzle solving that used to be an affair for newspaper crossword puzzles.  The presence of a solid story solidifies the game even further.  It is hopeful that the developers see fit to bring over the mashup between Layton and Phoenix Wright, as I can imagine no other more epic combination.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2011"}

Receiving the same item may trigger either satisfaction or disappointment depending on what you were expecting. From a game that was developed by members of Obsidian, the people who had released such masterpieces asPlanescape:TormentandBaldur's Gate, one expects lightening to strike yet another time. Unfortunately, they seem to have stroked out.The first thing that strikes you, however, are how bad the graphics are. Admittedly, great games have worked wonders and have been offering great fun with only limited graphics. There are games that are 10 or even 15 years old, when graphical capabilities were but a fraction of what they are today, and yet they are still more fun to play than most of the vapid eye-candies released these days. Unfortunately ALPHA PROTOCOL is not one of them.The graphics look just bad. From the institutional colors to the awkward movements of the characters and the almost non-existent interactive environment, the game feels like a cookie-cutter Third-Person Shooter game found in a sales-bin.Of course this is not a simple TPS game, it is rather a Third-Person RolePlaying Shooter (RPS). Your character advances in level and he also has an inventory. There are classes to choose from and skills to add to. There are different weapons and armor to equip with. Stealth is very important yet not the only way to go and there is a spy story unfolding through the dialogue options and cut-scenes. All this looks quite good on paper yet, somehow, it failed to work for me. And I have been an RPG fan for years.The story is not absorbing and the characters are caricatures rather than the deep, complex characters one enjoys in a good RPG. The RPG elements are all there but they seem to get in the way of one another and work together. Having a time limit on the (Mass Effect 2-short) dialogue options is not a good thing either.ALPHA PROTOCOL also sports...mini games. With variations of ideas we have seen inFallout 3andBioShock, hacking and lock-picking are carried out by completing mini-games that (just like in those previous games) get old and tedious. Fast.As DRM goes, good ol' SEGA slipped in a Limited Activations scheme - but promised to patch it out in about a year, so the game will stay yours. If promises are kept that is.An RPG that strives to also be a shooter, a stealth tactical game with the possibility of bullet time, an endlessly bifurcating story that manages to end up predictable. This is a game that takes up a lot of different elements on its brush but the picture it paints in the end is unoriginal if not confusing. Had all the different elements worked together, this would had been a masterpiece. Unfortunately, inspiration alone is not enough.All in all, ALPHA PROTOCOL consists of a lot of good ideas that got thrown together but were then left underdeveloped and unrefined. Maybe they exhausted their A-game on developing the upcomingFallout - New Vegas, who knows.Because of the developing team's history, I will be overlooking this one.If you are out of ideas guys, I would propose developing a game looking likeDiablo IIIand playing like BALDUR's GATE. And if it had a steampunk setting it would be heaven.ALPHA PROTOCOL will be remembered as a bump on the road.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2010"}

If you find yourself bored by the same crop of first person shooters or command and conquer clones, you may want to pick up a copy just to try something new and different (but read on first to be sure...)Considering EA owns the rights to the Sim-City franchise, this game could have been accurately billed as &quot;Sim-God.&quot;  I think Amazon and the other reviewers have done a good job of describing the gameplay so I'll try not to be redundant.First off, when you first load the game - be prepared to spend a full evening playing around with it.  The game starts off with a very well done introduction and teaches you how to move around,  control the creature, cast spells, etc...  You'll find yourself drawn in very quickly as you want to see what happens next and that is where the problems start.You see, when you first start out it's rather unclear what it is you ARE supposed to do in this game.  Being weaned on many years of resource management games and trying to be a nice God, I spent a long time trying to keep my villagers happy, (&quot;we need houses, we need food&quot; yada yada yada), but they would never shut up! It's enough to make me go nuts and destroy everyone - which kind of makes me wonder if that's what God thinks of all of us but that's a different discussion.  In any case, it took me a while to figure out they won't shut up regardless and I just need to progress with whatever I'm doing and ignore them.  (That's a tip for all you new players.)So what is it you are supposed to do?  Basically use your influence to take over villages which allow you to increase in power so you can take over more villages.  At its heart it really is a resource management game much like Command and Conquer.  Instead of building up a bunch of tanks and army men to take over the next town you cast spells and use your creature -in good ways or bad - to &quot;wow&quot; neighboring villages into worshipping you.  If you don't, you're stuck in this constant state of inertia trying to please your villagers who are never satisfied with anything you do.  This is quite the opposite of the &quot;do anything you want&quot; sales pitch EA's marketing department puts in their ads.Another myth is the concept of your creature having free will and the ability to learn.  This is far from the truth.  Basically the creature will do something and you either reinforce the behavior positively (petting) or negatively (slapping).  Based on what you do the creature is &quot;supposed&quot; to do that same action more often or less often.  At the risk of this entire review not making it past the censors at Amazon, I'll give you an example.  You see, I picked the tiger creature - not the brightest but supposedly a good fighter.  Well apparently it has decided it likes to poop on houses.  It's kind of funny to watch, but the villagers understandably don't like this very much.  I've been slapping the poop out of him (pun intended) but he won't stop.  So much for the ability to learn.  Instead I'm supposed to try to get him to poop in the fields as it'll help the crops grow.  Well what am I supposed to do?  If I place the poop in the fields it just stands there.  If I hand poop to him, he'll just look at me funny or worse yet, try and eat it.  I guess I'm the one that needs to be praying he poops in the fields so I can quickly pet him and reinforce the behavior.  As far as the things the creature has done right, positive reinforcement doesn't really seem to make him continue to do the same action.  I've found the whole concept of trying to &quot;teach&quot; my creature very frustrating and it's been more of an annoyance than an asset to the game.And fighting?  It's kind of like playing Rock-em Sock-em Robots.  There's no control.  Instead you just mash a lot of buttons and (again) pray you end up the winner.  When winning a fight against another creature becomes a necessity in the game (and I know it will eventually), my inability to do so will probably be the point I put down the game and never play it again.The review is harsh so far I know, but you see, in spite of these problems I still find myself drawn to this game.  In fact, just writing this review has made me want to load it up again.  The graphics and music really are top-notch and I haven't run into any bugs or system crashes (a rarety in the gaming world these days.)  I'm usually the type that will give a game one or two days at the max before giving up on it.  Even games I do like rarely hold my interest to the end.  This game is a rare exception.  I keep thinking, maybe if I do something differently...Reread the Amazon and DailyRadar reviews or jump over to the PCGamer site and read all the praise they've heaped on this game.  Contrast it with the review I wrote and hopefully it'll help you decide whether this is the type of game you would be interested in.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2001"}

C. Obraztsov","summary":"One of the best RPGs for the PS3.","reviewText":"I can make this decision really easy for you if you've playedStar Wars Knights of the Old Republic.  Did you love the game, and one of your favorite part being the intensive dialogue and the ability to influence characters by your comments (and the really funny ones), and you could basically be a good/bad person?  Where you had to do things to impress your companions to get more quests?  Did you love the battle system of having three other companions with you at any time, and the battle system?  If you said yes to all of that, then there is no reason to read any further.  These are both amazing BioWare games, and if you loved KOTOR, you will love this.  This is very similar, except it's dragons instead of Star Wars.The only PS3 RPG game that rivals this one is obviously the Elder Scrolls, and Fallout if you wish to include that, but those are vastly different types of RPGS.  Dragon Age has more of an old-school vibe to it, and I love that.  If you love classic RPGs, you should love this.  It has everything a true RPGer wants - a vastly open world to explore with tons of interesting quests, captivating storyline (some RPG storylines are just so cliche and boring), interesting companions, witty and funny dialogue with your companions and NPCs, the ability to make choices that effect your entire future in the game, a pretty good battle system, etc.  I'll help break it down for you.GRAPHICS - do not buy this game for the graphics.  The newKingdoms of Amalur: Reckoningis actually very much an RPG (or RPG/action, but it definitely feels more like an RPG) has amazing graphics, so if you're looking to buy a new RPG and are worried about getting awesome graphics, you may wish to look at that or Skyrim.  Dragon Age Origins has graphics similar to the PS2.  They are definitely nothing to write home about.  The cutscenes are decent and personal dialogue with players, but when walking around, everything looks a bit clunky and old-school.  The game is plenty good enough though to make up for that.  The graphics remind me a LOT of KOTOR.BATTLE SYSTEM - some complain that this is just basically a button mashing game.  Well, yes and no.  It's not that simple.  You need to get your queue in order for spells/abilities you wish to cast, strategize accordingly, and even modify what the other characters are doing if necessary.  Button mashing is plausible on easy mode, but for anything harder you're going to have to strategize a bit more.  Once again, it's very, very similar to KOTOR.You get to have three characters with you at all times (like KOTOR again).  It's always frustrating to me to have to choose, because I want to hear what they all have to say.  But who you bring with you makes a huge impact.  You need a tank, a healer, and a heavy damage dealer in your party, and whatever you're doing yourself.  This is not turn-based RPG; you just walk into enemies and start fighting.  Most RPGs are very much moving away from turn-based style, and I like that for the most part.COMPANIONS - the companions in this game are hilarious and fun, and that's why I wish I could have more than three with me (the whole party in non-fighting areas would be nice, and then only three others in mob areas).  Like KOTOR, some of your companions are so kind and lovely, while others are well....pretty evil.  Your actions in your quests and dialogue, even with NPCS, will often effect your companions feelings towards you (example - there is a pretty evil woman companion who you get positive influence on when you do evil things).  If you upset certain companions too much about touchy issues, they might even leave your party.  Whenever you're walking around town, every now and then two of your companions will start talking to each other about random stuff, and it's usually quite funny and entertaining.  The writers are very clever.  You can get characters to like or hate you through your interactions with them, others, and your own actions.  You can also give them gifts to make them like you, which I think is pretty neat.  When a character likes you enough, they often teach you new abilities or have their own special sidequest now available to you.  You even have the option to form romantic/sexual relationships with some of your companions, whether or not you're a guy or girl.STORYLINE - while some storylines in RPGs bore the hell out of me and I have to focus hard so I don't tune out, this one is pretty interesting.  One of the neatest parts of this game is the beginning, when you get to choose who and what you want to be.  Depending on that, you'll have different different opening storylines.  Although you end up in the same spot quite soon eventually, it's really cool to be able to go back and check out the different places you could have started out at.  For instance, I was a mage, so I started in the Circle of Magi (like a mage school - well, sort of).  Since your opinions actually change the destiny of the game, paying attention to storylines is pretty important.  But with the cleverly written dialogue and storylines, you shouldn't have a hard time paying attention.  Like most RPGs, the game IS very dialogue intensive.  But if you're an RPGer, I don't see why that would bother you.CONS:EA really milked downloadable content for everything they could.  It's kind of annoying when you buy an expensive game when it's first released, and then you're expected to keep paying for more and more content, some of which is very vital to the game.The graphics are not spectacular by any means.  They are simply mediocre.That is really all I can think of at the moment.  I never had the game freeze-up, and that's a constant, annoying hassle in Bethesda's Elder Scrolls and Fallout (love them to death, but they are buggy).  BioWare knows how to make a STELLAR RPG.  It is a severe disappointment that its predecessor could not even come close to being as good as this one.  I think BioWare's real developers left for awhile and let interns take over or something.  The graphics are a definite improvement in the second one, but everything else is worse - so what's the point?Anyway, if you have any love for RPGs, this is a game you should get right away.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2012"}

I find the many buttons to make him do combat, magic, journal, aiming...etc a bit frazzling. maybe I am just used to playing the 1st one on the computer where you just click the mouse when you saw the highlight. I find the aiming a bit harder..for example the bombs, knives, magic...But, am just starting so maybe, after time, my reactions will get more natural due to repetition. Sometimes, making a character do more makes it less appealing..in my opinion. but...combat and whatnot is still fun and challenging.3. as of yet, he is not shown meditating...only that you \"know\" he did. if this is the case for the whole game, as weird as it sounds, I will miss seeing him mediate near a fire. It was kinda relaxing. I hope to see this later in game but fear I shall not.4. the journal is not overly user friendly...just my opinion..but, I can live with it. it has it's few good points, but I find myself hitting RB over and over to toggle to things.5. music so far is gorgeous but I expected that after the 1st game.6. Personally, there is something about Geralt's looks that I don't like as much as the 1st game. His hair?? his face is just off a bit..like the original's brother kinda thingy...related but not exact same look. But..he is still awesome. Sometimes, what was fantastic before should not be \"improved\"...same goes for Triss7. I like the \"scan with medallion\" effect...that is cool.Overall, so far, I am pleased. I can say, with all honesty, that I would recommend this game based on past game and what I have experienced already. Of course, the ending of Mass Effect 3 now has me more weary of sticking to that faithfully.I hope to get more comfortable with the controls over time..but, can say for sure, I find them rather \"loose\" for a lack of a better term. I try to aim and it goes all over the place.Anyways..that is my take so far. I am sure I will enjoy the game for many many many hours. it is just that kind of series.big plus...same as 1st game..love the quest manual!To be continued....FYI...I installed the game on to the hard drive, as suggested for better graphics and smoother gameplay experience, and I find it is actually true. The graphics seem a bit better. Curious though, that I still have to put disc into tray to play it...ha! oh well...so it goes.Also, I find the controls are more stable and less jerking if you toggle off the \"auto rotate camera..\" on the options menu. I think that is more for the mouse of a computer (per wording in game manual). Just sayin...UPDATE:I find the map quite useful on this game. At first glance it does not look like much but if you zoom in, you can see roads (paths) that lead you very well to where you wish to go. The medallion will also help you to know enemies are close by in enough time to stop and prepare yourself. It turns red. That is quite useful.I also find the journal and it's updated information as you investigate. It also guides you as to what to do or where to go next so you don't feel like you are going in circles or getting lost.MY FINAL UPDATE:I have played enough now to give it my final review. I am extremely pleased and am having a blast. Also, the fact that I can change his hairstyle with a choice of like 5 of them (that is the woman part of me..ha!) once meeting a certain dwarf, I changed my star rating from a 4 to a 5.

Finally deciding to at least built up a good library in spite of the town's absolutely dismal selections, I heard Trace Memory was incredibly great despite its short length. Against better judgment since a short game shouldn't be full price, I got it and I can actually say that it is quite an intriguing game to pick up. You just wish that it was either longer or that the game was cheaper like my 10$ Feel the Magic was.Story: You play Ashley, a 13 year old girl travelling with her aunt who gets invited to Blood Edward Island. Turns out her father, who was supposed to be dead, wanted her there and is on the island. Her aunt Jessica sets out to find her but doesn't come back so Ashley sets off to find her father and Jessica, a murder mystery and another one concerning something called \"Trace\".Graphics: It's not really the most graphically sound game. Your top screen acts as a kind of basic area look giving you a more detailed view of your changing surroundings while you move Ashley with stylus or D-pad on 2nd screen which shows the area in a top-view. Now and then a puzzle will appear on the 2nd screen with varying designs and your top screen tends to be more story based such as conversations.Sound/Music: No voice acting that I can recall but the music was quite relaxing and I even started to hum it a little bit. It's probably not something that you'll be downloading or purchasing but what's there is actually quite nice and not throw away music.Gameplay: Like I mentioned, the 2nd screen at times has puzzles that must be solved. They range from those evil block sliding on a 3 by 3 grid with one square missing to scratching off rust to re-arranging torn paper and creating the original. Some of the puzzles are a bit easy while you get ones that are frustrating just the fact that it's puzzling (that evil block puzzle for one) while others are just kind of vague and have a feeling of \"now what do you do?\" Another thing is sometimes you have to \"activate\" Ashley's ability to recognize a puzzle piece. An early example is an iron ball required to be placed outside a gate to open it. I knew where the ball was but she wouldn't pick it up until I focused on it and she went \"hey!\" and sure enough she can pick up the ball.On the touch screen, certain key areas can be focused on and she'll talk about what you've clicked. You might fixate on a book on a desk, or the drawer, or something else in the room. It's good to have a specific thing to focus on but other times you're not even sure what can be focused so you might move past something thinking nothing's there when a couple clicks will net you something. It's not the most in-depth game but the story is surprisingly addictive and even when a puzzle stops the flow, you feel you have to beat that puzzle to continue with the mystery.Should you pay full price? Probably not, the game can easily be finished in a few days, one day if you play it a lot. Is it a worthwhile game to pick up? I'd say so.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2006"}

They look more like flashes of still images and minimal animation. Perhaps this was done to convey mood, but I'm not really sure.Music (score 8/10): Music is well done and seems to fit the context well. However, there doesn't seem to be much of it. I might be wrong, but I think I could count the number of music tracks on one hand. Not that it really matters; there are not that many different locations in the game, and the music suits these locations well.Characters (score 8/10): The characters (of which there aren't that many) are handled well. This game isn't really about character interaction though. Really, your only main characters are Ashley and \"D\" (a ghost boy). There are other characters as well, but Ashley and D are given the most development. The only thing that bothers me is that Ashley seems to be a bit stupid at times. What I mean is that she seems to take a bit longer to figure something out that already seems obvious to me, and this holds true for both the puzzles and the story elements. Still, it's really not that bad, just a little annoying. I must also note that I'm glad the game developers decided to add D as a character; they could've had Ashley explore alone, which wouldn't have provided the kind of rapport that makes this game more interesting. So, good job developers!Story (score 10/10): The story's where this game really shines. It is quite suspenseful, and will keep you wanting to play just to figure out more. You start off as main character Ashley who has received a message from her father telling her to go to Blood Edward Island and meet him. Of course he's not there, so Ashley sets off to find him, bumping into the ghost boy, D, along the way. And I'm not giving away anything else. Just know that the story is excellent.Gameplay (score 8/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me. The controls all work fairly well, and the game does a good job of guiding you along to the next destination and giving you proper hints to solve the puzzles with. My only complaint is that you often cannot pick up something until Ashley finds out what she needs it for later. This is mildly annoying, but doesn't cripple gameplay in any way. Another issue to mention is that the game is pretty short. I beat it in about two days. Replayability is also pretty bad, I imagine, since you'll already know how to solve all the puzzles. There is, however, two different endings, a good ending and a bad ending. Once you get both endings, though, there's no real reason to play through again other than to just re-experience the story.Overall (score 8/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score. I'd definitely have to recommend this game to fans of the point-and-click adventure genre. Trace Memory's excellent story-line and inventive puzzles are definitely worth experiencing at least once. So, rent it if you can; you could easily beat it in two days. Even if you can't find a place to rent it, just buy it. It's really cheap now, and is definitely worth your $10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2009"}

Unfortunately, there is just not enough finesse to the driving when you are forced to drive at 100+ mph with an unpredictable, white knuckled, slippery left thumb; but, in addition to Guitar Hero gear, I don't have room for all of that crap nor do I have an appropriate table (or special racing chair) to attach the wheel to?! The beauty of Dirt2 (and Dirt) is that your driving is more about zen/jedi minor correction driving than it is about perfect control. You will be using, light feathering on the gas to keep your speed up and control-wise you are working to line up jumps, start a drift and hand brake around loose hairpins. The rest of it is pure adrenalin and rebel yells.

{"product_name":"B00GANWVJE","description":"","reviewerName":"Adol A.","summary":"A fantastic modernized spin of a classic.","reviewText":"Like so many other people writing reviews about this game, I too have played A Link to the Past. In fact, it was one of the first games I ever played, and replayed it several times getting 100% just about every time. So how did I feel about this game?When I first heard about it I was really curious since it would take place within the world of ALttP. I was curious as to how the world could be faithful to the LttP world. When I played the game I found the recreation of the world generally faithful and even though certain elements have changed such as changing between the two worlds, Dark Hyrule or &#34;Lorule&#34; is divided into sections rather than one seamless overworld, and the new item system, I felt there were no problems with playing the game this way, and at the same time the game feels fresh.Speaking of which, the main items in the game (with the exception of a few) have this new rental system where you pay to rent out certain items for a few rupees, and if you die the items return to the shop and you must rent them again. You can buy the items and keep them when you die. Nintendo wanted to implement the idea of an &#34;open world&#34; adventure for this Zelda game where you could pretty much clear the dungeons however you want, and by having this rental system, that would go into play. However, this isn't exactly 100% true. The only flaw I find in this is the fact that to get the last item from the rental shop, one of the dungeons have to be cleared to make the item available in the shop. That kind of limits the &#34;open world&#34; just a little bit since you need to clear one dungeon in order to clear another. Aside from that, this idea is executed fairly well.I must say, however, that it seems Nintendo is doing this new trend where acquiring the game's currency is really emphasized upon. New Super Mario Bros. 2 had its whole plot based around collecting coins. In this game, it's not the plot, but if you want to buy every item (you'll have to in order to keep them upon death and to upgrade them), you'll have to spend up to 8,000 Rupees to get every item! That's a lot of rupees, and like New Super Mario Bros. 2, rupees are plentiful. When you clear the game you get two statistics, one based off how many rupees you found, and another on how many deaths you had. I think I finished with over 20,000 rupees found. Note that this is not a negative aspect of the game at all because the game feels right even with this concept implemented.Where lots of rupees comes lots of minigames. Granted all of them (except one I believe) hold a piece of heart as a reward, the games themselves are fun. You have a baseball minigame, a battle minigame (which gives the most rupees if you can complete it, just a friendly tip), the &#34;pick a random chest&#34; minigame, and my favorite, the rupee rush minigames. I find them fun to try getting a high score, or the best time. I was surprised that the archery minigame from ALttP wasn't implemented, but the minigames offer a fresh experience in the Zelda universe.I guess I've been pushing back the main thing that makes the game stand out the best. Seeing a lot of the old LttP creatures, items, and mechanics come to 3D is perfect. I liked seeing the enemies remade in 3D. I liked seeing things such as the giant bomb in 3D. The houses were remade well, along with the overworld features such as pillars, the walls, and the cave entrances. I know I'm pointing out the most random and mundane elements, but it's because Nintendo paid attention to even these minor details that the game works seamlessly and the world of ALttP is faithful even in 3D.Pros:+Overall faithful to LttP+Masterful 3D rendition of literally everything, from enemies to small things such as cave entrances..+The parts of the overworld that are changed are seamless and won't impede any gameplay.+Minigames are fun.+Returns to Zelda's roots of gameplay instead of trying to &#34;modernize&#34; like Skyward Sword did (not needing to hunt down several different items to upgrade shields with durability, etc)Neutral:=Depending on how you play the game, it may be a short experience. I 100%'d the game in about 15 1/2 hours, so if playing the game to 100% you may only spend up to 20-22 hours to do so. However, once you finish the game, a more challenging mode is unlocked, so game time can potentially be doubled.=The &#34;open world&#34; execution is definitely a unique and fun spin on the Zelda series, but it's not truly open world as you need an item from one dungeon to do another dungeon, thus limiting your options a bit. It's not that big of a flaw, but it's still worth mentioning.Cons:-N/AOverall, get this game. It's well worth the time spent into it. If you can get the 3DS XL bundle with this game, definitely pick that up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2013"}

I'm sure the purist won't appreciate the humor within the Row, but quit simply this game is fun and it replaces tediousness with all the elements that originally made the GTA series so great.  It has Jumps, Side Activities, Story Missions, Cribs (aka safe houses), building purchases and a whole lot more.For years I have been hoping the game companies would grow up with the rest of us in regards to multiplayer.  Frag fests are fun with the right group, however when you want to tool around with a buddy or spend time gaming with the wife it just doesn't cut it.Thank you Volition!  You've joined the ranks of Rockband and Left4Dead in providing us with a game that can be played as designed together. 80% of my time playing Saint's Row 2 has been riding shotgun with a buddy of mine and it's so much more fun than going at it alone.With the complexity building an entire game supporting multiplayer there are some glitches and bugs.  Honestly in the 20 hours of playing with my buddy, I've been extremely happy at how few bugs we have encountered.

{"product_name":"B003H0CBYS","description":"","reviewerName":"Some Guy","summary":"Surprisingly more than just dumb fun","reviewText":"I'm a big sci-fi shooter fan, so when I read reviews that Bulletstorm wasn't outright terrible it was a no-brainer to try it out.From the product description I was expecting a stupid-fun, uncomplicated shoot-em-up that didn't draw you in with story or complexity but just gave you something to enjoy for your money.  I have to say that even given those constraints, I was pleasantly surprised.For a start, it IS stupid fun.  The dialogue is b-movie rogue hero stuff and progress is linear and direct, with no bother with an open world/roam anywhere playing field.Simple, yes, but the first surprise came with the highly polished gameplay.  Controls are fluid and instantly familiar.  Character movement is smooth and aiming is easy.  Fun and combat variety come from the \"leash,\" \"thumper,\" kicking, and sliding mechanics.  Leash an enemy and yank them toward you, and they float in slow motion for a few moments while you kick or shoot them to pieces.  The skill-based kill system is fun, encouraging you to be creative.  What they also got right is they don't make it impossible to do this by overrunning you with hoards of enemies.  While combat is well paced, you still have time to try out those various kills.  The more creative you are, the more points you earn.  Some of the skills are comical too (kill a burner by shooting his butt), and the whole game has a carefree, lighthearted feel to it.But the biggest surprise is the graphics.  Some reviews here say they are so-so, but with a mere 720p HD LCD the environments are, gasp, really beautiful.  I didn't expect this at all, but the vistas are just gorgeous.  The environments are non-repetitive, very well detailed, and varied.  You won't see pieces of wall design repeated all over the place.  They are also accurate, in the sense that what you see from a given vantage point is what you played through earlier, not just a generic canvas.  For example, standing on a huge dam, in the distance you can see the collapsed railroad bridge that you fell from earlier, and the ground way down on your right looks like what you played through to get where you are now.You get the usual doses of variety.  There's the mounted-gun-on-a-train section (with the truly awesome sight of a huge turbine rolling along behind you), and a great section where you get to control a big mechanical dinosaur - laser beam eyes! - to mow down enemies.  How many games let you control a big dinosaur in a future amusement park?  Hilarious fun and every little boys' dream.It's definitely not a little boy's game, though.  Language and violence are very adult.Although I haven't quite finished it yet (I'm close to the end of the single-player campaign), I'm pleasantly surprised.  The game may not take itself too seriously, which is part of what makes it so fun, but the developers definitely DID take it seriously.  They may have set out to make a stupid-fun shooter with an ingrown silliness (like drinking the booze bottles you find and getting drunk for a few seconds), but that didn't stop them from taking their jobs very seriously.  Solid controls, beautiful graphics, no glitches to speak of, and the combat system all more than make up for the lack of story.  Who cares when you're having this much fun just kicking *ss and taking names?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2011"}

It feels natural when you do combos, like in Tekken, except faster.  Combos are done through a combination of bouncing your opponent around.  When you pull one off you'll feel accomplished.  The fatalities and whatnot are all gorgeous (if you wanna call it that).And go figure, the story mode is actually Good. It's interesting, good, relevant, and it will keep you moving to progress to the next scene to see what happens next.I can't emphasize how good of a single player experience this fighting game is.The online is very smooth too of course, I had a really good time on there, and with your best friend it's great since even the super-powerful x-ray attacks can be performed by Anyone with their easy button combination.You won't get that aggressive friend yelling at you, saying it's unfair that you can blow up the planet in Marvel Vs Capcom 3 but they can't figure out anything.  Mortal Kombat is much more intuitive and easy to learn.If there is 1 complaint to be had it's that it's Impossible to get a platinum trophy.  To 'master' every character you'll have to play for, if I remember right, over 600 hours.  That sucks.

The shading and rendering and texturing of brick, metal, shadows....basically everything in the world has a photorealistic look to it, in full 3-dimensions, moving at a fast pace.  Maybe its because I grew up with a Commodore 64 and Atari 2600 as a starting point that I am in such awe of the look of this game, but its also the atomosphere it portrays, and the rain, rust, and decay conveyed in the graphics really install the sense of dread that the subject matter of the game is all about.The gameplay is great, and just when you think things can't get any larger-scale or epic...boom, you are flying a reaver.

{"product_name":"B00005B8G1","description":"The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

Incredible graphics effects include detailed reflections, lighting effects, and particle physics. Police pursuit ranges from a single police cruiser to an intensive manhunt with a full squad of cars, choppers, and roadblocks. Traffic and police combine to create exciting situations unique to nonrace track environments. The gameplay is fast and furious, with simulated speeds of 170 mph (running 60 frames per second) through realistic traffic situations. There is an extensive reward path with upgraded cars, new courses, new race modes, and more.","reviewerName":"G. Guberlal","summary":"Excellent revamp of the series.","reviewText":"Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 excels on many levels. Its \"free run\" style has always been a welcome addition to the racing genre, not to mention the licensed sports cars that we all can only dream of owning. This new offering is deep with gameplay and hard-nosed driving.Controls:Easy PS2 layout with an almost non-existant learning curve.Controls II:The cars handle the way they would in real life, as much as possible on a video game. If you hold the \"pedal-to-the-metal\" approach, you're going to lose races. There is a setting for an easier control, but that defeats the purpose of the game. My advice is to learn in some practive races before you start any of the championship modes.Gameplay:The police are relentless this time around with an upgraded AI. Lots of times they lull you into a false sense of security by backing off the chase and you'll run into a roadblock, spike strip or the cool helicopter that drops barrels of explosives on the road.Championship modes, including Hot Pursuit and World Championship are 30 races long with each getting tougher. To unlock certain tracks and to progress, there is no win by \"the-skin-of-your-teeth.\" Which means you may win a race that way, but you must do just that, win. In many of the races there is objectives to complete to unlock cars, tracks, and other goodies.Visuals:The game is full of eye candy. Explosions, a warp ahead feature to let you see down the track, a slo-motion cam feature, replays, and FMV jump sequences which earn you points. The cars, tracks, and landscapes are gorgeous and if you're not careful, the beauty of the surroundings can cause a slip-up. You can cross through mountains, find a variety of short-cuts, get los in fog and smoke, or crash into a firetruck. Everything lifelike is placed into the game and fused with the gameplay.Overall:All in all, this is the best and most ambitious Need for Speed title ever created. it leaves the pack of racing games in the dust with pure adrenaline. Get yourself into the game and relax...this is a joyride, no? Watch out for traffic for Sunday drivers come in swarms and can cause an opponent to slip by at the last, pivitol moment.Robert Eldridge (...)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2002"}

I like Bioshock and a few others, but I don't really get excited for fps. Still, overall, I enjoyed this game. What it does, it mostly does well, but left out a lot of opportunities to richen the experience. I have not tried multiplayer so I am not going to comment on it.The good:This game has superb graphics and a cool, fallout-like setting with unique characters.  The game mechanics are tight and there are driving missions to add variety.The bad:very little exploration : There is a world, but no advantage to exploring it.  Going to advanced areas too early does not yield any reward. very linear mission oriented gameplay. The game did not attempt to make exploration a key feature since it is not encouraged or rewarded in any way. It FEELS like a game that should have better exploration/non-linear options, but it doesn't.Limited weapon types: This actually does not bother me that much, but some people won't like it.crafting = unrewarding:  Depending on how you play, most crafted items are a waste of time. Some missions require crafting though, so I guess that counts for something.No character ability advancement beyond buying/crafting special ammo: I prefer rpg games so this would have been a bonus for me, but I understand that not everyone cares. I do think it would have added some much needed depth.Story is generic and ends too quickly: Not a deal breaker, but a weak point in the production for certain.

{"product_name":"B00320JDWG","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"Far From Perfect but Amazingly Original","reviewText":"If I was to just review the gameplay of Spec Ops: The Line, I would just call it a weaker and less polished version of Gears of War, and rate it at 3 stars. However, there is so much more to this game than meets the eye. I think that the developer knew they couldn't make a game on par with COD and GoW, so they focused on the story and making a statement on all of the military shooters out there today. This is really the only reason I bought the game, as I'd heard so many great things, especially from Extra Credits. At first, I didn't really see too much originality, and the problems with the gameplay were frustrating me. Thankfully, the few really cool moments made me continue, and there were huge payoffs later in the game. I will say though, that I wish you had to hold down A to sprint like in GoW, and the AI was a little erratic, with it at times being very simple, but at other times being too smart, where I would move around in cover and as soon as I popped out I would be shot and killed. The checkpoint placement was also a little hit and miss, making frustrating parts of the game even worse. Also, multiple times I ran out of ammo, and I think this was partly due to the fact that many of the weapons from dispatched soldiers disappeared instead of giving you ammo (usually it was enemies that were farther away from you).Right from the beginning, you immediately had interesting interactions with your enemies and team mates. Where you are confronted by Dubai citizens (that you are supposed to save) with machine guns, the great part is that you are in control of your character, and at any time you can open fire. The only problem with this situation, is that eventually they open fire and you have to kill them. This problem is present in most of the game, where even as everything the game is telling you that what you're doing is absolutely horrible, if you want to beat the game you have to do these atrocious things. However, this may actually be a reference to real life soldiers, where if their superiors give them an order they have to follow it. As the game progresses, I love the art style, where all of the characters are getting more and more beaten up, where the outside of the characters mirrors the turmoil and growing insanity inside.Spec Ops: The Line is truly the first game where I actually questioned the morals of what I was doing, and parts of it still stays with me. There are two parts of the game where this was the strongest. The first was a scene that makes the COD airport level look like child's play. In it you are being surrounded by an angry mod of Dubai citizens, they are inching closer and closer, and your team mate is constantly asking for your permission to open fire. Here I held out for awhile, but then I just opened fire and mowed the civilians down like leaves of grass, with my team mate following suit. It was such a strong moment, and it was made even stronger with the fact that there were multiple outcomes here, all of them occurring in real time. In every RPG game where you are given the choice, I always choose the good route, I'm always the paragon. However in this game, I almost always took the seemingly evil route in the heat of the moment, and I at times felt regret about it. The second strongest moment actually occurred after the credits, where a company of completely innocent American soldiers confront you in front of the ruins of Dubai. Again you have multiple choices here, and I went with probably the most horrible one, but I wanted a chance to kind of win the game, and let the character walk off in relative freedom. It was so powerful though, as you are given an automatic shotgun (one of the coolest guns in the game) and the person confronting you seems like a nice guy. He tries to get everyone to lower their weapons, that your character was shell shocked, and he just wants you to drop your weapons and surrender yourself. This is made even worse as if you want to fight them and walk off into the sun, the first person you have to kill is that guy right in front of you that's talking to you, and with that shotgun his head just explodes if you make the decision to fight. Those are just two moments, and there are multiple other ones that aren't as powerful, but really make the game amazing.I will go a little into spoiler territory here. I really think that this has the best use of unreliable narrator in a game I've every played, and it's one of the best in any form of media. I almost always see the unreliable narrator plot device coming, but I really didn't see it coming at all in this game. I just thought that my character was going crazy, but not that crazy. However, the payoff was a little weak, it could have been done better, a little tighter. As I really wasn't sure what exactly was real and what wasn't real. Also, it doesn't fully hold up when you consider your two sane team mates were following you, even though it was very clear to them that you were crazy. This makes crazy ideas possible, especially one where your character actually died in the first helicopter crash, and everything that happened after wasn't real. I'm not sure if it works, but it's an interesting idea.Overall, I really enjoyed the game, and I would definitely recommend this game, although kids should probably stay away.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2012"}

It had a compelling storyline, great characters, catchy gameplay, and an epic feel. ME3 captures much of this, though it feels a bit more linear in telling and ends with a whimper.  For anyone who likes a good action RPG/shooter or played the earlier games, I recommend ME3 highly.The game is beautifully rendered, and the storyline is generally engrossing. As in ME2, your team members have their own story arcs, and some of the older faces reappear.  The shooter dynamics are the same as before, with the availability of various weapons that can be customized.  Special powers are available that give battles a little extra flavor.  The game lasts for 35-40 hours, which seemed long enough to me.  The \"normal\" difficulty is harder than that of ME2, so be ready for some reloading of saved games during some of the tougher battles.  With the patch, I didn't experience a single glitch, except one time when Liara's body did not load (it corrected itself).Regarding the end, I found it a bit disappointing. It seemed unpolished and uninspired, and left me a bit confused about the meaning of what had happened.  It's by no means as bad as some would have you believe and certainly does not negate the 35+ hours of great gameplay that preceded it.  Overall, the game is a worthy successor to ME2, and I recommend it.Pros:+Great graphics, sound, and gameplay+Believable characters+Lots of customization options+No bugs (at least in single player)+Epic feelCons-A bit more linear than ME2-Some frustrating fights (even on normal difficulty!)-Lackluster ending","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

I think it was mostly the story and characters that fell short of the previous game, because there were gameplay improvements.  I think they stepped up the combat a notch in this one, and I did appreciate that they reduced the number of cities to 1.  It was a little tedious exploring all of them in the last game.As for the ending controversy, I didn't mind it so much.  The situation was pretty hopeless, they were never going to achieve complete victory, and they made the best of it.The people who are giving this game a 1-star review because they didn't like the ending need to grow up.  Do they understand what a 1-star review means?  Do they just use them to rant against games that they feel have somehow wronged them?

I've seen people complaining about having a COOP element. Are you kidding? If you want to play by yourself--do it. Don't whine that there is a COOP mode. Personally, I think that virtually any game is more fun if you are playing with a buddy, but to each his own. I had a blast playing this with my friend and I am thrilled they added this option.There are also a lot of folks complaining that this game isn't scary anymore. I don't believe that is true, strictly speaking. I think that by the time you get to the third game in an installment, you're going to be somewhat used to the scare tactics and desensitized to them. Make no mistake, they are still here. In my opinion, it was still scary, though not as much as the first two, but ONLY because it wasn't new anymore. That's the risk you run with continuing a franchise, and to me it is a price I would gladly pay again.I will agree with some that say the weapons seem to be somewhat underpowered now, and there is the blatant attempt to grab some extra money from players by letting them buy game items with real money. Well, love it or hate it, its here to stay folks. Capitalism is what it is and although you have the occasional money grab attempt, you also get fantastic video games to play, so suck it up. Still, I would have liked some weapons with a little more bang. It seemed like even with a buddy at your side, we had to put some serious rounds into these critters to put them down, but in a way that is the fun part, as long as they don't short change you on ammo too much. And honestly, I don't recall a big ammo problem at any point.I've seen some pretty large variations in the length of the game. Some people say as little as 7 hours, while others say 15 hours or more. I finished a COOP playthrough in about nine hours on regular difficulty, so hopefully I didn't miss some side missions somewhere.I liked the story well enough. It didn't blow me away, nor did it detract from the game.The one reason why I didn't give this five stars is because there doesn't appear to be any other COOP mode outside of the campaign. I'll look again to verify this, but for me the campaign, no matter how good, needs something else to supplement it. For example, Gears Horde mode or Halo 4's Spartan Ops. Had this game included something similar, it would be a VERY formidable game.My plan was to get this game and hammer through it before the following week when Colonial Marines got here, and I'm glad I did it. Maybe some of you hard core fans are going to be a little put off by it, but to be honest I don't see anything here that should be too difficult to swallow. It's a little more action heavy, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0088I7L76","description":"","reviewerName":"Chris1988","summary":"Best Fighter Of 2013","reviewText":"To be honest, I (and I'm sure some people had this too) had a knee-jerk reaction upon the announcement of Injustice Gods Among Us. I remembered how half-decent Mortal Kombat VS DC Universe was. That game had potential. However, despite what it had, it left out A LOT to be desired. 3 years ago, Mortal Kombat made its way back into 2-D fighter territory on consoles with great results by Netherrealm Studios and Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon.Back in April 2013, Ed Boon and Netherrealm Studios had struck again with Injustice Gods Among Us, another 2-D fighting game that, like Mortal Kombat, has its own story mode, includes content to unlock, challenges a.k.a. star lab missions, the multiplayer from Mortal Kombat returning including King Of The Hill, and a great roster consisting of a lot of favorites from the DC Universe. I kinda thought what some people were thinking upon announcement and release of Injustice: The game was gonna fail, the game is spelling Cash Grab. However, if you were to call this any such things upon after playing it, I'd say you're 100% wrong, and people ought to know there are far worse fighting games out there, FOR EXAMPLE: MARVEL VS CAPCOM 3, a total fail for a number of reasons, but back to the review. True, this is Mortal Kombat with a DC cover, but this is still a great fighting game no less. N.R.S. has implemented fighting mechanics, which are great for any fighting gamer's skill level, beginner or expert, X-ray Special Moves return to be called Super Moves. Basically, If you've played MK, hopefully you'll feel right at home. The story of Injustice goes like this. The Joker manipulates Superman into killing his wife, and then Superman goes on to become a dictator after he feels the people of Metropolis aren't grateful for his deeds, and soon it boils into a full scale war. The story to me this was kinda confusing, but hopefully DC fans understand it. From what I've heard, there's a comic book out there telling the story about Superman killing Lois Lane by accident. Might be worth the pickup.Final thoughts: Injustice Gods Among Us is an excellent fighting game for any beginner or expert to take advantage of its fighting mechanics, and like N.R.S. did with Mortal Kombat, they added tons of content to unlock, and challenges, offering a lot outside the usuall tournament modes, and while this may be a DC imitation of MK, it does leave a good impression.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2014"}

It certainly is no longer a survival horror game, however, it still manages to retain most of the spookiness and foreboding atmosphere of the earlier games. The inventory management system is very good, and the ability to purchase upgrades and skills helps, especially infinite ammunition for the shotgun. The most annoying thing is the quick time events, however they become much easier with each play-through. I found the online modes to be boring.

{"product_name":"B001IK1BWC","reviewerName":"James Hunt","summary":"Dragon Age Origins","reviewText":"Note:  The game would not install on my system.  After reading a tip from another reviewer I changed the default installation path from \"program files\" to \"games\" and then it worked fine.Others have summarized the game very well so I will just add a few impressions.The basic game system was very reminiscent of Drakensang.  The interactions with your companions allowed you to develop more realistic relationships with them.  The \"Codex\" and adult themes reminded me of The Witcher while the humorous and sarcastic dialogue options were similar to Fable.  So many games are totally devoid of humor so it was nice to see it here.  Some of the teasing and insult humor between your companions was very good (and realistic).  One complaint:  you are allowed to choose a voice for your character but hear it so rarely that at first you wonder who is talking.  I wish you had the option of having all your dialogue options spoken aloud.  The voice acting overall was the best I've encountered.  Having professionals like Kate Mulgrew and Claudia Black really made a difference.The economics were great.  (no Monty Haul)  There was always more to buy than you could afford.  The ability to change the difficulty level mid-game was useful at times.  The game did occasionally crash but was above average in that regard.  The graphics were fine (I don't have a high end machine)  Too many companies make the mistake of emphasizing graphics at the expense of a story, resulting in an inferior game.  DAO didn't do that.  Until someone invents a holographic projector (or a wrap-around monitor) I wish they would just declare a moratorium on graphics improvements.  (or allow you to adjust them down to fit your computer)The opportunity (requirement actually) to make choices that would affect the story line was great.  At times it felt like you were part of an interactive movie.The best part of the game was that there were six different background stories depending on your race and class.  That really added to the replay value.  I only wish they were longer (they lasted 2 - 3 hours each before getting to the main story).  It would have been nice to play sandbox style for awhile before starting the main story.  I would gladly have accepted a shorter main quest story in exchange for longer (or more) background stories.  The most fun part of an RPG for me is creating a new character and starting out very weak with inferior arms and armor.  I had 7 different characters started (one I did male and female) before I actually finished one.  I highly recommend the game for any RPG fans.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2011"}

This is a great game","reviewText":"Could it be?  That the same studio and publisher that made &quot;Deus Ex: Invisible War&quot; also made &quot;Thief: Deadly Shadows?&quot;  Apparently, it is, since the former was a flawed and mediocre effort, and the latter stands out to me as the finest stealth/action game of the past five years.  If, for some reason, you have hesitated to buy this game, then hesitate no longer.Technically, you don't have to have played the first two Thief games to play &quot;Thief: Deadly Shadows&quot;, but the story and atmosphere tie so closely with the first game, that you probably should.  The story in &quot;Deadly Shadows&quot; is great from beginning to end.  So while the levels provide you with an interesting challenge, the story is what makes this game addictive.  The suspense begins to build early, and it never really stops until the very end.  The game provides a sense of mystery that few games manage to do, and then it wraps it all up in a very satisfying manner.  In the final cut scene, the game ends the thief trilogy by bringing it full circle.The stealth mechanics for the game are well-refined.  Generally, stealth works great here, and the trial-and-error that you find in the Splinter Cell series is nonexistent.  This is mostly due to the inclusion of items like flash bombs and sleeping gas arrows, which let you escape from a tight spot.  Unlike the previous Thief games, these items are abundant and somewhat cheap, so you can use a lot of them without running out.  Of course, there are exploits in the game, just like every other stealth game.  Yes, shadows hide you a bit too well and yes, the guards are all lazy.  This makes the game too easy, unless you play on the hardest difficulty level or self-impose a &quot;no-kill&quot; rule.  You also will have to refrain from using the third-person viewpoint, which has little value besides providing neat-looking screenshots.  However, it keeps the game from getting boring or frustrating, which can be a problem for stealth/action games, since they tend to move along slowly.The suffocating, creepy atmosphere of the first &quot;Thief&quot; game makes its return here with a vengeance.  The atmosphere is greatly enhanced by what I believe is the greatest ambient sound to ever grace a video game.  If you have an EAX-capable sound card, then the sound of the game is so perfect, that you'll forget that you are playing a game.  The sound contributes to a general sense of foreboding and danger that I haven't 'hurt either.  There is a ton of content here.  The number of voice-acted lines and sound bites rivals games like Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Deus Ex.  You can go a long time without hearing guards' AI barks repeat, although many of the voices sound the same.  You also get to overhear a lot of conversations.  Some are funny, and many contribute to the storyline.  All of it is top notch.  There isn't one B- voice performance in the game.This game definitely suffers from being co-designed for the X-Box.  Namely, the sizes of the maps are very small.  Every mission has to be divided into at least two small zones.  Plus, many areas feel tight and cramped, and the game doesn't reward creativity like the previous two did.  The levels are still good, but most of them are somewhat plain.  The rope arrows are gone, but it doesn't matter, since the small level sizes pretty much prevent vertical thinking.  The game also suffers a bit from a dumbing-down effect in some places.  The most notable is the tendency for the game to constantly tip you off to special items of loot with conspicuously placed notes.  Basically, you find books and letters everywhere out in the open, which give you obvious hints on what should have been secrets.  There are still a few hard goodies to find, but the over-reliance on this mechanic removes a lot of the satisfaction from finding special items.  One more slightly annoying problem in the game is the HORRIBLE implementation of rag-doll physics.  The way that bodies bend like Silly Putty is a distraction, and one of the game's few immersion-breakers.  The game would have been better off with motion-captured animations and simpler physics.&quot;Thief: Deadly Shadows&quot; ends up being a long game.  It took me over 30 hours to get through it, searching every nook and cranny and trying not to kill anyone.  In this time, I rarely got bored or tired of the game.  Regardless of how you play, there is a ton of content here, in stark contrast to games that only give you an 8-hour campaign.  Once you play this game, it's easy to recognize that a lot of people who worked on the first two games also worked on this game.  &quot;Deadly Shadows&quot; is more than worthy of carrying the &quot;Thief&quot; name.  The X-Box may have kept this from being &quot;Game of the Year&quot;, but at least it didn't keep it from being great.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2004"}

This game while being a typical Seek and Find game, lacks a few bells and whistles that could have made it a really neat game.The game play gets a little repetitive while you play mini games of turning tiles that match or are similar - I found these to be a tad boring and my concentration waned on the 7th or 8th time I played the same mini game at the end of a chapter. You find yourself doing the same puzzle scenes as well.The graphics are okay - I found them at times to be less than crisp. In Million Heir, you have different tools to use such as X ray, flash light, underwater light, etc. This game could have been jazzed up by the use of something like that to break up the monotony. The seek and finds do get more challenging with having clues to find things such as, wrist restraints for handcuffs, or 2 grown tadpoles, etc.I do like the idea of the game and the story line has some interesting facts but doesn't relate well to the game play as you only read the story between chapters - it's not like you really get into the story as in other seek and find games where you actually like or dislike characters based on the interaction with them.If you can't get enough seek and find games then give this a shot. If you are new to them this might not be one to start with. It will give you some relaxing free time but it's not fully engaging and does get repetitive.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2008"}

I have no bias when it comes to Microsoft or the X-Box and no qualm when it comes to Sony, owning a PS2 and its predecessor before acquiring the 360 and actually preferring them in the previous system \"bout,\" but I will say that the 360 more than sold me when I played it and that I am a happy camper when it comes to the keys to that particular kingdom. So, some solids:It DOES NOT die like rumors have said in the past - once upon a time it had errors but that was when it was a baby. It does not run hot; the machine cools well and can be cooled further if a person so desires by purchasing a cooling mat/ fan. It is not needed but some people need it to make their nerves solid. Personally I like warranties, but some people like fans. It makes noise, but it is being asked to run constantly. When you play and play and play, it is going to make some noise. Surround sound will mask it, much like it masks the sound of any disc spinning. The cords can be short to begin with - in the Elite bundle there are a few types of cords and, depending on your need for HDTV or TV you might have a short cord. A few bucks fixes that with some extra cord or a splitter or whatever you need. The control CAN read a LONG way away - I tried it mine from fifty feet just to see and tried it in another room.So, why should you buy that X-Box 360 when there are other systems to be had? If you look at the titles of games you are interested in beforehand, perhaps the answer to your question resides there. If it does not, with some of the stuff you *need* residing on some other console, then you might want to do more digging and find out if it is an exclusive to that system. If it is - well, that is a question one has to ask their budget because some systems dig craters. For myself, the first thing that made me want a 360 were some of its exclusives, with the beauty of items like Gears of War really making me think \"procure it\" and zombie fun like Dead Rising making me think \"right now.\" Combine that with a nice amount of backward compatibility (if you want to know the name of titles it will play, you can do so by looking online) and the world can be intriguing. The second thing I wanted was something I could truly call a next generation console, and the idea of next generation inside my mind meant that everything had to be \"better.\" I had seen many things carried out to their foreseeable conclusion and wanted a newly inspired playgrounf to complete games in and I hoped that would be fueled by graphics that went beyond. When I looked at the crisp layers of pixels making me feel closer to the moment it really took me in and held me close, too, and I found myself amazed by the way the 360 rendered worlds. Here be dragons, as old maps once said, along with smarter enemies in more beautiful surroundings without the lagging I had seen in the past.And why an X-Box 360 Elite? When you think of a system now, you should think of it as an investment and not simply as platforming. Aside from missing a few wires you may need during that joyous time you and your system become joined at the hip and two aforementioned games, there is the matter of memory and the things a harddrive can do for you. The Core system has 20GB, not terrible but not overwhelming, while the Elite hefts 120GB into the fray. The 120GB gives you an outstanding assortment of options down the road, allowing you to do things like keep music on-hand to play during pivotal moments during your favorite game, while the Core system would eventually require some cleaning.Honestly, the price is not too much higher for the beauty with a stomach the size of a beast residing in that cardboard box I received.It was WELL worth noticing and ultimately giving into.If you want comparisons between systems, you can easily find them. I have played them all a lot before my decision because I wanted to really know and thought about going further in my review. Ultimately, however, I think this review says where my thoughts were on that simply because it exists. If you want to see a comparison for yourself (and you should do it yourself because you know what suits you), simply go to a store selling a game on more than one system and play them all. Then you will notice why it really does not need to be a talking point at all.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2007"}

Sorry to say that I don't agree with the fans of this game. The graphics are totally old school and have an almost faded look to them.

I put a good four hours of playing time into this game and the more I played, the more ridiculous it got.  The characters aren't comical unless you like really bad jokes.  The controls are completely clunky and glitchy.  One thing that really bugged me was sometimes communication between characters was done with voices and sometimes only by text appearing in a box onscreen and there seemed no rhyme or reason as to why or when this happened.  According to other reviewers, this game takes anywhere from 20-30 hours to complete.  I can't imagine spending that much time on it.  I know this is not one of the big budget games for Xbox 360 but I have played ten year old games on GameCube that had better controls and graphics than this thing has.

Bullets whizzing by your head, footsteps, atmospherics. You hear it all. Those bullets? You perceive the sound as traveling past your head--the headset does a great simulation of time and space. I've owned other wireless headsets which have had annoying clicks, static, and other issues, presumably the result of competition on the wireless band from other devices. With the Ear Force XP510, not one. That problem is solved.The headset's sound quality is so good, it makes you overlook its annoying quirks. What are those?** Anything to do with the bluetooth chat. Chat sound quality is good. But it turns itself off all the time. One advantage over earlier headsets is that it announces when it is powering on and powering off.** When it decides to turn itself off generally. Yesterday, I had a quiet moment in a lobby. I decided to turn on the bluetooth. The bluetooth powers on. But then 10 seconds later, presumably because it had not received any audio input from the lobby, it turned itself off. If the device was a little smarter, it would have any user input received supersede the automatic turn off timers.The problems with this headset are really most likely the result of having to interact with the Xbox, a technology that is really almost eight years old.Speaking of that aging technology, if you are connecting your xbox to your tv via HDMI, you probably need an analog work around to get sound to your headset.Courtesy of Amazon reviewer Mike (original post located here, if you want to mark helpful:Hdmi Cable and Adapter for Xbox 360)on how to do this:\"The cable that came with my xbox would block the hdmi port when plugged in, so I couldn't plug both an hdmi cable and digital audio in at the same time (my receiver doesn't have hdmi). However, it is a fairly easy process to remove the plastiic casing around the cable with the digital audio and then both will fit - and it works like a charm.Just take a flat edge screwdriver to the crease in the side of the casing, give it a light tap with a hammer if necessary, and the plastic casing will pop off. Once this is done, both cables fit without a problem. You may want to wrap with electrical tape once the casing is removed.\"If this solution weirds you out too much, Turtle Beach does offer an adapter itself.Ear Force Audio Adapter Cable for Xbox 360. I bought an off-brand adapter, but it did not work. I have not tried Turtle Beach's solution. Make sure you have the right version for your machine.Overall, the xp510 is about as good as it gets. It provides excellent sound quality while eliminating tethering wires. The design decision to have chat bluetooth turn off with inactivity in order to save battery life was not a good one by Turtle Beach, but overall this headset is fantastic.Highly Recommended.

A couple of them look unimaginitive and just plain silly. The colors in the game are vibrant - maybe too much so. Some parts of the game look like they came out of Toy Story!The game play is simply the best I've ever seen for a third person shooter. The controls are intuitive and easy to get the hang of.The most anticipated feature of this game is the special ability of each of the 4 squad members. One can go invisible, another can shoot two guns at once, and one has special sniper abilities. These abilities are crucial to the game, and make gameplay more interesting than simply running and shooting.Which brings me to the game tactics. This is one of the best parts of the game. The whole game doesn't consist of running,  and shooting. It takes some strategy to clear out an enemy base. You can position a sniper and have your scout draw enemies out into the open. Don't get me wrong, you still have to run and gun quite a bit, but you could not win this game without using some strategy.The only negative aspect of this game is the story. It's waffer thin and detracting. But overall, this game does live up to the hype. It's one of two games you absolutely must have for X-box.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2003"}

{"product_name":"B002I0IVC4","description":"","reviewerName":"D. Smail \"Smailien\"","summary":"Wasn't a fan before, but I am now!","reviewText":"I'll start off by saying that until I got this, I had never owned a Street Fighter game, in fact the only time I sat down and played one was a looooong time ago. (I didn't even know what I was playing, I was like 6)I have always been a Mortal Kombat and Soul Caliber fanboy and didn't really give much credit to other games.  I bought my 3DS without any games mostly because I didn't have any money for games. After awhile I decided to buy this as it seemed to be the only one worth checking out in my opinion.I do not regret buying this at all, and in fact this game has turned me into a full blow Street Fighter maniac. SSF IV 3D is a significant portion of my time each day and has entertained me unshakingly.Gameplay:This is a very smooth fighter, and very balanced. Button mashing does not pay off here as you will probably just end up jumping around and doing weak punches.  You can really learn a character and develop a technique that is beyond knowing a few basic moves (Mortal Kombat generally has that feel to it).  Timing and attack choice really have weight and can make or break you when trying to pull off combos.  Some characters do seem to have a few unfair advantages (Bison can fly across the map and dart right back to the other side, Adon can pinpoint you if he is close enough) but overall it is very well balanced.  Highly offensive characters (Juri, Blanka, Sakura) tend to be in tight spots when they are not attacking, and defensive characters do well in the pocket.Graphics:From what I have seen from a bit of browsing the graphics are noticeably toned down from the console editions but for a handheld they look amazing. The 3D looks very crisp in the menus and such but because this is a fighting game you will probably give the system a fair amount of shaking, causing you to quickly drift in and out of the sweet spot.  I usually play with the 3D on, but don't feel like the game is detracted by having it off. Dynamic view (over the shoulder) makes the 3D effect rather intense, but I dislike it because it causes most of the screen to be your character.Replay:It's a fighter, if you are getting this you probably have a *very* high expectation for replay value, and this game delivers it well. I tend to change characters around a lot in most fighters to give it a fresh feeling, but with SSF IV I played a collective 4 hours in a row with Juri and didn't get tired of it AT ALL. (I've also done the same with Cody, Ryu, Ken, Guy... you get the picture)If you are already a SF fan I'm sure this game will deliver just what you expect.If you aren't, I suggest you give it a try. I wasn't a fan but I really love the series now, I've gone back and played a few of the classics and older editions and love them the same.If you are new to fighters this is probably the best out there to get started with.In summary: Don't miss out on this, get it on whatever system you have! Doesn't have to be on the 3DS!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00006599Q","description":"Turok: Evolutionis a prequel that takes us back to the origins of the Turok lineage. In the beginning of the game, we see our hero, Tal'Set, fighting nemesis Captain Tobias Bruckner in 1886 Texas. During the battle, a rift between their world and the Lost Lands opens and Tal'Set is sucked into it.Features and enhancements to this new installment in the Turok franchise include the groundbreaking Squad Dynamics System (SDS) for realistic enemy and allied squad AI, and an entirely new game engine built to take full advantage of the next-generation hardware platforms. All-new weapons including Variable Payload Cruise Missiles, Gravity Disrupter Beams, and the Swarm Bore--each with unique traits and damage. Flight sequences now enable players to soar through the skies on a winged pteranodon, and scripted event sequences bring the world to life with stunning detail.Turok: Evolutionfeatures 32 types of prehistoric and indigenous life rendered with frightening realism. The game is full of destructible objects and environments: shoot down trees over your enemies and collapse massive rock spires onto dinosaurs. The environments consist of lush, living jungles. Plants move as dinosaurs brush against them while trees sway in the wind. The game also includes stealth- and action-based gameplay directed by context-sensitive, mission-based sequences. Great care was also taken with the multiplayer modes, which were developed by a dedicated team of designers, programmers, and artists.","reviewerName":"-- \"--\"","summary":"\"Evolution\" could have used more evolving","reviewText":"\"Turok: Evolution\" is supposed to be a prequel to the earlier Turok games, and the term 'prequel' seems to imply that there is actually some plot going on behind all that first-person action. However, if that is true, I am hard-pressed to detect much of a story at all. I consistently felt as if I was just being dumped into missions that were little mini-games all by themselves. One chapter of the game hardly segues well with the next, and the narrative is almost completely incoherent. Still, it's hard to bash a first-person shooter for a bad storyline since the genre began by completely forsaking this ingredient (see \"Doom\" and \"Quake\" for example), but \"Evolution\" doesn't deliver the best of the best in gameplay terms either.You will encounter all kinds of dinosaurs and prehistoric critters in \"Evolution,\" but your primary foe will be the reptillian armies of the Sleg. These guys behave very strangely. Sometimes they take cover and shoot at you from around a corner, and other times they stand in place and hope for the best even as you fire away at them with your weapon of choice. Sometimes they duck and roll out of range and proceed to attack from a different position, and sometimes they walk right over a cliff edge and fall to their deaths. The point here is that sometimes they behave impressively, but generally they just serve to remind you that you're playing a video game because, after all, nobody would be THAT stupid. To make matters worse, these half-dinosaur troops all resemble one another to a fault, and vary only in size. I suppose the texture artists just got lazy and said, \"Well, we'll take this enemy model and make it bigger, and the programmers will make him tougher, and then we have a new enemy.\" So, aside from the occasional dinosaur attack, you will square off against the same guys over and over and over again.The levels fair somewhat better, but even they are inconsistent in their design. It's as if two completely different developers worked on this game. For instance, one very memorable level puts you in the so-called Halls of Battle, where humanity is making a stand against the bestial armies of the Sleg. The good guys are entrenched behind rubble as the bad guys fire away at them. Then you come in and, well, save the day. It isn't quite as cool as those scripted moments in \"Halo,\" but it's similar in its flavor. However, the majority of levels in the game are completely forgettable and uninspiring.To top it off, aiming isn't nearly as efficient as it should be in \"Evolution.\" Even with the autoaim turned on, you will often miss your target in the heat of battle, and, needless to say, that's not a good thing. To make matters worse, you will sometimes encounter packs of small dinosaurs or other animals that are just too tiny and agile to get the drop on. If they kill you, you have the added pleasure of starting the entire level from scratch, as \"Evolution\" makes the often-lamented mistake of preventing you from saving in the middle of a mission. Checkpoints would have helped, but these remain absent as well. Oops.Worst of all, though, is the game's misguided flight mode. Sometimes you will be called upon to take flight astride a winged, gun-toting dino that can pretty much only go in one direction most of the time. I appreciate the idea - it should add some texture to the game and break the monotony of constantly running and gunning, but, in the end, it's far more frustrating than it is fun. You only have a limited amount of control in these instances, and too much trial and error is involved. Worse, if you fly too high or try to throw aside your chains by heading in an unauthorized direction, you will be forced to swing VIOLENTLY back into place, which will often send you whipping into a wall - which INSTANTLY kills you. This flight mode is the single worst part about \"Evolution.\"The game isn't a bust, though - particularly if you're a rabid fan of shooters. Every game in this series has offered a fine array of original and compelling weapons, and \"Evolution\" is no exception. Putting these weapons to work is bloody indeed. The damage modeling is pretty good, and enemies will react to the impact of projectiles depending upon the direction from which they were launched. Unfortunately, all that work seems in vain since dead opponents and all lingering gore fade from sight in a matter of seconds. It's a pity.Despite a somewhat rickety engine, the designers also went to quite some trouble to bring the outdoor environments to life. Plants sway as you pass through them. Birds fly through the air and nest in the trees. Vicious crocs swim just beneath the surface of the water. The list goes on. It's very immersive stuff. The larger dinosaurs of the game are a treat as well, since they are so well-animated and believable.Multiplayer \"Evolution\" is quite fun, though it still suffers from some of the single-player campaign's faults. The list of gameplay options, character models, and multiplayer levels is long indeed, and should provide a healthy dose of replay value. In fact, you could get your money's worth by having at the multiplayer stuff all by itself. It's arguable that it's better than the single-player game.In the end, \"Turok\" is a pretty decent fps, but its flaws are glaring, especially on the Xbox console since it has to compete with \"Halo.\" Everything \"Evolution\" does, \"Halo\" does better. It's that simple, really. If you love shooters and are all finished with \"Halo,\" then give \"Evolution\" a chance. But don't let your expectations get too high.Final Score: C (Or 3 stars)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2003"}

Each animal has a unique mode of operating, which means that the two interconnected narratives behind this game each offer their own distinctive challenges to conquer.As the armored, action-oriented scorpion, you'll string together stinging blows into deadly combo moves that culminate in cinematic finishes and decimate your opponents. Playing as the sneaky tarantula requires a little more finesse--you'll find yourself leaping from above onto your nemesis, throw out neatly aimed shots of webbing to paralyze your prey, and finishing creatures off with your devastating fangs.Wild Enemies and a Sinister Back StoryIt takes skill and composure to master the moves the scorpion and tarantula have at their disposal. And, even after you think you've got every move down, you'll find you need to learn methods, since these life-and-death struggles take place between you and a huge array of vicious, hazardous creatures, including wolf spiders, rattlesnakes, Gila Monsters, Tarantula Wasps, black widows, mantises, enemies of your own species, rats, and even humans.Beyond the immediacy of fighting for survival, this game features a story of greed and betrayal in the human world. Slowly unveiled from the disparate perspectives of the two headline creatures, this evolving storyline helps keep even advanced players engaged and guessing at the implications of their own actions.Explore Brutal, Unforgiving EnvironmentsWhichever creature you're playing as, you'll have 360-degree access to a wide range of 3D environments based in the harsh Sonoran Desert. You'll explore a gloomy maze of thorny brambles, forgotten underground tunnels filled with rusting pipes, an above ground wasteland packed with people's garbage, and even a desolate gas station. Each arena promises to challenge your skills as a hunter and a survivor in its own way, while unique angles and a sense of scale that turns small, familiar objects into major obstacles help make these environs especially prickly.","reviewerName":"Halicon5","summary":"Disappointing level designs mar an otherwise good game.","reviewText":"The premise of the Deadly Creatures is promising.  The player takes the role of either a tarantula or a scorpion in the desert and must battle for survival.  The storyline surrounding the game is honestly quite cool and has some of the nicest voice acting I've heard in a long time.  Deadly Creatures tries to be fresh and innovative, and it succeeds in many ways, but ultimately I found the game to be lacking.GRAPHICS: Solid.  The game looks good, better than a lot of Wii games.  It is clean and crisp looking, but isn't without issues.  Many of the environments feel very similar because everything is drawn in the same drab desert palette.  I would have liked to see some brighter colors with more contrast, especially on the insects, lizards, and other critters.  The desert itself isn't typically that beautiful in most people's opinions, but many of its denizens have beautiful and bright markings.  The game fails to capitalize on that, which is a shame.STORY: Very Good, but odd.  The player has very little to do with story until a little more than half-way through the game.  Until then, you basically observe snippets of the story about two humans searching for treasure and stuff.  Ultimately it is a story of betrayal and drama, and very well written.  Strangely, storyline is one of the best aspects of the game.CHARACTER DESIGN: Very Good.  The two characters, tarantula and scorpion, function very differently.  The spider can walk on walls and ceilings, jump, use webbing to temporarily trap opponents, use webbing to jump from one web to another, and do stealth pounces from a great distance.  The scorpion is more of a brawler who swipes at enemies with its claws, strikes with its tail, burrow underground for surprise attacks, and can finish weakened enemies off with some finishing moves.  Additionally, the scorpion can dig holes, remove environmental debris, and cut obstructing weeds with his claws.  As far as I'm concerned, the character designs and abilities are good, well-rounded, and well thought out.CONTROLS: Very Good.  If there is one thing this game did well, controls would be it.  Most Wii games don't control nearly as well as Deadly Creatures does.  Moving your critter around is fairly intuitive.  The primary movement is controlled by the analog stick on the nunchuck and is very responsive.  Motion controls are used heavily in the game to good effect and pointer controls to a lesser degree.  Waggle motions are used sparingly and the motion controls are tight and responsive.  In addition, the player is given the option of increasing or decreasing the sensitivity of the motion controls.  This is something most games don't do but should.  The only exception is the camera, which would sometimes freak out and get terribly confused.  Camera issues were thankfully very rare, but very annoying when they happened.LEVELS: Lackluster and linear.  Much of the hype around the game indicated that the tarantula's levels would be more stealth oriented and the scorpion's levels more combat oriented.  The scorpion levels were actually better than I expected, but the tarantula's levels were a letdown.  There is actually very little stealth involved, which is a shame because the spider's moves and skills lend it perfectly to be a stealthy hunter.  Essentially, the tarantula levels end up playing a lot like the scorpion levels except you find yourself also doing the same things on ceilings or using web-jumping to get to an area before you brawl with more desert critters that want to eat you.  Finally, the game looks like you do a lot of exploration, but in actuality the game is very, very linear.  There are collectibles on every level, which I managed to get most all of them on my first time through any given level.REPLAYABILITY: Low.  The game can be beaten in a few sittings.  I plowed through half the game in few hours.  Aside from gathering collectibles on revisits or playing on harder difficulty settings, I didn't really see much purpose to replaying the levels.  The bigger problem is that few of the levels provided me with any compelling reason to play them a second time, regardless of what un-lockable rewards I received.Overall, I can honestly say that the only thing that kept me coming back was storyline.  Ultimately, the lackluster level design drove me away from what is otherwise a very fine game and a very original idea.  Honestly, if the tarantula's levels had been redesigned to focus on stealth I feel the game would have been more rewarding.  While I truly enjoyed playing this game, I quickly grew bored with the level designs and eventually quit playing probably about 80% of the way through the game.  I recommend renting this game before buying.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2009"}

I have played the first four classic entries of the series, and Lament of Innocence, the Mercury Steam Lords of Shadow and Mirror of Fate, and I must say that not only was this entry released in Konami's prime, but they have given the name Castlevania a whole new meaning while adding to the overall gameplay experience. The environment of the game is astoundingly detailed with 3D background effects, including moving objects in full 3D and the creativity involved in developing the enemies make it that much easier to immerse yourself in this wonderful complete fantasy world, and escaping reality. With that being said, seeing that this game was directly influenced by Super Metroid, and perhaps some of the other Nintendo entries to the series, I must say that the Metroid-style gameplay was executed beautifully with all kinds of different suits (or cloaks) you can pick up, fluid controls, and an absolutely fantastic soundtrack that fits each and every one of its perspective environments the tracks were made for. Another excellent aspect of this game is the idea of leveling up your character to increase stats and such. That was beautifully implemented, rewarding you with easier gameplay if you destroy enough enemies and find the most powerful cloaks and weapons you can find in the game. You can also acquire various transformations that will turn your character into either a bat, a purple wolf, or simply a handful of mist, so you can pass through obstacles that were blocked before. Overall, this game is the most groundbreaking entry of the series, and it is one that I would not mind playing again and again, as the gameplay is as versatile as it gets with these style of games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2014"}

N. K \"Esco\"","summary":"Better Than Anthology!....Even with the Worst Hero Ever!!","reviewText":"Frankly I don't know why people loved FF:Anthology so much...it really wasn't that good.  I mean, FF6 was better on the SNES, minus the FMV, and FF5 wasn't that good to begin with.  This, on the other hand, features Chrono Trigger, a rather good game, and a highly enhanced version of Final Fantasy IV, the game that launched the series into the main character-based RPG series in history!  Personally, I say go with this package, definately!!Chrono Trigger is a good game, with nice SNES graphics that're almost as good as Super Mario RPG's, decent music (although no FF6, and certainly not Yasonuri Mitsuda's best...even close), a nice out-of-battle interface, and an interesting quest that takes you throughout time.  True, since I never really played this game until FF Chronicles, I may have liked it more if I actually got it in 1995 (just about the only Square game I missed between the years 1991 and 2001).  I don't agree that it's quite possibly the greatest RPG of all time (mostly because I HATED Chrono, the character, SO MUCH!!!), but it is a nice enjoyable romp, and features plot twists that were about time, yet somehow weren't stolen from either H.G.Welles or Dr. Who!  That got me at least!Now, I'm not gonna deny it, but to me, the whole point of buying this package is for FF4!  The graphics are suprememly outdated, and so is the sound quality, but that doesn't change much when it comes to this game...quite possibly the greatest FF of all time!  The music is better composed than in Chrono Trigger, the characters are almost infinitely better, the battle system and interface are very easy to use, and even if you've played though it on the SNES a thousand times, unlike Chrono Trigger, this game features something new on the PSX.Yes, it's sad, that while FFIV was greatly enhanced and a totally new experience on the PSX, Chrono Trigger remains almost completely unchanged from what I can figure out.  Behind them both are nice long storylines, and behind FFIV is also strong character content.  Chrono Trigger's is full of many choices, which even FFIV doesn't have!  The plot twists are also cool, even by today's standards, although there's no real food for thought like in FFX or either Xeno games.  While FFIV doesn't feature much more food for thought, it does tell one of the greatest RPG tales of all time by far, and still contains some of the greatest musical tracks ever written.  Nobuo Uematsu may be loosing it now, but when it comes to his middle works like this through FFVII, he was quite a head-turner.  You follow Cecil on a much more elaborate and detailed quest than that of Chrono Trigger, which is dialogue centered, but still features a great gameplay system, albeit old, and full of random battles.  The equipping interface is still larger than that of any other strictly console-RPG I've seen (in terms of weapons and armor).  I kid you not when I say that FFIV is the reason I became a film major!  It was 12 years ago I saw the light, and it still shines onto me as strong as ever!Whether the more fun and basic, yet fast-moving quest of Chrono Trigger is your type, or the more elaborate and character driven Final Fantasy IV is your type (like it is mine, as you could figure out), this game is a must have!  Two legendary games!I think they could have called this: \"Final Fantasy: The Two RPG's that Wrote the Book that all RPG's Would Later Follow\", except for the fact that it's way too long of a title.  Original and entertaining until the end of time, get these games, for the power of epic awaits you!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2003"}
{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"S.L.J.C.O.A.A.A.T.R. \"SCOTTY\"","summary":"THE NEW GENERATION OF MARIO!","reviewText":"THIS MARIO GAME IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES.LUIGI,MARIOS BROTHER DOESN'T APPEAR IN THE GAME.THIS GAME ONLY INTODUCES ONE NEW MAJOR CHARACTER TO THE SERIES AND THAT'S BOWSER JR.THE GAME IS VERY EXCITING.THE STORY LINE IS MARIO,PEACH,TOAD AND A BUNCH OF RESIDENTS FROM THE MUSHRUM KINGDOM ARE ON VACATION ON DELFINO ISLE.WHEN THY ARRIVE AT THE DELFINO ISLE AIRPORT MARIO IS FRAMED AS A VILLIAN WHO IS DRAWING LIVING GRAFFITI ALL OVER THE ISLAND!MARIO NOW FINDS A MACHINE CALLED F.L.U.D.D.

Good Campaign, second-rate MP.","reviewText":"The Campaign was pretty good, not as good as COD4, but still worth playing.Zombies mode is still fun, I got the hardened version because I really liked the older Zombie maps.The MP is just a recycled version of COD4, WAW, and MW2 with a few extra additions. I don't find the COD points very interesting, I don't like that you have to level up to unlock the weapon, attachment, ect, and you still have to buy it. Also, now you have to complete a serise of challanges to unlock the pro perk, and some of those challanges may not suit to everyone. For instance, if you want to unlock marathon pro, you have to play CTF, I hate CTF and never play it, so no if I want that perk to be pro I have to play CTF. Same with Ninja, you have to plant bombs to unlock pro, what if you don't like S&D; or Demolition?I do like that the MP is balanced, there are no more overpowered killstreaks. The dogs are kind of overpowered, but still not as bad as an AC130 or chopper gunner.The one thing I really really about this game is the sound. The sound is absolutely terrible in MP. For instance, the footsteps... you can't hear them. I have an expensive set of surround sound headphones and they are useless since you can't hear the footsteps. The Ninja perk is not even necessary since the enemy is moving in dead silence by default. Even after you unlock Ninja Pro, it just sound like random footsteps, there is no sense of direction.Overall this is a subpar game that was overhyped to be this great game that was going to change the future of FPS. Treyarch must have some seriously talentless developers, because they supposedly spent two full years exclusively to develop this game. Just another fail product from Treyarch studios.

{"product_name":"B00BGAA0SU","description":"","reviewerName":"Chevy","summary":"Sucker Punch Spectacular","reviewText":"Infamous Second Son is a beautifully crafted game that compliments the series, yet is also capable of standing on its own. The graphics are superb and the gameplay is full of action. This game does a wonderful job of showing off the potential of the PS4.You are Delson Rowe, younger brother of a newly elected sheriff. You accidentally siphon the powers of a so called \"bio terrorist.\" This leads you and your brother to Seattle, Washington.In this contemporary Seattle, the Department of Unified Protection (DUP), led by a ruthless woman named Brooke Augustine, hunts bio terrorists. Augustine has powers of her own, and she has bestowed some of her powers unto the DUP troops under her command. DUP has militarized much of the city, and they run patrols as well. DUP's oppressive presence is evident in the attitudes of the people.Your goal is to stop the DUP and its powerful leader. First, though, you need to increase your powers, or you'll be no match for Augustine.Seattle is divided into districts. Each district has main story quests, along with many side activities. You gradually erode the DUP's presence in a district by doing all of the activities, then challenging the DUP in a district showdown, in which you must defeat a group or groups of DUP soldiers that are dispatched to your location.You will gain powers through main story quests. Other powers are purchased by collecting blast shards, which are also used to upgrade your powers.It's autumn, apparent from the colorful trees. The rain effects look great and don't hinder performance at all. I noticed no framerate issues regardless of all the action in the populated city. I did notice some infrequent texture tearing in the form of fallen enemies meshing together like a two-headed, four-armed and -legged mutant.You'll gain four classes of powers, not counting melee. The effects are stellar, and the visuals of Delson recharging his powers are literally the coolest thing I've seen in a game in decades.I would like to see more story implementation in the side activities. Much time is spent in combat, exploring, and doing side activities. It's easy to forget what the main mission is because it's so easy to get side tracked. Once you hit the main story icon, however, you quickly get back on track.The controls are excellent. The map and powers tree are easy to understand and navigate. This game looks and plays like a dream. The great thing about Infamous is that it warrants two play throughs---one as good and one as evil. Each has its own particular powers, and the story tilts to go with whichever side you choose. The world and your character no longer turn gray when playing evil. Now it's just Delson's clothes that change color. Of note, only the decal on Delson's default vest changes to represent his karma (good or evil). Decals on the bonus vests do not change.One thing I don't particularly care for is the requirement of creating a separate online account with a computer in order to experience the additional content in the game. This content is called \"Paper Trail.\" It offers more things to do as content is periodically released. I think this should be downloadable from the PSN store, not require the player to log on to an account with their computer. I think this is a hassle. This is the only hang-up I have with the game.I highly recommend Infamous Second Son. It's a blast to play and the graphics are nothing short of awesome. If you're a fan of the series, you'll appreciate the improvements in Second Son. If you're new to the series, you're in for a treat.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00009WAUH","description":"As renowned as theFinal Fantasyseries has become over the years, the release ofCrystal Chroniclesbrings with it an air of unfamiliarity. Although many of its elements tie into the greaterFinal Fantasyuniverse, this is but a faint echo of what you have come to know and love.While it can be argued that this is a new direction for the series, and therefore shouldn't be put on the same level as the other games, fans have come to expect the best fromFinal Fantasy, and with each passing release, Square has delivered.Crystal Chroniclesmay break new ground, but it lacks the creativity and passion of its role-playing brethren.As stylish as the character designs may be, they are completely void of personality. The story is just as ambiguous. Never once did I feel attached to my character, nor did I care what twists or turns the plot would make. TheFinal Fantasygames are renowned for storytelling, but it seems like an afterthought inCrystal Chronicles. Cinematic flair is also noticeably&nbsp;absent.The gameplay is just as careless and jagged. While the quest can be played single-player, it's meant to be tackled by a group of people (preferably four). Since each player utilizes menu screens often, Square and Game Designer's Studio decided that you could only play multiplayer with a Game Boy Advance attached to the GameCube. Hence, all menu management is done on the GBA screen, and the action on the TV is unaffected. In theory, this is a just solution. As it turns out, though, I found it to be more detrimental to the quest than anything.When a player accesses the GBA, their character on the TV cannot be controlled. Not only does this leave them open to attack, it more or less halts any progress that the group can make. So basically, you still find yourself sitting around waiting for your buddy to make preparations, but instead, you're doing it with a controller that has fewer buttons and dying batteries.To make matters worse, players must also keep an eye on a bucket. To prevent characters from scattering and trying to run in different directions, the bucket emits a field of energy that covers roughly 80 percent of the screen. If you go outside of this barrier, you'll take damage. So you basically must stay huddled together as one person carries the bucket throughout a stage. Without question, this is one of the stupidest ideas in the history of video games.When it comes to the basics of gameplay, the combat is respectable, but by no means great. I really like the timing-based combo system that accompanies both magic and general hack n' slash, yet I absolutely despise losing all of my magic with each new area that I enter. Hence, classes are not defined, and you never really get the impression that your character is growing in power.There's little here that truly excites.Crystal Chroniclesplays like an experiment gone awry, and is unfit to bear the sacrosanctFinal Fantasyname.Concept:A hack n' slash with inventive, yet highly aggravating GBA-based multiplayer connectivity, and a worthless bucketGraphics:Stylish character designs, gorgeous particle effects, and awesome boss designsSound:Not the familiarFinal Fantasymelodies, but memorable nonethelessPlayability:Steers away from button mashing with timing-based chains, manual spell aiming, and multi-person combosEntertainment:A cookie cutter adventure with a lackluster story, poor character growth, and frustrating playReplay:Moderately HighRated:7 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Crystal Chroniclesis here to remind us that every so often, Square Enix actually puts out an average game. It seems like for every thingFF: CCdoes right, it does two things wrong. Combining spells with your teammates is awesome, but half the time it's less effective than two individual castings, and you lose all of your magic between areas. The effects and character models are cool, but downtimes really drag and many cutscenes look awfully similar. The worst part, though, is that character advancement is the slowest I've ever seen. Beat a boss and get your choice of +1 to one of your stats! Thrilling. There is certainly some enjoyment to be had here, but it's sprinkled somewhat thinly among all of the lame and boring parts. On a console with a lot of great four-player titles,Crystal Chroniclesdoes very little to distinguish itself.Rated:7 out of 10Editor:Adam BiessenerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Pretty to look at but a lot of little problems 3.5 stars","reviewText":"After being away from Nintendo for a decade the Final Fantasy Series finally comes back to Nintendo game consoles. Crystal Chronicles is nice for some FF fans but not all. More over it has more of Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance kind of way to battle rather than the old style turn-based.The story in Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles is one to honor for it's creativeness. A large, dark, poisonous miasma covers the world and can only be controlled by the magical large crystals. These Crystals repel the pwer of the miasma The thing is though, the Crystals lose power after a year. So it's up to your character to find the Myrth to recharge these crystals that are at the center of every town. It's a creative story, but it lacks the story-telling that Final Fantasy has become famous for over the years.You start off by selecting your character and customizing him or her the way you want them to be. This seems good but it actually makes the game lack the other portion of what FF is famous for. It's characters aren't that loveable or developed. You don't feel anything for these characters.That's not to say Crystal Chronicles isn't a pretty game. The character models and landscapes are INCREDIBLE to look at. The monsters and everything in this game are quite simply astonishing. The boss designs are even more amazing to look at. So the graphics are incredible in this game.The gameplay is actually where Crystal Chronicles begins to faulter. It's great to hook up with your friends and go running around. Executing attacks and the control scheme are brilliantly done. It's the connectivity and the lack of actually playing the game. First, in order to play multiplayer you MUST hook up a Gameboy Advance. If you want to play multiplayer you CAN'T do it without a GBA (which means if you don't have one you HAVE to get one to play multiplayer). Each time you're in the middle of action and someone has to stop and pause the game for whatever reason (equipment, healing and that sort) the gameplay for that character stops. In single player this is no problem, but in multiplayer it'll leave the character in the menu open to take damage.This isn't all. Players also need to keep their eye on a bucket that covers about 4/5 of the screen. If characters step outside of this bucket they take damage. This forces you all to be huddled together on screen.But the good news is that playing with your friends on multiplayer is a blast. The game is actually harder with four characters than it is with one, which helps the gameplay element. Of course, the other problem with connecting is that if someone's batteries in their GBA dies ummm...well that character is helpless.As far as the sound and music go, it's not quite the same music is was before but the tunes are still memorable nonetheless. The sound effects aren't bad either so the game really hits high here.Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, for what it's worth, isn't a bad game really. The multiplayer is fun but it suffers from quite a few little bugs. Great concept for the game... but it seems like the recipe was missing something.The Good+Amazing Graphics+Great Gameplay on Multiplayer+Good Music+Creative story+Nice Combat System+Custom charactersThe Bad-You can only play Multiplayer with the GBA, so if you want multiplayer you have to BUY a GBA!-When in the menu on the GBA your character is open to take damage-The characters lack developement-That bucket makes it so your characters have to be huddled together-If someones batteries in their GBA dies then that character is ineffective","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2004"}

Ironically, when Nintendo released the DS system last year, they just really haven't found a game that would definitely appeal to all ages. Although they have had some good games like Meteos, a revised edition of Super Mario 64, there just hasn't been something for all pet lovers to really enjoy. Now, there is something for them to enjoy.Nintendogs for the Nintendo DS, is the latest answer to virtual pets. The game features a variety of loveable dogs that you can make them do tricks, roll over, and chase their tails. The dogs are vurtually adorable and have the unique appeal you'd see dogs have in any pet store. The graphics in the game really do come out very well, within each detail of all of the canines, while the music might be cutesy and sometimes too annoying. The control for all of the editions is very simple to maintain within the stylus, and definitely can be maintained simply with the turn of the hand. With each dog, you can also get special treats like collars, and pet toys and make them do special tricks for more funds as well.All in all, when I got to try the demo edition of this game, I honestly thought this would be very interesting to try and own. I was right. Nintendogs is a great game for all Nintendo DS owners young and old, and for those who want a dog, but just simply can't afford it.Graphics: B+Sound: BControl: BFun & Enjoyment: B 1/2+Overall: B","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2005"}

I didn't even finish it. It started strong but the world was so sparse and empty, the whole thing just felt like an empty amusement park. So, I wasn't expecting much when my son suggested playing Borderlands 2 on our PC's cooperatively.I am having a much better time this time around. The loot is fun, the game is highly irreverent, sarcastic, and tongue in cheek gory and violent. The cut scenes introducing each new boss are simply hilarious and remind you that this whole game is just a big goof. It's like playing an action comedy.  Lots of shooting and killing but no one is really taking it too seriously. This game is the perfect anti-dote to the latest Call of Battlefield military shooter. I like and play BF3 and MW, but that market is so saturated and seems stuck on a permanent rinse, wash, and repeat cycle. This game is a tasty change of pace.Plot? Not that it matters really, but a big bad guy is taking over Pandora. You (and your coop partner if you choose) resist and fight him and his goons. Lots of guns, all with little variations. Check out the gameplay videos on youtube to get a taste. This time around, the cell shaded graphics really pop. The planet is really colorful and somehow the weird comic book motif just works. The voiceovers are awesome and hilarious. If you want a change from the latest military shooters, check this game out; just expect a lighthearted jaunt through bullet ridden Pandora (the planet you are on) rather than a serious minded save the world style of game. Depth? No. Fun? Absolutely.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2012"}

I play all the games online any chance I can get and will tell anyone it's the best game.  I absolutely hated the first Bad Company game.  The controls were stiff and difficult to get used to and the graphics were nothing to write home about.  So naturally, when this one was released, I shrugged it off and kept going with COD.  Then the reviews started pouring in.  Game Informer, IGN, and all the friends I know were ranting and raving about this game being the best ever.  Extra 60 bucks and I got the game.  Although I remained skeptical, I started playing the story mode.  It was good, nothing overly impressive.  The graphics and controls have improved so much from the first game.  And then there was online.  The online modes of this game makes this my favorite 360 game of all time.  It's a little more difficult to heal when you are injured, you have to be way more accurate when you're shooting people and the modes are more realistic.  Of course, playing this on an HDTV only helps to make it better!  I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who is either a fan of COD or just first person shooters.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2010"}

I have played all of the KH games various amount of times and after all that playing, this is probably the second disappointment of the franchise just ahead of Chain of Memories. This game is set after KH II, which makes this the latest entrant in the series chronologically. It has an original story, but it is one that does not hold that KH brand kind of power. The game play is somewhat the same from other titles except each world you go to must be played differently than the last. Not really captivating, it does not have any real memorable moments except when it explains the letter Sora, Riku, and Kairi receive at the end of KH II. The graphics are okay but not better than any of the other instalments. This is a game that is made to a starving fan base for the next game and not meeting expectations (*cough* KH III *cough*)Pro:+ Different Kingdom HeartsCon:- Not all that good as a wholeLooking at the big picture, die KH fans should get this, but any others out would best spend their money elsewhere.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2012"}

And while it's campaign sometimes is bland in what it has you do in regards to missions, graphically it will impress you the whole journey. Also it is nice that you can attack missions in a variety of ways from going in loud guns blazing to stealthily carrying out the objective. To me this the kind of thing that really adds some replay value to the campaign.  I like to have a game like this for when friends come by and they want to see what the PlayStation 4 can do because this game shows that off.I think the multiplayer lost a little something in its playability this go round. I mean I played a lot of Killzone 3 and I love it but I find this a little less interesting. Sometimes the options are just downright confusing as they still don't know how to hear my teammates (I actually think you can hear them like some other players at this time).  That is really a bummer because I do like Killzone multiplayer I just think it's not as straightforward as it needs to be.  It is 24 player 12v12 that is nice.Multiplayer tip: Play support and revive teammates SOOOOOO many people don't do this and it's so helpful to winning... please do this.On a side note another thing that is grievous about the game is there are only a handful of button layouts available. I think many people were under the impression that Shadow Fall would include button remapping (the ability to change the button layouts to suit your play style) but sadly we are stuck with only a few button presets. As a disabled gamer button remapping is important and shadow fall should include it but it doesn't.Thanks for reading I hope you found some of this information useful.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2013"}

I often access Pandora and listen to music from the TV now.This plays blu-ray/regular and copied DVD's.  My wife has had shows for months that her mom copied for her that she was never able to watch until now because of the PS3.I haven't even begun to explore the playstation network yet, but I'm not much of an online gamer.

I grew up slamming the single red button on my Atari 2600 joystick and winning free ships in games that rewarded fast reflexes. I never got into D&D;, games that involved configuring 500 attributes for each character, 17- sided dice, or planning attack routes in advance. I didn't think I would ever dig playing something that involved a lot of thought and thoughtfulness.Until now.Firaxis has made a game that involves strategy, role-playing, and turn-based combat yet is compelling to first person shooter fanatics like me. The key to sucking me into XCOM's world was the high quality of the tutorial levels. Rather than just dumping me into a crazy array of character building, base construction, resource allocation, loadouts, and mission selection, the tutorials did a good job of building up my competence and comfort in the game at a reasonable pace.There are a couple of things that I think could be improved. First, the graphics are a little rough and not up to the standard of games that have been released in the last couple of years. Second, the story and characterization is full of typical videogame and sci-fi clich&eacute;s. Still, the meat of the game is in creating strategies, coming up with tactics to support your strategies, and plotting out battle plans for your squad, so these two complaints are just quibbles. Once you get immersed in a mission, the way the game looks and the story it tells become somewhat secondary.Bottom line: as a newcomer to both the XCOM series and its genre of games, I didn't really know what to expect. I anticipated either getting bored or becoming frustrated. Neither of these has happened; I'm having a lot of fun playing the game. Four stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2013"}

This expansion allows for only one Death Knight per realm, per account.New Environments in Northrend AwaitJourney through the remote, diverse lands of Northrend and explore Dragonblight, Grizzly Hills, Borean Tundra, and Howling Fjord. Named for bones of perished dragons and majestic shrines to the fallen creatures, Dragonblight is an arctic wasteland surrounded by dense forests.Not everything is frozen in Northrend. The lush mountains of Grizzly Hills are the ancestral home to the furbolgs, who have grown accustomed to relative peace. Although their tranquility is being challenged by trappers, goblins, and ice trolls, Grizzly Hills remains a vast and dangerous wilderness.The southwestern tip of Northrend is home to the sprawling Borean Tundra. The Horde has established a dominant presence in this icy portion of the continent and has formed a bond with the tuskarr, a walrus-like race of nomadic fisherman. Magical energy is afoot in the region, and it has caused increased tension.High above the Great Sea at the southeastern tip of Northrend lies the Howling Fjord. Ancient mythology holds that a race of half-giant warriors, the vrykul, once inhabited the land, founding a prosperous civilization. They mysteriously vanished, leaving deserted villages and abandoned temples. In present times, the Alliance and the Horde have come to Howling Fjord to confront the Lich King. Strangely, this has prompted the return of the vrykul, who are attacking the Alliance and Horde settlements. Howling Fjord presents a difficult challenge on two fronts: withstanding the vrykul's onslaught and battling the evil Lich King.A Multitude of MonstersStrange and terrifying creatures inhabit the frozen continent of Northrend, such as Nerubian Viziniers, Plague Eruptors, Shoveltusks and Flesh Giants, to name just a few. Half-spider, half-humanoid, the viziniers utilize sorcery and high intelligence to emerge as the rulers of Nerubians' underground kingdom. The Plague Eruptors are walking corpses created by the Lich King's evil experiments to spread horror and chaos across the living world.Massive curved antlers make it easy to identify the Shoveltusks. These grumpy beasts are very dangerous, territorial, and best left alone. The Flesh Giants are nothing short of nightmarish abominations. Cobbled together from the pieces of giant body parts, the Flesh Giants employ tremendous strength to carry out the Lich King's wishes.The World of Warcraft: Wrath of King Lich expansion pack allows you to engage in epic siege warfare. The pack presents the first Hero class and allows you to transform your Death Knight's look with character customization that even include hairstyles and dances. You'll enjoy exploring the Northrend and all its environments and dungeons, filled with some of the deadliest creatures -- and greatest treasures -- on all of Azeroth.System RequirementsMinimumRecommendedOperating SystemPC: Microsoft Windows XP or Windows Vista (with latest Service Packs)Mac: Mac OS X 10.4.11 or newerCPUPC: Intel Pentium 4 1.3 GHz or AMD Athlong XP 1500+Mac: PowerPC G5 1.6 GHz or Intel Core Duo processorPC: Dual-core processor, such as Intel Pentium D or AmD Athlong 64 X2Mac: Intel 1.8 GHz processor or betterGraphics HardwarePC: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transfor and Lighting with 32 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon 7200 or NVIDIA GeForce2 class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transform and Lighting with 64 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon 9600 or NVIDIA GeForce Ti 4600 class card or betterPC: 3D Graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capabilities with 128 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA GeForce 7600 GT class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capability with 128 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA 7600 class card or better.MemoryPC: 512 MB (1 GB for Vista)Mac: 1 GBPC: 1 GB (2 GB for Vista)Mac: 2 GBHard Drive Space15 GB of free spaceAll Platform RequirementsKeyboard and mouse, required for controls.

Just a new carrot to put on the string","reviewText":"I also did my review at gamespot here it is for aamazon.This game is complete garbage! Before I even get into the review I want to note that this game is broken. If you do purchase the expansion just be prepared for server crashes, restarts, and appologies from Blizzard stating that the realms will be down for 4 hours or more while they fix issues with the new content. Heck, even if your playing on the old \"content\" you still will be sitting at your computer looking at the Sign on screen.I wish Blizzard would work on making new and interesting game content, rather than putting a new paint job on the same old house. The new world looks the same as the old worlds. Just a few design differences. Nothing truly out of this world or note worthy. The new PVP battleground was nothing to brag about. Picture Alterac Valley with a fortress you defend. The new PVP gear is just a new and even more horrible grind. PVP armor is 60K a piece and there are 5 pieces to collect. Enjoy having no life and spending hours farming the honor needed for those sets.Not to mention enjoy trying to earn those points fighting against the horrible class balancing that Blizzard makes an attempt to fix every new patch.The real killer is that Blizzard almost forces you to buy the expansion. All the old cities are just about empty now. Shatterah is a ghost town, better yet Outlands are like a barren wasteland now. All the previous battle grounds are now 70+ , so if your decked out in that PVP armor enchanted to the teeth good luck getting swated by people 9 levels higher than you. The only BG that seems untouched is the Alterac Valley(which is 61-70). Mostly what you'll find are bunches of 60's and few 70's as most accounts have moved on and leveled, level some games noticably uneven (20 to 40). There are new arts and crafts for you to learn, and world PVP is still boring as ever. Invade a city and be prepared for 90 Gaurds to spawn and wipe you.Aside from,10 new levels, some new items and trades, a new area to run around in (which looks more like a missmash of the previous games rolled into one), there really isnt much to do. Blizzard has the greedy idea to keep you playing longer they should at more levels, but once you hit the cap, they give you little to do afterwards. Usually it's one of 3. Raid,ARENA, or make a new character. You'll eventually end up with the same problem you had last game. Decked out in the best armor and bored as hell with nothing to do. Like I always argued with people, Blizzard needs to work on adding fun and exciting game content, not regurgitated ideas from yesteryear.Overall the Wrath Of The Lich King is nothing new or worth buying, unless you just want to hit 80.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000O5DS32","description":"Prepare to experience an evolution in the first person shooter. Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"Deimos \".\"","summary":"One of the best 360 games yet!","reviewText":"Amazing graphics, awesome missions, very realistic atmosphere, and hair raising dinosaurs.

I liked it a lot, the side quests for leveling get old at some point. if you are a person like me that likes to do everything before trying to do the end missions then you know how it goes. I got done with the side quests just before it got really boring so that was ok, some things bothered me tho, like for example its 204x and still they have doors that take a really long time to open? another thing that bothered me was the damn elevators, again, it's the future plus element zero exists why would the elevators take forever to get to a place, the elevator in the ship is like a waste of a couple of minutes.Aside from that the cities, the characters, the weapons and the skills are amazing. I was always motivated into acquiring new weapons and armors.The mineral mining and the planet stuff I guess if the rover didn't take so long some time to climb up some parts I guess it would be fine because when you are mining for item and you want to complete them you tend to look everywhere and so it takes time, till the point it gets old. The funny part is, I completed the minerals and then after started the missions and so another galaxy opened and somehow I found more tags, more minerals, and more prothean tech, makes no sense... just that I wasted too much time looking for stuff in the beginning.The ending, well its simply the best part you will love it if you like sifi games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"Greg","summary":"A New Spectre","reviewText":"...and oh, do I love it!Mass Effect is such a special animal; an RPG sci-fi soap opera that, somehow, garnered general audience approval.  It's a different type of gameplay, where you spend far more time talking about the things that happened or just happened or will happen than you do actually experiencing them.  I'm shocked it's been accepted (and well accepted at that) because the bulk of the game is simply experiencing the world.  Talking to these weird alien races, learning about the rules of the galaxy and filling in the mythology and future science, is MOST of the game.  Humanity is a new comer to the galactic scene - the whole race is the fish-out-of-water character and part of the experience is helping them find their feet culturally and socially.  Yes, you shoot evil robots in the face, but you'll probably spend twice as much time talking and exploring as you ever will firing a gun.  ...Seriously, how do you pitch this game to distributors of modern titles?  It must have been a nightmare.We can talk about combat very briefly, because it's the least satisfying aspect.  It's fine; it's not broken or anything like that.  But it is bulky and starting to feel its age.  Basic third person, over the shoulder shooting and skill throwing; solid but not groundbreaking.  They tried to make use of that automatic shift into cover gimmick... you know, where you press the character against a surface and they use it as cover right away?  ...why doesn't that ever work?  It sounds like a good idea, but it's always so awkward.  Anyway, most fights are - find cover and shoot until their shields go away.  The enemy AI is simplistic and outdated and will either sit in one spot until they die or rush right at you until they die.  It's not overly dynamic but it is fun enough to keep you engaged.  You do spend a considerable amount of time in a vehicle (the Mako) and you can argue whether these are the best or worst parts of the game; they felt considerably more natural and less forced on me than, say, the vehicle levels in any Gears of War game, so it didn't bother me so much.  Again, blocky and imperfect but not broken.No, what keeps the game alive (and what BioWare handled so very cleverly) are the characters.  They are, by far, the most honest, most interesting and most dynamic portion of the game.  The plot is great, a very classic, three act, hero-against-the-galaxy, take-down-the-Bad guy journey with a couple of surprising twists and reveals.  But it's linear (as all stories are, and to expect otherwise is just silly); it's the CHARACTERS that are dynamic.  They plot is always the same; you're gonna go to the same places and have the same showdown with the same villain each time.  But how you treat your team, and the other people you meet, is what gives each play through its own special feel.  The characters' opinions of you, even the general galactic opinion, changes based on how you respond to them, how you treat them, what choices you make, who you kill and who you spare, and the game is the most satisfying when you've taken the time to explore everyone's needs and listen to everyone's tale.  The whole third act can have a completely different feel to it based on who loves you, who hates you, who's alive and who (if anyone) you've seduced.And it all starts with your playable character, the one you create from the start.  You've got the option to choose some backstory, some basic history that will influence how people treat you and create a couple of unique quests each time around.  You've got six potential classes to build your hero from that are a bit of a spin on the old \"Warrior, Mage, Rogue\" choice; here called \"Soldier, Biotic, Technician\"... or something like that.  But the flavor is the same, Soldiers use weapons and armor, Biotics use Sci-Fi magic, Technicians use... well, more Sci-Fi magic, but can also hack systems and open locks.  There's also combo classes, that take aspects of two of each to form something unique.  Each choice, while effecting combat, also effects your impact on the world.  It's an INCREDIBLY detailed universe and whether you're a hardened soldier or a gifted biotic can affect how certain characters will address you or relate to you.What I like most about the game (and what many people, I think, will hate) is the slow and even pace that it has the guts to stick to.  Games are moving faster and faster and faster and Mass Effect had the guts to slow back down and takes the time to tell its story.  Conversations move slowly, patiently, letting you absorb the tons and tons of backstory you need to piece out this weirdo future world.  Hell, the game stops MID-FIGHT from time to time to let you try and talk things out!  There's also a TON of text to read and, while you can completely understand the story without bothering with a lick of it, taking the time to comb through the codex and read each planet's description really fills out the game world and gives a much more fulfilling experience.  The writers took a chance here and really asked the question that's at the heart of all Science Fiction; \"What would happen if...\"  What would happen if the human race was suddenly and unexpectedly given the keys to interstellar travel and had contact with alien races that may or may not think that was a good thing?  What if this \"Mass Effect\" technology really existed?  Beyond letting the player levitate enemies, how would such technology affect the world as a whole?  It's a brave choice to make, and I'm willing to bet there's enough story and backstory scattered about to fill a medium sized novel.  And, much like Dragon Age: Origins, you get the best experience when you take the time to experience the best of it - hear meaning nearly all of it.I do think the story is solid enough and the gun-fights engaging enough that most players can find fun here, even if they skip all the reading and most of the conversations.  But those who appreciate a slow moving, well thought out story set in a deeply fleshed out world will get the most bang for their space-buck.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2012"}

Players can earn up to 20 weapons (including online and offline) with up to four levels of upgrades for most weapons, plus new high-tech gadgets to help them through their journey.After word spreads of Ratchet and Clank's recent conquest inRatchet & Clank: Going Commando, Clank finds himself recognized as an interstellar robot of mystery and intrigue after starring in his own television series, Secret Agent Clank. While Ratchet is dismayed by his new sidekick status, the feelings are put aside when the twosome is called together by the Galactic President to bring peace to the universe. They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise. This includes Helga, the robotic seductress; Big Al, a techno-geek with the ability to encrypt technology systems; and Skidd McMarxx, a former hoverboarding champ and pro slacker turned spy. Together with the Q-Force, Ratchet and Clank set off on another hilarious interstellar romp to uncover the schemes of the sinister Dr. Nefarious and keep the galaxy safe for organic life.The Starship Phoenix, headquarters for the Q-Force, is the flagship in the fight against Dr. Nefarious and serves as a key information hub.

Rhodes","summary":"Some of the Best Ratchet and Clank has to Offer","reviewText":"Ratchet and Clank is a series that has always been progressing and getting better with each installment.  Up Your Arsenal is the third in the series and long considered the best of the PS2 games out there.  With good reason, it's absolutely amazing to play.  The adventure and all the content is well worth any asking price.  The game is huge in just about every way.  It's hard to say if it really outdoes Going Commando, but it would only miss the mark by mere milometers.Up Your Arsenal sees Ratchet and Clank relaxing when they see on the news that Ratchet's home planet of Veldin is under attack by a mysterious race called the Tyranoids.  It's up to Ratchet to save the planet.  But he soon discovers that a robot by the name of Dr. Nefarious is behind all of this turmoil and he's out to turn the entire galaxy into robots.  There is only one person who has tangled with Dr. Nefarious before.  Captain Qwark, and you'll have to work with him to rescue the galaxy... if you can find him.From a story standpoint Up Your Arsenal is a lot more straightforward than Going Commando, which opted for a few more susprises in its story than this one does.  However, Dr. Nefarious is by far the most expressive villain Ratchet and Clank have ever faced.  One issue with the first game in particular is that the villain, Drek, doesn't feel like he's really there or doing anything.  This was rectified somewhat in the second one, although the main antagonists keeps himself hidden until the end.  But with Up Your Arsenal, Dr. Nefarious is there throughout.  Often stringing you along, taunting you and just being present.  You get the sense that Nefarious is actually doing something.  This has fewer surprises than uncovering the mystery of Going Commando's Protopet, but at least Nefarious is entertaining throughout.  Up Your Arsenal is by far the funniest of the Ratchet and Clank games.  Introducing you to some interesting characters and clever satire along the way.Gameplay wise it's about what you'd expect from Ratchet and Clank.  You'll have tons of weapons, but unlike before they now increase up to five levels instead of just two.  You'll buy weapons and each time they level they gain new abilities.  When they finally reach level five they upgrade and change into a different weapon.  If you've got save data from Going Commando then you'll be able to get a hold of some of the previous weapons from Megacorp for free (provided you acquired them in Going Commando).  And some of new weapons are actually quite nice.  There are some familiar weapons such as the Hurricane which is really just a variation of Going Commando's Lancer (which was, in turn, a variation of the first game's blaster).  There are some new weapons, the most amusing of which is the Rift Launcher which launches a black hole and sucks enemies in.  Or the Infector which causes enemies to turn on one another.  It's good stuff and they all upgrade and turn into different weapons later.Aside from that it's pretty much the familiar Ratchet and Clank.  There's a good share of running and gunning, platforming and puzzles to solve on your way to Dr. Nefarious.  It is not as hard as Going Commando but will still serve as a decent challenge.  It's not an easy game by any means.  Just like before your Nanotech will increase as you progress through the game giving you more chances to be hit.  Likewise, you can also upgrade your armor.  A few things also return such as the battle arena where you can compete for prizes.There are actually some new things to behold in Up Your Arsenal as well.  The first major thing you'll note is that there is actually a hub in this game.  Between stretches on various planets, Ratchet and Clank can always return to the Starship Phoenix and restock their weapons, buy new armor, test out weapons in the VR Training (and earn more bolts in the process) as well as go through an obstacle course in training as well.  Likewise, throughout the game you'll collect Vid-Comics where you can play as Captain Qwark in his previous missions.  It's a mini-game that plays like an old school shooter/platformer and it's quite nice, however shortlived it is.Some things have also changed.  Space combat has been axed in favor of various missions.  From time to time you'll arrive on planets where you'll have a series of missions to complete.  Some that require you to get something offline, or drive across the terrain on a planet to take out certain enemies.  Others are as simple as having you defend troops.  No matter your style of play, Ratchet and Clank Up Your Arsenal offers something for players of all breeds.  There's even an option go play the game entirely in first person should you choose to do so.All that aside, there's no shortage of content in Ratchet and Clank Up Your Arsenal.  And it helps that the campaign clocks in at a decent 15 to 20 hours as well.  It's a good, long lasting experience and also has a couple of side areas and a lot of good in-universe references for those who played the previous two games.  It's without a doubt a love letter to fans of the series.  There isn't much that keeps it down.  If there were it would be that some of the challenge can be unbalanced.  You'll go through an area that is pretty simple to get through only to find the next area to be too densely populated with enemies that'll kill you easily only because you were unable to get the next armor upgrade.  This doesn't happen too often, and you'll never feel like it's impossible.  But you'll more than likely just start memorizing where enemies will appear more so than anything to help you get by.  There's nothing really \"unfair\" about any death you may suffer, and the weapons are much more balanced than in Going Commando that you won't find yourself constantly running low once you get near the end game.Production values have always been very high in Ratchet and Clank.  The games themselves are gorgeous.  That being said, they were also a little ahead of their time graphically.  Up Your Arsenal doesn't really look that much better than the previous two games.  That's not a bad thing by any stretch as it still looks amazing.  There are more details in some of the environments.  The only thing that might happen from time to time is a slight dip in frame rate whenever there's too much chaos on screen.  The voice acting, however, has been getting progressively better as the series goes along.  There aren't quite as many awkward pauses or shifts as there used to be.  The writing and jokes are also among the best.  The best part of the voice acting ensemble by far is Dr. Nefarious.  He not only has the best lines, but provides the most comedy in the game.  By far he is the best villain that has ever been present in Ratchet and Clank.  The soundtrack itself is also pretty amazing, hosting some catchy tunes and a few epic moments.It's hard to say whether Up Your Arsenal is the best Ratchet and Clank game or not.  It has gone so far to throw everything it can into this game.  Dr. Nefarious is by far the best villain, but it's hard to say if the adventure is as enticing as that of Going Commando.  And this is mostly because Going Commando seemed to have a more interesting story despite Up Your Arsenal having better characters.  Either way, Up Your Arsenal is a great game that shouldn't be missed by any Ratchet and Clank fan, and shouldn't be missed by anyone who likes action platformers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2012"}

Your muscle car is well equipped with machine guns - the question is if you can survive the race, not win it! I enjoy the destructability of the world, as well as the rewind button.I have to say first that every time I go to play this game I laugh my fool head off for the first ten minutes or so. I play a lot of video games (as you might imagine) and many of them have a driving aspect. A key skill I've honed over time is how to drive quickly, instinctively, while avoiding crashes. It is REALLY hard for me to switch to this game where you're often trying to ram head-on into your opponent. I will be racing down the road and literally keep missing the cars I'm trying to hit, because my hands automatically dodge left and right!Once you get the hang of the smashing, the game is a lot of fun. It's really easy, too. I never have to look at the manual - it's just a matter of grabbing a car, choosing a weapons configuration, hopping into a map and smashing away. It's a great stress relief. You have arcade mode which are one-off maps as well as career mode to build up your skills and vehicles over time. They have a lot of vehicle choices, color choices, and interesting maps. There's a lot to enjoy here if you like smashing things with cars.They did a good job with the environment. You can smash into other cars of course, but you can also run down cafe tables, take down light poles and telephone poles, even smash your way through buildings. The whole world disintegrates around you. Blast into a full gasoline tanker truck and watch it go up in a huge fireball.The rewind feature builds up over time and lets you \"backtrack\" after a wrong turn or a head-on collision. It's great fun and helps you extend your time, undoing a mistake.There are multiplayer modes too, where you can play with people either locally on your system or online with XBox Live.Yes, other racing games might have more \"perfect\" car models and racing response, but that's not really what Full Auto is about. Full Auto is a casual, smash-em-up game that lets you play for a few minutes then go on with something else.

I didn't know any of the back story other than that Snake is a bad MOFO. I knew it was very stealthy and would have lengthy cut scenes to flesh out stories and connect the action sequences together.That being said, this game is fantastic.Don't go into this game expecting little story and being able to just run and gun for 10 straight hours. Instead, think of this more of an \"Interactive Action Movie Game, instead of a \"shooter\" or even \"action\" game. If you go into it with that on your brain, I think the chances are high that you will LOVE Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots.The cutscenes are long, but are done perfectly. Great graphics and voice acting add to the atmosphere and the flashbacks and everything else makes the longer scenes worth it. PLUS, after my heart is racing as I sneak through the levels, killing guys and trying to not get killed, I need a brief break to let me calm down and relax.This game will have your heart racing.So give it a try.

You finally confront and defeat a quavering Jedi.  Freaking awesome.  That all lasts about 4 minutes.  Then the real game begins, and the most enjoyable part of it, which you've just experienced, gets left far behind.  Don't get me wrong, this game has enjoyable aspects, most significantly the simple experience of being able to act out as a super-powerful Jedi while rousing Star Wars themes play in the background.  For that alone, many people will want to give this a look.  Just don't get your hopes up that it is some amazing game.There are games that pull you into the story, in which you have to use your mind as well as your hands to get through the game, where the choices you make along the way greatly effect the game play and, even better, the story and outcome.  This is NOT one of those games.This game attempts to be the kind that relies on memorizing combos, and a whole lot of hand-eye coordination, some jumping around on various platforms, and confronting \"bosses\", etc.  The game that comes to mind in comparison is Ninja Gaiden, or God of War.  I say \"attempts\" because of the pretty ridiculous mishmash of camera and targeting problems, imbalanced powers, awful boss battles, and repetitive levels/game play which add up to an experience that is only briefly redeemed by the cool factor of charging around familiar Star Wars settings.The game is highly conventional, even \"old school.\"  The game play relies on learning \"combos\", jumping around on various platforms, and manipulating various environmental elements to solve what are supposed to be puzzles or complete various objectives like (\"Destroy 5 Tie Fighters On This Level\").  You don't participate in the story, you watch it unfold, until the action kicks in, and then you get to run around smashing crap up with your wacky load of force powers.Your main concern will be not falling to your death.  It is ridiculously easy to fall off the various catwalks, platforms, and even many normal walkways--simple things like executing lightsaber moves that cause the character to lunge forward can lead you right off the edge of a platform.  Your character has an incredibly powerful jump-- he can jump high and far-- but that usually leads to the impossibility of judging the distances properly, and he lands very sloppily, so you just slip off whatever you were trying to land on and fall to your death!  On many levels, you spend a ton of time running around wiping out the zillions of enemies, then have to backtrack to try to jump to reach a floating sphere in order to acquire your Jedi points---and then you slip and fall to your death, requiring you to restart the entire level, and kill all those same enemies again, and then most likely slip to your death another time!  I ended up playing the game through on \"Apprentice\" mode, simply because I found the incidents of getting killed by falling to be more than enough of a challenge, and source of numerous reloads.There is some leveling up, but it mostly consists of unlocking various combos.  Nothing intellectually or strategically challenging, just arbitrary based on your playing preferences.The learning of combos and the combining/proper use of various force powers I found a bit frustrating.  Maybe someone out there likes \"combos\": pressing a sequence of buttons in order to skillfully execute a powerful move.  I'm not one of those people.  To me, it is simply a waste of brain power to memorize these stupid combos.Even worse is the necessity of hitting certain buttons to execute \"finishing moves\" at the end of a boss fight.  You beat the boss down to zero health, then the game forces you to press a sequence of buttons to finish him off in a supposedly cool cinematic, and if you don't, he returns to partial health.  This is utterly annoying and makes no sense.  There's no real world corollary to a \"finishing move\".  What aspect of life does it represent?  Stupid.Then there's the targeting and camera chaos.  You can throw zillions of objects and enemies around, but locking on and targeting them is a mess.  Some stormtrooper will be blasting you with a cannon from a far platform, and you'll try to zap him with lightning or a force push, but there are so many rocks, power cells, R2 units, and storage boxes littering the landscape that the targeting system will blast everything but the guy you are trying to actually hit!  And good luck trying to use your powers to pick up and throw an object at the guy--the lock on/pick up/aim/throw sequence is so cumbersome and sloppy, and moving objects with the force is so painfully slow --he'll waste you before you get your shot lined up.The graphics are, as they should be in a \"Next Gen\" game, very good.  Seeing the various levels, planets, creatures, and environments is probably what makes this game worth playing.  It is fun to just live in the Star Wars world, especially as most of the environments are made to seem enormous.  But that doesn't mean too many extra points in my book, like I said, the graphics should be amazing, it's the 360.I disregarded all the negative reviews when I purchased this, thinking, as a big Star Wars fan, that I would appreciate it anyway.  I was wrong.  Then I thought, maybe I'm just the wrong kind of gamer, maybe someone who appreciates \"combo\" and \"platforming\" games, more straight ahead action games, would like this, and I should soldier on (maybe if you are that kind of gamer you would give this 3 stars instead of two).  After some time, I realized that the flaws were in the game itself- that the game play was unbalanced, the camera and targeting were deeply flawed, the boss fights were stupid and pointless, and that the entire premise of the game was just flimsy.  I wish I would have taken those negative reviews more seriously!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2009"}

This is no Batman: Arkham City.  Deadpool is an insane, off the wall character from the Marvel universe and that translates directly into this game.

And the dialogue is a lot of things: funny, crass, immature, sexist, inappropriate and sometimes annoying.  I mean, there were some times in which Deadpool's comment made me actually laugh out loud.  There were other times that I just wanted him to shut up and kill things.  And trust me, he does NOT shut up.  His mouth and his \"voices\" are constantly running.  Constantly.  Running.

Deadpool, insanely annoying or not, is still very much a badass.  The stylish way in which he is able to dispatch enemies is very cool.  He has a decent arsenal at his disposal (once everything is unlocked, of course) which can be upgraded throughout the game.  Chapters are relatively lengthy and typically present a few \"sub-bosses\" throughout.  This helps to break up the monotony of hacking and slashing your way through hundreds foot soldiers.  There are a few appearances of other Marvel characters either as bosses, friendly AI or storyline plants.  Not only is Deadpool a skilled killer, but he's also a very talented acrobat.  He has movement abilities similar to that of Ryu (Ninja Gaiden).The bottom line is that this game can certainly entertain both Deadpool fans as well as those who have never heard of him.  It's good fun that will provide you with a few laughs along the way.  And, if you're like me, a few moments where you'll yell at your TV for Deadpool to kindly shut up.The foul language and the crass statements probably make this game inappropriate for kids.  It's rated Mature for a reason.  So you might want to keep that in mind if you're looking for a birthday gift for your 8 year old.  This is an adult game that is best enjoyed with an adult beverage.  Unless you're a huge Deadpool fan, I would recommend picking this game up when it reaches a price point around $40.00.PROS- Better than average graphics- Smooth control scheme perfect for killing- Nice upgrade system- Very entertaining from both a gaming and a comical standpoint- Maiming droves of foot soldiers never seems to get oldCONS- Deadpool and the voices in his head provide WAY too much commentary.  While a lot of it is funny, there is simply too much of it.Overall: 4/5-","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2013"}

While it retains the basic shape of the Dualshock 3, Sony has a lot of improvements to their flagship controller. Right off the bat, you notice the touch screen in the center of the screen, which has been used in games such as Killzone to control your drone or as an option to navigate the map in Watch_Dogs. Sony has reinvented its joysticks, which allow more precise movements compared to the dome-shaped sticks of the DS3. The triggers feel almost custom made because of the added ridges and arc, and most shooters have taken advantage of this by making L2/R2 the primary aim/shoot layout compared to the L1/R1 of previous generations. Other minor improvements such as more space between the sticks make the controller more comfortable after long game sessions. The longer handles make the controller feel less cramped and allow you to wrap your fingers around them. The Dualshock 4 has become my favorite, even more so than the amazing Xbox 360 controller.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2014"}

The gameplay is tighter and it is harder to run. The graphics are top notch, especially when there is weather involved. The models are lifelike though refs are still missing and there is no chain gang. The sideline players don't really move or show emotion either. These are little things but make a difference when looking at the game as a whole. The graphics definitely make you feel you are playing a next gen game.However, I do not like the running game whatsoever, it is very hard to run as once you make a move for a hole to bust through there are three defenders there to tackle you. If you try to go around someone being blocked, they suddenly come free and tackle you. You need a strong offensive line in this game otherwise your running game will be non-existant. Even the AI of the computer when running isn't that impressive - no big games from any runners, including LT.The whole madden iq system actually backfires - it is easy  to pass the tests (my iq was at 665) but then you play the first game and the game is a lot harder than the madden test - after my first game my iq dropped to 504 so obviously i wasn't really a 665. The game constantly adapts to you which is fun but at the same time I have played 20 games now and no matter who you face they play at your skill level, meaning you don't blow teams out - my biggest win has been by 4.Fun game yes, gameplay, while much improved, leaves a lot to be desired. No progression in franchise mode makes pre-season and training activities a moot point. I put Favre on the Jets (he is on the legends roster and can be moved to free agency or you can download the roster update). He is rated 99 and is 25 years old so I can have him for like 15 years lol. I might keep him though because if I draft a QB there is no way for him to get better. If they patch this it would be good but for those who can't go online to play it is not fair.I myself have not had freezing problems but friends of mine have. I can't comment on them since I have not experienced one - I have a brand new elite xbox which might help, I don't know. I would get this game again if I could unless there was another choice out there, which there isn't. Madden suffices to give me some football fun but leaves a decent amount to be desired.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2008"}

If you get close enough to enemies, you can meleethem with two elbows or do a stealth kill.  The more experience you gain, the less energyyour powers consume.  Higher level players feast upon the weak, because they can run around,nearly invisible, and melee others; they don't even need a gun.  I think the balance of powershifts when you reach a ranking level of approx. 35.  I've got a ways to go, but the multiplayer experiencecan become passable when you figure things out, and your reflexes are honed.  It's a rush killing othersafter dying so many times.  If you're an average player, it still takes a long time to level up.Use your weapon upgrades wisely, because they're few and far between.  I'm so incredibly angry at the campaign glitch,that speaking about the single player experience is a mute point.  If you want a different, challengingmultiplayer experience, get Crysis 2.  Don't dare get the DLC maps, because no one else does,and they're not played in the regular rotation.  Upon further playing, you can pass the glitch level byreplaying the entire chapter.  It seems like a pain at first, but it's worth your while if you can passthe 'regroup at vehicles' glitch.  When I replayed the level, the boss fight seemed more difficult, which was a good sign.I've calmed down a little, and can explain the campaign.  The initial levels are pretty boring, because youhave to sneek by the enemy.  When the alien army is re-introduced, the gameplay gets more fun.

With great anticipation, I like many other gamers awaited the release of the new game Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy from the creative minds at Raven Software and Lucasarts. The game is a 3D shooter that is set ten years after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; when the New Republic is being menaced by the evil remnant of the Empire that seeks to reclaim their former status as rulers of the galaxy, and a mysterious cult of Sith warriors. Players are able to select their characters sex, species, and clothing as you start as a Jedi apprentice. Before long, players find themselves working with Kyle Kattarn (The players character from previous chapters), as the duo embark on a series of missions designed to uncover the mystery behind the Sith cult and the threat it poses to the Jedi and New Republic. Players also get to embark on a number of solo missions and they game allows players to select from a variety of missions in addition to the core missions of the game.The artwork of the game is outstanding as the look of everything from ships to bars is authentic to the Star wars setting. Seeing the passenger ships come and go as well as listening in on conversations of characters in the game was amazing. On more than one occasion, I became totally immersed in the story and settings and was in awe of the detail and complexity of the game. I especially enjoyed the Hoth levels, as it was great to explore the Rebel base from &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and ride a Tauntaun. Other locations of note included Coruscant, Yavin 4, and Tattooine in addition to a host of new locations.The dazzling away of weapons available is good but nothing compares to using the lightsaber and force powers that allow players to perform a wide variety of functions ranging from enhanced leaps, speed, pushing, pulling, healing, and some offensive moves such as force lightening and choke. When using the lightsaber, the view switches from first to third person and allows players a wide range of arch in which to attack and defend. My favorite tactic is to use the force speed during attacks to move circles around foes as I dispatch them. The game offers some fantastic challenges, as players have to use their minds rather than rely solely on combat to complete the game. The sound effects are simply the best I have heard in a game in a long time and the ever-present Star Wars music perfectly sets the tone for the adventure. Players will take delight in seeing some familiar faces in the game as Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca at various stages of the game is a nice touch.I do not want to spoil the game so I will refrain from mentioning more of the settings and weapons that players have in store for them but suffice it to say, they will not be disappointed. Jedi Academy is by far the best game in recent memory and easily the best Star Wars game ever created. The Multiplay factor of the game is outstanding as there are several styles of online play that would warm the heart of even the darkest Sith Lord. My favorite is the siege mode where players form teams and select ability classes to complete missions. If I had any flaws with the game I would say that having to reset my controls for certain Force Powers and graphics every time I loaded was a pain and that some weapons would fire now and then on there own. This is a minor compliant for what is destined to be a gaming classic and a very worthy follow up to the fantastic Jedi Knight series.Game Title Rating Concept Fantastic and Gripping 100Gameplay A perfect mix of action and strategy. 100Graphics Outstanding and full of detail.

In this game, Batman is just starting out as a crime fighter.  He is considered to be a myth by police and criminals.  He is also yet to face any criminals such as Penguin and Joker.  The main two villains in this game are Black Mask and the Joker.  However, there are many twists that I don't feel like giving away in a simple review.  Needless to say, being there for the very first time Batman and Joker lay eyes on each other is a special moment for any comic book fan.In this game, there is a bounty on Batman's head by Black Mask.  This brings out a whole slew of assassins from Killer Croc to Deathstroke.  As if being careful not to run into any assassins wasn't stressful enough on the Dark Knight, he also has to fight the police in this game as he is seen as a criminal vigilante.The gameplay and graphics almost mirror the next to flawless system from Arkham City.  The map is much larger in this game and you have two or three new gadgets...but other than that it's the same game.  For some fans of the series that can be seen as a disappointment.  However, if you beat Arkham City like I did, you will find that there is nothing wrong with the graphics or how you play the game so why fix something that isn't broken?  The combat system is easy enough for anyone to pick up on.  Press Y/Triangle when there are streaks above someone's head and you'll never get hit.  Use stealth mode and sneak attack enemies.  That's all you need to know to succeed in Batman games.Overall, this game provides temporary satisfaction but will leave you wanting more.  My only hope is that this series continues to grow and produce excellent titles.  There is still a lot of work for this series to be perfect....but nothing I can put my finger on.  These games get old, repetitive and boring very quickly.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

This led to people thinking it was a bad system, and even as far as to say it didn't belong in the class of the XBOX and PS2.  Well, people mis-judged, as this tiny little machine out-does in almost every category the PS2, and in some aspects, the XBOX.1. The system: The GC is easily better than the DC or the PS2 for these 3 simple reasons.  1) It's small, compact, and yet twice as powerful as either of the other 2.  This little cube has enough graphics power to dish out beautiful, splashing water, sharp fighting details, sweat dripping from athletes faces, and fiery eruptions that will make u put your hands over your eyes.  This thing can bring a convincing world to your screen, and is highly reccomended for anyone buying a game system for kids younger than 8, and even those of 8-14.  \"Why?\" is this not reccomended for adults.  It's not that it isn't a good system, or that it doesn't have good games.1) The games are aimed at kids, not adults.  Ok, sure, any Mario game or Donkey Kong adventure can entertain an adult for a few hours.  But it just looses interest, as the computer AI isn't very good, the riddles aren't very challenging, and the skill required to beat them isn't going to make you work very hard.  Most adults also don't like the controller (which I'll get to more detail in a minute), which is quite small and cramped in many areas for adults, and just looks a bit...odd for those hardcore HALO, GTA, or even all those great sports titles.  This system is aimed at kids.2) Capabilties: This system is great for setting up in the car for a long trip accross the country, or even state to state, but it doesn't do much else but play those kid games.  The memory units are extremely small compared to the massive XBOX hard disk and PS2 Memory Card, so you'll often find yourself buying more memory units then games.  That's NO fun!  This system also has no way to play DVD's, play music, and can't be cleaned or fixed when the drive brakes (the CD drive can't contain CD cleaners, and can't be replaced with a regular DVD tray like the PS2 and XBOX).  The size of CD's can also be a problem, as many adults can't even fit their finger through the little circle in the middle, or could loose them quite easily.  It hasn't been the case for me, but I have rather small hands (still only 16).2. Games: This system has a ton of great games...aimed at kids.  If your an adult looking for a little gore, smart, fast computer AI, or even the casual sports title to build a franchise through, the GC is NOT FOR U!!!  The major games are for the most part the Mario's, Zeldas, Donkey Kong's, Star Foxx, etc...all cartoons.  You won't find the HALO's, GTA's, SOCOM: Navy Seals, or even games like Splinter Cell (nor the controller to use them).  If u want ALL of your games to be Mario-like (nothing wrong with that), this system is ok.  But for the more hard-core gamer like me, an XBOX, or even a PS2, would be a better choice.3) Controller: For games like Pikmin, perfect.  Huge buttons, small joy sticks, springy trigger buttons.  It's perfect!  But for sport's games like those that I love, HALO, Splinter Cell, games like that, the controller is awful.  It just doesn't work.  Notice that SEGA pulled all of their 2k sports titles as no one with a CUBE bought them.  If u look at the top 10 selling GC titles, you won't find a shooter (except maybe Metroid Prime by Nintendo).  This system, or controller, just doesn't work for these games.  On the other hand; for games like Mario, Melee, Zelda, Pikmin, Animal Crossing, etc...it's the best EVER MADE!!!  And if you've got lots of money to spend, and don't mind owning a system just for one type of game, then the GC will do just fine.  But for someone with a low budget and wanting a little bit of Sports, RPG, some Shooters, Stealth, and even Mario-like games (Blinx, Crash Bandicoot), the XBOX was for me (also a DVD play and CD player, GC doesn't support).4) Online Plan: None!  It has a 56K adapter and works on broadband, but nothing like XBOX Live or even the PS2's online network.  No headset, no stat tracking, no buddy list, and not a very big list of games.  No real plan, it just seems to be there.  If u want to be left behind without the online gameplay of the future, I guess the GC will do fine.  But I am a gamer who loves playing other games like me, keeping stat track, trash talking, and enjoying good competition besides my little sister or next door neighbor.  The GC didn't suppport that!  \"Why?\"  I don't know.Overall, the GC is great for kids, and good for the casual gamer.  But for someone who is A) Low on money and would like a DVD player too!, B) Wants a controller and system that works with shooters and Sports, and C) Want's a few M titles in his collection, the GC was NOT for me.  This system will satisfy those looking for a system for kids, a second system, or even a first if they have a great PC.  But I needed more, and the GC didn't have it!Still a great system with great games, and is very reliable, I'd reccomend the system to anyone who can live with the above problems!Thx!Oh, and as for it being platinum, it's no different from Indigo or Jet Black except it's color, and that it's only going to be available for a few months.  Do u like Platinum?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2002"}

I played it exclusively since it came out, finding COD to be rather dull and old by comparison.  DICE has pulled of an impressive technological feat with this game.  I think I'm a 16th level Colonel at this point.I bought two copies of this game at 60 dollars each (we have 2 xboxes).  EA has ruined this game.  Here's why.1) Rent a Servers - about the only games you can realistically find now are on privately rented servers.  That wouldn't be so bad if the customization wasn't so ridiculous.  But every server is different and it's tedious to find one with normal rules.  Ridiculous ticket counts and \"rules\" imposed by 12 year old who will not hesitate to kick you if you do too well in their game, or use one of their \"banned\" XYZ guns or weapons.  When I bought this game, EA and Dice supplied the servers, ass they did for free with BFBC2.2) Premium service.  I can afford premium.  But I won't buy it.  I already paid 60 dollars for this game--\"premium\" players get priority queue access and other little perks.  And that's fine, but they shouldn't get preferential treatment in game.  I will buy the map packs separately, and yes I will pay more, but I refuse to view this as a \"pay for play\" service.  To each his own.3) Lack of support.  You STILL cannot enter a game with your squad in tact, like you could in BFBC2.  It's not so bad if you end up on the same team, but often as not you are on opposite teams.  We buy this game to play with our friends.  Why is this so hard to fix?  It's hard because they don't make money fixing things--they make money ripping off players with \"Premium\" services.What a joke.  But this is EA, so what do you expect?I know Activision is guilty of some of this especially with COD, but as a publisher, EA is clearly the worst.  That leaves Take Two and Valve and a hand full of others that show anything other than contempt for the game player.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00007B77T","description":"We could talk about theSerious Sambackstory, but that would be missing the point, namely to commit carnage on a galactic scale. The smooth engine, multiplayer options, and fast pace make this game a solid choice for fans of first-person shooters.The interface uses the tried-and-true Xbox formula for shooters: the left thumbstick controls movement and the right thumbstick controls the angle of view. The extensive arsenal is something special though, with each weapon possessing a different efficiency so you have to find the perfect weapon quickly for each situation. For instance, the shotgun is a great weapon for up-close fighting among a crowd of enemies, but it's horrible at a distance or when you're stuck in the middle of a melee. The enemy list is also quite extensive. You will be fired upon, stepped on, stabbed, slashed, and electrocuted. Enemies will appear by land, air, and water.What makes this game stand out and keep you interested, though, is its irreverent, offbeat sense of humor. Serious Sam makes outlandish comments throughout the game, rides cosmic surfboards between scenes, saves progress at Dr. Who-like telephone booths, and pays homage to the Indiana Jones theme song. And you can change the blood splatters between red, green, and hippy (flowers and fruit). Our only major complaint is level design. Even when you believe you've cleared a room, enemies can pop out of midair and injure you. By not allowing you to seal yourself off from the onrushing masses in appropriate spaces, a major strategic element has been missed.--Eric Franklin","reviewerName":"Walter Reade","summary":"Great game!","reviewText":"Oh my! This game is a SUPERB value! It is a fun and rather light-hearted first person shooter that has gorgeous graphics in an Egyptian-type setting and a great use of music and sound effects.While the game doesn't have a particularly deep plot, there is enough variety to keep your interest. Some of the many enemies you will encounter during the game are the Marsh-Hopper from Rigil Kentaurus, Beheaded Rocketeer, Beheaded Firecracker, Beheaded Bomber (do you see a trend here?), Male Gnaar, Female Gnaar (with no obviously different features), Zorg Mercenary from Beelmez IV, Zoer Commander from Beelmez IV, Reeban Electro-Fish, Beheaded Kamikaze (my personal favorite bad-guy), Scythian Witch-Harpy, Kleer Skeleton, Bio-Mechanoid, Cucurbito the Pumpkin, Zumb'ul from Planet Raw-ad-nyk, Juvenile Anachnoid, Sirian Werebull, Adult Anachnoid, Aludran Reptiloid, Fiendian Reptiloid Demon, Lava Golem, and Aludran Reptiloid Highlander. As you can see, there is quite an arrangement of monsters to blast.And you get to choose between any of many weapons, such as a military knife, Chainsaw, Schofield .45, 12-Guage Shotgun, Double-Barrel Shotgun, XM214-A Minigun, M1-A2 Thompson Submachine Gun, XPML21 Rocket Launcher, MKIII Grenade Launcher, RAPTOR 16mm Sniper, XOP Flamethrower, XL2 Lasergun, SBC Cannon, and the Serious Bomb.Along the way, there are the obligatory health, armor, life, treasure, and other pick-ups.I only have a few complaints about the game. First, the enemy AI is pretty weak, so you often have two or more of same monsters coming at you in the exact same manner. Second, the cut scenes are rather short and superficial. Lastly, because monsters come from \"another dimension,\" you often find yourself attacked from behind without warning. This can be frustrating at times, especially since there is no direction-of-attack indicator.But these are minor issues. Although I rated Serious Sam a 4, it is only because it is not as deep as Halo (against which all first person shooters on Xbox should be judged). But the game is fun, and a definite title to get.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2002"}

Players will find familiar names like Glass Joe, King Hippo and trainer Doc Louis. These boxers come to life again in cell-shaded 3-D, complete with hilarious fighting animations and backstories that capture all the fun and flair of the originalPunch-Out!!games.The Wii's Motion SensitivityThe motion-sensitive controls of the Wii console mean that when players throw punches, Little Mac throws punches as well. Additionally, you can control hooks and jabs by combining motion control with control-stick movement. The motion-sensing Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers turn real-life swings into on-screen punches, so anyone can play. The game can also be played with classic NES-style controls by turning the Wii Remote sideways.CharactersPunch-Out!!features a total of 13 opponents for Little Mac to step into the ring with. 12 of which are returning from previous games in thePunch-Out!!series. Each have their own backstory and patterns of attacks to learn and learn to counter. Just a few of the characters you can expect to see are:Little MacSmall but extremely game, Little Mac is a young, up-and-coming fighter, who with the help of his trainer, ex-champion Doc Lewis, has set his sights on working his way through the ranks.Glass JoeA fearful French fighter due to his extremely weak chin, Glass Joe will crumple to the mat quickly with just a few well-placed shots, making him an easy mark and a good warm-up for the fighters to follow.King HippoKing Hippo is both huge and an immensely powerful fighter, but can be weakened with the right combinations to the head and body, giving you time to go for the knockout if you can survive his onslaught.Von KaiserAn old-timey fighter whose rumored childhood difficulties have left him eager to dish out punishment in the ring, Von Kaiser is a dangerous opponent, but one who will turn tail if you can find his weakness.Special AttacksPlayers can obtain special 'Star Punches,' which allow Little Mac to take more health from his rival in a single punch. Players can now use multiple stars in a single punch for an extra-powerful attack.Controller OptionsPunch-Out!!features multiple controller options. For players looking to take advantage of the Wii's motion control capabilities,Punch-Out!!uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers to simulate throwing punches. Use the Nunchuck to throw a left punch and the Wii Remote to throw a right punch. Fans of the NES version and core gamers will be excited to see Nintendo has also included the option to playPunch-Out!!using the classic layout from the original NES controller. Use the 1 and 2 buttons along with the cross pad to throw hooks and jabs or to dodge.","reviewerName":"Kristen E.

Morales","summary":"An Experience Never to be Forgotten","reviewText":"THE GOOD: Incredibly visionary, innovative and ambitious game design; soundtrack of the decade; breathtaking world; jaw dropping colossi enemies; simply unforgettable.THE BAD: Choppy framerate; sometimes unresponsive controls; sometimes crazy cameraDIFFICULTY: MediumThere's not much to explain when it comes to the details of SotC. You control a sword wielding boy who takes a girl (sister? girlfriend?) into a mysterious far-away land, and enters a castle of some sort to lay her down on a pedestal. He is told by a heavenly voice that there are 16 colossi living in that land and defeating them will bring about the power to bring back life (which he plans to use to save said girl). Now you, your horse and trusty sword and bow must seek out these mammoth creatures and bring them down.The game basically just has you travelling on horseback throughout this land searching the next colossi to fight. And defeating them will take more than just shooting off your bow and swiping your sword at them. Each enemy is their own puzzle, and figuring out exactly HOW to reach each weak spot will have you exploring their bodies as well as the environment in which you're fighting them. The godly voice gives you clues, some more vague than others but all mostly helpful, then you're on your own, 5 foot boy versus 10-story size colossi. Each of course becomes more difficult than the last.From the very first colossi you'll find yourself with your jaw dropped, and remember what it felt like when any medium first introduced you to something incredible you've just plain never seen before. You'll circle the enormous stone-like creatures, all the while being ear caressed by an orchestral soundtrack so epic and grandiose there hasn't been anything like it since Castlevania: Symphony of the Night for the PS1. A work of art that simply can't be explained in words but MUST be experienced. You'll once again remember why you play video games, and what you love most about them.This all of course isn't without its faults. Anyone who's played this development team's first innovative adventure, Ico, knows what a pain in the rear that game was to control at certain times. Unfortunately, that somewhat loose control scheme hasn't changed much. Many times you'll find yourself slipping off enemies or getting hit because the game's ambitious graphics lead the way while other things like controls and framerates can't keep up. It just doesn't feel as tight as it could be. Perhaps a game of this calibur would have been better suited for the new PS3 arriving soon?Anyway, once you've finally defeated all the colossi, you'll reach the ultimate final boss and the controls unfortunately pick this one battle to be the most annoying. At some points the graphics clipped so much that my character would suddenly disappear at one point and reappear at another point a little ways further. Also, the vague storyline may dissappoint some, especially those who prefer absolute closure. Remember that just like Ico, the time, place, and even language of the characters are kept mysterious, giving the player the option to use their own imaginations to fill in the gaps.BOTTOM LINE: An absolute must buy for anyone who owns a PS2. If you love adventure and fantasy tales, look no further than SotC, one of the most ambitious, and downright unforgettable entertainment experiences of your gaming life.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2006"}

As with all of them it is a third person rpg composed primarily hack, slash, and bespell.  Add a dash of sneak and run, and you have the entire spectrum of strategies available.  If anything, there is even less story content on the PS2 than there is on the PCs.  I didn't count them, but there are about thirty-five levels maybe the same number of monster types.Basically the plot consists of arriving in Baldur's gate, getting mugged and going after the malefactors.  On thing leads to another and soon you are haring all over the countryside killing everything in your sight until you come face-to-face with an old enemy of the town,  On titanic battle later you are looking at the credits.In retrospect, it is hard to believe that someone who spent list price for this game would be very happy about the game play.  Even at the 'on sale, close out' price I was a bit stunned to get through the game in less than 20 hours on the first shot.  And I'm not a particularly fast player.  The game is beautiful to look at, motion is fluid, and you have good control of the camera angle.  But all that artwork takes up most of the space on the DVD, and the game really screams for more of just about everything.Of course, you could always just keep playing the game over until you felt you had gotten your moneys worth.  Since game play is a bit monotonous, this is a viable option.  But no matter what you do, you will always wind up in the same places with the same experience points and some slight variation in spells (not much if you want to win.

Among other things, the Dunia Engine delivers realistic, interactive environments, special effects, real-time night-and-day cycles, and smart enemy AI.Expansive, Realistic EnvironmentFar Cry 2 is set in a fictional region of Africa where you are caught between two rival factions at war. The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah. Wild animals such as zebras, buffalo, gazelle are encountered during the game, with both players and enemies allowed to interact with them.Far Cry 2 features an incredible level of detail and realism, with a minimal in-game interface to detract from immersion. For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game. To fulfill your mission, you need to play the enemies against each other, using both strategy and skill.Huge Range of Weapons and VehiclesFar Cry 2 offers gamers a wide range of weapons, from a machete for hand-to-hand combat, to a sniper rifle that can stealthily pluck off enemies from afar.

They want a single player gameThis group really needs to reevaluate why the bought a game marketed as one of the first solely multiplayer games looking for a single player element. If I bought Tomb Raider and complained about the lack of team death match multiplayer, that isn't a fair assessment of the game's quality because it never set out to be what I'm looking for. In other words, you can't complain about the lack of a feature that was never promised, intended, or within the scope of the game.2. They are insatiableThese gamers are becoming the bane of gaming. Nothing, and I mean nothing, is ever good enough.  Both Battlefield and COD launch their titles riddled with problems and bugs. This game, as far as I can tell, runs almost flawless.

Set 150 years from now, the world has been ruined by war and ecological disaster with only a handful of survivors remaining.End Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"Pikminfan \"bobsworld3\"","summary":"Don't pass this one up!","reviewText":"Thanks to the positive reviews on Amazon and the good feeling I had about this game in general, I bought \"Enslaved\" on a whim.  Glad I did too, because it's a really great game.  What I don't understand though is how such a great game-which obviously had a lot of TLC put into it, slipped out completely under the radar.  The only reason I even heard about this game was because of a tiny review in a video game magazine.  That led me to Amazon to do more research.Despite the lack of hype, \"Enslaved\" is still a triple A game in every sense of the word. Judging by the final product, it is evident that a lot of time and effort went into crafting the game-from the well scripted story and fun game play dynamics, to the insanely beautiful graphics and the highly memorable characters\"Enslaved\" opens with an action packed bang and wastes no time drawing the player into an immersive story right off the bat .  We are quickly introduced to the game's rough-around-the-edges bad a** protagonist \"Monkey\" and his gorgeous traveling companion \"Trip\", and let me tell you-It would be an understatement to call these two the most memorable and charismatic characters to hit the video game scene in a while.  The symbiotic relationship between the two is very interesting and grows even more so as the game progresses.  For the first time in a long time, I actually found myself growing quite attached to a game's characters.  I was genuinely interested where the story would take them and saw the cinema scenes as a compelling telling of their story rather than time filler like in most games.As for how the game plays, \"Enslaved\" runs smoothly and controls fairly tightly for the most part.  There's still a little room for improvement though, but nothing major enough to really detract from the game (more on that later).  There is also enough variety to keep you interested, and Monkey's \"Cloud\" device is a welcome respite from taking out the game's numerous mech enemies.  You can also earn upgrades for weapons, health, shields and combat which adds to the experience-though these upgrades aren't as robust as perhaps they should be.The game's real standout feature however is its graphics.  The wow factor here is through the roof.  This has to be one of the most visually stunning games I have ever seen.  Often, I caught myself stopping for a moment just to admire the sheer beauty of the \"Enslaved\" universe.  The attention to detail in every single environment is nothing short of stunning.  I've played a lot of beautiful looking games in my time but this one is an absolute jaw dropper.As for my quips about \"Enslaved: Odyssey to the West\", they are minor.  As mentioned-I suppose the controls could be just a little bit tighter.  There were a few times scattered throughout the game where it seemed just a little off.  Also, the in-game camera frequently seems to have mind of its own when you are trying to look around.  These qualms are very minor though and neither of them really affect the overall positive experience of playing the game.  What did detract from the experience for me though was the level of \"hand holding\".  I'm all for cutting down on the frustration factor in games, but in the case of \"Enslaved\"-I wish the game didn't feel the need to tell me every single thing I'm supposed do and every single place I'm supposed to go and instead let me figure out a few  things on my own.  Even when climbing or swinging \"Prince of Persia\" style up and through the environment-every possible foot hold or useable object was highlighted.  The games gives you zero opportunity to figure the path out for yourself.  Mind you, this really cut down on the frustration of getting stuck in the game, but didn't give me the satisfaction of solving a few of the puzzles for myself.  Some players will love the additional help and the \"casual\" platforming approach here and others will hate it.  I guess it comes down to preference.Over all, \"Enslaved\" is a fairly unique and original game, but you can still see the obvious influence of \"Prince of Persia\" and \"God of War\" on the game's platforming and combat mechanics.  The overall vibe has a slight \"Beyond Good and Evil\" feel to it too and there's even a segment toward the end of the game that is very reminiscent of Michael Bay's God awful Transformers movies.  (Though it's put to good use here)As a whole, \"Enslaved: Odyssey to the West\" is a great game that must not be overlooked.  Forget the lack of hype, this game is as triple A as anything else out this season.  I hope this game sells well because I would LOVE to see a sequel.  It would be great to take another adventure with Monkey and Trip and see how a few minor tweaks could make an outstanding game even better.  Buy this one!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0047TG2R0","description":"","reviewerName":"007 \"cmyth007\"","summary":"Mixed Feelings...","reviewText":"I have mixed feelings about this game after playing it all day. Some of the things that other reviewers didn't like really don't bother me. For example, I don't mind that you can't pick a few different races this time around. That really only changed the first hour or so anyway. The reworked art style seems much better to me. In the original, although I loved the game, there was nothing spectacular or \"dark\" about the setting, considering they called it dark fantasy. I think they are closer this time around.They really dumbed a lot of it down, just like with ME2, and I think that was a mistake in some respects. You can no longer deck out your other party members with the best gear, because the only thing you can do is upgrade their equipment with runes. Want them to use a different weapon or give them better armor? Too bad.I actually also don't mind the narrative style of the storytelling either, although it does have its drawbacks. The real problems start with the new button-mash style of play. On the one hand the original system did need some fixing. When you'd highlight an opponent to attack, you would have to move into range. Sometimes the target was running towards you at the time, so you'd literally run by him without attacking, then have to chase him down. I think they could have fixed that problem without changing it to a button mash fest. I started with the rogue and after a few hours, frankly, I had to change to an archer. Now I paly a LOT of video games, but when you are hip-deep in darkspawn, having to mash that button hundreds of times will take its toll on your poor hands. And if you've played the rogue set up with dual weapons, you know that means a LOT of button presses. For goodness sakes if its going to be that way just let us hold the attack button in!The combat is certainly more savage and fun to watch, but when you have to press a button for every single attack, it gets to the point where you can't enjoy it anymore. The original game play let you use strategy and then watch the results of your choices play out. This new system is almost too fast and hectic to be appreciated. They made a similar choice with the path they took after the original KOTOR, which I also loved and still play. When they moved on to Jade Empire they went with the button masher scheme. I was so thrilled when the first DA came out because they switched back to a truly great system, but now they have switched yet again.Although I think many of the reviewers are being a little harsh in their assessment, I think there is a lot of truth to their comments. I'm enjoying the game, don't get me wrong, but I think they lost focus of the core audience that made the original such a hit. I also really don't like how there is no real connection to the first game. Yes you'll see some of the characters from the original game pop up here and there, but it still seems very disconnected. Its almost like--we know you played the first game, now come play it again--but with a different guy that we will create for you--oh and you have to mash a lot of buttons too.Surprisingly, some folks are even unhappy with the fact that the main character actually has a voice this time. Frankly I love that. I thought it was REALLY a poor choice the first time around to not give the hero a voice because it really detracted from the epic feeling of the game. So I don't empathize with folks on that point. For what its worth, I also don't like how they stripped down ME2 in terms of skills and leveling, but I still really enjoyed the game.I'm a little concerned not only about the future of this franchise, but of Bioware in general. When they made a game--I bought it--period. You KNEW it was going to be good. But this is a really shaky installment for the quality that I'm used to expecting from them, and I hope they turn things around if there is another one. I don't feel like the game was \"rushed\", like many reviewers. I just feel like they stripped it down a bit too much. I think they could have kept the original gameplay mechanics with a couple of fixes and still got the game out just as quickly.Please, Bioware, think hard about how you move forward. You have never been satisifed making games that are like everyone elses, so please don't start now.**UpdateNow that I've finished the game its time for an update! I've cooled off on some of the criticisms I had early on but gotten a little more irritated with other things, so overall my rating will stay put. But a few things to comment on...I don't know how some folks can say that the game only lasted 30 hours. The only way you could finish that fast is if you put it on casual difficulty and ignore all the side quests. I put in nearly twice that many hours, so I'm happy with the game length.Originally I wasn't able to change my other characters' weapons and armor. I had tried initially and it wouldn't let me so I didn't try again until a fellow reviewer told me you could do that a little while into the game, at least as far as the weapons go. You can't change the armor for any of the other characters, aside from buying these stupid little mods for their armor. I thought it was a step in the wrong direction. The cool thing about the first game was that when your main character got a cool new set of armor, you passed on your old set to one of your crew. Not possible here.The one unforgiveable thing about the game is the repetitive use of maps. You will go back to the same areas over and over and over again. Combined with the whole \"stuck in town\" feeling of the game, it really detracts from the epic nature of the original game. You were out there exploring the world, seeing new places all the time. Here you're in town and occasionally you go out of town briefly to do something, unfortunately its almost always back to the same three locations.Another small matter was the lack of the party camp. I really liked that from the first game. All your characters were together in one place and it made you feel like your party was in this terrible mess together. Now you have everyone who has their own house around town--it feels very odd to me for some reason. Why not have them all hang out at Hawke's place?All in all a very solid game. Takes a while to warm up to some of the changes but for the most part you will. I'd probably give it 3.5 stars if I could, but its definitely not a four star game the way it is. If they had added a little variety in the maps and put a little more work into the plot they could have easily made this better than the first game, even with the changes to the combat system. But now we know how they got the game on the market so fast.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2011"}

This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better. Buy it immediately.Rated:9.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Matthew Warner","summary":"Metroid Soars!","reviewText":"Remakes of classic games are a risky endeavor. On the one hand, you're working with a classic game recognized by possibly millions of people around the world, most of whom are fans. This means that you start with an existing fan community, but the flipside is that these fans are likely to be far more critical of a remake treading on hallowed ground. Deviate too far from the formula of the original, and you risk alienating the fans who put the source game on the map in the first place. Go to far in the other direction and don't change things enough, and the game will suffer -- presumably the whole reason for the remake in the first place was to address issues in the original game that are no longer up to the standards of modern titles, thereby giving fans a modern-day version of a classic. Fail in this, and the most likely response will be an apathetic shrug from the gaming community, followed by predicable but merely mediocre sales.Taking this into account, a Metroid 1 remake seems like a great idea that will should fall flat. The Metroid series was  groundbreaking for Nintendo, and was a truly remarkable step sideways for the kid-friendly company. Metroid was, and remains, one of the few truly dark Nintendo games, throwing players into a maze of subterranean monster lairs and secret passages. It was a futuristic game with a massive sense of mystery about it, creating the feeling of exploration in an alien world that has become the series' trademark.However, what worked in '87 doesn't necessarily hold up today. Metroid's backstory has since been fleshed out to a substantial degree, shedding light on many of the mysteries that actually propped up the original game. Half the reason to explore Metroid was just to figure out what all this stuff was about. Now, with games like Metroid: Fusion, the players have been given a much clearer window into the life of the game's protagonist, as well as all the events and occurrences surrounding her. If you go back and play the original game, there are hints of the direction the series' plot would take in future installments, but for the most part it's too full of holes to be considered cannon; it feels like more of a suggestion than a real reference point. While the aesthetics are certainly cool, to be honest, there's not much of a plot to speak of in Metroid 1.At the same time, if a remake were to go back and try to cram what we now know of the game's origins into a setting that was never particularly meant to hold it, you're going to wind up with a different game entirely -- not exactly a remake. So...What to do?Well, I'm not sure how they managed it, but they did. This game not only sidesteps every bullet I've mentioned above, it plucks them right out of the air, Matrix-style, and tosses them back without breaking a sweat. This game, as far as what one would hope to achieve with a remake, is absolutely PERFECT.True to the original game, Metroid: Zero Mission eschews any real narrative style in favor of visual cues. The plot remains the same: Penetrate the defenses below the planet and kill the space-pirate ringleader, Mother Brain. Really, that's it, both in the original and in the new version. However, now, all the unseen stuff that was merely implied in the original is actually present in the game proper. Kraid's been updated to his official size (i.e. freakin' huge). Ridley actually lands his ship (yes, Ridley can fly a ship) partway through the game to intercept Samus as the game wears on. Hey, he apparently wasn't just waiting around for her to show up and kill him that whole time. Who knew?Really, the whole game has been updated to the point that it's exactly what one assumes the original would have been, had it been made in 2004. All the original layouts, powerups, enemies, and tricky hidden rooms are in there, but they've been streamlined and slightly altered to remove much of the obtuseness of the original game. Of course, as a result, the remake is far easier, but it comes together so well that the difficulty amounts to what it would be if the player was already intimately familiar with the original game. That is, if you know the entire map of Metroid 1 like the back of your hand, the game isn't particularly hard. Metroid: Zero Mission just adds that sort of familiarity artificially by means of a true in-game map and a waypoint system to alert the player where they need to go to advance. If it sounds like hand-holding, it is, but it doesn't serve to make the game genuinely easier. Rather, it takes the frustration level down, which is a perfect tradeoff as far as I care.On the technical side of things, the graphics have received an obvious overhaul, and the game looks fantastic. Control is spot on, and the music consists of well-done updates of the original MIDI tunes. Metroid had a particularly memorable soundtrack, and the remake keeps everything wonderfully intact. You'll be humming the Brinstar theme for hours, guaranteed.Lastly, it's worth pointing out that the Original Metroid opens up as a bonus feature once the game is beaten once, so those who want to make a direct comparison can do so right on the same cart. It's a very nice little bonus that rounds out what really is the definitive 2D Metroid experience.All in all, this game is as good as I ever could have hoped for. Fans of the original are really in for a treat -- especially AFTER the Mother Brain fight. A few things were added, to tie up some loose ends, you might say...Highly, highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2004"}

This game is no different - it is quite enjoyable and has a good storyline - although there are 2 probs I have with it. 1) had to updated with latest patch to get it to work despite my having a new copy and a sick machine.  2) there seems to be more story/cutscenes than actual game play/fighting.  I didn't mind the car driving, but there was more than I expected, and I haven't even finished the game yet (level 7) I only played this game as I could no longer stand the hype and had to find out what it was all about.  And the game is pretty good as far as games go. but once again, seems more cutscenes than gameplay so keep that in mind. I got this as the Value Edition - same game- diff packaging (more lame)so it was a good vaule at that.  Don't think it would have been worth full price, as it was just not that exciting and I don't think I will be getting ME2.

{"product_name":"B0016NRS8M","reviewerName":"JckDnls","summary":"Good RPG but lacks polish","reviewText":"I found this to be a pretty enjoyable RPG.  The story was predictable and contained more than a few plot holes but the quests are fun overall.  The setting seems to be a mix of multiple cultural influences and environments (not your usual \"east\" or \"west\" settings.  The voice acting was terrible at first but it grows on you in a way that will make you laugh once you're used to it.  I also loved the stupid hand gestures and posturing the characters would do during conversations (not sure if this was intentional by the developers).  The combat was satisfying and reminiscent of Fable.  I used a melee heavy character and really enjoyed putting together combos with your basic slashing and \"powers\" you can upgrade.  One major letdown was the map size - it looks huge but a very large swath of the main island is reserved for multiplayer and is inaccessible during the single player.  The servers were completely dead the few times I tried to connect with other players but achievement hunters can still play alone on multiplayer servers if they need to.  I think I played approximately 50-60 hours by the time I was finished with the game and all side quests, so I definitely think I got my money's worth.  DLC is available but the prices they ask for are simply appalling.  For the price TW2 can be had for now, I would encourage the curious to give it a try.  As many reviewers have stated, it's not the best game but if you're a forgiving player you can certainly enjoy your time with this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2012"}

All of that changed, luckily, as I kept hearing from co-workers of the new Saints Row. Calls of crazy phallic weapons, over the top action and dialog, and just all around fulfilling gaming sessions, for those of us who love gaming, however, just want to have a beer and vegetate by the end of the day. I had to give it a go; I had to find out for my self if this was something different than a GTA clone. I was no disappointed!Where GTA has successfully transformed an edgy, entertaining experience into a tedious job with marginal reward, in Saints Row the Third, the developer has decided to abandon all serious regard and has produced a purely entertaining experience. This game had me hooked from the first scene! It was ridiculous, and it was fun!This game has succeeded in creating a niche in the market that I can barely hold my anticipation for the fourth addition.

The whole point of the game is the story and the characters. The game moves really slowly, the characters do not run, they walk, slowly, and the dialogue is slow with no way of skipping it. Think of this game as 'Choose Your Own Adventure' and play out how the game ends per character who is tied to the story. The only thing that doesn't seem to change is who the villain is, but the course of actions determine how the other characters end up. Some of the scenes along with the music are intense, the sense of fear or rush from seeing a character struggle is amazing.There are multiple endings and depending on what choices are made, the characters will live or die. The incentive of replaying the game is to get all the endings. The controls are awkward for this game, there are prompts to press buttons at a specific time and sequence, and missing the sequence will mean re-doing it over again, and again, until it's done correctly to pass the scene. The controls make the game not very enjoyable in my opinion, I found myself not hitting the prompts every time and when the SIXAXIS icon comes up to tilt the controller, there was tons of missing as well. Half the game is filled with tasks each character will must perform, it gives the sense that they are real people doing real things, like changing diapers, preparing food by taking stuff out from the fridge, etc.This is an important video game for this generation, to try out storytelling in video game motion controller form. Heavy Rain does have a decent story to it, far better than most things in the movies these days. However, the voice acting is unbelievable, the characters sound hollow, but this could be due to roster of French developers in the credits. The only real negative thing about this game is the glitches, it hiccups often enough to notice and froze more than once.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2010"}

The graphics were really good and the game gave new meaning to the phrase \"Adrenaline Overload\".Here's AvP2, and in almost every way it's an improvement over the original, which I didn't think was possible. Every species has been retooled and new weapons have been added making each character type you play very different from the next. And my God, it's even more heart stopping than the original!The plot centers around a particular alien-infested planet. A research station run by Corporates has had something go awry so the Marines are sent in to figure out the goings on and fix it if possible. The Predator goes in to rack up points for his Hunt while searching ultimately for the Boss of the base, a kill that got away years before. And the Aliens, well...they're just out to kill.The Marines are still my favorite. Heavily reliant on Pulse Rifles and Chainguns, the Marine campaign is nothing short of spectacular. From the word go you're immersed in what has to be simply put the best fusion of all the movies put together. Predictably after landing, your character is separated from his comrades and must rely on his minimal ammo load to make it from point A to B to C, fighting with Aliens the whole while. Hints that the Predator is around are seen everywhere by the numerous \"skinned\" bodies hanging upside down, and the telltale clicking noises he makes. The brilliant addition of a shoulder lamp helps enormously, making you less reliant on your finite source of flares. And to say this particular campaign will make you [appreciate it] is the understatement of the century. Even when you know that the dark and scary locale you're in is loaded with Aliens wanting to disembowel you is not enough to prevent even the most hardened gamer from screaming out loud at his or her computer in surprise.The Predator portion is for the most part true to the movies. They've somewhat weakened this character from the first game, where the Predator was something of the uber class to play, mostly for multiplayer balance I would imagine. While the atmosphere is still eerie, knowing that you have auto-tracking weapons helps alleviate the shock of seeing an Alien running at you. A close eye must be kept on your energy bar as too many shots off of your Plasma Caster will deplete it rapidly.But the real overhaul of the game, and by far the single biggest improvement is to the Alien. My God, this class has become so much fun! The original AvP had a very weak Single player story for the Alien, in my opinion. I must not have been alone in this way because the boys at Lithtech retooled the whole deal and made it very immersive. You start out as a simple facehugger...running from place to place looking for a victim to \"impregnate\". Playing cat and mouse with patrolling Corporate guards is something like having Thief crossed with Quake, and you'll want to avoid all contact for as long as possible. Once a suitable host is found, you spawn as a baby alien, even getting to *shudders* watch the chest-bursting act from a whole new perspective. This really adds to the entire experience and my hat's off to Sierra for making this happen.Multiplayer is an absolute riot. You've got your standard array of maps and arenas, with the continued options such as \"Deathmatch\" and \"Species Deathmatch\", with the addition of notable scenarios like \"Evac\", where a group of Marines works together to escape a facility, while Aliens try to pick them off one by one. Get to the dropship on time and your team wins. Combat gets really hairy and confusing, and you'll never get used to crawling through airshafts that an Alien opponent is using to hunt you, reminding me of poor old Captain Dallas.Buy this game. Play this game. And be prepared to be a stockholder in the Fruit of the Loom company, because you'll be changing your drawers hourly and often, especially in the Single Player Campaigns.

It is very challenging and some might say downright sadistic in design.  It&#8217;s almost like this game taunts you, and when you fail, it laughs.  But the triumphs of victory are far greater than the sorrow of despair.  Other players will join you in this world and leave messages and blood stains, so that you might not make the same mistakes.  They can also join into your game and help you clear what seems like an impossible boss, or invade and try to kill you.  The constant fear of dying and losing all your souls is always in your mind.  Souls are what are needed to level up and buy equipment.  Should you keep going further or turn back?I like the changes From Software has done to keep new players engaged but still give the souls veterans a challenge.  The level designs and how you go about the world are quite different than Dark Souls.  Instead of an interconnected world it feels like pathways with many places along the way.  Dark Souls 2 is much less guided than its predecessor and you are less limited on where you can go.  This can sometimes be frustrating when trying to figure out where to go next.  Different areas have a different level of challenge and going to one &#8220;too soon&#8221; is almost always fatal.The graphics and sound are fantastic for a system that is over 10 years old.  I haven&#8217;t noticed any significant glitches or frame rate drops.  Be on the lookout for the PC version in April.  It will support 1080P and I&#8217;m sure will look magnificent.Overall this game is just incredible.  It is just as fun and challenging as the previous souls games while keeping it fresh.  The game forces you to get better at it and accept its challenges.  If you do not there is no winning but instead a whole lot of dying.

Examples of difficult games are Devil May Cry 3 and Breath of Fire Dragon Quarter, those are really challenging ones, and not everyone will be able to finish them. Demon's Souls is a great game, but it punishes so much and is so unforgiving that, after beating the game I didn't wanted to play again. Gear and weapon development are tied to item farming which has numerous annoyances that are a detriment of the gameplay experience.The best aspect of this title is the multiplayer experience, get help to defeat a tough stage or invade other player's worlds is addictive; most of the bosses are very well designed, and your adrenaline will flow when you get in a difficult situation or get invaded by another player.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2010"}

Squires \"theDrizzle\"","summary":"Better late then never I suppose","reviewText":"I've given the XBOX three stars for the simple reason that it took them too long to do this. I've had two broken consoles, scratched discs and wasted money on various other products (2 wifi adapters, HD DVD drive and a bunch of microphones made from twigs and berries I believe). The new Xbox is great! It's very quiet, integrated wifi and it looks pretty. But they've been screwing me with inferior hardware since the original Xbox 360 release, so I don't know that this makes up for it. I think that they should have set up a program where you could trade in a wifi adapter, HD drive and a bricked Xbox for a new console to make up for all the pain they've caused. A three year warranty where they waited 2 months to send me a \"new\" Xbox (old one repaired with duct tape I think), wasn't good enough for me.At least GameStop has a pretty good deal going on; that's the only reason I bought a new console. They took both my old 360s (I have two because they waited to put HDMI and the 65nm processor until later and my older one scratched disks sometimes), and both my wifi adapters (G and N upgrade), and some games which gave me enough credit to get the new Xbox and two new games.I'm glad GameStop helped me out with this; otherwise I'd be even more frustrated with Microsoft. They put out a shiny new piece of hardware with all the problems fixed and left me stranded with two inferior boxes and old wifi adapters. It's hard to justify buying a new Xbox when you've wasted so much money on failed equipment in the past.Funny how they can sell me a smaller console with a 250GB harddrive and integrated N wireless at 299 when they charged me 100 bucks for my wireless adapter 4 months ago.I love Xbox and I prefer it to other consoles, but I\"m sick of Microsoft screwing me over all the time. Between Windows Vista and all the failed Xbox hardware, I've had it. I'd switch to PS3 solely if the controller and live service was as good for me.If my new Xbox fails, I'm going to have a stroke!I know a lot of you will complain that it's not fair to give this three stars if it's a good product, but I would argue that it's fair to incorporate total costs and pain from other releases of the same product. This Xbox is basically what Xbox should have been 4 years ago and they've made me buy it three times, so I can't help but let that play into the review. This is not the Xbox 720, so I don't think it deserves a clean slate product review. If you bought a DVD and it wouldn't play, so you bought another copy and it wouldn't play and then they put it in a new package and you bought it, and it worked great, would you give it 5 stars?UPDATE: 12July2010- 3 weeks now and it's working great. I noticed that the wifi was a little weaker than the previous adapters that I used with my old consoles. I was getting interference from the netgear wireless USB adapter on my media center PC, so I had to unplug it. This isn't really Microsoft's fault, but I think that the integrated wifi might be a lot weaker than other wifi devices. I wonder why they didn't go with an external antenna? Guess it looks better without it though. Anyways, it's working great and it truly is whisper quiet; I haven't experienced any issues with the system and it's still pretty. Also, I'm finding the touch buttons to work really well and they're kind of neat; I generally use the controller to turn on the console, but they're still pretty fun to use. When you open the tray, you just lightly touch the button and it goes \"bing.\" I'll continue to update this review over time and I'll consider upgrading the star rating if I don't get any issues with this console.- To those of you that appreciated this review, I'm glad that I could help out. To all of the haters, stop complaining about my review...it's my review. If you think Xbox is flawless, go make your own meaningless 5-star review.Take Care","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00009ZVHW","description":"Armed with her camera, aikido staff, and investigative skills, Jade sets out to expose the secrets behind the alien invaders to liberate the minds of her deceived people.","reviewerName":"Richard Veysey","summary":"One of those hard to find games","reviewText":"I don't mean by my title that this game is hard to find.  More that a game as well done as this only comes around once and a while.  I spent about 20 hours exploring the world of Hylis.  20 hours which seemed to be only 10-15 hours.  Time passes much faster outside the little bubble of blissful ignorance that will form around you while playing this game because, frankly, the outside world will seem to fade as you almost become Jade, becoming increasingly immersed in the beautiful yet dark world of Beyond Good and Evil.The game opens with an alien attack by creatures known as the Domz.  After a simple battle, you recieve your camera and can begin exploring your small island home, which also happens to be a lighthouse.  When you first get the camera, you'll recieve one of the game's main side quests: photographing all the world's animals.  This quest continues throught the game and takes a bit of work to complete, although you won't regret it.  It is one of the most entertaining mini-games I have ever seen, keeping you entertained durring and between misions.  After you've finished photographing the animals and exploring the environment, you begin you're adventure by recieving a speedboat from your best friend and companion, Pay'j.Before I go on to mention anything else, I should probably go into detail about the environment.  Although the game's graphics are often very cartoony, the cartoon world of Hylis comes alive in the form of the teeming life you see everywhere around you.  There are the small things, such as the detailed rock walls of caverns, to the way the water moves, to all the people walking out on the streets.  Everything just seems so alive that it will seem almost magical.  The game also has a wonderful distance engine, which allows the player to see things from a very large distance, such as a whale leaping from the water, or other boats, or even the larger details of the game's several islands.While running around taking pictures and fighting evil is fun, it is just as much fun to cruise around on the speed boat and the rocket ship, once you get it.  While there is some fighting and picture taking to be had aboard the ship, it was not quite frequent enough for me, and I had to just make due with the 3 boat race courses and the four smugglers caverns, with the occasional Domz attack.The main collectible in this game is the pearl, and pearls are required to progress through the game, with some additional pearls added in to give you more choice as to what quests to perform to progress in the game.  The games quests vary.  While you will get pearls automatically for progression in the game's rich plot, you will also have to take pictures of animals, fight some hidden Domz, win boat races, defeat smugglers, infiltrate government buildings in which pearls are held, and other little quests, many involving the perchase of pearls.  Also, to avoid all the annoying serching that most games have to get the last collectibles, you can buy an item that will label pearl and animal locations on your map so that you have an idea of where to look, although it won't tell you how to get them.The puzzles in the game are very well done, and, for the most part, simple.  There is one puzzle later on that is quite well done because it is hard without being contrived or ridiculously pointless or anything else that can be complained about.  Other puzzles involve finding clever ways of sneaking past guards or getting over a wall.  It's one of those games where solving puzzles isn't extremely difficult as long as you look for the game's hints, yet still give a very rewarding feeling after their completion.Almost done... This game isn't exactly an action game.  Like in most RPGs, you can't fall of edges into bottomless pits, although enemies can kill you.  Jade will do most jumping and action oriented moves by herself, leaving you to fight monsters and solve puzzles.  The controls are very responsive and should never frustrate the player, especially with the fantastic camera, which places itself in basically the best position almost automatically, although there are sometimes when it would be nice to be able to move it.  This makes doing battle simple, although it's not to hard to begin with.  Most enemies are slow to attack and give you plenty of time to prepare a good strategy to dealing with them.To wrap up, I need to mention the two most surprising things about this game.  First off, it had almost no bugs that I could find.  I found one spot where I fell through a floor, but I can only blame myself for that one, and it was easy to avoid the spot once I knew what I did to get into it.  Did I mention that there are save points EVERYWHERE, so you never have to worry about getting really far and then getting stuck having to turn it off and losing 30 minutes of playing.  Also, being killed only places you back at the entrance of a room, making some of the more frustrating sneaking bits much less so.  The other bug was simply a quest desription bug on Salene which described the Pay'j quest as the \"escaping the Slaughterhouse\" quest.  Other than that, I had no problems with the game's mechanics.  Another surprise in this game was the increadible music, which had a great Latin feel and really got your feet moving and sometimes your head moving from side to side.This game's story line never lets up and keeps you on the edge of your seat right up till the fantastic final battle.  There were even several spots (especially the lighthouse bit near the end), when I almost cried because of the game's extremely emotional presentation.  The only irritating thing is that the game seems to have one of those 'prepare for a sequal' endings, with some little loose ends to tie up, yet I have heard no plans for one as of yet.  I'll have to keep my eyes peeled, I guess.Anyway, if you're still reading this (I didn't realize I had this much to say about BG&E;, sorry), this game goes beyond good and bad and reaches a level which few games attain of utter perfection.  Every little thing in this game is thrown at you in just the right amount to entertain you, yet keep you begging for more.  If you can find this game used, it makes a great addition to anyone's collection, but even new it's still a great deal for a great game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2004"}

{"product_name":"B0009UC6AI","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Fatal Frame has met Silent Hill!","reviewText":"The third of the well-received \"Fatal Frame\" series carries on all the same gameplay as it's predecessors, but as the idea has proved to be such a good one, there's nothing wrong with that. Playing as a young female reporter called Rei - the most grown-up main character seen so far in the series - the player is once again armed with a ghost-busting camera and sent to explore a huge dilapidated Japanese mansion. And once again you will encounter vengeful phantoms that need to be dispatched via split-second timing of getting the best possible shots with the mysterious camera. This aspect is as fun as ever, as the best shots always come with the cost of putting yourself at most risk in order to take them (i.e. letting the ghost come as near as possible to attacking you). Also back are the many fleeting apparitions that you need to be lightning quick with your shutter-finger to snap on film. But it's all worth the effort, as these shots, along with your best \"attack\" photos score highly on a points system that lets you power up the capabilities of the camera, turning it into a more powerful ghost-buster for the later, harder phantoms...especially when it's sometimes not just one against one.I had reservations as the game got underway, when I realised that all the spooky Japanese mansions were starting to get a bit repetitive, with the same old rotting cupboards and dusty kimonos at every corner, but the game has addressed this with a new slant on the gameplay, in that all the ghost hunting levels forms part of a recurring nightmare being experienced by main character. When she's not dreaming, she's awake and inhabiting her not-at-all spooky apartment. This splitting of playing time between dream trips to the forbidding mansion, and popping into the neat and tidy kitchen or stroking the cat, reminded me heavily of \"Silent Hill 4\", which used the same dual locations, and must have been an inspiration for this game. Cleverly, the game has Rei being up and about in her own apartment between both day and night times, and after the horrors of the dream adventures, even this neat and modern location begins to make you fell uneasy when walking around it at night. There are also two more playable characters in the game which adds variety, as they can go into areas that Rei cannot access. They also have certain unique skills, but much weaker ghost-busting cameras than Rei, so these stages can be tough. And once again those evil ghosts are no slouches, and getting the \"fatal frame\" shots can be pretty dicey, especially as these ghouls don't play fair and can vanish and teleport all over the place while you are swinging your camera around trying to keep them in view....you'll learn to hate those little girls with stakes and mallets!Because of the fun to be had with the camera and the game in general, I'm prepared to once again forgive the same drawbacks that are still present as before - really clunky directional controls and the lamest \"run\" function ever witnessed - Rei runs like a little old lady hobbling after a bus. Despite starting off as a fairly easy game, the game keeps the reputation of the series up by occasionally throwing some really tough ghost battles at you, roundabout the halfway mark and onwards, so save often! Even so, the ghosts STILL don't live up to the creepy horrors of the first game (too many of the ghosts are smiling little girls, which doesn't scare me very much), but I think that this third installment actually has the most grown up theme; it's take on the rituals concerning death and the afterlife is handled very seriously and quite sensitively. It also has the most impressive ending movie of the series so far - effective and quite moving. Bottom line - while not really being very different to parts one and two, this is a worthy third installment to the series, and a treat for fans.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2006"}

This game is just so radically different, it takes me back to my youth when games using joysticks and paddles and were all about fun, not trying to out-technology each other.  The included Wii Sports game is a blast. It introduces you to the controllers very nicely.  Although the remote and nunchuck feel a little weird at first, they are very intuitive because body movements are far easier than just mashing finger buttons.  Setup was pretty easy and we were playing in minutes.  The graphics are very nice.  I really don't care if they're not in the highest 1080-whatever resolution and doubt most kids my son's age will either (or adults just looking for pure fun).  Gameplay is smooth and very immersive.  The games all have the usual Nintendo feel of family fun.  The Wii Wi-Fi setup was also a breeze.  After connecting both Wii's to our home network, we were immediately checking sports, weather, and news over Nintendo's free online service. The Wii uses a standard SD card for memory.  I was able to give my son a huge memory card for almost nothing (compared to previous prices for memory cards on his PS2 and Gamecube).  There is a reason these things are selling like hotcakes. Besides the buyer-friendly price, it's a great console.  My son was so possessive of his Wii, my daughters pooled their Christmas money and gift cards to buy their own.  Now they play each other wirelessly.  I only have a few very minor gripes.  The battery life in the controllers is pretty bad.  These things suck down AA batteries like crazy.  I've already changed the batteries twice in each remote during a month of gameplay.  I'm about to invest in some rechargable AA's.  The remote also sometimes loses it's partnership with the console when the batteries are exhausted.  You also have to be careful with the wrist strap.  The strap on my daughter's remote snapped after only a week; and it was supposedly one of the improved ones.  Fortunately, the remote remained in her hand and didn't result in one of those flying Wii remote stories posted all over the web.  To Nintendo's credit, I received two new straps by mail in less than a week after completing a brief online form. Other than the strap, the quality of the materials is excellent.  Our remotes have been dropped several times, including once on a hard ceramic tile floor, and haven't suffered a scratch. Nintendo also extended our warranty to 15 months after we registered our Wii online (Don't know how long this deal will last, but it's worth a few minutes on the web for 90 extra days peace-of-mind). Don't despair if you can't find a Wii on store shelves.  If you scout the advertisements and show up at the store when they open, you have a very good chance at scoring one; no lines or camping.  Just make sure you're there at opening because they usually sell out very fast.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2007"}

The games size rivals that of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (even if GTA:SA is bigger Assassins Creed is lot more detailed and intractable).- A good story mixing elements of historical fiction and a Sci-Fi.- Really impressive graphics and first-rate animations, that look just as good as games like Bioshock and Mass Effect.- A great sound track that mixes music of the era during the clam points of the game and more modern type of music during the chase points of the game.BAD:- Collecting Flags (one hundred in every city and one hundred in the countryside) has no real point and only unlocks achievements.- Most players and reviews complain about the relative nature of the Intel missions. Most of these missions are generally the same from city to city.IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- A Stealth game set in the year 1191 A.D. during the holy land crusades between King Richard and Sladine. You play as an Assassin of Hashshashin (who was a real life group of assassins of that time) charged with unsettling the powers that be in an attempt to bring peace to the holy land. To do this you must kill nine people who are using the crusades to control others and bring disorder to the land.- The control is broken down into two areas of game play there is a passive action and an aggressive action to almost everything you can do in the game. For example you can lightly tap people to move out of your way while walking down crowed the street (hold the B button to do this) or shove people as you run down that same street (hold the R button and the B button to do this). This duality applies to all your actions and it becomes necessary because during the game you must be able to move freely between these two states (passive and aggressive) to run and then hide from people the out to get you as well as to sneak up on and kill your victims.- Lot of what you will be doing is climbing and jumping from buildings this plays similar to the Prince of Persia games also made by ubisoft (the sands of time series). Although in this game the controls are more streamlined and user friendly as you can climb way more effectively as well as more realistically.- Most of the game play itself is not so much assassinating people but gathering Intel on your targets, like ease dropping on conversations, pick pocketing people, and saving innocents from corrupt guards (who will repay you later by having others help in your endeavors) you can also scout out high areas to find hiding areas for later.- Altair (the main character that you will play as) is an assassin and not a gladiator, while you can kill over 25 guards in a row (doing that unlocks an achievement) Altair is more like a spy or Ninja where his style is to stay hidden for a long as possible and not out right fight unless cornered. Now when cornered Altair can really destroy is enemies rather effetely with either a small combo (tap X once until you hear/see Altair's sword hit his opponents sword and quickly tap X again - this take lots of practice to get right) or counter move (tap X right before an opponent hit Altair with his sword), the over all effect is that only players who feel the most confident in their abilities will fight more then a few people at once. While most players should and will play more like a \"true\" assassin and not be seen as well as only fight when they must.- After every major assassination you unlock new moves and weapons (like throwing knives and counter strike).- While in the countryside (called \"Kingdom\") you get to ride horses, this aspect of game play is very reminiscent of the Nintendo 64 game The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time.- The story can be very confusing to some not familiar with the politics of this time era. I recommend seeing the movie Kingdom of Heaven, this helps explain the story a bit more and give more back story to the game (note this game takes place a year or so after that movie).GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Metal Gear Solid (PS1)- Splinter Cell: Double Agent (360/PS3/PC)- Prince of Persia (Xbox/PS2)- Crackdown (360)- HitMan: Blood Money (360)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- There is a small secret about the games story that I will not give away, although I will say the 90% of your gameplay time will be spend on the facts I have already mentioned, and the other part of the game is only really story based with no real bearing on your gameplay.- Altair is an Arabic word that means \"The Flying One\".- The assassins that Altair is a part of were a real group of assassins during that era in fact the word assassins comes from the assassins group Hashshashin as it was a word used to describe there followers. All your main targets (nine in all) are based on real people who during that time period either died mysteriously or vanished.- This game is also on the Sony Playstation 3 as well as the PC.- In the limited collector's edition you will find an art book, a mini Altair figuring as well as a mini strategy guide, you will also find a mini comic about one of Altair's missions (drawn from the comic artist from Penny Arcade website) as well as a bonus DVD with the videos \"The Making of Assassins Creed\" documentary and it all comes in a tin case.- There is talk from Ubisoft about sequels to this game set in other time eras.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000IMWK2G","reviewerName":"The Duck of Indeed","summary":"A Good Controller, But Not Great Battery Life","reviewText":"The Wii remote is needed to play Wii games, and it makes games very fun because of the motion.  The remote also has speakers, though I don't see the point, and it probably makes the battery last less time.  For me, the batteries last about a month, which isn't as long as they last in my XBox 360 controller.  Make sure you wear the wrist strap to make sure you don't accidentally throw the remote.  This has happened to people, and they have damaged their TV's.  I don't think it's likely if you're careful, though.I mostly like the Wii remote, but there is one problem I've had besides the battery not lasting super long.  In one of my Wii remotes, the sound eventually started to get bad.  The sound isn't very important, but it would sound like static sometimes.  I don't know if this is a very common problem or not.  Luckily, other than that, the controller works great.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2011"}

It's not Dragonforce hard, but still has lots of solos and strumming. I played on Expert only.This version is pretty much setup exactly like Guitar Hero: World Tour. Same interface etc. The quickplay song list is set up in one big list ala World Tour & Rockband. Career mode is useless, all the songs are already unlocked in quickplay so why bother. 28 Metallica Songs, and 21 other artists. If you play a song in Career mode, that high score won't transfer down to the quickplay, like Guitar Hero: Aerosmith did.I like Metallica, but not die-hard fan. Some of the songs are rather long. Mercyful fate takes awhile, I didn't have a stopwatch but it is listed as a 11 minutes 12 seconds long off that respective album, that seems about right.The rest of the \"Other Artist\" songs, 21 in all, are listed below:ALICE IN CHAINS - No ExcusesBOB SEGER - Turn The PageCORROSION OF CONFORMITY - AlbatrossDIAMOND HEAD - Am I Evil?FOO FIGHTERS - Stacked ActorsJUDAS PRIEST - Hell Bent For LeatherKYUSS - Demon CleanerLYNYRD SKYNYRD - Tuesdays GoneMACHINE HEAD - Beautiful MourningMASTODON - Blood And ThunderMERCYFUL FATE - EvilMICHAEL SCHENKER GROUP - Armed and ReadyMOT&Ouml;RHEAD - Ace of SpadesQUEEN - Stone Cold CrazySAMHAIN - Mother of MercySLAYER - War EnsembleSOCIAL DISTORTION - Mommy's Little MonsterSUICIDAL TENDENCIES - War Inside My HeadSYSTEM OF A DOWN - ToxicityTHE SWORD - Black RiverTHIN LIZZY - The Boys Are Back in TownAside from System of A Down & perhaps Alice in Chains, these songs were subpar to play.I liked Guitar Hero III & Aerosmith.

{"product_name":"B00000DMB2","reviewerName":"Robert Jenkins \"video geek #1\"","summary":"I just love blasting TIE'S....","reviewText":"LucasArts has really outdone itself with this great N64 game.  After Shadows of the Empire was released, it quickly became obvious that the best level in the game was the first level, where you are flying a Rebel Airspeeder during the Battle of Hoth.  LA decided to make a whole game using a similar concept, and Rogue Squadron was born.  You play as Luke Skywalker, leader of Rogue Squadron, a group of elite rebel pilots who roam the galaxy, making life difficult for the Empire and its minions.  You play through 16 basic missions, which together form a loose plot chronicling the adventures of Rogue Squadron during the time between the destruction of the first Death Star and The Empire Strikes Back.  The missions range from simple search-and-destroy missions, to escorting supply trains, to freeing rebel soldiers from Imperial prison facilities.  Along the way, you must learn to handle a variety of rebel craft, from the X-Wing to the Airspeeder.  Each craft has its own strengths and weaknesses, plus each craft has a special weapon, which means that you are required to use each craft on certain missions.  After you complete each mission, you may be awarded a bronze, silver, or gold medal based on your performance.  After completing a mission, you can move on to the next one, or else go back and try again to get a better score.  The game gives you a score summary after each mission, so you know right away which areaas you need to improve upon to get the gold.The look and feel of the game is excellent.  The graphics are superb, and the Expansion Pak boosts them to cinematic levels.  The sound is also excellent for a non-CD game, although the chatter from your squadron mates does get a little repetitive.  The game is contained within a 3D environment, giving the game a flight simulator-like feel.  The controls are pretty easy to get used to, though this DOES take a little practice.  Fortunately, the first couple of missions are pretty easy, so you get a good chance to get familiar with the controls.  The controls are the same for each ship, so you don't have to switch back and forth.As stated before, the first couple of missions are pretty simple and easy.  But, starting with about the fourth mission, they start to get REALLY tough, with multitudes of TIE fighters, missile turrets, and gun emplacements all doing their best to shoot you down.  Expect to die many times before mastering each mission.  Getting the gold medal on all 16 missions will definitely take a while.The game has a lot of nice bonus features as well.  As you complete missions and earn higher medals, three bonus missions will appear, plus you will gain access to new ships, including the Millenium Falcon and a captured Imperial TIE Interceptor.  There is also a passcode screen, allowing you to enter codes to unlock all sorts of interesting options, including a fourth bonus level and the Naboo Starfighter.  There is even a code to allow you to fly a Buick sedan against the Empire!  The codes themselves are pretty easy to get.  There are several sites on the Internet that have them.It's easy to get immersed in the 3D environment of this game.  Many's the time I've found myself leaning over to the left or right as I put my X-Wing through a tight turn.  For those who like flight simulator-type games, I would say that this is the best FS game on the N64.  It's a bit dated now, what with the impending release of Rogue Squadron II for the GameCube, but for those N64 fans out there, this one is a must-have.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2001"}

Good organization of the layout in general.Some Flaws:- Races ships and technology trees are too similar to each other.- Some utility frigates are virtually useless- Would have liked an 'engineer' frigate that can capture enemy structures- The AI tends to retreat too quickly, your AI allies don't coordinate their attacks with you.- The pirate attacks are too frequent (you can turn this off with patch)- Single player game play could use more variety or a campaignIf you do buy the game be sure to get the patch from stardock's website. This fixes some balance issues and gives you more choices when setting up single player maps.

Since I bought my xbox earlier this year, I have been playing Battlefield BC 2, which is an incredible game. Black Ops stands up to it in some respects, which I would like to address in this review. First of all, the campaign for Black Ops is just aweome. It's hard to get into specifics without giving anything away, but I would say that the single player for BO tops that of BF BC2 for sure. Great game. Add in the extras that Black Ops offers - Zombie Mode, several Arcade games, etc.. and I certainly think it is worth the $. Now on to Multiplayer.. Black Ops' Multiplayer is a lot of fun, no doubt, but it pales in comparison to that of Battlefield BC2. It's almost like the Black Ops' multiplayer is dumbed-down to some degree. It kind of reminds me of the old Shooters for PC back in the day but with fewer players (i.e. Soldier of Fortune). In the end, the Bad Company 2 Multiplayer is so much more evolved in just about every way. If you are fan of War FPS games, you should absolutely have both of these games in your collection, but just know that the Multiplayer, while really fun, just isn't totally up to par (and if you have both games, you'll be going back to BF BC2 in the long run for your multiplayer fix :)EDIT - I traded this game after having it for a month. After beating the campaign and playing Zombies a few times, I didn't see myself playing it at all in the future. Black Ops is the first game I have ever traded (maybe the only one?), so that says something. I guess this would be a good game to pick up used or as a rental. Black Ops is not enough to keep you coming back over and over. It wasn't for me, anyway.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2011"}

While they haven't been consistantly good, Call of Duty 4 is still one of my favorite all time video games. Now comes the seventh entry in the series (after World at War and Modern Warfare 2). Call of Duty: Black Ops is a very exciting game that excells in story-telling but is weighed down by familiar gameplay mechanics.While the plot's of the Call of Duty games have never been all that impressive, filled with forgetable heroes and villians Black Ops has very well-written characters that bring a very personal feeling to the game's story. No it's not movie worthy (and I'm sure everyone guessed the final twists at the end) but the fact that I actually found myself engrossed in the events of the overall story and the fully voiced player-characters puts this one a notch above the previous Call of Duty games. The voice acting is also terrific with Sam Worthington, Ice Cube, Gary Oldman, and Ed Harris giving real weight to their characters. The music is also very exciting with some great period tracks setting the overall tone of the game.While the story-telling is rock-solid, the actual level designs and basic gameplay of Call of Duty: Black Ops are typical and not very engaging with the exception of a cool prison break level and  one where you're swimming around in Vietnam. Don't get me wrong, no other FPS has quite captured the excitement of the Prypiat, Ukraine missions of Call of Duty 4, but considering this game's called 'Black Ops' you sure do cause a LOT of explosions and get into a lot of gunfights. The basic gameplay is also exactly the same as it was in Call of Duty 4 and even with the 1960's time period the game feels a bit worn-out. Black Ops DOES manage to incorporate some vehicle mechanics into it's gameplay, but even these feel more like arcade shooting moments than actual engrossing experiences (that and they're WAAAAY too brief). The zombie mode is back from World at War and the White House mission is a lot of fun in a tongue-in-cheek manner, but is otherwise identical.When all's said and done Call of Duty Black Ops is more like the ODST to Modern Warfare's Halo 3 (better story, same old gameplay with lots of multiplayer options). It's not an evolution of FPS nor is it really a change to the Call of Duty series in general. Call of Duty Black Ops is a very good game and worth at least a rental (unless you're a multiplayer fan), but lets just hope the next COD takes things in a more unique direction.(a note: I know there's a lot more to Call of Duty Black Ops than the single player campaign and I'm sure you'll have no problem finding a review on here for the multiplayer options. Unfortunatly I'm not a multiplayer gamer so this review is ONLY my opinion of the single player game.)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2010"}
